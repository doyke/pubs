                                            Chapter 1

                                            OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. This Instruction addresses design and management of USAFE construction
projects in the FRG according to procedures established in the ABG-75 administrative
agreement. Specifically it sets USAFE policy, responsibilities and procedures regarding project
planning, development, design, execution and project close-out of USAFE construction in the
FRG. As issues emerge and various agreements, instructions, rules and regulations regarding
construction in Germany change, Base Civil Engineers (BCE) shall consult with HQ
USAFE/A7P and HQ USAFE/A7K on a regular basis.
1.2. Applicability. The procedures and responsibilities described in this instruction apply to all
USAFE elements with planning, programming, design, construction and project closeout
responsibility within the FRG. They also apply to other associated U.S. Forces elements tenant
on USAFE installations in Germany to the extent their missions may affect in any manner the
construction responsibilities of USAFE or an element of USAFE. Due to the Air Force
MILCON Execution Transformation in late 2007, relationships and responsibilities have
changed between HQ USAFE, HQ Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment
(AFCEE) and BCEs. Reference Table 1.1 and paragraph 3.4 of this instruction for further
details regarding these changes. The design, construction and project closeout procedures
described in this instruction are written to apply specifically to BCEs for construction projects
under their direct control as defined in paragraph 3.4.4.1 of this instruction. AFCEE will
publish guidance to their personnel to fulfill their Design Manager/Construction Manager
(DM/CM) role as USAFE‘s execution agent for the Military Construction (MILCON) program
as described in the Program Management Plan for the Management of the Air Force Capital
Construction Program, dated 15 November 2007.

     STATUTORY AUTHORITIES FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION IN THE FRG

2.1. NATO Status of Forces Agreement. The ABG-75 is a bilateral administrative agreement
between the United States Forces and the FRG applicable to all U.S. Forces construction in
Germany. It is based on and implements Article 49 NATO SA, which establishes general
authorities and conditions for executing construction in the FRG by Sending State Forces (SSF)
and defines procedures for coordination of SSF construction programs, awarding construction
projects, compensation fees and reimbursements to FRG and acceptance and turnover of
completed works. ABG-75 was signed on behalf of the United States by the Deputy
Commanding General, United States Army Europe (USAREUR), on 29 Sep 82 and became
effective on 1 Oct 82 for all projects started after that date. It was amended effective 3 November
2003. Protocol of Signature (PoS) to ABG-75, an exchange of covering letters, and ABG-75
Implementing Instructions (II), further define and delineate German and U.S. rights,
responsibilities and procedures under this agreement.

                           ABG-75 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. ABG-75 Description.
   3.1.1. Structure of the ABG-75. ABG-75 consists of several interdependent documents, all
   having a bearing on conduct of the U.S. Forces construction works. Air Force Civil
   Engineers shall become familiar with their contents and consult with HQ USAFE/A7P to
   ensure they possess the latest versions.
      3.1.1.1. ABG-75. The main document that governs how construction works are
      accomplished in Germany for and by the U.S. Forces and forms the basis for procuring
      engineering and construction services in Germany. Article 1.1 of ABG-75 states,
      ―Construction projects (projet de construction/Bauvorhaben) are items of proposed
      construction works.‖          Article 1.2 of ABG-75 states, ―Construction works
      (travaux/Baumaβnahmen) are new construction, alterations and extensions, external
      works, the necessary development measures, and repair and maintenance.‖ Article 1.1 of
      the revised Implementing Instructions to ABG-75 dated 11 May 2009 states, ―ABG 1975
      settles the performance of the construction projects of the U.S. Forces defined in Article 1
      which are financed with U.S. national funds. In individual cases, at the option of the U.S.
      Forces, remediation of contaminated areas, soil and groundwater and removal of
      unexploded ordnance may be carried out using the ABG-75 procedures, if required to
      complete a construction project.‖ ABG-75 may not be used to execute studies, services,
      etc. that are not tied to a specific construction project. These include but are not limited
      to sampling, analysis and monitoring of potable water, stormwater, wastewater, air
      emissions, hazardous waste facility operations, general energy studies, surveys and
      soil/groundwater cleanup not tied to a specific construction project.
          3.1.1.1.1. Table of Contents. ABG-75 is written with four distinct parts:
          3.1.1.1.1.1. Part I contains general definitions, authorities and program coordination
          requirements. (Articles 1-3).
             3.1.1.1.1.2. Part II describes execution of construction works by the German
             authorities, herein referred to as the Indirect procedure. (Articles 4-26).
             3.1.1.1.1.3. Part III describes execution of construction works by the U.S. Forces
             with their own employed personnel or direct contracted construction, herein
             referred to as the Direct procedure. (Articles 27-38).
             3.1.1.1.1.4. Part IV contains transitional concluding provisions, e.g., regarding
             establishing implementing instructions and amendments, resolving disputes and
             stating both the German and English language text of the agreement being equally
             effective. (Articles 39 - 41).
      3.1.1.2. Protocol of Signature to ABG-75. Provides comments which expand or clarify
      the articles set forth in the basic agreement and its supplements.
 10                                                          USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


       3.1.1.3. ABG-75 Implementing Instructions. The bilateral agreement which further
       defines and delineates German and U.S. rights, responsibilities and procedures under
       ABG-75.
3.2. German Construction Authority (GCA) Definitions. This is a general term used to refer
to the various entities at the state level in the German government responsible for U.S. Forces
construction on behalf of the FRG. The U.S. Forces interact with two main GCA in the State of
Rheinland-Pfalz.
   3.2.1. Bauamt (Building Authority). This is term for the German state level authority
   responsible for actual construction execution, i.e., the German government‘s Design
   Agent/Construction Agent (DA/CA). For USAFE installations and GSUs in the State of
   Rheinland-Pfalz, this refers specifically to the Landesbetrieb Liegenschafts- und
   Baubetreuung (LBB), in English, the State Real Estate and Building Support Agency. As
   both main USAFE installations are located within the state of Rheinland-Pflaz, Bauamt will
   be used to refer to the LBB.
   3.2.2. Fachaufsicht führende Ebene (FfE) / Agency Responsible for Technical
   Oversight. This is the term for the state level authority responsible for the technical and
   functional oversight of the construction execution. For USAFE installations and GSUs in the
   State of Rheinland-Pfalz, this refers specifically to the Oberfinanzdirektion/Geschäftsbereich
   Bundesbau (OFD/GBB), in English the Regional Finance Office‘s Federal Construction
   Division. As both main USAFE installations are located within Rheinland-Pflaz, the FfE
   will be used to refer to the GBB. Their roles and responsibilities are described throughout
   this instruction.
   3.2.3. German Federal Ministries. At the Federal level, the two main German Federal
   Ministries are the Ministry of Transportation, Construction, and Urban Development
   (FMOC) who is the highest ABG-75 administrative authority and the Ministry of Defense
   (FMOD) who is the highest technical authority for U.S. projects in Germany. Their roles and
   responsibilities are described throughout this instruction.
3.3. Limitations on U.S. Authority. Indirect ABG-75 contracting officers have complete
contractual authority when executing construction under ABG-75‘s Direct procedure described
in Chapter 4 of this instruction. U.S. Forces construction offices and contracting have distinct,
but very limited, authorities in management of projects executed using the Indirect procedure
described in Chapters 5-8 of this instruction. Indirect ABG-75 contracting officers may not, for
instance, instruct or otherwise order or demand actions from Architect-Engineer (A-E) or
contractor personnel employed by the Bauamt on U.S. Forces projects. Any Indirect AGB-75
contracting officer coordination with firms or personnel under contract to the Bauamt must be
conducted through the Bauamt.
3.4. Responsibilities. Actions initiating design and/or construction under ABG-75, including
technical changes and fund expedition, can only be performed by ABG-75 Indirect and Direct
contracting officers. Their responsibilities are described throughout Chapters 5-8.

3.5. Procedures for Annual Program Coordination. Article 3 of ABG-75 requires the U.S.
Air Force to coordinate construction projects with the German government. This is
accomplished annually by the U.S. Air Force through the submittal of an ABG Form 1-Program
of Construction Projects for the U.S. Forces. This allows the Bauamt to structure their
organization‘s work load to sufficiently support USAFE construction programs.
   3.5.1. Process. HQ USAFE/A7P will send installations an annual call with specific
   instructions for their expected construction program projected for the next two fiscal years.
   The BCE shall ensure they list each new construction project costing more than €150,000
   and the method of execution, either Direct or Indirect. Regardless of cost, the BCE shall
   ensure they list each project intended for execution using the Indirect procedure. HQ
   USAFE/A7P shall review the projects, compile a list and submit the completed ABG Form 1
   to the FMOC and the FMOD no later than 1 February of each year.
   3.5.2. Distribution. The ABG Form 1 lists the required distribution.
   3.5.3. Project Requirements. The BCE initiates actions to program and obtain proper
   project approvals from the Bauamt. The BCE must receive signature approval on appropriate
   documents (DD Form 1391, AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, etc.), input
   project into the Automated Civil Engineer System-Project Manager module (ACES-PM) and
   obtain sufficient funds or funds assurance before initiating ABG-75 actions. These
   conditions apply for both Direct and Indirect procedure projects.
   3.5.4. GCA Biannual Walkthroughs. The FfE is required to conduct and document formal
   installation walkthroughs biannually. The BCEs shall notify HQ USAFE/A7P when a formal
   walkthrough is requested by the FfE. In particular, the following items will be discussed:
       3.5.4.1. Implementation of the construction program according to the latest ABG Form
       1.
       3.5.4.2. Clarification as to whether additional projects have been projected, planned or
       initiated, or whether a previously projected project has been cancelled. A written note
       will be included stating whether the required ABG Form 2 or 3 document has been
       submitted and that the provisions of German law are being adhered to.
3.6. Selecting Direct/Indirect Procedure. ABG-75 provides for two major methods or
procedures to carry out U.S. Forces construction works. These methods are termed ―Direct‖
(Reference Chapter 4) and ―Indirect‘ (Reference Chapters 5-8). The BCE decides if the project
should be accomplished by the Direct or by the Indirect procedure.
   3.6.1. Direct Procedure. Under the Direct procedure, in consultation with the German
   authorities, the U.S. Forces carry out design, bid tender and award, construction supervision
   and inspection with its own forces or through the direct award of contracts by an Air Force or
   Army Contracting Agency, reference ABG-75, Article 1.6. The project may be also
   accomplished by troop labor (RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, Construction and Training
   Squadron, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, etc.). Reference Chapter 4 of this instruction
   listing the exceptions and procedures required to execute a project through the Direct
   procedure. Attachment 4 lists ―Pros and Cons‖ to aid the BCE in deciding which procedure
   to select for specific projects.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                  15


   3.6.2. Indirect Procedure. Under the provisions of the NATO SOFA SA and ABG-75,
   major new construction, alterations and extensions or construction intended to change the
   function of a facility exceeding €375,000 are executed by the GCA under German laws and
   federal administrative regulations in their name and under their responsibility, unless an
   exception is granted (Reference paragraph 4.1). At each step in planning, design, change or
   actions that increase cost above agreed amount, method of tendering, contract award and
   acceptance are subject to prior U.S. consent. USAFE engineers shall work closely with the
   GCA to ensure U.S. interests are met and protected, with respect to cost, schedule and
   quality.
3.7. Design and Construction Distinction. The ABG-75 classification of Direct and Indirect
procedure refers only to construction execution. The agreement does not prevent the U.S. Forces
from preparing project designs with their own labor or by directly awarding an A-E contract for
any project with actual construction execution carried out by the Bauamt under the Indirect
procedure. This method of mixed project execution, referred to as ―Direct/Indirect‖ representing
―Direct design/Indirect construction‖ is rare and must be approved by the USAFE Civil Engineer
before design initiation. The current USAFE policy is to use the Indirect procedure for both the
design and construction of a project. Although this ―Direct/Indirect‖ method provides greater
control, the U.S. government must pay the German government compensation fees (to include
design cost) as if it were executed under the Indirect procedure.
3.8. Public Coordination, Permits, Licenses and Permissions. The GCA is solely responsible
for all coordination and permissions required under German public law for U.S. Forces‘ Direct or
Indirect procedure construction projects, from design through construction at no extra cost
(Reference Article 53A, NATO SOFA SA and Articles 3.3.6 and 30.2 of ABG-75‘s
Implementing Instructions).
   3.8.1. Indirect Procedure. For the Indirect procedure, the GCA, through the Bauamt, has
   the responsibility to obtain any necessary construction permits, licenses or other forms of
   official approval that may be required under German public law to include any related
   operational permits (water rights approval, etc.) and make the necessary notifications to the
   appropriate Host Nation agencies on behalf of USAFE at no extra cost.
   3.8.2. Direct Procedure. For the Direct Procedure, the GCA, through the Bauamt, is also
   responsible for obtaining any necessary construction permits, licenses or other forms of
   official approval that may be required under German public law to include any related
   operational permits (water rights approval, etc.) and make the necessary notifications to the
   appropriate Host Nation agencies on behalf of USAFE at no extra cost. GCA concurrence
   with an ABG Form 2 does not relieve the BCE of responsibility to initiate permitting,
   coordination and notification procedures and ensure that conditions of any GCA concurrence
   are met. The BCE shall initiate coordination regarding permitting, coordination and
   notification procedures with the Bauamt in the early planning phase to determine the
   necessity for a construction permit, license or other form of official permission. The BCE
   ensures Direct procedure projects requiring an ABG Form 2 are coordinated in accordance
   with ABG-75 Article 30. As required by Article 30.3, the BCE shall establish a binding
   coordination and review schedule with the Bauamt before release of plans and specifications
   for review.
16                                                      USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


     3.8.2.1. Demolition. The BCE shall ensure ABG Form 2s are prepared and submitted to
     HQ USAFE/A7PC requesting Bauamt assistance in obtaining permissions and making
     notifications on behalf of the Air Force according to Article 30.1 of ABG-75 prior to
     demolishing any facility.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    17


                                           Chapter 4

     DIRECT PROCEDURE, OVERVIEW, PROJECT INITIATION, DESIGN AND
                          CONSTRUCTION

4.1. General. The U.S. Forces are authorized to accomplish the following types of projects
using their own resources and contracts through the Direct procedure IAW Article 27 of ABG-
75:
   4.1.1. Repair and Maintenance projects, regardless of value, provided the external
   configuration of the facility does not change or the purpose of an entire facility does not
   change (e.g. conversion). Note that the English version of ABG-75 allows renovation
   provided there is no change to configuration (exterior dimensions) or function. In practical
   terms, USAFE policy is to treat ―change in configuration‖ as a change in building footprint.
   USAFE policy is to also treat ―changes in use‖ when the ―purpose of a facility‖ is changed to
   satisfy new needs. The BCE shall consult with HQ USAFE/A7P regarding classifying
   renovations as repair and maintenance because a portion of the project may be considered
   new construction.
   4.1.2. Very minor construction projects not exceeding €150,000.
   4.1.3. Construction projects carried out by military construction units for training purposes
   under supervision of the Forces (troop labor).
   4.1.3. Construction, alteration and extension projects (construction projects) that, regardless
   of value, require special security measures, or involve the integration or installation of
   equipment such as special communication or weapon systems of the Forces.
   4.1.4. Urgent Unspecified Minor Military Construction projects up to $1,500,000.
   ($3,000,000 for Life/Health/Safety).
   4.1.5. Minor construction projects greater than €150,000 but less than €375,000, if agreed to
   by the FfE on an ABG Form 2 request document.
   4.1.6. Major new construction projects exceeding €375,000 if an exception is granted by the
   appropriate German Federal Ministry (FMOC or FMOD) on an ABG Form 2 request
   document.
4.2. Submittal of ABG Form 2 Packages. ABG Form 2s are used in two ways: first, for
requesting Bauamt assistance in coordinating and procuring permissions required under German
public law for projects that fall under 4.1.1 and 4.1.2; second, for requesting GCA concurrence
with U.S. proposals for the use of the Direct procedure for projects under 4.1.3 – 4.1.6. The BCE
is responsible for coordinating ABG Form 2 packages through HQ USAFE/A7P, who will sign
and forward the final ABG Form 2 package to the FfE. German authorities shall advise if there
are objections to the scheduled execution of the projects. Construction projects approved for the
Direct procedure must be coordinated with the Bauamt (reference Sec 3.8.2 of this instruction).
Initiating local coordination procedures with the Bauamt is the BCE‘s responsibility. Should the
Current Working Estimate (CWE) exceed the notified/approved ABG Form 2 during the design
process, the BCE shall notify HQ USAFE/A7PC.

The following submittal requirements apply to new construction, alterations and extension
projects:
   4.2.1. For new construction, alteration and extensions up to and including €375,000, the
   BCE submits the ABG Form 2 and attachments described below in paragraph 4.3,
   electronically to HQ USAFE/A7P (usafe.abg75@ramstein.af.mil) for review, signature and
   submittal to the FfE.
   4.2.2. For major new construction, alterations and extension projects greater than €375,000,
   the BCE submits the ABG Form 2 and attachments described below in paragraph 4.3,
   electronically to HQ USAFE/A7P (usafe.abg75@ramstein.af.mil) for review, signature and
   submittal to the appropriate FRG ministry as described below:
      4.2.2.1. For mission related projects (e.g. operational, training, security, vehicle or
      equipment maintenance, supply, medical, aircraft hangars, etc.), HQ USAFE/A7P
      submits an ABG Form 2 to the FMOD, after prior consultation with the FfE, for formal
      acceptance.
      4.2.2.2. For projects related to civil or recreational use (e.g., general purpose admin,
      utilities and grounds, Services, family housing), HQ USAFE/A7P submits an ABG Form
      2 to the FMOC, after prior consultation with the FfE, for formal acceptance.
      4.2.2.3. Within 30 calendar days of receiving the ABG Form 2 request, the appropriate
      FRG ministry reviews and concurs/nonconcurs with the Direct procedure and forwards
      their written reply to the HQ USAFE/A7P. Copies of the countersigned ABG Form 2 are
      distributed by HQ USAFE/A7PC to the FfE. HQ USAFE/A7P forwards the final ABG
      Form 2 package to the BCE. The BCE shall ensure information requests and conditions
      for approvals are met. If concurrence is received, the GCA will indicate whether the
      detailed coordination procedure would apply. Procedures for the detailed coordination
      procedure are described in ABG-75, Articles 29-38.
4.3. ABG Form 2 Package Requirements. ABG Form 2 packages submitted by the BCE to
HQ USAFE/A7P for projects to be accomplished under the Direct procedure must contain the
following items as a minimum:
   4.3.1. Project Approval Forms. Approved DD Form 1391 or AF Form 332.
   4.3.2. Description of Work in German and English. This should be as detailed as the
   Statement of Work (SOW) normally submitted with ABG Form 3 for Indirect projects,
   addressing the type, classification and method of construction contemplated. The purpose is
   to provide the various GCA, namely the FfE, with an accurate summary of the proposed
   work. For major renovations, it is important to break out costs for the portion of work that
   may be considered new construction.
   4.3.3. Cost Estimate. Cost estimates must be provided in both German and English with the
   German portion in Euros and must be as detailed as the description of work. Construction
   costs shown on the ABG Form 2 should include services (e.g., troop labor) and supplies to be
   provided by the U.S. Forces.
   4.3.4. Site Plans. Include a current and approved general site plan at a scale of 1 inch:1,000
   feet (2.54 centimeters:305 meters) to 1 inch:2,000 feet (2.54 centimeters:610 meters) and a
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    19


   detailed site plan at a scale of 1 inch:200 feet (2.54 centimeters:61 meters) to 1inch:500 feet
   (2.54 meters:152 meters).
   4.3.5. Environmental Impact/Compatibility Statement. Include a statement that safety,
   tree cutting, disposal of existing facilities and overall environmental impacts have been
   considered in accordance with the German Gesetz über die Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung
   (UVPG), which translates to ―Law on Environmental Impact Assessment‖ and is similar to
   the USAF‘s Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).
   4.3.6. Request the Bauamt to submit the necessary applications and undertake the relevant
   administrative and legal procedures on behalf of the U.S. as stipulated in Article 53A of the
   NATO SOFA SA.
4.4. Initiating Design and Construction/Public Coordination. During the design and
construction phases there are major steps where the Bauamt interacts in order to accomplish
public coordination with special German authorities concerned. This only applies in cases where
specifically asked for by the GCA when concurring with a US proposal on an ABG Form 2.
   4.4.1. Preparation of KVM-Bau Documents. The BCE prepares documents equivalent to
   the ―Kostenvoranmeldung – Bau‖ (KVM-Bau) consisting of the items below to be submitted
   to the Bauamt. The KVM-Bau is essentially equivalent to the more familiar CCD normally
   considered a 15% or pre-concept design. The Charrette or program development is prepared
   as a subpart of this phase resulting in preliminary floor plans, elevations and functional
   description for each room. On the basis of these documents, the Bauamt initiates public
   coordination by consulting with the specialized German authorities concerned and ascertains
   whether there are any fundamental objections to the project regarding public interests. The
   Bauamt informs the BCE accordingly and indicates any conditions which should be met in
   the design. The BCE ensures review comments from the Bauamt are provided to the User
   for consideration. When it becomes necessary to remove trees in the construction area the
   BCE provides a written request to the Bauamt. The Bauamt will arrange for tree cutting
   approval and execution as required to support construction projects on and off base. Article
   30.2, ABG-75 requires the KVM-Bau package to the Bauamt include the following:
       4.4.1.1. An informal explanatory report (providing roughly the equivalent of a
       Requirements Document).
       4.4.1.2. A rough order of magnitude cost estimate.
       4.4.1.3. A general location plan.
       4.4.1.4. A building expert‘s technical report as to site suitability.
   4.4.2. Progress to HU-Bau. After receiving comments on the KVM-Bau from the Bauamt,
   the BCE is authorized to proceed with the preparation of the Haushaltsunterlage-Bau (HU-
   Bau). This is the equivalent to an approximately 35% design. During the preparation of the
   HU-Bau, the BCE may invite the Bauamt to attend design meetings. This may be required to
   clarify KVM-Bau comments received from the Bauamt. The BCE shall submit the HU-Bau
   package to the Bauamt for review and additional coordination with competent German
   authorities to determine whether conditions established in the KVM-Bau are complied with
   and whether any other conditions should be observed. The HU-Bau submittal to the Bauamt
   includes six (6) packages of the following documents:
 20                                                          USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


       4.4.2.1. The design drawings/plans.
       4.4.2.2. A detailed explanatory report.
       4.4.2.3. The current cost estimate.
       4.4.2.4. The time schedule.
       4.4.2.5. The building expert‘s technical report (engineering design data: e.g., soil test,
       structural analysis, etc.)
   4.4.3. Bauamt Construction Observation. During the execution of the construction
   project, the responsible Bauamt may examine the construction site to ensure the project is
   proceeding according to the plans and applicable German regulations, and to ensure the
   conditions imposed by German authorities are being observed. For this reason the Bauamt
   will have access to the construction site subject to security considerations. The Bauamt
   notifies the BCE in writing of any issues no later than five (5) working days after the
   inspection.
       4.4.3.1. The Bauamt is not authorized to direct or in any other way control the work of
       A-Es or construction contractors under contract to the U.S. Any Bauamt comments
       regarding the design or execution of projects must be provided to the responsible U.S.
       contracting officer‘s representative or the BCE.
       4.4.3.2. The Bauamt shall provide any work outside an installation necessary to support
       any Direct construction project.
4.5. Applicable Technical Criteria. The BCE shall ensure applicable technical regulations of
the German government are respected in preparation of the structural analysis, reinforcement
plans (i.e., Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) which is the German Institute for
Standardization 1045 and 1052, etc.), and thermal (DIN 4108) and soundproofing insulation
(DIN 4109) documents. The BCE shall provide certification of structural analysis to the German
authorities for all designs, to include in-house, troop labor, or A-E and is according to ABG-75,
Part III, Articles 30, 31 and 32. Regarding fire protection and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection
(AT/FP), the BCE shall refer and comply with the requirements of the latest Unified Facilities
Criteria (UFC) document for Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities, UFC 3-600-01 and DoD
Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings found at www.wbdg.org. For projects
requiring an ABG Form 2, information and proof that U.S. standards are more stringent than
those stipulated in German law will be provided by the BCE during the Pre-concept phase
(KVM-Bau), but no later than the Concept phase (HU-Bau). Changes to criteria will be provided
by the BCE at subsequent coordination phases. For projects not requiring an ABG Form 2,
German criteria will be employed to the extent practical in light of requirements to observe
German public safety and order. (Reference Articles 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of ABG-75‘s Implementing
Instructions).
4.6. Payment for Variations in Estimated Quantities. Overruns on Direct Procedure
contracts are those quantity variations between 100 and 115 percent of the original estimated
item quantities, and underruns are quantity variations between 85 and 100 percent of the original
estimated quantities. Overruns on a Direct unit priced project can be approved for payment
when all of the following conditions are met:
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                     21


   4.6.1. The work is performed and the overrun is not the result of an unfinalized modification
   to the contract,
   4.6.2. There is a specified unit price item for the work involved, and
   4.6.3. Current authorization and funds are not exceeded. When current authorization and
   funds would be exceeded by the overrun, additional funds necessary to cover the balance
   shall be obligated by the BCE prior to the performance of the corresponding work. Based on
   unit price spread sheet data presented with each invoice, the USAF Project Manager (PM)
   determines if invoiced overruns are offset by underruns in contract items. If quantity
   overruns are offset, additional funding requirements are unnecessary, and the overrun and
   underrun quantities can be combined in one modification. If overruns are not offset, the PM
   shall obtain additional funds for the overruns by preparing and submitting a change request to
   the appropriate contracting officer. It is not necessary to deobligate funds due to underruns
   prior to fiscal contract completion. The PM may not make payment for any overrun resulting
   in a statutory or regulatory violation, or any project limitation stated in the contract. The PM
   shall exercise proper caution to ensure such overruns do not occur.
4.7. Final Inspection/Turn Over. A joint final inspection shall be conducted upon completion
of Direct procedure construction projects. Article 37 of ABG-75 requires joint final inspection of
Direct projects by U.S. and Bauamt representatives. The BCE is designated as the primary U.S.
representative. Other representatives shall include the User, the contractor, and other BCE staff.
At the time of final inspection, an inspection report documented on an ABG Form 7B, Record of
Joint Final Inspection of Construction Work Executed by US-Forces using the Direct Procedure
will be completed jointly by the GCA and the BCE, recording the results of the inspection. The
BCE shall countersign the ABG Form 7B and provide copies to all participants. The Bauamt has
the right to notify the U.S. within five (5) working days of the final inspection of any defects
found during the inspection which it feels are contrary to public safety and order.
4.8. Fees for Direct Procedure Projects. No fees are assessed for Bauamt services under the
Direct procedure, even though most Direct projects require design and construction review by
the Bauamt. However, if services of other German authorities or agencies are required and
agreed to by the BCE, fees will be paid by the BCE if the service is not of the type provided free
by the German authorities as discussed in Article 38 of ABG-75. The process for payment of
fees follows the same process as defined under the Indirect procedure in Chapters 5-8 of this
instruction.

                                           Chapter 5

                          INDIRECT PROCEDURE, OVERVIEW

5.1. General. The Indirect procedure allows for the planning, execution, supervision and
administration of construction by the German authorities on behalf of the U.S. Forces.
Paragraph 2 of Article 49 of the NATO SOFA SA, in connection with ABG-75, requires that
major U.S. Forces construction projects in the FRG shall be carried out by the German
authorities responsible for Federal building in accordance with German legal provisions and
administrative regulations in force (Indirect procedure, ABG-75 Articles 4-26). The German
government, through the local GCA, awards and administers construction contracts subject to
certain rights and conditions of the U.S. Government as prescribed by Paragraph 6 of Article 49,
NATO SOFA SA and ABG-75. The Indirect procedure is required primarily for major new
construction, extensions and alterations exceeding €375,000 or construction intended to change
the function of a facility. Exceptions to this rule are found in Article 27, ABG-75. The work is
executed under German laws and administrative regulations and in the German authorities‘ own
name and on their own responsibility. Exceptions may be granted by the appropriate Federal
Ministry (FMOC or FMOD) on a case by case basis in accordance with provisions in Article 27
of ABG-75. Each step in planning/design, tendering and acceptance, contract award, and change
management, is subject to prior U.S. approval.
   5.1.1. Delegation of Authority to Sign ABG Documents
       5.1.1.1. In accordance with Protocol of Signature (PoS) to ABG-75, General Item 3, that
       states ―The U.S. Forces will act in contractual matters through U.S. Contracting Officers
       or other officials designated in writing as the authorized representatives of the U.S.
       Forces for such purposes‖, HQ USAFE/A7P shall ensure timely and current notification
       of individuals in writing authorized to sign ABG documents on behalf of USAFE.
       5.1.1.2. Warrants.
           5.1.1.2.1. Standard Warrant. Limitations contained in the Department of Defense
           Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Supplement and the Air Force FAR
           Supplement. Limited to contractual actions not in excess of $56,000,000.
           5.1.1.2.2. ABG-75 Warrant. This warrant reflects the proper delegation to U.S.
           employees of signature authority for the U.S. Government limited to ABG-75 actions
           not in excess of $100,000, including foreign currency fluctuation, for the purpose of
           validating funding availability and obligating the United States Government in
           accordance with the provisions of ABG-75. This type of warrant is issued to both
           MAJCOM and base level appropriate personnel, mainly engineers, involved in
           construction under the Indirect procedure. This warrant was specifically designed to
           provide MAJCOM and base level personnel limited authority, up to and including
           foreign currency fluctuation, not to exceed $100,000 per ABG-75 action (Reference
           paragraph 3.4.4.12), to execute an Indirect project.
           5.1.1.2.3. Prior to delegation, the followings conditions apply:
              5.1.1.2.3.1. HQ USAFE/A7P and HQ USAFE/A7K shall jointly ensure
              individuals are trained on specific provisions, procedures and requirements of
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                  23


            ABG-75.
            5.1.1.2.3.2. HQ USAFE/A7P shall ensure the designated personnel signing ABG
            Forms which includes ABG Forms 3, 4, 5, 5A and 6 up to the $100,000 limit are
            also appointed as Indirect ABG-75 contracting officers.
        5.1.1.2.4. For reviews and signatures of ABG Form 8s-Construction Costs and
        Partial ABG Form 9s-Administrative Fees, warrants are not needed.                 HQ
        USAFE/A7P and HQ USAFE/A7K shall jointly ensure individuals are trained and
        appointed in writing, on a DD Form 577 and by formal letter,
        Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature, as Departmental
        Accountable Officials or Certifying Officers depending on their role in the financial
        certification process. Accountable officials are responsible for the review of ABG 8s
        and 9s only. Based on the review, the certifying officers ensure funds are in place
        prior to signing ABG forms as described in paragraph 5.1.2.
     5.1.1.3. HQ USAFE/A7P shall provide the FfE a list of individuals having authority to
     sign ABG documents at least annually.
  5.1.2. Signature Authority on ABG Documents.
     5.1.2.1. Certifying Project Initiation and Design Documents. Only Indirect ABG-75
     contracting officers trained in, warranted and appointed in writing by HQ USAFE/A7K
     to specifically work ABG-75 related construction under the Indirect procedure are
     authorized to sign an ABG Form 3-Request/Approval/Award Document. This applies to
     subsequent requests and approvals in ABG Form 3, Part 1, Item 3. The documents are
     forwarded to the appropriate GCA, depending on cost, for acceptance via a counter
     signature for projects including new construction, alterations, and/or additions as defined
     in Article 1, Paragraphs 1.4, 1.4.1, and 1.4.2 of ABG-75.
     5.1.2.2. Certifying Project Construction Execution Documents. Only Indirect ABG-
     75 contracting officers trained in, warranted and appointed in writing by HQ
     USAFE/A7K to specifically work ABG-75 related construction under the Indirect
     procedure are authorized to sign ABG Form 4,-Tender Acceptance Form and any
     requests for contract modifications which includes all ABG Form 5s-Change Order
     Document submitted to the U.S. by the Bauamt, ABG Form 5As-U.S. Forces Change
     Request, prepared and submitted by the U.S. to the Bauamt and ABG Form 6s-Order
     Document for Term Construction. ABG Form 6s are rarely used for U.S. Force Indirect
     projects. For project financial documents, CE personnel trained and appointed in writing
     by their commanders to represent their organizations as Departmental Accountable
     Officials via DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature,
     are authorized to sign ABG Form 8s-Construction Costs and Partial (not final) ABG
     Form 9s-Administrative Fees. Processing is ―time critical‖ to ensure contractors are paid
     for work verified by the Bauamt and the U.S.
     5.1.2.3. Certifying Project Acceptance Documents. Only Indirect ABG-75 contracting
     officers trained in, warranted and appointed in writing by HQ USAFE/A7K to
     specifically work ABG-75 related construction under the Indirect procedure are
     authorized to sign the Final ABG Form 9-Administration Fees, which is considered the
     formal project closeout document with the Bauamt.
 24                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


       5.1.2.4. The BCE shall ensure at a minimum the following information is provided to the
       Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer:
           5.1.2.4.1. A statement providing justification summarizing the need to obligate U.S.
           funds.
           5.1.2.4.2. The original ABG-75 form requiring the contracting officers signature and
           its attachments.
           5.1.2.4.3. Other information and attachments that will enhance the contracting
           officers understanding.
5.2. U.S. versus German Standards under Indirect Procedures. Article 4 of the ABG-75
Administrative Agreement prescribes that U.S. Forces‘ projects be executed by the German
authorities in their own name and on their own responsibility in accordance with German laws
and administrative regulations in force for federal construction. Articles 4.2 and 4.3 of ABG 75
provide for certain exceptions. Article 4.2 of ABG-75 states, ―If any regulation of the Forces
regarding public safety and order lays down higher standards than the German regulations, the
Forces‘ regulations shall be observed if they so request. The Forces accept responsibility arising
directly from the application of such standards. The Forces shall attach to their request the
technical details, which are to be observed. The request must be made sufficiently early to allow
cost calculations to be made.‖ Refer to the latest Implementing Instructions to Article 4 of ABG-
75 for specific procedures.
It is USAFE policy that questions regarding applicability between U.S. and German standards
shall be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in accordance with Article 4, ABG-75. The following
guidelines have been established:
   5.2.1. Public Safety and Order. U.S. standards are to be applied wherever appropriate in
   cases where German public safety and order is not affected. In cases where public safety and
   order is an issue, German regulations shall be observed unless the BCE supplies proof that
   U.S. regulations lay down higher standards than those stipulated in German law. Such
   regulations must be provided to the Bauamt by the BCE with the initial ABG Form 3 or no
   later than the pre-concept review stage of the design work (KVM-Bau).
   5.2.2. Fire Codes and Life Safety. In all cases, U.S. regulations and criteria for fire codes
   and life safety codes shall be followed. The BCE shall provide the U.S. standards to the
   Bauamt with the initial ABG Form 3. Note that German and U.S. Fire codes are not
   consistently complementary and conflicts are likely. Regarding fire protection, the BCE
   shall refer to and ensure designs comply with the requirements of the latest Unified Facilities
   Criteria (UFC) document for Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities found at
   www.wbdg.org.                The      DoD       Unified      Facility    Criteria      website
   (http://65.204.17.188//report/doc_ufc.html) also provides a current index of criteria for a
   multitude of subjects including fire protection requirements. BCE‘s shall ensure U.S. fire
   and life safety codes are strictly adhered to during construction. For U.S. projects on USAF
   installations in Germany, U.S. National Fire Protection Standards (NFPA) fire protection
   criteria shall be mandatory. The Bauamt is responsible for ensuring contractors comply with
   the jobsite safety standards.
   5.2.3. Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP). AT/FP requirements shall be reviewed
   by the BCE in the programming stage and the facility sited according to the latest UFC 4-
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                  25


   010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, and other current technical
   criteria. Where the new facility cannot meet AT/FP requirements, costs to harden the facility
   to meet requirements must be programmed by the BCE. The Security Engineering Working
   Group website may provide an additional source of information. The DoD Unified Facility
   Criteria website (http://65.204.17.188//report/doc_ufc.html) provides a current index of
   criteria for a multitude of subjects including AT/FP, Security Engineering and Mass
   Notification Systems.
5.3. Documenting Unsatisfactory Performance. The BCE shall provide continued feedback
to the Bauamt and HQ USAFE/A7P when A-Es or contractors are found to be unresponsive to
U.S. Forces‘ quality or compliance concerns. A contractor‘s performance is deemed
unsatisfactory should one or more of the following conditions exist:
   5.3.1. Work will not meet the contract completion date or is more than 30 calendar days or
   5% behind schedule.
   5.3.2. Warranty repair or replacement work is not timely.
   5.3.3. Quality of work is poor or the Bauamt is not adequately enforcing quality control on
   site. The BCE shall provide descriptions and examples of work deficiencies to HQ
   USAFE/A7P and HQ USAFE/A7K whenever poor performance from a Bauamt contractor or
   an A-E firm warrants a recommendation for restriction from further work for the U.S. Forces.
   If the BCE determines the quality of the work to be poor, the BCE should request HQ
   USAFE/A7P to notify both the FfE and USAFE contracting offices. The BCE should
   communicate directly with the Bauamt on issues related to active projects. The BCE should
   notify the responsible Bauamt of serious construction deficiencies in writing clearly
   describing the nature and extent of the deficiency and requesting the Bauamt and contractor
   to take corrective action. Deficiencies warranting formal notification could include concerns
   regarding project quality, qualification, performance or timeliness. HQ USAFE/A7P will
   communicate with the proper German authorities on any matter requiring elevation to higher
   level authorities.
5.4. Project Management Plans (PMP). USAFE policy requires the BCE to prepare a PMP
prior to design start for all MILCON and all O&M construction, renovation and repair projects
exceeding $750,000 which are executed under the Indirect procedure. The PMP is intended to be
a comprehensive ―living document‖ that is refined as the project progresses. The PMP outlines
the roles and responsibilities of the Project Delivery Team (PDT) and provides the framework
for executing the project. The PMP outlines the strategy for the project identifying specific
delivery methods and milestones. The document should be developed in collaboration of the
entire PDT. Attachment 5 outlines topics to include in Project Management Plans.

                   INDIRECT PROCEDURE, PROJECT INITIATION

6.1. Project Initiation. Before initiation of Indirect procedure projects, the BCE shall ensure
the following documentation has been prepared:
   6.1.1. The project approval document. (DD Form 1391, AF Form 332, etc.).
   6.1.2. The purchase Request (certified AF Form 9).
   6.1.3. The U.S. Forces initiate design and construction of properly approved projects through
   various GCA depending on the cost. Formal project initiation begins with the submission of
   an ABG Form 3 package to the appropriate GGCA signed by a contracting officer.
6.2. ABG Form 3. The ABG Form 3 document is used for requesting and approving design and
construction work in progressive steps. The BCE is responsible for the preparation of ABG
Form 3 packages for Indirect procedure projects on bases under their responsibility. Only an
Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer is authorized to sign the ABG Form 3 on behalf of USAFE,
reference paragraph 5.1.2. The ABG Form 3 may also be used to award contracts on an
estimated basis, thus obligating both design and construction funds only with written approval
from the USAFE Civil Engineer.
   6.2.1. ABG Form 3 Preparation Procedures. The ABG Form 3 shall, upon signature of an
   Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer, serve as an order against the ABG-75. The
   countersigned ABG Form 3 is forwarded to the FMO and DFAS, who transfers funds from
   commitment to obligation or makes downward adjustments, as appropriate. The accepted
   ABG Form 3 is recorded as an Undelivered Order Outstanding (UOO). The BCE shall use
   ABG Form 3 to provide basic project information, preferred method of contracting with
   justification and list out any additional services for the design and construction phases in (an)
   attachment(s) to Block 5 remarks section:
       6.2.1.1. A statement of work in German and English based on DD Form 1391. The
       statement of work shall include the basic items of work and clearly defined deductive
       items, if any are requested, and also list applicable UFC and AF design standards,. All
       items of work (basic items and each deductive item) must be self-contained,
       independently functional and listed in order of preference. (Reference Articles 5.9 and
       20.3 of the ABG-75 Implementing Instructions.)
       6.2.1.2. List of requested additional services. Note that additional services are those
       services that are not covered by the Bauamt fee and are to be paid separately by the U.S.
       Forces. Because deciding which services constitute additional services is not always
       clear and is project specific, the BCE shall consult with MAJCOM with questions
       regarding additional services. Additional services include, but may not be limited to:
          6.2.1.2.1. Typical Design Phase Additional Services.
              6.2.1.2.1.1. Topographical Survey.
              6.2.1.2.1.2. Building Survey / Structural Survey. For future major renovation
              projects, engineers shall request the Bauamt to validate as-built drawings and
              project site conditions prior to contract award.

         6.2.1.9.1. New construction = bid and award as lump sum.
         6.2.1.9.2. Renovation and exterior work = unit price.
     6.2.1.10. Project Information.
         6.2.1.10.1. U.S. Project Manger(s).
         6.2.1.10.2. U.S. Mailing Address.
     6.2.1.11. Statement that ―The necessity of tree cutting is to be determined.‖
     6.2.1.12. Further U.S. requirements or information .
     6.2.1.13. List and Copies of specific U.S. Regulations. (Fire, Life Safety, AT/FP, etc.)
     (Reference paragraph 5.2).
     6.2.1.14. Statement that ―This project directly supports the defense mission of the U.S.
     Forces in Europe.‖
     6.2.1.15. The BCE shall determine whether there are any special translation
     requirements.
  6.2.2. Initial ABG Form 3 Submittal Procedures. The BCE shall include any special
  requirements for security, contractor access, construction periods, etc., in the SOW when it is
  submitted. Once the ABG Form 3 package is reviewed and signed by an Indirect ABG-75
  contracting officer, the BCE will submit Part I of the ABG Form 3 package according to the
  latest version of the required distribution listed in the ABG-75 flow charts for formal
  acceptance and countersignature to the appropriate GCA as listed below:
     6.2.2.1. For very minor construction, alterations and extensions up to and including
     €150,000, along with Indirect procedure maintenance and repair projects regardless of
     cost, the BCE shall submit three (3) copies of Part I of the ABG Form 3 package to the
     Bauamt and send two (2) copies to the FfE for information only.
     6.2.2.2. For new construction, alterations and extensions over €150,000 up to and
     including €375,000, after coordination with HQ USAFE/A7P, the BCE shall submit six
     (6) copies of Part I of the ABG Form 3 package to the FfE and send one (1) copy to the
     Bauamt for information only.
     6.2.2.3. For new construction, alterations and extensions over €375,000, the BCE shall
     use the Indirect procedure if not covered under the exemption of Art 27, ABG-75
     (Reference paragraph 4.1.6). A funded AF Form 9, for a minimum of 60 percent of the
     compensation fee (5.6 percent for new construction or 7.5 percent for maintenance and
     repair of the estimated construction cost) shall be prepared by the BCE and a contract
     number assigned by the FMO (Reference Attachment 7 for a breakdown of the NAEs at
     the various design and construction stages). After coordination with HQ USAFE/A7P,
     the BCE will submit eight (8) copies of the ABG Form 3 package to the appropriate FRG
     ministry (FMOD for Defense related projects and FMOC for Civil related projects) for
     countersignature and initial acceptance with one (1) information copy each sent to the
     Responsible State Ministry, the FfE and the Bauamt. Once the initial acceptance is
     received from the appropriate FRG ministry, the BCE shall submit subsequent ABG
     Form 3s for the project used to approve design phases and request actions directly to the
     Bauamt with information copies to the FfE.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   29


   6.2.3. Funds Commitment and Obligation. Acceptance of the ABG Form 3 by the
   German authorities is required before funds may be obligated for the project. Prior to
   acceptance by the German authorities, the initial ABG Form 3 is considered a commitment
   document. Acceptance of the ABG Form 3 by FRG obligates funds for project and design
   including fees. Construction project costs generally are obligated through the approved ABG
   Form 4 (Reference paragraph 7.12.3).
   6.2.4. Base Finance Management Office (FMO) Funding. The BCE forwards a copy of
   the initial ABG Form 3 signed by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer and AF Form 9 to
   the FMO who places a commitment on funds required to support the ABG Form 3 request in
   Part I, Line 3. Upon receipt of the countersigned ABG Form 3 from the Bauamt, the FfE or
   appropriate German Federal Ministry, the BCE forwards a confirmed copy to the FMO who
   transfers funds from commitment to obligations. The BCEs shall ensure that sufficient lead
   time is allowed for year-end obligation of funds.
   6.2.5. Joint Funding Simplification. For those projects containing a mix of fund sources,
   e.g., NAF and MILCON, project managers should consider managing the various funds
   sources in a central account, allowed for under 31 United States Code (USC) 7107, Joint
   Management of Funds. Funds should be held by the U.S. and not the Bauamt. Joint funds
   management may significantly reduce the administrative workload on both U.S. and Bauamt
   personnel.
6.3. Project Cost Estimates. Protocol of Signature and the Implementing Instructions do not
require the FRG to separate types of funds provided by the U.S. Forces in support of construction
projects. In addition, the definitions of repair, maintenance, minor construction, and major
construction differ between the German Government construction agencies and the U.S. Forces.
However, the normal Bauamt 100% cost estimate provides unit cost for identified work
elements. The BCE should work with the Bauamt to structure the work elements to provide the
U.S. Forces with the required information needed to track classification of funds during the
design process. During the execution phase, the BCE shall classify the required changes as
maintenance, repair, minor construction, with scope determination. It is the BCE‘s responsibility
to ensure construction funds are tracked and classified correctly in accordance with U.S. fiscal
law.
6.4. Project Folder. In the administration of Indirect procedure projects, the BCE should
establish a project management folder at project initiation containing the record of all project
related actions and correspondence. This folder serves as the master official folder containing
ABG-75 actions processed through the life of the project. A suggested format for this folder and
project files is provided at Attachment 6.

                                           Chapter 7

                      INDIRECT PROCEDURE, PROJECT DESIGN

7.1. Pre-Design Conference. After the appropriate GCA has accepted the project, the US
Forces will assist the Bauamt in setting up a pre-design conference to include representatives
from the Bauamt, A-E firms, project stakeholders, and all appropriate US agencies. At the pre-
design conference, design milestones (design start, KVM-Bau, HU-Bau, AFU-Bau, ,
advertisement date, notice to proceed/mobilization date and construction complete date) should
be established, problems resolved and scope of work accurately defined. At the pre-design
conference, the BCE shall perform a thorough risk analysis prior to embarking on construction
design and execution acquisition methods outside the norm (such as Fast Track, etc.). This risk
analysis will consider current USAF policy and guidance, both US and the Bauamt limitations
under the ABG-75 Indirect procedure, US and German contracting and fiscal law, as well as past
performance on projects with critical schedules. If the BCE would like to include specific FAR
clauses or language in the contract, the BCE shall solicit the agreement of the German authorities
to such inclusions. The BCE shall ensure this agreement is documented in meeting minutes.
BCE personnel should be prepared to turn over reproducible copies of as-built drawings and
utility drawings to designers at this time. The design specifications should include any special
requirements, both those in the SOW and any new requirements. A hazardous materials plan
should be addressed. Performance times for design are normally agreed upon at the pre-design
conference. The BCE should provide the required performance time and be prepared to support
it.
   7.1.1. Design Durations. Experience has shown the following times to be reasonable for
   design execution for projects in the FRG. These are typical durations (by project value) for
   estimating performance time for planning and programming purposes:
       7.1.1.1. Up to €1M. Eight (8) months for complete design with 35 percent at three (3) to
       four (4) months.
       7.1.1.2. 1 to €5M. 12 months for complete design with 35 percent at four (4) to five (5)
       months.
       7.1.1.3. 5 to €10M. 15 months for complete design with 35 percent at six (6) months.
       7.1.1.4. Over €10M. To be determined at pre-design conference, but in excess of 15
       months.
   7.1.2. Solicitation and Construction Durations. In addition to design time, the BCE shall
   consider the following:
       7.1.2.1. Advertisement. From 30 to 60 calendar days depending on value and scope.
       7.1.2.2. Review of bids and award. A minimum of 45 calendar days depending on the
       value and scope of the project and the number of bids received.
       7.1.2.3. Construction period. The BCE shall refer to existing USAF guidance and
       policy regarding setting construction period goals.
       7.1.2.4. Weather. Impacts during proposed construction period.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    31


7.2. Design Meetings. The BCE is the point of contact for the U.S. Forces and will interact
with the Bauamt to provide cross-feed of technical information as required to support the design
process. Meetings concerning reviews should be formalized and comments recorded on USAFE
Form 307, Project Review Comments, and 307B, Project Review Comments (Continuation
Sheet). The BCE shall identify additional design requirements or additional services on an ABG
Form 5A not later than the KVM-Bau. This does not preclude any additional service
requirements to be submitted during the remaining design/construction process. The quantity
and size (full/half sheet) of English/German design submittal copies required for each review
should be coordinated at the pre-design meeting. If the BCE requires more than one copy for
each design phase (KVM-Bau, HU-Bau, AFU-Bau, etc.), the U.S. Forces will incur additional
costs for the services. There are four formal design reviews. These include:
   7.2.1. Kostenvoranmeldung-Bau (KVM-Bau). Pre-Concept (5%-10%) design submittal
   (Article 7.1.2, ABG-75)
   7.2.2. Haushaltsunterlage-Bau (HU-Bau). Concept (approximately 35%) design submittal
   (Article 7.1.3, ABG-75)
   7.2.3. Ausführungsunterlage-Bau (AFU-Bau) I. Final (90%-95%) design submittal
   (Article 7.1.4, ABG-75)
   7.2.4. AFU-Bau II. Final (100% design) tender action package (Article 7.1.4, ABG-75)
7.3. KVM-Bau Pre-Concept Design Submittal (5-10% Design). Following the pre-design
meeting, the Bauamt prepares the KVM-Bau submittal. The submittal consists of an informal
explanatory report, a rough cost estimate, a general location plan, and a building expert‘s report
on site suitability to ensure the design requirements are understood before progressing further
with the design. The KVM-Bau shall be considered the project scope approval point, effectively
meaning that user requested design changes after this point would result in payment for lost
design effort; changes to comply with UFC or design standards as specified in the SOW are not
considered user changes at this or more advanced design phases. For the US, the BCE ensures
copies are forwarded to the User and other stakeholders as requested for review/comments.
   7.3.1. Design Review Meeting. Within eight (8) calendar days after distribution of the
   KVM-Bau, a KVM-Bau review meeting is held at the BCE office. Participants shall include
   representatives of the Bauamt, the User, and BCE representatives.
   7.3.2. Design Review Comments. Review comments will be consolidated by the BCE and
   transmitted to the Bauamt for incorporation into the design. The BCE will also provide an
   electronic copy of the meeting minutes and consolidated comments to the User. The BCE
   shall ensure each comment is addressed and annotated by the GCA A-E prior to approving
   any design phase on the ABG Form 3. The BCE shall provide an electronic copy of the A-E
   annotated comments to the User prior to providing approval for design continuation to the
   Bauamt.
7.4. HU-Bau Design Submittal (35% Design). Upon written approval of the KVM-Bau
submittal by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer (on ABG Form 3), the Bauamt proceed shall
proceed with the preparation of the HU-Bau submittal. The Bauamt shall submit the HU-Bau to
the BCE who shall distribute it to the User and other stakeholders within 15 calendar days after
receipt. The HU-Bau consists of plans, an explanatory report, current working cost estimate,
quantity calculations and a building expert‘s technical report.
 32                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   7.4.1. Design Review Comments. Comments at this time should focus on the functional
   arrangement, the technical requirement and economical maintenance and operation. At a
   minimum, the User, the BCE, Base communications, safety, environmental and Security
   Forces should be involved in the review. The USAFE Project Manager (PM) shall
   consolidate comments and forward them to the Bauamt approximately six (6) weeks after
   receipt of the HU-Bau. BCE shall also provide an electronic copy of the consolidated
   comments to the User.
   7.4.2. Design Review Meeting. A HU-Bau review meeting will be held at the BCE office
   no later than thirty (30) calendar days following transmittal of the HU-Bau comments to the
   Bauamt. The meeting is scheduled by the BCE and includes the Bauamt, the A-E and the
   User.
   7.4.3. Design Review Comments. The BCE shall consolidate review comments and
   transmit them to the Bauamt for incorporation into the design. The BCE shall ensure each
   comment is addressed and annotated by the Bauamt A-E prior to approval on the ABG Form
   3. BCE will provide the User an electronic copy of the A-E annotated comments prior to
   providing approval for design continuation to the Bauamt.
   7.4.4. Design Comment Incorporation. The U.S. Project Managers shall ensure design
   review comments are incorporated through the use of back check reviews by technical
   designers and obtain written confirmation of their incorporation into the design from the
   Bauamt.
   7.4.5. Design Continuation. Upon written approval by the BCE of the HU-Bau, the
   Bauamt shall proceed to the AFU-Bau. If the initial ABG Form 3 did not authorize the
   design to 100%, the BCE shall prepare and forward an ABG Form 3 modification document
   checking the appropriate block in Part I of the form. This shall be reviewed and signed by an
   Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer.
   7.4.6. Public Review. The basis for public coordination review conducted by the Bauamt is
   the completed and approved HU-Bau submittal. Public coordination procedures are initiated
   by the Bauamt and are usually complete by the time of submission of the AFU-Bau.
7.5. AFU-Bau I (90-95% Design) Submittal. Upon written approval of the HU-Bau submittal
by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer (on ABG Form 3), the Bauamt shall proceed with
preparation of the AFU-Bau submittal. The Bauamt shall submit the AFU-Bau I to the BCE who
shall distribute it within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt to the User and any other
stakeholder that may need to review. The AFU-Bau consists of design drawings, working
drawings, specifications (together with bills of quantity), approved structural analyses, together
with calculations and relevant drawings showing the stability of the design, proof of thermal and
sound insulation and fire protection and other calculations and analyses, as required.
   7.5.1. Design Review Meeting. Agencies involved in the review of the 35% (HU-Bau)
   design submittal shall review the 90-95% (AFU-Bau 1) design. Only minor changes should
   be required at this time based on incorporation of previous design review comments and
   design‘s compliance with UFC and design standards as prescribed per the SOW. Major
   recommended changes should be carefully considered as they may significantly impact final
   design and construction milestones. Changes will also increase the cost of the design (lost
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                  33


   design effort); however, if changes are required, it would be better to make such changes at
   this time rather than during construction.
       7.5.1.1. BCE personnel perform the constructability review which includes a thorough
       plan-in-hand check on the site to verify all aspects of facility, utility and topographic
       conditions. The review focuses on weak areas of design that may precipitate changes or
       claims as a result of design errors or omissions due to incorrect description of existing
       site conditions.
       7.5.1.2. BCE personnel perform a maintainability review to ensure systems and
       equipment can be easily and properly serviced. Superintendents responsible for utilities
       ensure tie-ins are accurately depicted.
       7.5.1.3. Project Managers shall ensure design review comments are incorporated into
       subsequent design submittals through the use of back check reviews by technical
       designers and each comment shall be annotated by the designer. U.S. PMs shall obtain
       written confirmation of their incorporation into the design from the Bauamt.
   7.5.2. Final AFU-Bau I Design. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the AFU-Bau I, the
   BCE shall consolidate comments and forward them to the Bauamt for incorporation into the
   final AFU-Bau design. The BCE shall also provide an electronic copy of the consolidated
   comments to the User.
   7.5.3. Design Review Conference. The BCE shall schedule design review conferences
   within 30 calendar days of the transmittal of comments to the Bauamt, with attendees
   including the Bauamt, the A-E and the User.
   7.5.4. The BCE shall prepare minutes of the AFU-Bau I review meeting and forward copies
   to all attendees. If there were additional review comments on the AFU-Bau I, the BCE shall
   transmit the review comments to the Bauamt within 17 calendar days after of the review
   meeting.
   7.5.5. Corrected Final Design. As a result of the AFU-Bau I meeting, the Bauamt shall
   prepare and submit to the BCE a corrected final AFU-Bau design within 30 calendar days
   after receiving the AFU-Bau I comments. BCE will provide the User and reviewing
   authorities (e.g., AFCESA, AFSVA, AAFES,) a copy of the corrected final design for review
   prior to the AFU-Bau II meeting.
7.6. AFU-Bau II (100% Design) Submittal. Within eight (8) calendar days of receiving the
corrected AFU-Bau II design, the BCE shall schedule a meeting with the User to review the
changes. Attendance by the Bauamt or the A-E is not mandatory unless the initial review of the
AFU-Bau II reveals noncompliance with previous review comments.
7.7. Special Design Reviews. Certain reviews and actions are specifically required by this and
other directives. While the project is accomplished within German laws and procedures, it is the
BCE‘s responsibility to review designs to ensure they adhere to U.S. laws and procedures. The
BCE shall accomplish required reviews locally.
   7.7.1. BCE Responsibilities. The BCE is responsible for ensuring the following review
   actions:
       7.7.1.1. The User-client shall review each project at each stage, providing comments in
       writing, with specific reasons for exceptions.
34                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


     7.7.1.2. Communication systems, base safety, security police and fire department shall
     also review each project to ensure active and passive security requirements and life safety
     codes are met, and that necessary information systems requirements such as pre-wiring
     are included and programmed for installation upon project completion. The BCE should
     require written responses.
     7.7.1.3. The BCE shall review designs for functional and technical sufficiency.
     7.7.1.4. The BCE shall ensure maintainability reviews are accomplished.
     7.7.1.5. Constructability is implied since the Bauamt as the designer must ensure its
     designs are constructible.
     7.7.1.6. The BCE shall ensure the Bauamt addresses, annotates and incorporates all U.S.
     design review comments in the project design prior to requesting an Indirect ABG-75
     contracting officer‘s approval of each design phase on ABG Form 3.
  7.7.2. Special Review Requirements. Either AFCEE/CMT or the BCE project manager
  shall ensure any special design review requirements are incorporated into the project design
  based on other instructions or agreements. Most medical, dental, chapel, services, DODDS-
  E, AAFES, AFSVA and DeCA facilities, for example, shall require special using agency
  reviews.
     7.7.2.1. User-client review and comment is required before the Bauamt may advertise
     the project; user-client signing of the drawings is not sufficient. The User-client‘s written
     conclusions should clearly convey that the User-client thoroughly reviewed the design,
     that any questions have been satisfactorily answered, and that the design satisfies the
     User-client‘s requirements. Any User-client concerns or reservations shall be clearly
     stated.
     7.7.2.2. Technical approval does not eliminate the need for local review of matters that
     can only be properly evaluated with knowledge of the local stakeholders.
     7.7.2.3. The BCE shall revisit the site whenever a question arises concerning existing
     conditions because verifying existing conditions may uncover potential design errors or
     omissions that could be costly during construction if not promptly addressed.
     7.7.2.4. The BCE shall annotate comments on USAFE Forms 307 and 307B and retain
     copies as written records of comments of design reviews at various levels of the project
     design. The BCE shall complete this form in a minimum of two copies and shall file one
     copy in the project folder and send one to the designer. Other agencies may request the
     BCE to provide additional copies.
     7.7.2.5. AFCEE and installation PMs shall take measures to ensure that design A-E firms
     procured by the Bauamt to perform subsequent construction management (CM) duties
     establish a proper separation of duties permitting independent review of construction
     quality control, costs and schedule.
  7.7.3. Design Reviews at 65% Submittal. Because thorough design review is crucial to the
  success of USAFE's MILCON program, the BCE shall tailor the design review process for
  each project on the basis of complexity, cost and schedule. MILCON projects procured
  through the ABG-75‘s Indirect procedure typically include only two design stage submittals;
  the 35% and the 95%. 65% submittals are usually not required for projects, and construction
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                 35


   document reviews are typically conducted through on-board meetings (over-the-shoulder) in
   the A-E‘s office. This allows team members to provide the necessary design oversight
   without stopping design. USAFE engineers shall request formal 65% submittals on the
   initial ABG Form 3 for complex or unique projects and projects with significant Heating,
   Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) or industrial operations requirements. For other
   less complex projects, USAFE engineers shall focus on the key elements of the designs with
   significant HVAC or industrial operations requirements by asking the A-E for detailed floor
   plans/layouts and/or renderings of HVAC systems that would facilitate detailed and thorough
   over-the-shoulder reviews.
7.8. Design Changes. Design changes are different from design review comments, and alter the
scope of work intended in the statement of work submitted with the ABG Form 3. Design
review comments reinforce or emphasize requirements included in the statement of work. It is
important that PMs understand how incorporating comments will effect the project‘s final form
and its ease of execution, as well as its scope and cost. If inclusion of the comments causes
significant problems, the BCE shall elevate the situation to HQ USAFE/A7P for resolution.
   7.8.1. ABG     Form 3 Documentation. The BCE accomplishes design changes by
   submitting an ABG Form 3 modification package to the Bauamt. The package includes the
   following:
       7.8.1.1. ABG Form 3.
       7.8.1.2. Revised and re-approved DD Form 1391 (if required).
       7.8.1.3. Statement of Work package.
       7.8.1.4. AF Form 9, if additional funds are required.
       7.8.1.5. Justification for the change. The following additional items are necessary as
       supplemental information:
          7.8.1.5.1. User comments critical to mission success.
          7.8.1.5.2. Functional and technical comments.
          7.8.1.5.3. Fire Department comments.
   7.8.2. ABG Form 3 Processing. Once the ABG Form 3 modification package has been
   reviewed and signed by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer, the BCE shall submit the
   package to the Bauamt during the design phase.
   7.8.3. ABG Form 3 Change Order Documentation to FMO. The supplemental ABG
   Form 3 is used by the U.S. Forces to modify the original agreement. If the ABG Form 3 is
   initiated only to increase funds in support of a revised current working estimate during the
   design, the Bauamt is not required to countersign the ABG Form 3 document, and form is
   sent by the BCE to both the FMO and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)
   who immediately records as an obligation. If the ABG Form 3 is initiated to alter the design
   and/or make downward adjustments to the initial ABG Form 3, the ABG Form 3 requires the
   Bauamt‘s countersignature showing acceptance of the change. The ABG Form 3 is reviewed
   and signed by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer and forwarded to the FMO and DFAS.
   If the ABG Form 3 is a downward adjustment, no action is taken by the FMO until receipt of
 36                                                            USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   the countersigned ABG Form 3. An ABG Form 3 for an increase is recorded by the FMO as
   an obligation of funds.
7.9. Contract Clauses. The ABG-75 agreement is an international U.S. Forces/FRG executive
agreement providing that Indirect procedure construction projects will be executed in accordance
with German laws. However, Annex A of the Protocol of Signature includes the following
―boilerplate‖ provisions of U.S. contracting law (which are also found in the FAR):
   7.9.1. United States Officials not to Benefit.
   7.9.2. Covenant Against Contingent Fees.
   7.9.3. Gratuities.
   7.9.4. Cost Plus a Percentage of Cost.
7.10. Inclusion of FAR Clauses. Under the present ABG-75 agreement, U.S. Forces have no
authority to unilaterally incorporate additional FAR clauses into Host Nation construction
contracts executed using the Indirect procedure. Furthermore, the spirit and intent of many FAR
clauses used by the U.S. Forces are mirrored in German contracting laws and regulations applied
by the German authorities in their execution of Indirect procedure construction projects. The
EVM/B is a compendium of standard contract provision forms for building and works similar to
the special contract requirements and clauses including other procurement documents used for
Direct procedure projects. These forms are included in the ―Vergabehandbuch fuer die
Durchfuehrung von Bauaufgaben des Bundes im Zustaendigkeitsbereich der
Finanzbauverwaltung,‖ in English the ―Manual on Financial Management of Federal Contracting
in Germany‖ (VHB), and shall be used by the German government contracting agencies for all
ABG-75 Indirect procedure construction projects.
7.11. Project Advertisement. Following the incorporation of final AFU-BAU II comments, the
design is considered complete and ready for tender action (advertisements). Construction
advertisements are conducted by the Bauamt according to open (public) procedures in
accordance with ―Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen,‖ in English ―Construction
Contract Procedures‖ (VOB) Part A, Section 3.1.(1). The Bauamt shall award contracts based on
full and open competition and only in rare exceptions should they be awarded under other than
full and open competition. The justification must contain sufficient facts and rationale to support
the decision. The justification shall be originated by the contracting officer in conjunction with
the BCE, and approved by the base commander and the Staff Judge Advocate if the project is
within the base‘s Indirect procedure approval authority, and shall be approved by HQ
USAFE/A7K if the project exceeds the base contracting authority.
   7.11.1. ABG Form 3 Preparation. Upon acceptance of the AFU-Bau II, the BCE prepares
   an ABG Form 3 modification package (if the original ABG Form 3 did not authorize project
   advertisement) approving 100% design (ABG-75, Article 7.1.4) to be reviewed and signed
   by an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer and requesting the Bauamt to tender actions.
   Once the package has been reviewed and signed, the BCE submits the authority to advertise
   package to the Bauamt for execution of the project.
   7.11.2. Bid Solicitation Review. In conjunction with the Indirect ABG-75 contracting
   officer on record, the BCE should develop operating procedures to review bid solicitations to
   ensure the package meets the intent of the construction order and serves the best interest of
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    37


   the U.S. government. If items are missing the contracting officer should submit
   recommendations to the Bauamt. The Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer should request
   the Bauamt to issue amendments to prospective bidders as necessary to protect the U.S.
   government‘s interest.
   7.11.3. Use of General Contractors. USAFE‘s policy dictates the use of a single general
   contractor or joint venture for all USAFE construction projects. When approving the designs
   and requesting tender action, the BCEs shall ensure request and detailed justification are
   written on the ABG Form 3, Part 1, Item 5, Remarks section. (Reference paragraph 8.2.2).
   7.11.4. Bid Evaluation. Following advertisement and submission of bids, a bid evaluation
   period is necessary. Advertisement and bid evaluation by the Bauamt can take up to 90
   calendar days. Once the successful lowest responsive and responsible bidder is chosen by
   the Bauamt, they will submit an ABG Form 4 recommending award to the U.S. contracting
   officer.
7.12. ABG Form 4. The Bauamt provides the BCE with the bid evaluations of the five (5)
lowest bids and alternative construction methods provided by the bidders. The recommendation
package (ABG Form 4) is submitted as follows:
   7.12.1. ABG Form 4 for Major Construction. For new construction projects over
   €375,000 the Bauamt submits five (5) copies of the ABG Form 4 to the BCE for
   countersignature. The BCE shall review the bid evaluation to ensure the U.S. government‘s
   interests were included in the bid response and any alternative construction method is in the
   best interest of the U.S. government. The BCE shall develop procedures to validate the
   recommendation from the Bauamt; however, the BCE is not authorized to reject the
   recommendation from the Bauamt. Only HQ USAFE/A7P, as an independent reviewer, may
   reject the recommendation from the Bauamt based on sufficient justification from the BCE.
   After review, the BCE will prepare an AF Form 9 for construction funds sufficient to cover
   the construction cost and will ensure funds are in place before the ABG Form 4 is reviewed
   and signed by the Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer (Reference paragraph 3.4.5.2). If the
   bid would expire before the receipt of funds, the Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer will
   request a bid extension from and approved by the Bauamt. The Indirect ABG-75 contracting
   officer will countersign the ABG Form 4 within 18 calendar days of receipt, return it to the
   Bauamt, and provide a copy to the BCE.
   7.12.2. ABG Form 4 for Minor Construction and Maintenance and Repair. For new
   construction, renovation and alteration projects equal to or less than €375,000, the Bauamt
   submits five (5) copies of the ABG Form 4 package to the BCE for countersignature. The
   BCE shall review the bid evaluation to ensure the U.S. government‘s interests were included
   in the bid response and any alternative construction method is in the best interest of the U.S.
   government. The BCE shall develop procedures to validate the recommendation from the
   Bauamt; however, the BCE is not authorized to reject the recommendation from the Bauamt.
   Only HQ USAFE/A7P, as an independent reviewer, may reject the recommendation from the
   Bauamt based on sufficient justification from the BCE. If additional funds are required for
   the Bauamt to cover the low bid and award the contract, the BCE must request and receive
   funds before the Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer signs the ABG Form 4. If the bid
   would expire before the receipt of funds, the Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer will request
   a bid extension from and approved by the Bauamt. Bids are not normally extended beyond
 38                                                          USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   30 calendar days. The ABG Form 4 will be reviewed and signed by a contracting officer, at
   BCE or CONS as appropriate. (Reference paragraph 3.4.4.12 and 3.4.5.2) and returned to
   the Bauamt within 18 calendar days. The signed ABG Form 4 gives the Bauamt authority to
   award the contract which obligates the U.S. to pay up to the amount on the ABG Form 4.
   7.12.3. ABG Form 4 Funding. The ABG Form 4 is an obligation document that can adjust
   funding to meet the project cost, either by initial obligations or de-commitment of excess
   funds previously obligated to the project. The BCE is required to coordinate with its local
   FMO on ABG Form 4 funding actions. If insufficient funds are available to cover the low
   bid, the BCE will seek additional funds. When, after signature of the ABG Form 4, excess
   funds remain obligated for a project, the BCE shall instruct the FMO to de-obligate the
   excess construction funds. In such cases, the contracting officer will break out the cost
   estimate accordingly. If excess funds remain, the contracting officer will instruct the FMO to
   de-obligate the funds from the project.
7.13. Project Award. Contract award of an Indirect procedure project for construction is made
only through the Bauamt. The Bauamt completes tender actions and makes the construction
contract award within 28 calendar days of receiving the countersigned ABG Form 4 from the
contracting officer. The construction Notice to Proceed (NTP) is issued by the Bauamt to their
construction contractor.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   39

                 INDIRECT PROCEDURE, PROJECT CONSTRUCTION

8.1. Pre-construction Conference. Prior to issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP), the
Bauamt is responsible for arranging an on-site pre-construction meeting. Participants should
include the construction contractor, the design A-E, the User, and any other personnel as
determined by the BCE. The pre-construction meeting establishes local ground rules directly
related to contractor actions and interactions on base. Engineers should be prepared to discuss
issues such as phasing, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government Furnished
Materials (GFM) items, coordination in restricted areas, safety, fire protection, digging permit
procedures and base access requirements as specified in the contract. During the pre-
construction meeting, key points of contact from the Bauamt, the BCE construction manager,
and the User shall be identified. The Bauamt will clarify contractual issues such as construction
start date, contract amount, performance time, estimated construction completion date, etc. The
participants will clarify technical questions, decide weekly construction progress meetings, and
establish construction schedule requirements. The contractor shall submit a construction
performance plan to the Bauamt within 21 calendar days after the pre-construction meeting.
8.2. ABG-75 Construction
   8.2.1. General. The construction phase of a project executed using the Indirect procedure
   can be similar to Direct procedure procurement or it can be very different, depending on
   whether the work was contracted to a general contractor or contracted by trade. When a
   general contractor is responsible, he is responsible for coordinating the various trades
   (masonry, carpentry, electrical, mechanical, etc.) and for scheduling all work. When the
   work is contracted by trade, the Bauamt is responsible for coordinating the trades and for
   scheduling the work and acts as a General Contractor.
   8.2.2. Use of General Contractors. It is USAFE policy to use general contractors instead
   of multiple individual specific ―trade‖ contractors to carry out new construction. In certain
   limited circumstances, the BCE may allow the Bauamt to let trade contracts if the work
   contemplated is best suited to this type of contracting. However, where the BCE determines
   that a general contractor is required, the Bauamt is obligated to advertise in accordance with
   such a determination. The BCE‘s determination shall be in writing and justified on an ABG
   Form 3 in a timely manner. Formal procedures can be found in the Implementing
   Instructions (8.6) for Article 8 of ABG-75. The BCE shall insist on the use of a general
   contractor and elevate any resistance on the part of the Bauamt to HQ USAFE/A7P.
8.3. Responsibilities During Construction
   8.3.1. Bauamt. The Bauamt directly interacts with the contractor. They are responsible for
   ensuring that the work is accomplished according to plans and specifications. Their
   construction supervision performs day-to-day inspection, verifies quantities and quality of
   materials used and ensures the contractor performs in a workmanlike manner. The Bauamt
   resolves problems and initiates corrective action regarding design deficiencies.
   8.3.2. Contractor. The contractor is responsible for meeting the contractual requirements
   and for providing materials and workmanship in accordance with the terms of the contract.
 40                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   8.3.3. Base Civil Engineer. The BCE is responsible for identifying special scheduling and
   security requirements (e.g., base passes for contractors) during the design phase, ensuring
   those requirements are in the contract, and providing the contractor with assistance to ensure
   the requirements are met. The BCE is also responsible for providing surveillance.
   (Reference paragraph 8.4).
   8.3.4. Finance Management Office (FMO). The FMO servicing the responsible BCE
   certifies and records funds availability on each construction project through preparation of an
   AF Form 9.         The BCE has the authority to execute projects for Element of
   Expense/Investment Codes (EEIC) 521 and 522 and up to €375,000 for EEIC 529. The
   FMO processes ABG actions using the following forms that are distributed to DFAS. ABG
   Form 3 is the order form used to increase, decrease, or cancel funds, representing a
   commitment until accepted by the appropriate GCA, at which time funds are moved from
   commitment to Undelivered Order Outstanding (UOO) status. DFAS establishes projects in
   the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS) with the different accounting classifications
   under each budget project (e.g., P-341 or P-721) and EEIC (e.g., 52900 or 53200). Increases
   or decreases to UOO are recorded for each ABG Form 5 received during the construction
   phase.
8.4. Air Force Construction Surveillance. Construction surveillance differs from inspection.
Surveillance is defined as observation of a project‘s execution, as well as the progress of the
project, to detect any problems that could adversely affect the final result. It must be close
enough to detect anything that could prevent the completed work from serving its designed
function. Experience has shown that under the Indirect procedure, the Bauamt may not have an
organized quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) program other than the testing
requirements of the VOB. The BCE shall ensure their surveillance includes a thorough internal
QA/QC program. The BCE is responsible for establishing the frequency of surveillance visits as
appropriate for the complexity of the project. Depending on the complexity and scope of the
project, robust U.S. surveillance may be required to protect U.S. interests.
   8.4.1. Reporting Construction Deficiencies. A record of surveillance visits shall be kept
   using AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection Record, or a similar form. At a minimum, the
   date, time, weather, number of people, and work sections should be completed and inspectors
   are encouraged to use all parts of the form. The AF Inspector shall ensure written records are
   immediately prepared concerning controversial items. The AF Inspector performing
   surveillance on an Indirect procedure project has no authority to direct or tell a contractor
   how to perform the work. If the inspector notes anything on-site not in compliance with the
   plans and specifications, it shall be noted on AF Form 1477, immediately brought verbally to
   the attention of the Bauamt inspector (Bauleitung) and followed with a written notice to the
   Bauamt within five (5) workdays. If the AF inspector discovers a condition which is unsafe
   or life threatening, the inspector shall contact the on-site Bauamt inspector to initiate this
   action with the contractor. If the Bauamt inspector is not on site, the AF inspector shall
   contact the contractor directly and immediately follow-up with the Bauamt. The AF
   Inspector shall document in writing on an AF Form 1477 each step taken.
8.5. Change Order Management.
   8.5.1. General Considerations. Modifications may increase original contracted amounts
   formalized by the Bauamt with the contractor. Modifications allow equitable adjustments to
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    41


  the contract requirements so as to accommodate differing site conditions, unforeseen
  conditions, corrections of errors and omissions (design deficiencies), delays and impacts to
  the work, administrative changes, weather delays, work suspensions, etc. Modifications
  should not significantly change the original scope of work. If a modification represents a
  scope increase or decrease of 5% or more, the PM shall work with the Bauamt to carefully
  examine the original scope to gain a clear understanding of the necessity for the change prior
  to approval. In the Indirect procedure, the PM shall ensure the Bauamt does not execute
  contract change orders prior to U.S. notification and approval. The PM shall work closely
  with the Bauamt to ensure they explain the urgency for each change and the impact if a
  change were not approved by the U.S. Forces. Additional costs caused by a change order are
  only borne by the U.S. if written approval has been granted by the U.S. Exceptional cases
  such as construction delay, construction stoppage, contractor claims, etc., are not valid
  reasons for the Bauamt to execute a change order without formal approval from the U.S.
  There are two types of changes, mandatory and non-mandatory, that the PM may encounter
  during construction. Mandatory changes are changes that must be made to allow the
  construction to proceed in a normal manner or to provide a fully functional facility and may
  be generated as a result of differing site conditions, errors or omissions in the plans and
  specifications, or directed changes in applicable standards and criteria and are normally
  generated and submitted by the Bauamt to the PM on an ABG Form 5 (Reference paragraph
  8.5.2). Non-mandatory changes, normally user generated, typically arise based on changes in
  procedures, equipment or capabilities; or are changes to improve the maintainability or
  functional characteristics of a facility and are generated by the PM and submitted to the
  Bauamt (Reference paragraph 8.5.3).
  8.5.2. Mandatory Change Order Initiation. Upon notification that the contractor proposes
  to deviate from the plans and specifications in his construction, the PM will work with the
  Bauamt to ensure all information necessary to reach a sound decision prior to approval of the
  ABG Form 5-Change Order Document is obtained. An Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer
  shall only approve and sign a change order document when it is determined that the
  modification is necessary and in the best interests of the U.S. Government (Reference
  paragraphs 3.4.4.12 and 3.4.5.2). The ABG Form 5 must include a clear and concise
  description of the change along with drawings as necessary to explain what is being done.
  Equally important is the technical justification for the change, the reason for the change, and
  why it was not included in the original design. This justification shall be clear, specific, and
  complete so that those unfamiliar with the contract will understand why the change is being
  made. The PM shall work closely with the Bauamt to minimize any construction delays. It
  is also important for funds reservation that costs are estimated realistically, with sufficient
  detail to support the estimated amount. For change requests, the following information is
  required:
     8.5.2.1. Description of Requested Change. The Bauamt shall describe the key features
     of the requested change and whether the change represents an additional, altered or
     substitute requirement for a feature already included in the project.
     8.5.2.2. Justification for Change. The Bauamt shall include specific references to Air
     Force Instructions, German regulations, Technical Orders, industry standards, or other
     applicable references or back up documentation.
42                                                          USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


     8.5.2.3. Cost and Schedule. The Bauamt shall provide the cost of the change (or Rough
     Order of Magnitude (ROM) if precise cost information is not available) and schedule
     requirements, including impacts to project timeline, especially if the change is a critical
     path activity. PMs shall review and analyze Bauamt proposed cost estimates for
     reasonableness and technical accuracy. For change orders in excess of $100,000, PMs
     shall document cost reviews as follows:
         8.5.2.3.1. If the items in a change order are related to an item in the original (main)
         specifications, the PM will check the item based on the original (main) specifications.
         8.5.2.3.2. If the items in a change order are comparable with items in the original
         (main) specifications, the PM may check the proposed prices for the change order
         based on the original (main) specifications.
         8.5.2.3.3. If the items in a change order are completely new items that are not
         included in the original (main) specifications, the PM will check the unit prices based
         upon documentation (internet research and quotations by construction companies)
         provided by the LBB. Original overhead costs should remain unchanged.
  8.5.3. Non-Mandatory or User Requested Change Initiation. For Non-Mandatory or
  User Requested Changes, the ABG Form 5A must include a clear and concise description of
  the change, drawings as necessary to explain what is being requested, and a justification and
  explanation of the impact if the change were not provided. Paragraph 8.5.3.1 describes the
  level of user endorsement required. After review and approval by the PM, FMO obligates
  funds based on the estimated cost of the change and an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer
  submits a signed ABG Form 5A to the Bauamt. The Bauamt processes the change by
  preparing and/or revising contract specifications and drawings and responds on an ABG
  Form 5. The ABG Form 5 should contain the same information required for a mandatory
  change described in paragraphs 8.5.2.1-8.5.2.3 followed by a similar review and tracking.
     8.5.3.1. User Change Request Endorsement. In addition to the providing the required
     information set forth above, the change requestor shall obtain the endorsements of the
     key decision makers set forth below. This feature of the user change request process
     provides a second mechanism for validating user change requests and ensuring
     appropriate leaders are aware of project execution impacts.           Change request
     endorsements and submitting signatures are required from the following persons at the
     stages listed:
         8.5.3.1.1. Project Definition-65% Design: Endorsement:             The requesting
         organization‘s assigned Project Officer. Submitting Signature: The Indirect ABG-75
         contracting officer after review and approval by the PM.
         8.5.3.1.2. 65% Design to 10% Construction: Endorsement: The requesting
         organization‘s Flight Commander or staff equivalent. Submitting Signature: The
         Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer after review and approval by the PM.
         8.5.3.1.3. 10%-80% Construction: Endorsement: The requesting organization‘s
         Squadron Commander, Deputy, or staff equivalent. Submitting Signature: The
         Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer after review and approval by the Programs Flight
         Chief.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   43


         8.5.3.1.4. 80%-100% Construction (Red Zone): Endorsement: The requesting
         organization‘s Squadron Commander or Deputy. Signature: The Indirect ABG-75
         contracting officer after review and approval by the BCE.
  8.5.4. Change Order Tracking. PMs shall develop and maintain a tracking sheet for all
  mandatory and non-mandatory/user changes. At a minimum, the tracking sheet shall include:
     8.5.4.1. The change order number (common to U.S. and Bauamt) and description.
     8.5.4.2. The original requested amount. (May be ROM estimated amount if precise cost
     information is not available from the Bauamt).
     8.5.4.3. The final negotiated amount.
     8.5.4.4. The root cause according to the following categories:
         8.5.4.4.1. Engineering Change. A change necessary to remedy deficiencies in
         contract plans and specifications, including changes resulting from design errors (A-E
         Liability) – Code 1.
         8.5.4.4.2. Missing from Specification. Self explanatory – Code 2.
         8.5.4.4.3. Bauamt Coordination Issue. Because the Bauamt may assume the role of
         a general contractor for Trade Lot contracts (Reference paragraph 8.2.2 regarding
         USAFE policy on trade contracts), there may be changes directly attributed to a lack
         of properly coordinating work – Code 3.
         8.5.4.4.4. User Requested Change. Self explanatory – Code 4.
         8.5.4.4.5. Differing Site Condition. Subsurface or other latent physical conditions
         at the site which differ materially from those indicated in the contract or unknown,
         unusual physical conditions at the site which differ materially from those ordinarily
         encountered and generally recognized as inhering in work of the character provided
         for in the contract – Code 5.
         8.5.4.4.6. Variation in Estimated Quantities. A change order submitted by the
         Bauamt to balance line item quantity overruns/underruns. These may also be used to
         adjust specific line item quantities in the original contract – Code 6.
         8.5.4.4.7. Value Engineering Change. A change Order that results in reducing the
         contract price or estimated cost without impairing essential functions or
         characteristics – Code 7.
         8.5.4.4.8. Administrative Change. A change Order that does not affect substantive
         rights of the parties (e.g., a change in paying office, appropriation data,
         contractor/Bauamt address, funding change, etc.). The change must be for no cost
         and no time extension – Code 8.
         8.5.4.4.9. Miscellaneous Change. A change not fitting other categories – Code 9.
     8.5.4.5. Initial liability recommendation from the following categories:
         8.5.4.5.1. Accept responsibility and agree to settled amount – Code G.
         8.5.4.5.2. Accept responsibility, but dispute costs – Code Y.
         8.5.4.5.3. Deny responsibility and review for possible third party claim – Code R.
 44                                                             USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


           8.5.4.5.4. Defer decision for legal and contracting review – Code Z.
           8.5.4.5.5. Variation in estimated quantities greater than or equal to 10% needing
           validation/quantity take-offs – Code O.
           8.5.4.5.6. Design omission and U.S. obligation because the U.S. would have paid if it
           had been included in the original contract – Code L.
       8.5.4.6. Date received, approved and sent to the Bauamt.
   8.5.5. Project Cost Control. Project Managers will also maintain a spreadsheet to track
   contingencies available on the project to assure statutory or regulatory funding violations do
   not occur. Coordination should be made among the Project Delivery Team (PDT) members
   at the start of the project to confirm the award amount, the program amount, contingencies
   available for changes, Design During Construction (DDC), any additional services that may
   be required and fee rates (Bauamt fees), that may be funded from available contingencies. If
   it appears additional funds will be required, the PM coordinates a request for funds.
   8.5.6. Procedure for Unilateral Changes. Every effort will be made to reach agreement
   with the Bauamt on the price and time adjustment before change order work proceeds. If an
   agreement cannot be reached and it is necessary to proceed, the contracting officer will issue
   a written order to the Bauamt stipulating that the contract price (and additional time, if any)
   will be adjusted in the amount of the Government's Estimate. Unilateral Changes are only
   employed on Direct procedure contracts and only when timely conclusion of a negotiated
   settlement is not possible or there is a delinquent proposal for the proposed work. Unilateral
   changes may not be used under the Indirect procedure.
8.6. Payments for Variations in Estimated Quantities. Construction contracts in Germany
rely extensively on line item estimated quantities. In certain circumstances where the overruns
included in a contractor‘s invoice are offset by underruns in other line items and current
authorization, the PM can recommend their designated and appointed Certifying Officer make
payments on the invoice. It is not necessary to deobligate funds due to underruns prior to fiscal
contract completion since these underruns may be offset by overruns on other line items. When
current contract value is projected to be exceeded by a preponderance of overruns, a
modification must be issued by the Bauamt prior to commencement of the work.
   8.6.1. Order of Precedence. Specifications are written instructions concerning project
   requirements. Drawings show and visually describe what is to be built, with the
   specifications describing how the project shall be constructed and the ending results.
   Anything mentioned in the technical specifications and not shown on the drawings, or shown
   on the drawings and not mentioned in the technical specifications, shall not have the like
   effect as if shown or mentioned in both. When there are inconsistencies between drawings
   and specifications, the specifications should be followed; however, court decisions in
   Germany have stated that on a case by case basis, the more detailed document governs.
   Reference VOB Part B, Section 1.2, in the event of inconsistencies in the contract. Its
   separate parts shall take precedence in the following order:
       8.6.1.1. The specification.
       8.6.1.2. The special conditions of the contract.
       8.6.1.3. Any supplementary conditions if the contract.
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    45


       8.6.1.4. Any supplementary technical specifications.
       8.6.1.5. The general technical specifications for construction contracts (DIN 18299).
       8.6.1.6. The general conditions of the contract relating to the execution of construction
       work (VOB).
   8.6.2. The principles and procedures described in paragraph 4.6 for Direct procedure
   contracts are valid for Indirect procedure projects, except that the Bauamt exercises contract
   administration through the VOB Part B, Section 2.3. At the start of the project and in
   conjunction with the Bauamt, the PM shall establish a reliable exchange of quantity
   measurements and tabulations of overruns/underruns to ensure that the overall project
   amount is not exceeded. As the major phases of work are completed, finalization of those
   quantities is beneficial in working toward early resolution of final quantities and invoice
   amounts. The same payment restrictions for Indirect procedure projects apply to Direct
   procedure projects.
8.7. Invoice Payment. Timely invoice payment is vital to effective project management since
the performing contractor is due interest if an invoice is paid late. Indirect procedure projects
require payment within 30 German workdays (excludes Sundays and German Holidays), based
on the guidelines established by ABG-75. All work performed and properly presented (invoiced)
is transmitted from the Bauamt on an ABG Form 8. The Accountable Official (typically the PM)
most familiar with the work critically reviews in detail the project‘s partial payment invoices
received from Bauamt. The Accountable Officer then submits a memorandum documenting the
review and recommendation for payment, along with the invoice, to the Certifying Officer for
funds verification, certification and payment.
   8.7.1. The BCE shall thoroughly review the invoice to ensure that all work billed for was
   actually accomplished, in-place, acceptable and that all change orders included in the invoice
   have been submitted to, reviewed and approved by the contracting officer Payments are not
   authorized for change orders the contracting officer has not approved.
   8.7.2. In accordance with the VOB, line item overruns (exceedances) on an indirect unit
   priced contract should be included for payment when all of the following conditions are met:
       8.7.2.1. The work is performed and the overrun is not the result of a pending change
       order (unapproved ABG Form 5 or 5A) to the contract.
       8.7.2.2. There is a specific unit price item for the work involved and the current
       authorization and funds are not exceeded (current contract value)
       8.7.2.3. If the overruns included in the contractor‘s invoice are offset by underruns in
       other contracted items and current authorization and funds are not exceeded, additional
       funding is not required. Under these circumstances, the BCE may recommend payment
       on the invoice. It is not necessary to deobligate funds due to underruns prior to fiscal
       current contract completion since these underruns may be offset by overruns in other line
       items. When the current contract value is projected to be exceeded by a preponderance of
       overruns, a modification should be issued by the Bauamt prior to commencement of the
       work.
8.8. Project Acceptance and Turnover. Article 14, ABG-75 provides that the U.S. shall
accept completed facilities within 12 work days following notification by the Bauamt that the
 46                                                            USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


project is complete and offered to be handed over. The 12 work day period can be extended for
cogent reasons by the U.S. upon written justification. Project acceptance and turn-over is
preceded by a final joint inspection of the facility with results documented by the Bauamt on the
ABG Form 7. The BCE is responsible for coordinating final/partial turnover meetings with the
Bauamt and the User. Base PMs conduct final/partial turnover meetings accepting all or portions
of the completed project and identifying and ensuring correction of defects and deficiencies.
BCE personnel will prepare a deficiency/punch list for all items requiring corrective action,
including missing as-built drawings and operation and maintenance manuals.
   8.8.1. Construction Deficiencies. If discrepancies are found during the inspection, the BCE
   prepares a list of them and attaches it to the ABG Form 7. The Bauamt must explain under
   Part 5 of the form the remedial action planned to correct discrepancies. In case of major
   defects or deficiencies (rendered unacceptable or not suitable for use), the U.S. may refuse to
   accept a project. In these instances Part 3 of the ABG Form 7 form is completed with the
   reason for refusal documented in Part 4.
   8.8.2. Final Inspections. All final inspections will be attended by appropriate U.S.
   personnel designated by the BCE.
   8.8.3. Estimated Quantities. Most contracts written in Germany use estimated quantities
   and final measurements are taken by the contractor and verified by the Bauamt after final
   inspection, acceptance, turnover and all contract modifications have been signed. Approvals
   of the actual quantities used form the basis for the final ABG Form 8. Contractor
   falsification of project quantities constitutes a criminal offense in Germany. Therefore, this
   process often takes some time due to the serious consequences for providing inaccurate
   quantities.
8.9. Deliverables at Turnover. Article 7.7.1 of the Implementing Instructions to ABG-75,
requires certain items be delivered to the U.S. at project turnover or shortly thereafter. The
specific items are detailed in Section H of the German instruction entitled ―Directives for the
Accomplishment of Federal Construction‖ (Richtlinien fuer die Durchfuehrung von
Bauaufgaben des Bundes im Zustaendigkeitsbereich der Finanzbauverwaltung), known as the
RBBau. The BCE shall ensure that all items are turned over for projects under their
responsibility. Projects will not be financially closed until all items are delivered.
8.10. As-Built Drawings and Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Manuals. The U.S. Forces
are entitled to receive complete as-built drawings in both English and German 12 calendar days
prior to project turnover, if specifically requested. The contractor is also required to provide the
U.S. Forces with O&M manuals in both English and German at project turnover. For projects
with phased turnovers, the O&M manuals related to each phase shall be delivered by the Bauamt
to the BCE at turnover of that phase, with an ABG Form 7 prepared at the completion of each
phase.
8.11. Construction Costs Payments
   8.11.1. ABG Form 8-Construction Costs. The Bauamt will send an ABG Form 8 to a U.S.
   certifying officer for partial or final payment. The certifying officer ensures contractor
   invoices are reviewed and accepted by the GCA, the BCE or the MAJCOM Project Manager
   and the financial management office. The certifying officer signs the ABG Form 8 and
   submits it to accounting and finance within four (4) working days after receipt from the
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   47


  Bauamt. The ABG Form 8 package includes a transmittal letter to the FMO providing
  appropriate project information with instructions to the FMO to deobligate excess
  construction funds after final payment is made. Supervision and Administration (S&A)
  funds remain obligated in support of the final ABG Form 9. Reference paragraph 8.13 for
  additional comments for final payments. After payment, accounting and finance send the
  BCE one copy of SF 1034-Public Voucher for Purchases and Services. The certifying
  officer shall control funds and payments on the miscellaneous obligation document (AF
  Form 406-Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document). Project construction
  invoices are paid from construction funds.
  8.11.2. Receipt of Service Certification. For each invoice (ABG Forms 8 or 9) received,
  the BCE will certify receipt of services directly on the ABG Forms 8 or 9 by signing the
  lower right corner of the form. The DFAS will date stamp the invoice or related transmittal
  letter upon receipt of the certified invoice from the BCE. Upon completion of the work, the
  BCE submits a receiving report using DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving
  Report, to DFAS or the User if applicable for properly completed payment. SF 1034 is
  prepared by DFAS and shall be supported by the invoice (ABG Forms 8 or 9) and certified
  by the BCE.
  8.11.3. Payments for Invoiced Work. ABG-75 stipulates simply that U.S. Forces must pay
  any ABG Form 8 for construction work received. However, if the partial/final ABG Form 8
  includes pending construction deficiencies (listed on the ABG Form 7), in coordination with
  the Bauamt, the BCE can withhold sufficient funds to accomplish the repairs. The Bauamt
  shall suspense the contractor to correct the deficiencies. If after the second suspense the
  contractor has still failed to correct the deficiencies, the BCE can request the Bauamt hire an
  independent contractor to accomplish the work and pay the invoice from the withheld funds.
  8.11.4. Timeliness of Payments. Contracts executed by the Bauamt for U.S. funded
  construction projects provide for partial payments to be made to contractors within 30
  working days after receipt of the contractor‘s invoice by the Bauamt. The Implementing
  Instructions to the ABG-75 Agreement specify that the payments will be made to the
  Bundeskasse. The 30 working days are subdivided between the Bauamt and the U.S., with
  the Bauamt being given ten (10) working days to audit the invoice and submit it to the U.S.,
  the U.S. having 18 working days to review the invoice and execute payment to the
  Bundeskasse, in English, German Federal Cashiers Office. Finally, the Bauamt then has two
  (2) working days to transfer the payment to the contractor. Working days exclude Sundays
  and German holidays; Saturdays and American holidays are not excluded.
     8.11.4.1. Final Invoices. To ensure prudent fiscal close out, the BCE shall be familiar
     with final invoice timelines described below.
         8.11.4.1.1. Between the contractor and the Bauamt. According to VOB Part B §3,
         ―Unless otherwise agreed, the final invoice shall be submitted at the latest 12 working
         days after completion in the case of works which are due to be executed within not
         more than three months, this period being extended by six (6) days for each three (3)
         month increase of the period set for execution.‖ In VOB part B §4, ―If the contractor
         does not submit a verifiable invoice, although the client [Bauamt] has set him a
         reasonable term for doing so, then the client [Bauamt] may draw up the invoice
         himself at the expense of the contractor.‖ The BCE shall ensure the Bauamt holds the
 48                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


          contractor to these timelines. Below are two examples of how to calculate the time a
          contractor has to submit a final invoice.
              8.11.4.1.1.1. For a project/contract execution period of 12 months. The time
              required for the contractor to forward a final invoice to the Bauamt is 30 working
              days, calculated as follows: 12 days (for the first three (3) months contract period)
              plus (six (6) days times three (3)) (for the rest of the nine (9) months; nine (9)
              months divided by three (3) equals three (3)).
              8.11.4.1.1.2. For a project/contract execution period of 36 months. The time
              required for the contractor to forward a final invoice to the Bauamt is 78 working
              days, calculated as follows: 12 days (for the first three (3) months contract period)
              plus (six (6) days times 11) (for the rest of the 33 months; 33 months divided by
              three (3) equals 11).
          8.11.4.1.2. Between the Bauamt and the U.S. According to Article 25.3 of ABG-
          75, ―Not later than six months after the takeover of the completed construction works
          [ABG Form 7], the German authorities shall give the Forces detailed accounts which
          will be supplemented by the original copies of all paid bills.‖ Within these six (6)
          months, article 25.1.5.2 of ABG-75‘s Implementing Instructions gives the Bauamt 44
          working days to complete their audit and the U.S. up to 24 working days for their
          review and allocation of funds.
   8.11.5. Recording Payment Data. BCE approves payments to German vendors via the
   Bauamt according to the provisions on each ABG Form 3 as modified. Payments are
   normally made in Euro to the address stated on the invoice/receiving report (ABG Forms 8 or
   9). DFAS records the accountability and fund reporting transactions through IAPS
   (Integrated Accounts Payable System).
   8.11.6. Document Distribution. BCE furnishes a copy of each disbursement voucher to the
   office certifying the invoice for payment. The following distribution of ABG Form 8 is
   required: Copy to project folder; Copies 1, 4 and 5 to FMO; Copy 6 to BCE Financial
   Resources; Copy 7 to HQ USAFE/A7PC; and, Copies 3, 8, and 9 to the Bauamt.
8.12. ABG Form 9-Administrative Fee Payments:
   8.12.1. ABG Form 9 Form Processing. The ABG Form 9 should be processed in the same
   manner as the ABG Form 8, and within 4 working days after receipt of the invoice should be
   forwarded to FMO for payment. After payment, FMO sends a copy of SF 1034 to the BCE.
   BCE Financial Resources should use AF Form 406 to control funds and payments.
   8.12.2. Document Distribution. The following distribution for ABG Form 9 is required:
   Copy 2 to project folder; Copies 3 and 4 to OFD; Copies 1, 5, and 6 to FMO; and, Copy 7 to
   BCE Financial Resources (BCE makes copy).
   8.12.3. Cost Accounting. The BCE establishes procedures to maintain an accounting
   spread sheet for each type of funds in each project indicating available funds and payments
   made. Special attention should be given to NAF projects where the exchange rate fluctuates
   in order to ensure availability of funds.
   8.12.4. Request for Final Invoice. Within 14 working days after receipt of the final ABG
   Form 8, the BCE sends a letter to the Bauamt requesting it to initiate action for the final ABG
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                     49


   Form 9. The GCA initiates the final ABG Form 9 to forward to the BCE. The BCE
   forwards monthly follow-up letters to the Bauamt until the final ABG Form 9 is received.
8.13. Final Project Payment. For each project, there are two types of final payments submitted
to the U.S. Forces. Article 25.3 ABG-75, states ―not later than six months after the take-over of
the completed construction works, the German authorities shall give the Forces detailed
accounts.‖ Detailed accounts include the final ABG Form 8 and the final ABG Form 9.
   8.13.1. Final ABG Form 8. The final ABG Form 8 is submitted by the Bauamt after it has
   received and reviewed all construction costs associated with the project. However, if after
   three (3) months from construction completion the Bauamt has not provided the final ABG
   Form 8, the PM shall forward a letter to the Bauamt requesting status of the final ABG Form
   8 with monthly follow-ups until the final ABG Form 8 is received. Final payments should
   not be made for construction invoices (ABG Form 8) until all deficiencies noted on
   acceptance and turnover document (ABG Form 7) have been corrected. This includes
   providing O&M manuals and as-built drawings which should be listed on the ABG Form 7
   unless turned over with the document. Upon receipt of the final ABG Form 8 the program
   manager/accountable official instructs the FMO to de-obligate remaining construction funds.
   8.13.2. Final ABG Form 9. The final ABG Form 9 invoice is submitted by the Bauamt
   after they have evaluated all costs associated with the execution of the project (administrative
   fees, additional services, etc.). Upon receipt and review of the final ABG Form 9 by the
   BCE, an Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer instructs the FMO to pay the invoice bill if
   sufficient funds are available or to de-obligate remaining funds, if any, and close out the
   project. The final ABG Form 9 could result in the need for additional funds to cover the final
   cost of additional services. In this case additional funds will be required to process the ABG
   Form 9. If after six months from project completion the BCE has not received the final ABG
   Form 9, the final administrative fees should be estimated from review of the project records
   and discussions with the Bauamt project management authorities. If the existing S&A funds
   exceed the estimated amount, the BCE should direct the base FMO to de-obligate excess
   S&A funds via a transmittal letter. However, the BCE should continue taking aggressive
   actions with the Bauamt to obtain a final ABG Form 9. The BCE will document the basis for
   line item estimated quantity calculations in the project file.
   8.13.3. Invoices Submitted After Final Payment. Occasionally the Bauamt may submit an
   additional invoice for payment to the U.S. Forces after the U.S. Forces had received and paid
   a final invoice. When this occurs, the program manager/accountable official is responsible
   for reviewing the submittal for validity. The U.S. may be required to pay the additional
   invoice if the submittal is for services provided by the contractor or the Bauamt during the
   actual design and construction period of the project. Questions should be referred to HQ
   USAFE/A7PC.
8.14. Financial Close-out. VOB Part B, Section 14 explains the contractor‘s timing
requirement for a final invoice to the Bauamt. Projects physically complete and accepted by the
User, but not financially complete, pose a continuing problem. Reviews have found a significant
amount of funds can be tied up and idle for years.
   8.14.1. Legal Disputes. Contractual disputes between the Bauamt and its contractors are the
   prevailing reason for the delay of a true financial close-out of a construction project. Article
   44 of the SA to the NATO SOFA requires that the authorities of the force or of the civilian
 50                                                             USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   component shall be notified without delay of the lodging of a complaint and shall be
   consulted at all material stages of the proceedings. In the event of a dispute, AFCEE/CMT
   and the BCE shall ensure they request and maintain close cooperation with the FfE, namely
   the GBB, who handle all construction related legal disputes regarding U.S. projects executed
   under the Indirect procedure to ensure U.S. interests are best represented. Refer to the
   Administrative Agreement implementing Article 44 of the SA to the NATO SOFA regarding
   actual settlements. Regarding settlements finalized by a court, the U.S. will bear the costs,
   including attorney fees, incurred by the German authorities in connection with these lawsuits
   and in taking actions pertaining to the execution of judgments, decisions, orders, or
   settlements as a result of such lawsuits to the extent that they constitute necessary costs of
   attainment of justice (Rechtsverfolgung und Rechtsverteidigung) (Section 91, German Code
   of Civil Procedure) and provided that their payment can neither be demanded from, nor be
   enforced against, the other party, and provided, in the latter case, that the bill for expenditure
   incurred is accompanied by a statement confirming that collection efforts made have failed.
   8.14.2. U.S. Procedures. The BCE shall ensure procedures are established to financially
   closeout projects as quickly as possible. A letter requesting action to submit final ABG Form
   8s and final ABG Form 9s shall be sent monthly to the Bauamt listing projects remaining
   financially open six (6) months following acceptance of the facility via an ABG Form 7.
   USAFE has established a goal to fiscally close projects 15 months after the acceptance of the
   facility on an ABG Form 7. Timely financial closure of projects ensures unused construction
   funds do not expire and are available for MILCON reprogramming to other projects.
   Financial closure for the Air Force occurs when no obligated funds remain on the project
   account, no outstanding claims await judgment, and the DD Form 1354, Transfer and
   Acceptance of DoD Real Property, is signed by the BCE ??? and delivered to the BCE. By
   this definition, unexpended funds may remain on the project as obligated against known bills,
   even if final payment is pending.
8.15. Warranty Periods. The current VOB warranty period is four (4) years with inspections at
four (4) and 45 months. Warranty claims shall be pursued through the Bauamt. As part of the
turnover documentation, the Bauamt must provide a list of warranty items and their validity
periods. Three (3) months before the end of warranty period, a joint inspection will be held to
inspect the items under warranty. The BCE is responsible to notify the Bauamt of the date, time,
and place of the inspection. Inspection results are documented by the Bauamt in writing, with
copies provided for the project files.

                 CONJUNCTIVELY FUNDED NATO CONSTRUCTION

9.1. General. Conjunctive funding is defined as the expenditure of national funds (U.S.) for
NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) projects. Conjunctive funding provides funds for
those portions of projects which are U.S. unique requirements in excess of NATO standards, not
supported by NATO, and/or not eligible for NSIP funding. Conjunctive funded NATO projects
will be delivered through the Bauamt and will not be procured through Direct procedures. All
existing procedures within the ABG-75 process will be used by the U.S. Forces for execution of
conjunctively funded NATO projects.
9.2. Responsibilities.
   9.2.1. Host Nation. The host nation will design the entire project, including incorporating
   the conjunctive funded portion, prepare and award the contract and accomplish construction
   management.
   9.2.2. HQ USAFE/A7P. HQ USAFE/A7 oversees the implementation NSIP for USAFE.
   This includes coordinating program actions with the FMOD and NATO HQ as required.
   During construction, if issues arise regarding scope issues, HQ USAFE/A7P will assist the
   BCE in resolving the issue with the host nation and/or with NATO.
   9.2.3. BCE. For all NATO conjunctively funded projects, the BCE shall ensure preparation
   of any ABG Form 3s necessary for project execution. For the NATO portion, the BCE shall
   ensure funds are obligated to make up for any possible lost design involving projects that
   NATO may not support.

                                          Chapter 10

                 NONAPPROPRIATED FUNDS (NAF) CONSTRUCTION

10.1. General. Occasionally the U.S. Forces undertakes ABG-75 construction projects which
will be funded and paid for by a nonappropriated fund activity, e.g., Services, AAFES, etc.
Regulations, policies and program guidance for construction resourced by Nonappropriated
funds include AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming Nonappropriated Fund Facility
Construction Projects, AFI 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects,
Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1015.15, Table E4.T1, General Funding
Authorizations for NAFI Activities, DoDI 7700.20, Commissary Surcharge, Nonappropriated
Fund and Privately Financed Construction Policy, DoDI 7700.18, Commissary Surcharge,
Nonappropriated Fund and Privately Financed Construction Reporting Procedures, AFI 34-
209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting, and AFI 65-106,
Appropriated Fund Support of Moral, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund
Instrumentalities. Before such projects are undertaken by the BCE, the base and the NAF activity
must document the NAF agreement to fund and pay for the construction.
10.2. Recording Obligations. It is the responsibility of the NAF activity funding the project to
reserve funds and account for the obligation until payment is required. To ensure the funding
agreement clearly obligates the NAF to pay the full cost of the construction project or a portion
thereof, if the project includes a companion appropriated fund (APF) piece, the agreement shall,
at a minimum:
   10.2.1. Scope. Comprehensively outline the scope of the construction project. The
   MAJCOM Services scope change authorities are: two (2) percent for projects up to 10,000
   square feet (SF); 1.5 percent for projects above 10,000 SF up to 20,000 SF; and 1 percent for
   projects over 20,000 SF. AF Agency panel approval is required for scope increases beyond
   MAJCOM Services approval authority.
   10.2.2. Cost. Specify the anticipated cost of the project, including Bauamt administrative
   fees (5.6% for new construction and 7.5% for maintenance and repair) and foreign currency
   fluctuation. The BCE and the Indirect ABG-75 contracting officer will ensure that contracts
   are not awarded at a cost exceeding those listed in the agreement. However, the agreement
   must specify that the NAF activity is responsible for cost increases authorized by ABG-75
   and for absorbing any cost associated with foreign currency fluctuation. Any U.S. Dollar
   portion of a project shall be separately stated in the agreement. MAJCOM cost change
   authority is up to 10% of the approved amount or $50K, whichever is greater. Cost increases
   that exceed project programmed funding are paid with MAJCOM/base funds. AF
   Nonappropriated Fund Panel approval is required for cost increases beyond MAJCOM
   approval authority. Any cost increases of 25% or scope changes of 10% plus/minus require
   approval by Higher Headquarters (HHQ) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) with a
   Congressional re-report.
       10.2.2.1. Funds Programming. NAF funding approval amounts and funds allocation
       are per a DD Form 1391. It is critical that the cost estimates on the DD 1391 section 9
       are accurate and all inclusive.           Estimates should, at minimum, include
       Construction/Repair cost (EEIC 52900/52200) with breakout for contingency, AT/FP,
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   53


       environmental, HVAC and landscaping (as applicable). They must also include Design,
       Additional (secondary) Services for design and construction phases (Reference
       paragraphs 6.2.1.2.1 and 6.2.1.2.2), S&A and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment
       (FF&E) estimates. The BCE shall use the NAE schedule (Attachment 7) when
       computing Bauamt 5.6 percent / 7.5 percent administrative fees, i.e., 5.6 percent (new
       construction) or 7.5 percent (maintenance and repair) which attributes 45 percent of the
       fees to S&A and the remaining 55 percent to Design. Additional services should be
       based on historical averages, taking into consideration known requirements, such as soil
       testing, surveys, re-forestation fees, etc. (Reference paragraph 6.2.1.2). Unfunded costs,
       such as Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF&E) and Intrusion Detection System
       (IDS), shall be noted on the DD Form 1391.
   10.2.3. Funds Obligations/Invoicing. The BCE will provide funds obligation and invoice
   payment requests with DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, to the NAF
   activity at the address listed on the agreement. The NAF activity will process electronic
   funds transfer to the Bundeskasse on invoices (ABG Forms 8 or 9) certified by the BCE
   within five (5) working days after receipt of the certified invoice. Working days for this
   purpose exclude Sundays and German holidays, but include Saturdays and American
   holidays.
   10.2.4. Signature. The agreement shall be reviewed and signed by the BCE and the NAF
   Certifying Official authorized to obligate NAF project funds.
10.3. Construction Orders and Modifications. The BCE executes the necessary requests,
approvals, and obligation documents subsequent to receiving the funding agreement. The NAF
activity funding the project shall be cited on ABG Forms 3, 4, 5A, and 6 in the blocks reserved
for ―Forces Internal Accounting Data/Fuer interne Buchungszwecke der Streitkraefte.‖ The BCE
shall submit a copy of each ABG form executed to the NAF activity for final approval and funds
obligation. The BCE shall maintain a detailed listing of changes IAW Chapter 8.5 of this
instruction. The BCE shall provide the modification tracking document to the NAF activity
monthly via electronic transmission. Funds management will record contract amounts.
10.4. Invoices. The Bauamt submits invoices (ABG Forms 8 and 9) directly to the BCE. The
BCE is required to validate each invoice, certify it for payment, and deliver it, along with DD
Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, to the NAF activity designated in the
funding agreement within seven (7) working days. A transmittal letter should accompany the
certified invoices requesting payment directly to the Bundeskasse (German Federal Bank)
account cited in the invoice within five (5) working days. If an invoice contains non-RPIE (real
property installed equipment), the BCE should flag the invoice as such or include the breakout
amount for the non-RPIE portion to ensure the amount is accurately expensed against equipment
and excluded from the real property records and the Congressional reportable amount.
10.5. Project Management Plan. The BCE shall work with and provide a PMP for project
oversight/execution to the NAF activity no later than contract award, IAW Chapter 5.4 of this
instruction. The BCE will provide the NAF activity a project execution timeline with a
milestone completion schedule.
 54                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


                                          Chapter 11

                                 MISCELANEOUS ISSUES

11.1. Construction Projects for Other DoD Agencies. USAFE may perform construction
work for other DoD agencies from time to time. The requesting agency forwards a DD Form
448-Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) to the local BCE tasked to perform
the work. The MIPR references the fund certification of the requesting agency. The BCE will
acknowledge acceptance of the MIPR by means of DD Form 448-2-Acceptance of MIPR. The
BCE also prepares a manual AF Form 9 from the information provided for forwarding to HQ
USAFE/A7P and requests the Bauamt to award the project based upon receipt of the AF Form 9.
11.2. Requirements and Management Plan (RAMP). AFI 32-1023 mandates the use of
RAMPs for MILCON projects to fully document User and base requirements and to guide the
design and construction process. The RAMP is intended to fully communicate facility needs to
the Design Agent/Construction Agent (DA/CA) early in the design process to ensure MILCON
design goals and milestones are achieved.
   11.2.1. Composition. RAMPs consist of two components: a Requirements Document (RD)
   and a Project Management Plan (PMP). Projects should be closely managed by the PM in
   accordance with the RAMP, as careful planning is always the key to successful execution.
   The RAMP is the fundamental document presenting the concept for project execution. It
   addresses such topics as contracting strategy, processing User-requested changes, meetings,
   status reporting, key Project Delivery Team (PDT) membership, and roles and
   responsibilities. The RAMP is developed and maintained by the BCE with a level of detail
   appropriate to the size and complexity of the project. Guide RAMPs from previous USAFE
   projects are available as reference templates. A RAMP checklist is provided at Appendix 1
   of the USAF Project Manager‘s Guide for Design and Construction.
   11.2.2. Requirements Document (RD). The purpose of the RD is to provide designers a
   thorough basis for understanding the User‘s functional and technical requirements. Active
   participation of the User as a member of the PDT through all phases of design and
   construction is vital to ensure the facility satisfies all mission requirements. The RD must
   accurately define the project scope and the facility and site requirements to ensure a complete
   and accurate DD 1391. Typical RD table of contents include following major topics:
       11.2.2.1. Project Description (narrative and space requirements, user equipment, special
       requirements)
       11.2.2.2. Area Development Plan (facility siting and compatibilities)
       11.2.2.3. Environmental Considerations
       11.2.2.4. Requirements Document Agreement
       11.2.2.5. Attachments—DD Form 1391; maps, plans and special studies; sketches and
       photos; design guide references and design standards
   11.2.3. Summary. The RAMP identifies all aspects of the scope of MILCON projects. It
   also establishes a management plan to carry out a project. When fully developed, the RAMP
   becomes a teaming agreement between the Air Force and the Design and Construction
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   55


   Agent. Formalizing the relationship between all Air Force participants and the DA/CA adds
   discipline to the design and construction process. A comprehensive RAMP for any project
   can generated only through full and open discussion between the USAFE or base PM and the
   User.
11.3. Construction Quality Assurance. Members of the Project Delivery Team (PDT) should
become familiar with the project Quality Assurance Plan and, for Direct projects, the
Contractor's Quality Control plan. The Project Manager shall consistently stress the importance
of effective inspection, the key to quality construction requiring technical knowledge, tact and
sound judgment. The PM reinforces a climate of fair and reasonable cooperation, ensuring
inspections and site visits serve to check adherence of the work to the contract plans and
specifications.
   11.3.1. Three-Phase Inspection Process. The principles of the three-phase inspection
   system (Preliminary, Initial and Final) shall be employed by the BCE on Indirect procedure
   projects. The three-phase inspection system, starting at the inception of each phase of work,
   is particularly effective in preventing minor deficiencies from magnifying as the work
   progresses. The PM ensures the contractor maintains an adequate inspection system and
   performs inspections as necessary to fully comply with contract requirements. For Direct
   procedure projects, the PM ensures the contractor is held responsible for fully complying
   with the Quality Control plan and ensures proper records are kept of the contractor's
   inspection coverage.
   11.3.2. Indirect Procedure Projects. For Indirect contracts, the Bauamt may not have an
   organized Quality Control Program other than the testing required by the VOB. The PM
   shall make every effort to ensure the contractor provides reports in pace with the progress of
   construction. The PM should become familiar with these VOB requirements, which are
   similar to those required by Direct procedure projects. In order to assist QA efforts on
   Indirect projects, the PM should prepare a QA plan to identify critical features of the work
   requiring U.S. review and inspection. The plan should be tailored to the project and reflect
   the methods, techniques and practices to utilize in ensuring delivering a quality product.
   Critical features of the plan include those materials or items of equipment representing
   special requirements of the User which must be met for the project to be usable. The PM
   advises the Bauamt representative and informs him when work is not being performed by the
   contractor in accordance with the terms of the contract, and documents deficiencies in daily
   reports with photos and corrective actions taken.
   11.3.3. Direct Procedure Projects. For Direct contracts, the PM advises the contractor's
   Quality Control Manager of identified deficiencies and necessary corrections to the QC
   process.
11.4. Project Communications. Communications within the Project Delivery Team and key
stakeholders are essential to project success. The Project Manager coordinates with the local
BCE and the User as often as necessary to provide updates of the status of the project. Such
matters as road closings, gate closings or scheduled utility outages require careful coordination
between various base organizations. The PM ensures the Bauamt/contractor will not commence
this type of work without proper coordination and approval of the BCE. The BCE shall have
detailed plans and schedules in place that may be necessary in order to have a smooth transition
between power outages.
56                                                           USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


  11.4.1. Importance of Formal Communications. The protocol of regularly scheduled
  coordination meetings generally holds greater contractual authority with most Germans than
  is typically the case with Americans. This situation makes it vitally important that meeting
  minutes be carefully reviewed and with a mutual understanding between the Bauamt and
  BCE to ensure that information is accurate and acceptable as recorded. Meeting minutes
  frequently serve as the parties‘ means to ―provide notice‖ to each other, when the more
  common American business practice is to present notice via separate signed correspondence
  or formal change order documentation. Project managers must be aware that what one party
  may regard as notice, unless challenged, may be interpreted as acknowledgement or
  acceptance and may result in the commitment of project funds. Language and cultural
  barriers within the Project Delivery Team compound the problem of differences in contract
  interpretations and construction practices.
  11.4.2. Protocol Meetings. It is customary in Germany for key parties to attend protocol
  meetings, normally held weekly. The purpose of these meetings is to monitor project
  progress, and discuss problems and find solutions. The BCE shall ensure the proceedings are
  recorded in meeting minutes by the Bauamt for Indirect projects and BCE staff for Direct
  projects. Minutes are maintained with corrections noted at the next meeting. Protocol
  minutes may become legal documents, so it is imperative the minutes accurately detail the
  items discussed and the decisions made. The following topics should be discussed:
     11.4.2.1. Previous problems still requiring decision.
     11.4.2.2. Future conflicts or potential problems. (Use of contractor generated ‗Requests
     for Information‘ is encouraged).
     11.4.2.3. The work scheduled for the following week and month.
     11.4.2.4. The status of technical submittals.
     11.4.2.5. The status of change orders.
     11.4.2.6. Quality Assurance issues.
     11.4.2.7. Project safety.
  11.4.4. Executive Review Meetings. The BCE shall conduct line item reviews of all
  current projects on the base with the Bauamt counterpart once every four months. Special
  attention should be given to sensitive, complex, or critical projects.
  11.4.5. Customer Concept Document (CCD). The CCD is an extension of the DD 1391
  program and the key to effective pre-design MILCON planning and project risk mitigation.
  The document provides a bridge between the DD 1391 and 35% design stages and, as an
  established business practice, produces demonstrated successful results. Typically completed
  two to four years in advance of the year of execution, the O&M funded document ensures the
  project fully supports Command mission requirements. The KVM-Bau is essentially the
  equivalent of the CCD, and addresses difficult planning issues early in project development
  and refines the Requirements Definition supporting the ―official 1391‖. HQ USAFE/A7P
  policy encourages the use of pre-planning documentation to achieve Commander and User
  endorsement of the design solution and as a means to reduce changes, thereby controlling
  cost and schedule growth. CCDs provide added value by: a) reviewing and confirming
  planning considerations identified in the RAMP, b) documenting results of design charrette
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                      57


   meetings with functionals and Users, c) identifying Value Engineering opportunities, d)
   outlining sustainable development and AT/FP criteria, and e) identifying key milestones for
   new mission projects.
11.5. Project Safety. Project safety is generally a Host Nation responsibility, with U.S. Forces
supplementing that effort by bringing deficiencies to the attention Bauamt when observed, and
encouraging visits by the State Safety Inspection Office. Job safety is of prime importance and
the enforcement of safety is everyone‘s responsibility. Safety requirements for U.S. construction
in the Republic of Germany are based on both German and U.S. regulations, with the most
stringent regulations taking precedence. On Direct contracts, the contractor will submit a Safety
Plan for review by the Project Manager. Safety shall be addressed at the pre-construction
meeting and routinely at the job-site. Should immediate danger to life exist, the senior U.S.
representative on site has the authority to immediately stop the work in that particular area. All
accidents should be immediately reported through the chain of command. Unsafe acts or safety
violations on Indirect projects should be brought to the immediate attention of the responsible
Bauamt by the BCE.
   11.5.1. State Safety Inspection Office. The State Safety Inspection Office (Bau-
   Berufsgenossenschaft or BBG) is available to conduct safety audits of work sites. The BCE
   should request the BBG to visit the site early in construction and revisit it again as necessary,
   but at least quarterly. The major safety agencies have the authority to fine personnel for
   safety regulation violations.
11.6. Project Close Out (Red Zone). Provides background and current requirements for timely
construction project completion and financial close out.
   11.6.1. Background Discussion. The ―Red Zone‖ concept for project close-out receives
   wide acceptance across the Air Force and Corps of Engineers as a recognized business
   practice. The goal of the Red Zone meeting is to construct a milestone activities schedule to
   reach project completion and closeout within 120 calendar days of beneficial occupancy.
   The Construction Agent PM co-chairs the Red Zone meeting with the USAFE or base PM
   with the full PDT. The meeting‘s purpose is to direct discussion of project elements and
   reach consensus on remaining project activities. Red Zone team members identify remaining
   tasks, assign action item champions, and construct a milestone schedule for achieving project
   completion and financial closeout.
   11.6.3. Process. Project closeout is a function involving the entire PDT and all interested
   stakeholders. The strategy for final project completion should be addressed in the Project
   Management Plan. A ―Red Zone‖ meeting is held at the base 60-90 calendar days prior to
   BOD to coordinate actions and define responsibilities and includes the Construction Agent
   PM, the USAFE or base PM, the BCE, the supporting agency (Communications, Security
   Force, Environmental, Safety, Airfield Management), the customer, and the construction
   contractor representatives. At the initial briefing, the PDT fills in the gaps in the agenda
   milestone slides. This approach brings all shareholders on-board to control mission creep on
   project requirements and to impose a measured discipline to the process. The process
   supports partnering and facilitates the working relationship of the construction contractor
   with the entire PDT.
   11.6.4. Summary. Project completion and closeout has not traditionally received the same
   level of interest as project start-up. Formalizing the Red Zone project closeout process
 58                                                            USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


   strengthens team commitment and enhances communication, defining the path to successful
   project completion and customer satisfaction. An ―execution charrette‖ approach instills
   discipline into an otherwise haphazard process. The Red Zone is business practice that
   results in clear understanding of work required for completion, while fostering strong
   teamwork and commitment.
11.7. Project Deferrals and Cancellations. The following USAFE policies for deferred
design, design terminations, and project cancellations have been established. The BCE is
responsible for the settlement of all fees to the Bauamt. When a project is cancelled, the most
current information addressing the price will be used in determination of the final payment for
administrative fees (e.g., the HU-Bau, the AFU-Bau, the low bid, etc.).
   11.7.1. Deferred Designs. Deferred designs are those receiving notification directives to
   stop current action during the design or tender cycle. After the expiration of 12 months,
   partial invoices are honored by the BCE from the Bauamt to cover ―proportionate‖ costs for
   administrative fees. If the BCE receives the notification of design deferral between major
   milestones, the design is carried out to the next major milestone before ordering a work stop.
   If the BCE is subsequently given the directive to proceed with the design, additional costs
   may be incurred to start work, depending on the length of time since the design deferral or
   other factors. Additional costs are referred to as ―lost design effort.‖ The total design fee to
   be paid is a negotiated amount between the U.S. and the Bauamt.
   11.7.2. Design Termination. The BCE‘s decision on whether to terminate design
   immediately or to wait until the completion of the next design milestone is dependent on
   whether the design is being prepared by the Bauamt in-house or whether it is being prepared
   by an A-E. If the design is being prepared by an A-E, a stop work order is issued by the BCE
   immediately upon receipt of the notification. If the design is being prepared in-house by the
   Bauamt, the BCE will allow the Bauamt to proceed to the next milestone. If the design is
   cancelled when it is being prepared by the Bauamt, fees payable are based on ―proportionate‖
   costs. If the design is cancelled when it is being prepared by an A-E, fees will amount to the
   actual costs (Ist-Kosten) of the A-E, not to exceed 5.0% or 7.0%, depending upon the value
   of the project, plus 0.6% or 0.5%, respectively, if translation services are involved, plus the
   actual cost of the additional services.
   11.7.3. Project Cancellation. Cancelled construction projects are those terminated after the
   BCE has issued construction Notice to Proceed. The method of determining fees payable to
   the Bauamt in these cases is described in Article 24.1.2 and Article 24.2, ABG-75, and in the
   respective sections in the ABG-75 Implementing Instructions.
11.8. Project Folders. Good project documentation is essential and should be given priority in
the daily actions associated with each project. The project folder provides up to date facts on the
project. The folder‘s first function is to display the project‘s vital signs–quality, schedule, and
cost- at all phases of development and execution. The folder organizes the enormous amount of
detail associated with projects. The ABG-75 documents and supporting information, to include
planning, programming, design, contracting, construction and financial management, shall all be
addressed in the project folder.
   11.8.1. Folder Contents. Each project shall have a central, readily acceptable folder
   containing all key documents. The total project documentation may be located in several

                                        ABG-75 FORMS

A3.1. Below is a complete list and general description of the purpose of the forms used within
ABG-75.      ABG-75 forms are maintained and available on the German Ministry of
Transportation, Construction, and Urban Development‘s website at www.abg-
plus.de/abg2/ebuecher/abg_us/downloadber.htm for downloading.
A3.2. Refer to the latest ABG-75 flow charts detailing the numbers of copies and steps needed
for approval. Formal flow charts associated with the ABG-75 forms are found at www.abg-
plus.de/abg2/ebuecher/abg_us/Anlage2-Abl.htm.
A3.3. ABG Form 1 (Program of Construction Projects for the U.S. Forces)—Annual
submittal to the FRG of the USAFE expected construction program forecasted for the next two
fiscal years. This form is used by the German government to adjust its resources to accomplish
U.S. Forces work. The form also provides the German government a notice on the proposed
method of design and construction (e.g. Indirect or Direct procedure). This form is just a
planning document and not a construction commitment. U.S. Forces generated form.
A3.4. ABG Form 2 (Letter of Intent for Direct Procedure)—Reference ABG-75 Article 27
and Protocol of Signature to ABG-75 Article 27 Paragraph 2 for instances where the U.S. are
authorized to and can request to execute construction with own forces and/or contracts. U.S.
Forces generated form.
A3.5. ABG Form 3 (Intergovernmental Construction Order)—Also titled the
Request/Approval/Award Document under ABG-75. This document is used to order and approve
design and construction services from the German Government. Depending on the cost, this is
sent to the German Government by the BCE, AFCEE and/or Corps of Engineers Europe District
(EUD) to request or approve initiation, continuation, modification, addition, stop and cancelation
of design, obligation, deobligation of funds and authority to advertise of a construction contract
or project according to the Indirect procedure. With this ABG Form 3, funds are initially
obligated to begin design. U.S. funds are placed in a UOO status. This document can also
obligate all construction funds on an estimated basis only with approval of the USAFE Civil
Engineer. U.S. Forces generated form.
A3.6. ABG Form 4 (Tender Acceptance Form)—This form is sent to the U.S. after the
Bauamt has completed their bidding process and contains the Bauamt recommendation for award
to a specific contractor, normally the low responsive bidder. Funds are formally obligated
against the specific amount of this main contract. Bauamt generated form.
A3.7. ABG Form 5 (Change Order Document)—This form is used for change orders and
when countersigned by the U.S. constitutes modifications to the main contract (ABG Form 4
amount) and generally requires additional funds to be added to existing contracts. Bauamt
generated form.
A3.8. ABG Form 5A (U.S. Forces Change Request)—This form is submitted by the U.S. to
the GCA. These are changes resulting from conditions differing from the original design (e.g.
new federal regulation, code, criteria, mission changes or enhancement).        Normally also
requested from the user relating to ease of maintainability, operability or an enhancement of
quality of life for customers. U.S. Forces generated form.

A3.9. ABG Form 6 (Order Document for Term Construction)—Order document used by
BCE‘s, AFCEE and COE to instruct a firm to carry out construction work in accordance with
this term contract. These contracts held by the GCA are similar to what USAFE considers
SABER. Generally small dollar items and rarely used on U.S. Indirect projects. U.S. Forces
generated form.
A3.10. ABG Form 7 (Joint Minutes - Turnover of Construction Work)—This is the
turnover of construction work to the U.S. by the Bauamt. Form is used to formally document the
minutes of the turnover and includes defects and deficiencies noted with corrective action at the
time of turnover. Bauamt generated form.
A3.11. ABG Form 7B (Record of the joint final inspection of construction work executed
by the U.S.-Forces using the Direct Procedure)—After completion of construction works
executed by the U.S. Forces under the Direct procedure, BCE initiates a final inspection with
representatives of the Bauamt, Bundesanstalt für Immobilienaufgaben (BImA) (Federal Institute
for Real Estate Management) and the U.S. Forces. Bauamt generated form.
A3.12. ABG Form 8 (Construction Costs)—Contractors Invoice. Throughout project there
are partial and eventually a final Invoices. This document is only attesting to the fact that all
services were received and rendered. This is accompanied by an itemized line item invoice.
Bauamt generated form.
A3.13. ABG Form 9 (Administrative Fee)—Bauamt invoice. Throughout project there are
partial and eventually a final ABG 9. This is the final invoice used to pay compensation to the
Bauamt for their services at 5.6% (New Construction) / 7.5% (Maintenance and Repair) plus any
additional services incurred on project (e.g. A-E expenses such as site surveys, model renderings,
doc reproductions, etc.). Bauamt generated form.

                                         Attachment 4
       PROS AND CONS OF USING INDIRECT AND DIRECT CONSTRUCTION

A4.1. Indirect Procedure (Art 2. 1).
   A4.1.1. Advantages:
       A4.1.1.1. Funds can be obligated rapidly (e.g., Estimated Basis Contract)
       A4.1.1.2. Host Nation (HN) fees significantly lower than similar services contracted
       directly (Additional services exempt from HN fees)
       A4.1.1.3. Smoother public coordination
       A4.1.1.4. Bauamt generally has better knowledge of German technical norms,
       regulations and construction practices
   A4.1.2. Disadvantages:
       A4.1.2.1. Actual execution of design and construction is usually slower than the Direct
       procedure
       A4.1.2.2. HN contracting practices are generally inflexible, time consuming; innovative
       techniques are not well developed; Design-Build is seldom an option
       A4.1.2.3. Typically awards are made to low bidders
       A4.1.2.4. Less control of costs and schedule than on direct contracts
       A4.1.2.5. Frequent use of unit price contracts requiring intensive oversight and scrutiny
       of invoices
       A4.1.2.6. Potential late or ―after the fact‖ notification of changes impacting cost or time
       A4.1.2.7. Contracts and regulations, as well as most meetings, are in German. Majority
       of U.S. employees are not fluent in German
       A4.1.2.8. Performance guarantees are rarely accessed to remedy defective performance
       A4.1.2.9. Liquidated damages are difficult to obtain and enforce
       A4.1.2.10. Must have active U.S. oversight to ensure control of quality, cost and
       schedule
A4.2. Direct Procedure (Art 2.2).
   A4.2.1. Advantages:
       A4.2.1.1. U.S. controls design, tender and construction processes
       A4.2.1.2. Wider use of ―risk to contractor‖ methods of contracting (e.g., design/build,
       lump sum)
       A4.2.1.3. Best value procedures ensure award to quality contractors
       A4.2.1.4. Use of faster and more innovative contracting techniques (e.g., SABER,
       Multiple Award task order contracting)
       A4.2.1.5. Contract documentation and correspondence in English
70                                                         USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011


     A4.2.1.6. Contracts executed under U.S. Law are more favorable to the U.S. (e.g.,
     remedies for latent defects, claims, etc.)
     A4.2.1.7. Disputes settled in U.S. administrative boards and courts
  A4.2.2. Disadvantages:
     A4.2.2.1. Increased U.S. contracting and engineering staffing levels
     A4.2.2.2. Typically higher costs for design and construction oversight
     A4.2.2.3. More effort to obtain permits and/or make notification and process could take
     longer
USAFEI32-1016 15 APRIL 2011                                                                   71
