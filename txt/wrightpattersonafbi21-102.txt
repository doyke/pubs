provides the basic procedures to be followed for the physical aircraft recovery/removal of
crash/disabled aircraft after all initial response events, including response to hydrazine spills,
have been accomplished in accordance with WPAFB Comprehensive Emergency Management
Plan (CEMP 10-2) and AFMAN 32-4004, Chapter 2, Emergency Response Operations. Send

1. GENERAL.
   1.1. The Logistics Readiness Division (88 MSG/LGR) in the 88th Mission Support Group
   (88 MSG) will maintain a CDDAR capability and provide a CDDAR Team Chief (TC) for
   transient aircraft, (if not provided by owning MAJCOM) or a Crash Recovery Representative
   (CRR), if a Team Chief is provided by owning MAJCOM, from the Transient Maintenance
   Section (LGRM). The LGR Team Chief or CRR will act as liaison with tenant/MAJCOM

    units and facilitate the use of 88 ABW assets in the recovery of their aircraft. The LGR
    Transient Maintenance Section will be responsible for maintaining a generic aircraft recovery
    capability. This capability will consist of a crash recovery team equipped with generic
    aircraft recovery equipment. If recovery efforts for tenant/transient aircraft exceed the
    capabilities of the 88 ABW, the TC will contact the aircraft’s home base and/or
    TACC/XOCL (in accordance with AMCI 21-108, Logistics Support Operations, for AMC
    aircraft) for assistance.
    1.2. The CDDAR Program is established to recover damaged and disabled aircraft in
    minimum time and be consistent with the following considerations:
       1.2.1. The requirement to reopen the runway for operational use.
       1.2.2. Preservation of evidence for accident/safety investigation.
       1.2.3. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
       1.2.4. Safety of CDDAR and all initial response personnel involved with recovery
       operations.
    1.3. Physical aircraft removal procedures will not be implemented until approved by the
    Incident Commander (IC) with concurrence of the Safety Investigation Board (SIB)
    president. For circumstances requiring immediate aircraft removal, coordinate with Interim
    Safety Board (ISB) president to receive approval from the Convening Authority. CDDAR
    teams are considered Follow-On Elements under the AF Incident Management System.
    1.4. Aircraft Support Equipment (e.g., aircraft tugs and aerospace ground equipment) are
    available through LGR’s Transient Maintenance Section. Crane, bulldozer, backhoe, dump
    truck and front-end loader capabilities are available from Civil Engineering. Fill rock or
    gravel, plywood, and shoring lumber are available on base or through a local off-base
    contractor.
    1.5. The Logistics Readiness Division (LGR) has refuel and defuel capabilities for all base
    assets. The Fire Department and 88 ABW/CEV Spill Response Team have fuel-spill
    capabilities.
WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause serious
injury or death to those in contact. Transient aircraft home bases should be contacted to
determine composite and depleted uranium material risks and any requirement for personal
protective equipment prior to commencement of clean-up activities.
CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will only be disturbed as required to eliminate an
imminently dangerous situation to the aircraft, support equipment and/or personnel, and will
remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released by the SIB President, per AFI 91-204,
to the IC.

3. RECOVERY OPERATIONS.
   3.1. The IC must ensure the security and preservation of any evidence and wreckage through
   coordination with the SIB president.
   3.2. Before beginning the recovery, the IC must obtain approval from Security Forces, EOD,
   Bio-Environmental Engineering (BEE), and the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) and
   identify any real or potential hazards to recovery personnel.
   3.3. The following factors should be considered to determine how great the need is for rapid
   recovery.
       3.3.1. Availability of alternate runways/taxiways.
       3.3.2. Availability of alternate airports.
       3.3.3. Position of disabled aircraft relative to aircraft movement areas.

       3.3.5. Military alert commitments.
       3.3.6. Adequacy of MISHAP scene photography and SIB to preserve evidence.
4. SITUATION EVALUATION. NOTE: The first task at a recovery site is to gather
information and evaluate the situation. The initial response team will be able to gather much of
this data and initiate requests for additional information from appropriate sources.
   4.1. Gather all necessary information and use to accomplish risk assessment, using
   Operational Risk Management (ORM).
NOTE: Safety, definitions, purpose, scope, and using ORM is the common sense approach to
making calculated decisions on human material and environmental factors. It enables those in
charge to maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks at all levels preserving assets
and safeguarding health and welfare. Accept no unnecessary risk.
   4.2. ORM.
       4.2.1. Identify the hazards.
       4.2.2. Assess the risk.
       4.2.3. Analyze risk control measures.
       4.2.4. Make control decisions.
       4.2.5. Implement risk controls.
       4.2.6. Supervise and review.
5. RECOVERY METHODS.
   5.1. Aircraft recovery usually involves seven general steps.
       5.1.1. Overall assessment, analysis, planning and briefings.
       5.1.2. Alteration of weight and center of gravity (CG).
           5.1.2.1. In the event that an aircraft being recovered requires the removal of cargo,
           contact 88 MSG/LGRTT.

       5.1.7. Movement of the aircraft.
6. CDDAR TEAM BRIEFING.
    6.1. After initial planning steps have been completed a briefing will be conducted for all
    involved recovery personnel. This will allow all involved to begin thinking of various
    possible hazards and ways to minimize them. Detailed briefings are best broken down into
    several distinct tasks with one person appointed to be responsible for each task.
    6.2. Each team leader must fully understand his/her responsibilities and how they interface
    with each other.
    6.3. Team leaders will brief personnel involved in their task(s).
    6.4. Briefings will cover the following topics (as a minimum).
       6.4.1. The task to be accomplished (what).
       6.4.2. The intended purpose of each task (why).
       6.4.3. The sequence of the task (when).
       6.4.4. Responsibility for each task (who).
       6.4.5. Task accomplishment and coordination (how).
       6.4.6. Any known hazards involved.
