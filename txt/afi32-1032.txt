This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 32-10, Installations and Facilities, which
establishes an asset management framework to deliver common levels of services for civil
engineering activities. It provides guidance and instruction for planning and programming
projects for real property classified as maintenance, repair, and unspecified minor construction
(UMC), using operation and maintenance (O&M) funds. It applies to individuals at all levels
who plan, program, and approve said projects, including Air National Guard units and Air Force
Reserve Command. To ensure a full understanding of the process of providing, maintenance,
repair, and UMC support to real property, users of this instruction should be familiar with other
Air Force 32-(Civil Engineer) and 65-(Budget) series publications. AFI 65-601, Vol. 1,
Financial Management, Budget Guidance and Procedures, is particularly important for
determining funded and unfunded costs for all projects. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through Major
Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. The authorities to waive wing/unit level
requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, and T-3”) number
following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management,
Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests
for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or
alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
in accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
paragraph lists major changes. Wording in the Instruction title was changed. The Instruction
identifies Tiered waiver authorities for unit level compliance items. Chapter 1 was updated to
include: a summary of key statutory provisions and updated project approval and notification
levels (reflecting elimination of the life, health, and safety exception to the statutory limit on the
cost of UMC projects that may be funded with O&M appropriations); and introduction of the Air
Force Civil Engineer Center. Chapter 3 was updated to include: the definition of facility for
infrastructure and utility systems; project prioritization through the Activity Management Plan
process; details on demolition and consolidation; guidance for determining facility conversion
(also in Chapter 5); guidance for programming government-furnished equipment; definitions for
facility replacement cost and project phases; clarification of programming linear structures;
updated guidance on antiterrorism, temporary facilities, communications prewiring, seismic
considerations, design and engineering services, and artificial turf; new economic analysis policy
(also in Chapter 4); and procedures for programming installation entry control areas.
References to maintenance and repair are consolidated in Chapter 4. Chapter 4 updates also
include: work classification for landscaping, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance facilities,
roofs, and pavements; programming multiple fund sources, companion projects, and concurrent
work; revision to the “aggregation rule”; added sustainability guidance; the current repair project
approval process; and clarification of programming mezzanines. References to UMC are
consolidated in Chapter 5. Chapter 5 updates also include: new policy for aircraft sunshades;
updates for laboratory revitalization guidance; and clarified policy for consolidating minor
construction projects in a single facility. Chapter 6 updates include: distinction between
sustainment and restoration/modernization fund categories; a table of commonly used program
element codes; programming projects involving troop labor; updates for host-tenant
relationships; joint basing responsibilities; guidance on energy, water conservation, and green
procurement; clarification for determining equipment structures; and information on claims.
Additional examples of each work classification are added to include the proper element of
expense investment code. Chapter 7 has been revised, primarily for legislative clarifications.
Attachment 2 has been revised. Attachment 4, Facility Investment Metric, has been deleted.

     Infrastructure) (SAF/IEE). SAF/IEE establishes and provides oversight of policies relating
     to all real property and installation-related authorities as delegated in Headquarters Air Force
     Mission Directive (MD) 1-18, and grants waivers to those policies in appropriate
     circumstances. SAF/IEE is the final approval authority for facility projects exceeding
     specified cost thresholds as stated in this Instruction. Project approval by SAF/IEE does not
     constitute funding approval.
     1.2.2. The Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C). AF/A4C provides programming and
     investment planning guidance, oversight, and policy. AF/A4C reviews, validates, and
     coordinates active duty O&M-funded repair and UMC projects for AF/A4C or SAF/IEE
     approval of those projects exceeding approval authorities delegated to the Major Commands
     (MAJCOM). AF/A4C is the approval authority for repair projects exceeding specified cost
     thresholds as re-delegated from SAF/IEE and stated in this Instruction. AF/A4C, through the
     Installation Support Panel, applies asset management principles to make recommendations to
     the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management (SAF/FM) and the Air
     Force Corporate Structure (e.g., Air Force Board, Air Force Council) on requirements for,
     and appropriate allocation of, resources across the Air Force Civil Engineer portfolio.
     1.2.3. MAJCOMs. MAJCOMs provide oversight to ensure compliance with law, DoD, and
     Air Force policies. They may provide supplements to Air Force policies, procedures, and
     instructions. They use Activity Management Plans (AMPs) to validate and prioritize
     requirements provided by their installations or subordinate units. They build and advocate
     for command budgets for maintenance, repair, and UMC projects, with timely funds
     obligation. MAJCOMs approve projects within delegated approval levels and execute
     investment plans. The Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
     Civil Engineer perform these MAJCOM functions for their installations. The ANG and
     AFRC Civil Engineers will process their respective packages for SAF/IEE approval for
     O&M-funded repair and UMC projects exceeding their approval authority.
     1.2.4. United States Property and Fiscal Officer (USPFO).
        1.2.4.1. The USPFO is accountable for all ANG property with a Federal interest.
        1.2.4.2. The USPFO may approve project funding as described in the current ANG
        delegation of authority memoranda and Base Civil Engineers (BCEs) shall submit
        projects greater than these limits to Air National Guard, Civil Engineer Programming

  (1) ensuring the effective and efficient use of Air Force real property to include optimization
  through consolidation, demolition, and timely disposal of excess real property; and (2)
  planning and programming all O&M-funded, maintenance, repair, and UMC for real
  property requirements necessary to properly support assigned missions and people (including
  tenants) in accordance with approved investment plans.
  1.2.6. Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC).
     1.2.6.1. AFCEC provides the chair for the Installations Integration Group (I2G), which is
     the forum for integrating all requirements to create the Air Force Activity Management
     Plan (AFAMP) and Air Force Comprehensive Asset Management Plan (AFCAMP) and
     is the primary link for MAJCOM and installation input. In conjunction with MAJCOM
     representatives, AFCEC serves as the final integrator of its various directorate product
     line investment plans (AFAMPs and AFCAMP) to ensure an enterprise-wide, mission
     critical/worst-first portfolio management methodology is applied to the installation
     investment strategy.
     1.2.6.2. AFCEC provides built and natural infrastructure technical support and subject
     matter expertise, and manages Air Force enterprise space planning and optimization.
     AFCEC Centrally manages facility and infrastructure assessments and surveys to inform

     and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures, and AFI 65-601 V1, Budget Guidance
     and Procedures. (T-0) These services include, but are not limited to, preparing program
     documents, obtaining required certifications, and providing BCE services. The host will
     prepare facility repair project packages requiring AF/A4C and SAF/IEE approval and
     congressional notification. The host Civil Engineer unit will route approval packages
     through the host MAJCOM. (T-1) The host installation must receive coordination from the
     funding organization prior to staffing. (T-1) AF/A4C and SAF/IEE approval does not
     constitute funding approval. Air Reserve Components (ARC) will prepare and staff approval
     request packages for ARC-funded work. As a tenant on other Air Force installations, ARC
     units will coordinate their approval request packages with the host. See Chapter 6 for
     further guidance.
1.3. Scope. This instruction provides general procedures for planning and programming O&M-
funded projects for Air Force real property classified as maintenance, repair, or UMC, and
demolition projects. Funds for these projects are normally in the 3400 appropriation (3740 for
AFRC and 3840 for ANG), but may include: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
(RDT&E) funds (3600 appropriation); Working Capital Funds (WCF); Defense Health Program
funds; Defense Sustainment/Restoration and Modernization (S/R&M) accounts, and other fund
sources when made available for O&M purpose (e.g., other nations, other government agencies,
non-governmental entities). It applies to all projects, including, but not limited to, those planned
for accomplishment by organic forces (including overhires and temporary duty augmentees),
troop labor, or contract (including Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineer Requirements
[SABER]). See AFI 32-1001, Operations Management, for guidance on functions at the
installation level. See Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for
guidance for determining space allocations for facilities and for evaluation of existing facilities.
See AFRCH 32-1001, Standard Facility Requirements, for AFRC-occupied facilities, and
ANGH32-1084, Facility Space Standards, for ANG-occupied facilities.
This instruction does not address the following:
(1) construction work funded by Military Construction Appropriations (MCA), including MCA-
funded unspecified minor military construction (UMMC) (commonly referred to as P-341) (see
AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction Projects); (2) Nonappropriated
Fund Instrumentalities work (see AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming Nonappropriated
Fund Facility Projects); and (3) military family housing work (see AFI 32-6002, Family
Housing Planning, Programming, Design and Construction).
1.4. Work Classification. Work classification is key to properly programming facility
requirements. Applicable statutory authorities and definitions for work classification are set
forth in Paragraph 1.5 Work classification is addressed further in Paragraph 3.3 Work must
be classified as maintenance, repair, or construction. Demolition unrelated to or which does not
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                         9


enable any maintenance, repair, or UMC project is not considered to be a class of real property
work. Project approval levels and appropriate funding sources vary with work classification.
See also Chapter 4 for maintenance and repair details and Chapter 5 for UMC details. Note:
Work classifications are not to be confused with fund source categories such as Sustainment or
Restoration and Modernization. See Chapter 6 for O&M fund source categories.
1.5. Statutory Authorities. Differing statutory authorities regarding repair and UMC make it
critical to distinguish between these two work classifications in planning and programming
projects. In particular, the misclassification of construction as repair can lead to statutory
violations. Although there are no statutory limitations on the use of O&M funds for facility
maintenance, it is also important to distinguish maintenance from repair and construction. The
Air Force defines maintenance as the recurring, day-to-day, periodic, or scheduled work required
to preserve real property facilities, systems, or components and prevent premature failure or
deterioration, so these may be effectively used for their designated purposes.
   1.5.1. Facility. A “facility” (for purposes of both repair and UMC) is defined in Title 10 of
   the United States Code, § 2801 (references to sections of Title 10 of United States Code
   [USC] sections are hereafter set forth in the following format: 10 USC § xxxx) as a building,
   structure or other improvement to real property.
   1.5.2. Repair. 10 USC, § 2811 authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to carry
   out repair projects for an entire single purpose facility or one or more functional areas of a
   multipurpose facility using O&M funds.
       1.5.2.1. The statute defines a “repair project” as a project to restore a real property
       facility, system, or component to such a condition that it may effectively be used for its
       designated functional purpose.
       1.5.2.2. The statute provides that a repair project costing more than $7,500,000 may not
       be carried out unless approved in advance by SECAF. In determining the cost of a repair
       project, SECAF must include all phases of a multi-year repair project to a single facility.
       In considering a repair project for approval, SECAF must ensure that the project is
       consistent with force structure plans, that repair of the facility is more cost-effective than
       replacement, and that the project is an appropriate use of O&M funds.
       1.5.2.3. SECAF must notify Congress of a decision to approve a repair project with an
       estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000 and provide a report that includes: the justification
       for the project; if estimated repair cost exceeds 75% of the estimated cost of a military
       construction project to replace the facility, an explanation of why replacement is not in
       the best interests of the Government; and a description of any elements of construction
       included in the project.
       1.5.2.4. See Chapter 4 for detailed guidance on planning and programming maintenance
       and repair projects.
   1.5.3. Unspecified Minor Construction. 10 USC § 2805 authorizes SECAF to carry out a
   UMC project costing not more than $750,000 using O&M funds.
       1.5.3.1. “Military construction” is defined in 10 USC § 2801 as any construction,
       development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military
 10                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


       installation, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent requirements, including
       acquisition of land.
       1.5.3.2. Title 10 USC § 2805 currently includes an exception to the cap on the use of
       O&M funds for laboratory revitalization and recapitalization. For these construction
       projects, the cap is $4,000,000. This provision currently expires on September 30, 2018.
       Contact HQ USAF/A4C (through the MAJCOM) for most current expiration date of this
       authority.
       1.5.3.3. A “military construction project” includes all construction and other work
       necessary to produce a complete and useable facility or a complete and useable
       improvement to an existing facility.
       1.5.3.4. For Reserve Components, UMC authority similar to 10 USC § 2805 is granted to
       the Secretary of Defense under 10 USC § 18233b. This authority has been delegated to
       SECAF under DoD Directive (DoDD) 1225.07 and DoDI 1225.8.
       1.5.3.5. UMC projects may not be used to construct new military family housing units.
       1.5.3.6. See Chapter 5 for detailed guidance on planning and programming UMC
       projects.
1.6. Delegation and Approval Levels. By MD 1-18, the SECAF delegated authorities under 10
USC § 2805 (DoDD 1225.07 and DoDI 1225.8 for ANG and AFRC) and 10 USC § 2811 to
SAF/IE, who re-delegated them to SAF/IEE with the authority to further re-delegate. ANG and
AFRC repair and construction authorities under 10 USC Chapter 1803 § 18233 have also been
delegated to SAF/IE and subsequently to SAF/IEE. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 provide the approval
levels re-delegated by SAF/IEE for maintenance, repair, and UMC projects. SAF/IE and
SAF/IEE may, at their discretion, for particular projects, reduce or otherwise impose restrictions
on the delegated approval levels. DoD Directive 4270.5, Military Construction, delegates to the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD-ATL) the
statutory authorities vested in the Secretary of Defense by United States Code Title 10 Chapter
169, but excluding sections 2804 and 2808. OUSD-ATL delegated these authorities to the U.S.
Special Operations Command Commander, Directors of the Defense Agencies, and Directors of
the DoD Field Activities, for purposes of administering their respective military construction
programs within the Defense-wide military construction account. Additionally, OUSD-ATL
delegated to these same officials authority to approve prior determinations, approvals,
notifications, and other actions previously taken on projects within their respective military
construction programs using these same statutory authorities.
   1.6.1. Re-Delegation by AF/A4C. Except as set forth in Table 1.2, AF/A4C may re-
   delegate approval authorities to MAJCOM Civil Engineers for O&M-funded maintenance,
   repair, and UMC projects. MAJCOM Civil Engineers may re-delegate approval authorities
   to the installation level. The Chief, National Guard Bureau, and the Chief, Air Force
   Reserve, accomplish their re-delegations for ANG and AFRC respectively.
   1.6.2. Work Classifications Independent for Approval Purposes. The cost of each work
   classification within in a complete and usable project is considered independently of the cost
   of other work classification(s) within the same project when determining the approval
   authority for a project with multiple work classifications. A project may require separate,
   multiple approvals for each work classification. For example, a project that repairs a facility
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                                     11


      at a cost of $4,500,000 and constructs an addition to the same facility for $600,000 must be
      approved by the office whose delegated repair approval authority is at least $4,500,000 and
      by the office whose delegated UMC approval authority is at least $600,000.

                                             Chapter 2

                                     PROJECT PLANNING

2.1. Project Planning Defined. Project planning is the identification of requirements for built
or natural assets to satisfy current and future mission needs. It addresses the ultimate goal to be
achieved and includes the specific work required with regard to the development and
sustainment of Air Force installations. Understanding how built or natural assets support
mission requirements allows planners to successfully develop sustainable investment plans,
which may include multi-year phased maintenance and repair projects and any needed
construction projects. For other planning, such as installation planning, refer to AFI 32-7062,
Air Force Comprehensive Planning.
2.2. Facility Requirement Identification. The BCE uses a variety of methods to identify
facility requirements, including, but not limited to: projected mission changes; installation
development plans; AMPs; space utilization surveys; sustainable infrastructure assessments;
condition surveys (pavements, roofs, etc.); environmental compliance assessments, safety,
security, laws, codes, regulations, design guides, and unified facilities criteria; energy
conservation surveys and audits; and user-identified requirements. The BCE will identify and
document requirements in accordance with applicable AMP procedures (refer to the applicable
AFAMP playbook on the Civil Engineer (CE) Portal under the Playbooks menu in the
Engineering Flight Portfolio Optimization list). (T-1)
2.3. Project Definition. Any maintenance, repair, construction, or combination of the three
performed on or in a facility necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or improvement
to a facility is a “project”, regardless of dollar amount or execution strategy. See Paragraph 3.4
for more detail on defining a project.
2.4. Planning Determinations. With a defined requirement, the BCE determines: (1) solutions
to provide, operate, maintain, and protect facilities, infrastructure, and installations for effective
mission support at the lowest life-cycle cost to include sustainable design concepts (i.e. facility
site, space allocation, facility orientation, energy and water sources); (2) technical engineering
requirements; (3) work classification (see Paragraph 3.3), and (4) cost estimates. These actions
enable project(s) development and programming. Existing built or natural assets should be used
to the greatest extent possible to minimize new construction. Facilities that are inefficient or
excess to requirements should be demolished when possible. Consider facility space utilization,
asset operating costs, and asset condition when making planning considerations. Planners and
programmers should refer to the Requirements Definition & Programming Playbook (RD&P) for
assistance in defining and programming projects. The RD&P Playbook can be found on the CE
Portal under the Playbooks menu in the Engineering Flight Portfolio Optimization list.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     13

                                      PROGRAMMING

3.1. Programming Defined. Programming is the process of documenting requirements and
acquiring both the authority and the resources necessary to accomplish planned work.
3.2. Prioritization. With a defined facility requirement, the BCE will develop facility project
programming proposals and use the AMP process to prepare investment plans and present them
to the installation Facilities Board for approval and awareness, regardless of fund source. (T-2)
Prioritization guidance will be provided by Headquarters Air Force (HAF), AFCEC, and
MAJCOMs through the AMP process, and will include installation and subordinate unit
considerations. MAJCOMs will evaluate installation investment plans using the AMP process to
consider integrating projects into MAJCOM priority lists. See AFPD 32-10, Installations and
Facilities, for general prioritization guidance, and AFI 32-10142, Facilities Board, (ANGI 32-
1003, Facilities Board (FB), for ANG), for guidance regarding Facilities Board functions.
3.3. Work Classification. Programmers must classify work as maintenance, repair, or
construction. (T-0) Project approval levels, and appropriate funding sources vary with work
classification. See Chapter 4 for details on maintenance and repair and Chapter 5 for details on
UMC. Note: Maintenance, repair, and construction are work classifications, and are not to be
confused with fund source categories such as Sustainment or Restoration and Modernization.
See Chapter 6 for O&M fund source categories. Ensure solicitations for projects which include
multiple work classifications include a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure that
identifies project costs by type of work (e.g., maintenance, repair, construction, or demolition).
   3.3.1. Demolition. The Air Force will provide and retain the minimum number of facilities
   required to effectively support mission requirements, and will dispose of facilities excess to
   requirements. Demolition of a facility (or portion of a facility) unrelated to or which does
   not enable any maintenance, repair, or UMC project is not considered to be a class of real
   property work. Demolition work performed independently from repair or construction work
   (is not required for or does not enable the work), regardless of cost, is not subject to O&M
   project approval thresholds. See Chapter 6 for guidance on fund source categories for
   demolition. Demolition assists in reducing infrastructure and sustainment investment, and
   directly reduces base operational costs; therefore, it should not be cut from the scope of
   work. See AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, and AFH 32-9007, Managing Air Force
   Real Property, Chapter 4, for Air Force property disposal procedures. When programmers
   program this work, the first word of the project title will be “Demolish.” (T-1)
   3.3.2. Facility Consolidation. As stated in Paragraph 3.3.1, the Air Force will provide and
   retain the minimum number of facilities required to effectively support mission requirements.
   Effective facility consolidation can be a significant enabler to disposing facilities excess to
   requirements. When programmers program consolidation work, the word “consolidate” shall
   be included in the project title. (T-1) See Paragraph 6.1 for detailed guidance on fund
   source categories for each work classification. Programmers shall ensure proposed work is
   conducted on real property and within the limitations and work classification descriptions
   established for O&M-funded repair and minor construction work as described in Chapters 4
   and 5 of this Instruction. (T-1)
 14                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


   3.3.3. Facility Conversion. Under 10 USC § 2801, “construction” specifically includes
   conversion of a facility, which this Instruction defines as change from one functional purpose
   to another. “Repair”, according to 10 USC § 2811, is “a project to restore a real property
   facility, system, or component to such a condition that it may effectively be used for its
   designated functional purpose.” Based on these definitions, if the functional purpose of the
   facility or affected portion of the facility remains consistent, then facility conversion has not
   taken place. If the functional purpose of the facility or affected portion of the facility does
   change, then facility conversion has taken place. Planners and programmers shall document
   and justify any decisions distinguishing repair from conversion. (T-1)
       3.3.3.1. Functional Purpose Categories. To provide consistent application of the
       functional purpose filter, Table 3.1 below provides ten “functional purpose categories”.
       Programmers shall use these categories to determine the functional purpose of the
       affected portion of the facility. (T-1) If the functional purpose changes from one
       category to another, then conversion takes place, and programmers must classify
       associated work as construction. (T-1) Note: These functional purpose categories are not
       real property categories (facility analysis categories, category codes, etc.). This guidance
       does not alleviate the need for real property actions or designation changes mandated in
       other publications.
       3.3.3.2. When undertaking a conversion, programmers must take into account all work,
       and classify each portion of the work according to the following:
             3.3.3.2.1. Programmers shall classify work necessary to affect the change in
             functional purpose as construction. (T-1) See additional guidance on construction
             work associated with conversion in Paragraph 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2
             3.3.3.2.2. Work consistent with sustainment of the facility may be classified as
             repair.
       3.3.3.3. Respective funding and approval thresholds apply to both the total construction
       work and total repair work. Programmers must ensure that any project, including both
       repair and construction work, results in a complete and usable facility. (T-0)

    3.3.4. Work Other Than Facility Maintenance, Repair, or Construction. On a
    reimbursable basis, the BCE may perform other types of work which are not directly related
    to O&M-funded maintenance, repair, or UMC and which do not fit the work categories
    described in this instruction. Examples of reimbursable work include direct burial of
    communication cables, work on non-real property equipment (e.g., equipment listed on the
    Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) account), or installing raised flooring or
    non-capitalized air conditioning to support computer equipment (for air conditioning
    installed solely for the purpose of cooling communications-electronic equipment, see AFI 65-
    601 V1). Work that is not facility maintenance, repair, or UMC is not subject to the
    limitations placed on O&M-funded maintenance, repair, or UMC work—if included as part
    of a project, it is an unfunded cost to the project. See Paragraph 3.5.15 for additional
    guidance on funded and unfunded costs.
    3.3.5. Work on Non-DoD Property. 10 USC § 2012, Support and Services for Eligible
    Organizations and Activities Outside Department of Defense, authorizes certain support and
    services to eligible organizations and activities outside the DoD for the purpose of addressing
    community and civic needs when such assistance is incidental to military training or
    otherwise authorized by law. The purpose is to build upon the long-standing tradition of the
    Armed Forces, acting as good neighbors at the local level, in applying military personnel to
    assist worthy civic and community needs. See DoDD 1100.20, Support and Services for
    Eligible Organizations and Activities Outside the Department of Defense, and AFI 32-9001,
    Acquisition of Real Property, for further guidance.
3.4. Project. Any maintenance, repair, construction, or combination of the three performed on
or in a facility necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or improvement to a facility is
a “project,” regardless of dollar amount or execution strategy. Combining requirements in
multiple facilities for a single contract or task order is an execution strategy, which could include
multiple “projects” (a project is specific to a single facility). However, there may also be
multiple “projects” within a single facility if each individual project fulfills an individual
requirement which produces a complete and usable facility or improvement to a facility (or
component of a facility) and is independent and not interrelated with other requirements within
the facility. To determine if a planned construction or repair effort may exceed project approval
thresholds, aggregation of individual projects within a single facility may be necessary (see
Chapters 4 and 5 for specific guidance on repair and minor construction, respectively). When
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       17


programming construction to meet a requirement, if each facility/structure that comprises the
requirement cannot be considered complete and usable without any of the other facilities or
structures, then programmers must aggregate the costs of the dependent facilities/structures for
approval threshold determination. (T-0)
3.5. Planning, Programming, and Accomplishing Projects. The installation BCE with real
property accountability is responsible to ensure all facility work complies with applicable laws,
codes, and standards (e.g., Unified Facilities Criteria [UFC], Engineering Technical Letters
[ETLs], and AFIs). (T-1) See Paragraph 6.6 for programming considerations for host-tenant
requirements and responsibilities. Projects must be planned and programmed to support current
and future mission needs. Programmers must ensure each maintenance, repair, and UMC project
provides a complete and usable facility or improvement to a facility. (T-0) A complete and
usable facility is ready for the installation of necessary equipment other than Real Property
Installed Equipment (RPIE) such that it enables user occupancy and meets all required legal
certifications for operation of specialized activities (e.g., child development centers, air traffic
control towers, etc.). See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance. Non-RPIE equipment
typically includes systems furniture, desks, chairs, communications systems, electronic alarm
systems, and other non-RPIE equipment listed in AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and
Reporting. Programmers must ensure the facility requirement is fully defined. (T-0)
Additionally, programmers must ensure the bona fide need of the current year is not split to keep
the project under the construction threshold. (T-0) The entire construction requirement is subject
to the appropriate statutory limitations.
   3.5.1. Facility Replacement Cost. Several provisions in this Instruction relating to repair
   projects require consideration of the facility repair-to-replacement cost ratio. “Replacement
   cost” is the estimated cost of a MILCON project to replace the facility. Programmers must
   base the replacement cost on the existing facility’s purpose and characteristics (mission,
   function, size, etc.), which can be brought up to current standards and codes. (T-1)
   Programmers cannot expand the facility used in the replacement cost estimate to
   accommodate new or additional requirements beyond the existing facility function. (T-1)
   Programmers may use the current AF/A4C approved facility plant replacement value (PRV)
   of record as submitted to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as part of the annual
   reporting of unclassified real property assets in accordance with 10 USC § 2721, Property
   Records: Maintenance on Quantitative and Monetary Basis, as available in the Air Force
   Civil Engineer real property database. When the project cost is 75% of the PRV or higher,
   programmers must use the estimated cost of a military construction project to replace the
   facility. (T-1) Note: In order to comply with UFC guidance, programmers must use the PRV
   when determining the antiterrorism threshold (see Paragraph 3.5.7). (T-0)
   3.5.2. Phasing. A project may be phased over multiple years to minimize the impact of
   work on a facility’s mission, or for other reasons. For programming purposes, phases are
   defined as being interdependent in achieving an overall requirement or objective (e.g.
   renovating a facility, repairing a system, etc.) but must be complete and usable on their own.
   Programmers shall not use the word ‘phase’ in project titles unless it meets this definition.
   (T-1) The word “phase” has statutory implications. For approval and notification threshold
   determination (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2) programmers must sum the cost of all phases of a
   project. (T-0) Also, for compliance purposes, programmers must program and secure
   authorization of all phases of minor construction work as a single minor construction project.
 18                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


   (T-0) Note: Programmers must not split projects into increments to circumvent
   approval authorities, reporting requirements, or programming policy. Programmers
   must include all phases when determining appropriate approval levels. (T-0)
   3.5.3. Bona Fide Need. The “bona fide needs rule” is a fundamental rule of appropriations
   law. It mandates that a fiscal year’s appropriations be obligated only to meet a legitimate
   need existing in the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made. It restricts this year’s
   appropriated funds from being used to fund next fiscal year’s requirement.
Refer to DoD FMR, Vol. 3, Ch. 8, for detailed guidance regarding bona fide need. Applications
of the bona fide need rule include delivery or production lead time, stock level, non-severable
and severable services, maintenance, repair, and construction. In addition, AFI 65-601
Paragraph 6.3.3. includes the following, “(See DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, Chapter 2, and GAO,
Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Volume 1, Chapter 5, for more information concerning
the bona fide need rule).”
   3.5.4. Programming Linear Systems. A facility is a building, structure, or other
   improvement to real property (see Paragraph 1.5.1).               However, linear structures
   (infrastructure and utility systems) are not typically subdivided into discrete facilities
   identified by unique facility identifiers in Air Force real property records. Instead,
   distribution systems that provide a common service or commodity to more than one building
   or structure are defined in DoDI 4165.14, Paragraph E2.1.14, as linear structures. These are
   facilities whose functions traverse land and which are comprised of one or more segments
   that must be linked contiguously in order to deliver the service or commodity.
       3.5.4.1. The following policy for infrastructure and utility systems applies for
       programming purposes and may not align with Air Force real property facility naming
       convention or segmentation.
       3.5.4.2. As a general rule, for programming purposes, programmers shall manage
       pavements or utility systems that are contiguous and share the same three-digit category
       groups displayed in Table 3.2 below as a single facility. (T-1) The three-digit DoD
       Basic Category Groups are defined in The Department of Defense Real Property
       Classification System published by The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of
       Defense, Installations and Environment (DUSD (I&E)). Pavements or utility systems
       may be managed for programming purposes as separate, discrete facilities, even though
       they may share the same three-digit DoD Basic Category Group, if they are
       geographically separated or non-contiguous. Programmers must remain aware that
       distinguishing linear structures has implications when determining if the repair cost
       exceeds the replacement cost, as in the case of replacing overhead distribution lines with
       underground distribution lines. Each distinguishable linear structure carries its own
       replacement cost.
       3.5.4.3. Programming rules for specific types of facilities, airfield pavements, and
       electrical distribution systems are as follows:
          3.5.4.3.1. Named roads, parking lots (not serving a single building), fences (not
          serving a single building), and sidewalks can be treated as separate discrete facilities.
          Programmers must group parking lots and/or fences serving a single building with the
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      19


            building for determining compliance with construction and repair approval and
            notification thresholds. (T-1)
            3.5.4.3.2. When programming projects, programmers can treat airfield pavements as
            separate facilities, if they are non-contiguous and non-adjacent (e.g., separated by
            unimproved surface), even if they have the same three-digit DoD Basic Category
            Group. (T-1) For project programming purposes, programmers may not necessarily
            distinguish “named” infrastructure (e.g. Alpha Apron, Bravo Apron) as separate
            facilities unless they meet the criteria of being non-contiguous and non-adjacent.
            Intersecting taxiways can be treated as separate facilities; however, continuous
            taxiways (e.g., a taxiway that turns, but does not intersect another taxiway) must be
            treated as a single facility. A taxiway crossing a runway is a continuous taxiway, for
            programming purposes. (T-1)
            3.5.4.3.3. Regarding electrical distribution systems, see Table 3.2 for rules.

   modify newly constructed facilities, funded by any source, within 12 months of the placed-
   in-service date unless the modification is determined to be outside the scope of the original
   project (i.e., a newly identified requirement not covered by the "REQUIREMENTS"
   statement in the DD Form 1391). Possibilities include a modification necessitated by a
   mission requirement or equipment change which was unforeseen prior to the placed-in-
   service date or necessitated by a life/safety/health deficiency not covered by warranty. (T-1)
   The BCE shall not use O&M funds to correct deficiencies in MCA-funded projects
   throughout the life of the facility. (T-0) A deficiency exists when a component of the
   original construction has never functioned properly. Should it be necessary to correct a
   deficiency of the original MCA-funded project (e.g., whether due to inadequate design,
   construction, or installation), MCA funds must be used to correct the deficiency.
   3.5.6. Concurrent Work. To the extent possible, construction, maintenance, and repair
   requirements for a particular facility should be accomplished concurrently to take advantage
   of economies of scale.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   21


     3.5.6.1. Programmers must ensure each concurrent project in a facility results in a
     complete and usable improvement without being dependent on another project. (T-0) The
     programming documents for concurrent projects should be cross-referenced.
     3.5.6.2. There may be cost-savings or other value in construction, maintenance, or repair
     work being accomplished on several facilities at the same time. This work may coincide
     with other concurrent construction, maintenance, or repair requirements. Examples
     include a multi-facility energy improvement or multi-facility roof repair program being
     undertaken in one or more facilities in need of other work. Programming document(s)
     should reference any concurrent work in any of the affected facilities.
     3.5.6.3. Programmers must aggregate concurrent work within a single facility for
     approval and congressional notification threshold determination in accordance with
     Paragraph 4.3.3 (repair) and Paragraph 5.2 (construction). (T-1)
  3.5.7. Facility Security and Antiterrorism (AT) Measures. Security and AT must be
  primary considerations in the planning, programming, and design of Air Force facilities and
  utilities, which should include independent review and consultation with installation security
  and AT personnel. UFC 4-010-01, Design: DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for
  Buildings, is the official AT minimum design standard for DoD facilities. If the total of any
  new construction (including additions) and/or any repairs, regardless of funding source,
  exceeds 50% of the current PRV of record or changes the occupancy level of the facility (as
  defined in UFC4-010-01), programmers must ensure the entire facility is brought into
  compliance with UFC 4-010-01. (T-0) Planners and programmers must ensure planned
  window and door replacement or new installation included in any project for existing
  inhabited buildings, regardless of cost, must meet UFC 4-010-01 glazing requirements. (T-0)
  UFC 4-020-01, DoD Security Engineering Facilities Planning Manual, provides the initial
  AT process for identifying AT requirements, design basis threat, and protection levels. UFC
  3-340-01, Design and Analysis of Hardened Structures for Conventional Weapons Effects, is
  the design standard for DoD facility hardening against nuclear, biological, chemical, and
  conventional weapon effects.
     3.5.7.1. Per AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, the installation commander, or the installation’s
     senior Civil Engineer on the commander’s behalf, will certify on the certificate of
     compliance or in the Department of Defense Form (DD Form) 1391, FY__ Military
     Construction Project Data, that new facilities or renovation projects comply with UFC
     AT standards. (T-1) The AT Officer (ATO) will work with the engineering staff during
     planning, design, and construction to ensure requirements are met, including coordination
     prior to certification. A member of the installation Civil Engineer staff should complete
     security engineering training in accordance with AFI 10-245.
     3.5.7.2. For fund source category purposes, programmers will assign the “XT” Element
     of Expense Investment Code (EEIC) subshred for AT requirements utilizing only EEICs
     521xx, 522xx, 524xx, 529xx, 532xx, and 536xx. (T-1) See Paragraph 6.1 for detailed
     guidance on fund source categories. Additionally, as determined by AF/A4C, planners
     and programmers can classify permanently installed bollards, drop-arm barriers, tire
     shredders, and pop-up barriers as RPIE; however, cameras, radar, scanners, card readers,
     mobile/repositionable tire shredders, barriers, and transmitting detection systems/alarms
     are not RPIE. (T-1) See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance. References include,

     but are not limited to, UFC 4-010-02, Design (FOUO) DoD Minimum Standoff Distances
     for Buildings; UFC 4-021-01, Design and O&M Mass Notification Systems; DoDI
     2000.12, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Program; DoDI 5200.8, Security of DoD Installations
     and Resources; DoDI 2000.16, Antiterrorism Standards; AFI 65-601 V1; AFMAN 32-
     1084, and AFI 32-9005 Attachment 2 for additional information. The process for
     allowances and approval of applicable deviations from AT facility standards is provided
     in AFI 10-245, Appendix 6.
     3.5.7.3. Programmers may classify real property AT measures added to comply with
     codes or standards within existing footprint and attached to the facility as repair (unless
     the AT measure is considered an equipment item). Programmers shall classify real
     property AT measures added outside existing footprint and unattached to the facility,
     regardless of the reason, as construction (unless the AT measure is considered an
     equipment item). (T-1)
     3.5.7.4. Installation Entry Control Areas. The AF Facilities Entry Control Design
     Guide and UFC 4-022-01, Security Engineering: Entry Control Facilities / Access
     Control Points, establish standards for improving and strengthening the protection of our
     forces and installations from potential terrorist attack. The following four basic types of
     facilities may be needed at installation entry control areas: gatehouse, vehicle inspection
     facility, visitor control center, and overwatch (including associated final pop-up barriers).
     Although these facilities each contribute to controlling access to an installation, they each
     accomplish separate and distinct functions and do not have to be accomplished at the
     same time (although they may be) as long as they are non-contiguous and are physically
     separated from each other at an installation’s entry control area. Programmers may
     program these four facility requirements as separate projects provided there is not a
     specific reason at a particular location that makes aspects of one project dependent on
     another project. For programming roadwork (repair or construction), programmers will
     determine if the new facility is complete and usable if the road is not constructed. If not,
     programmers shall program the roadwork as a funded cost of the facility. (T-0)
     Programmers must include supporting requirements, such as roads, parking lots, lighting,
     utilities, and landscaping which make the facility complete and usable in the cost of the
     project. (T-0) Generally, programmers should not program roadwork as “repair” if the
     route of the road is being changed (see Paragraph 5.1.3.10). (T-1)
     3.5.7.5. Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Integrated Base Defense Security System
     (IBDSS), and Remote Targeting Engagement Systems (RTESs). An IDS or IBDSS
     attached to or connected to a building, that transmits a signal to an alternate monitoring
     location is classified as an equipment item. IDSs installed within a facility that do not
     transmit a signal outside the facility are RPIE (e.g., a ringing alarm that does not transmit
     a signal). An RTES is an equipment item. Cameras, radar, scanners, and card readers are
     equipment items. If a system requires installation of a platform to support the sensors
     (e.g. fencing, gates, posts, slabs, etc.) and/or allied support (e.g. power, conduit, etc.), the
     platform component(s) and/or allied support are considered real property. The real
     property components of these systems should be funded, installed, maintained, and
     sustained with S/R&M-type funds. If any components are not considered to be real
     property per the criteria above, they are equipment items, and the user or security unit
     responsible for the procurement, installation, and sustainment. (T-1)
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      23


     3.5.7.6. Guard Towers and Defensive Fighting Positions (DFPs). Verify with the
     installation Real Property Officer whether guard towers and defensive fighting position
     structures are real property. If the structure is: 1) permanently installed, 2) not temporary
     in nature, and 3) not relocatable in practice, it is real property. If real property, planners
     and programmers shall classify installation of these where they did not previously exist as
     construction. (T-1) If permanently installed, these shall be maintained, sustained, and
     repaired as real property. If these are not real property per the criteria above, they are
     equipment items, and the procurement, installation, and sustainment is the responsibility
     of the user.
  3.5.8. Obsolete Facilities. Limit construction, maintenance, and repair work in facilities
  identified for disposal to the minimum required to ensure safety and security, to protect
  health and the environment, and to permit the facility to accomplish its mission.
  3.5.9. Temporary Facilities. Planners, programmers, and project managers shall ensure
  temporary facilities are used for the shortest term possible (less than five years) and only
  until the permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their use. (T-1) If the
  requirement for a temporary facility concludes and a new requirement makes use of the same
  facility, the “clock” toward the five-year threshold starts over. These facilities must be
  functional yet austere. Planners, programmers, and project managers shall ensure these
  facilities have no appearance of permanence, such as brick exteriors, brick building signs, or
  extensive landscaping. (T-1)
     3.5.9.1. Relocatable Buildings. Relocatable buildings, by definition, are used to fulfill a
     temporary requirement (less than five years). A structure physically capable of being
     moved does not alone qualify it as a “relocatable building”. See AFI 32-1021, Ch. 6, and
     DoDI 4165.56, Relocatable Buildings, for further guidance, including fire, safety, and
     antiterrorism requirements.
     3.5.9.2. Temporary Facilities Interim or Incident to O&M S/R&M
     Projects. Temporary facilities may be obtained either as an interim solution prior to
     funding an O&M-funded repair or UMC project or as an incident solution during
     execution of an O&M-funded repair or UMC project. Programmers shall program an
     interim temporary facility as a stand-alone project. (T-1) Incident temporary facilities
     are considered companion to a repair or UMC project and programmers should reference
     them on the project programming document. (T-1) For temporary incidental facilities,
     programmers shall include the procurement cost (to include lease cost) of the temporary
     facility on the DD 1391, as an unfunded cost. (T-1) If leased, programmers shall include
     the full cost of the lease on the DD Form 1391. (T-1) The lease cost will reflect the
     period when the facility being maintained, repaired, or constructed will not be available.
     Work to add allied support is classified as construction and programmers shall program
     this work as a funded cost to both incident and interim temporary facilities, even if it is
     not to be retained. (T-0) Allied support includes, but is not limited to; foundations,
     concrete mounting slabs, site preparation, utility connections, stairways, porches or
     breezeways between units, extra wall covering and paneling, ceramic works, lighting, and
     other interior and exterior finishes and features not included in the original facility
     package or unit. Planners, programmers, and project managers should consider the
     relocatable facility as an equipment item and unfunded cost. (T-0) See Paragraph
     3.5.15 for additional guidance on funded and unfunded costs.
24                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     3.5.9.3. Siting Temporary Facilities. Planners shall ensure siting temporary facilities is
     approved by the Installation Commander through the Facilities Board, is consistent with
     the installation development plan, and should avoid, when possible, primary
     thoroughfares and high visibility areas. (T-1) Landscaping and screening material should
     be employed only to the extent necessary to meet minimum military requirements.
     3.5.9.4. Temporary Facilities to be Retained Following Completion of an O&M
     Project. Relocatable buildings may be acquired as real property. When converting
     temporary facilities to real property the BCE shall secure SAF/IEE approval. (T-1) See
     AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6.
     3.5.9.5. Temporary Facilities Incident to Military Construction Projects. For
     temporary facilities incident to military construction projects, refer to AFI 32-1021.
  3.5.10. Communications Requirements. Refer to UFC 3-580-01, Telecommunications
  Building Cabling Systems Planning and Design, ETL 02-12, Communications and
  Information System Criteria for Air Force Facilities, successor publications, and AFI 65-601
  V1, for guidance on communications-related requirements for O&M-funded repair and
  construction projects. The real property elements of a project (e.g. conduit, manholes, duct
  banks, etc.) are subject to construction and repair approval and congressional notification
  thresholds, are funded costs of the project, and cannot be financed with equipment
  procurement funds (e.g., 57*3080 account). Elements of a project that are not real property,
  such as communications wiring (telephone lines, data lines, etc.) and termination devices
  (telephones, computers, racks, switches, etc.), will be unfunded costs of the project and
  financed as expenses in accordance with AFI 32-9005 and AFI 65-601V1. See Paragraph
  3.5.15 for additional guidance on funded and unfunded costs. When planned facility projects
  will include installation or replacement of communications systems, CE programmers are
  urged to coordinate closely with A6/Communications officials to ensure that adequate
  resources for both facility work and communications systems work will be available
  concurrently to enable on-time delivery of facilities.
  3.5.11. Waste Management. When solid waste, including hazardous waste, is generated
  during maintenance, repair, construction, or demolition projects, ensure that management of
  such waste conforms to the requirements of AFI 32-7042, Waste Management.
  3.5.12. Contamination Cleanup. Programmers and project managers shall treat removal
  and disposal of contaminated material (e.g., soil, fuel, asbestos containing material, mold)
  identified in anticipation of or during a facility maintenance, repair, construction, or
  demolition project (within the project footprint) as a funded cost of the project. (T-1)
  Programmers and project managers shall classify remediation associated with a repair or
  construction project as repair. (T-1) Remediation associated with an isolated demolition
  project (unrelated to a maintenance, repair, or construction project) is part of the demolition
  project and carries no work classification. See AFI 32-1022 for NAF projects.
  3.5.13. Military Family Housing (MFH). A number of statutory provisions prohibit the
  use of O&M funds for maintenance, repair, and construction on MFH units, including areas
  in such units that may be used for the purpose of conducting official DoD business.
  Exceptions may be permitted to meet operational mission requirements. MFH-designated
  funds will be used for maintenance, repair, and construction on infrastructure systems which
  primarily support non-privatized MFH areas and units. For a project encompassing systems
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    25


  which support both APF and non-privatized MFH areas, prorate the project costs. Funding
  for systems encompassing privatized MFH areas will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
  See AFI 32-6002, for details on MFH programming and funding.
  3.5.14. Seismic Evaluation and Potential Mitigation. The determination of whether
  seismic evaluation and mitigation of an existing building must be considered during repair or
  minor construction is governed by UFC 3-310-04, Seismic Design for Buildings, and the
  Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction - Recommended Practice (RP) 8
  (ICSSC RP 8), "Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased
  Buildings”. RP 8 is applicable to all existing DoD-owned and leased buildings, as well as to
  newly acquired buildings added to the DoD inventory through purchase, lease, or donation.
     3.5.14.1. RP 8 Section 1.3 describes buildings that are exempt from the RP 8 standards.
     3.5.14.2. RP 8 Section 2.1. lists all other situations that require evaluation and potential
     mitigation. In general, in case of the following situations, planners and programmers
     shall trigger seismic evaluation and potential mitigation of existing facilities:
         3.5.14.2.1. UFC 3-310-04 Replacement for RP 8 Section 2.1 (b): For Seismic Design
         Category C buildings, a project is planned, which totals more than 50% of the
         replacement value of the building. (T-0)
         3.5.14.2.2. UFC 3-310-04 Replacement for RP 8 Section 2.1 (c): For Seismic Design
         Category D, E, or F buildings, a project is planned, which totals more than 30% of the
         replacement value of the building. (T-0)
         3.5.14.2.3. UFC 3-310-04 applies to DoD facilities worldwide, and for specific
         applicability defines the “United States” to include all 50 states, the District of
         Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,
         Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the
         United States.
  3.5.15. Funded and Unfunded Costs. For determinations regarding the classification of
  project costs as funded or unfunded, for both repair and UMC, conform to guidance in the
  Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR) 7000.14R, V3. Note
  that DoD FMR, V3, Ch. 17, Paragraph 1702 provides information unique to projects funded
  by MCA; the guidance provided below pertains to O&M-funded facility repair and UMC
  projects. In addition to the paragraphs below, refer to AFI 65-601 V1, Ch. 9, AFI 32-1021,
  Attachment 1, and ETL 02-12 for definitions and guidance on funded and unfunded costs.
     3.5.15.1. Funded Costs. Funded project costs are those costs used to determine the
     project cost for purposes such as approval authority (including need to notify the
     appropriate congressional committee) and appropriate source of funds. Programmers and
     project managers shall consider the following as funded project costs (the list may not be
     all inclusive) (T-0):
         3.5.15.1.1. Construction Equipment. Project execution costs applicable to
         maintenance and operation of government-owned construction equipment or
         applicable to contractor or government construction equipment rental expense.
         3.5.15.1.2. Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE). The cost of all
         permanently installed RPIE (government-furnished or contractor-furnished) is a
26                                                       AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     funded cost. An exception is government-owned equipment obtained on a non-
     reimbursable basis. In accordance with DoD FMR V3, Chapter 17, Paragraph
     170102.I.6, DoD Components are precluded from using materials, supplies, or items
     of RPIE on their own UMC projects on a non-reimbursable basis. Information
     regarding RPIE is provided in AFI 32-9005 and AFI 65-601V1. For medical
     projects, refer to Military Standard (MIL-STD) 1691, Construction and Material
     Schedule for Military Medical, Dental, Veterinary and Medical Research
     Laboratories, to determine which equipment should be accounted as “funded” costs.
     “Funded” medical equipment is described as Logistics Category “A” within MIL-
     STD 1691.
     3.5.15.1.3. Labor. Labor costs including foreign national construction units, except
     as noted below with respect to DoD WCF activities, excluding U.S. military labor.
     Labor costs for in-house civilian employees are calculated based on DoD FMR
     guidance. When the work is accomplished by contract, include the labor component
     of all contract costs except labor costs attributable to pre-construction execution
     planning and design. The cost of military labor shall not be included as a funded
     project cost except for the cost of military personnel assigned to DoD WCF activities.
     DoD WCF activities shall be reimbursed by their customers for the cost of military
     labor as prescribed in DoD FMR V11A, Chapter 1, Paragraph 010203.B and V11B,
     Chapter 13, Paragraph 130704. Troop labor temporary duty (TDY) costs are funded
     costs to the project unless TDY costs are provided by the troop labor organization
     from its training budget, in which case these are unfunded costs to the project.
     3.5.15.1.4. Land. The cost of any land procured for the proposed project or an
     independent land acquisition. See Paragraph 5.1.3.21 for classifying land
     acquisition. Refer to Paragraph 3.5.15.2.8 for unfunded costs associated with land
     procurement.
     3.5.15.1.5. Material. The cost of direct material (government-furnished and
     contractor-furnished) used in accomplishing the project except government-owned
     material obtained on a non-reimbursable basis from another agency. Materials
     purchased for troop labor projects are funded costs to the project for which they were
     purchased. Only materials used on the project should be capitalized. Wasted materials
     (substantial losses due to fire, theft, etc.) on troop labor projects are not capitalized
     and do not count against the project cost threshold. This does not apply to incidental
     wastage (e.g., lumber ends, bent nails, non-reusable scraps). Excess materials used
     on another project become funded costs of the latter project. Materials for troop labor
     projects may be incrementally procured in different fiscal years
     3.5.15.1.6. Estimated (for programming) or actual (during execution) contractor
     overhead and profit, and/or that portion of installation overhead or support costs that
     can be identified as representing additional costs that would not have been incurred
     were it not for the project, reference DoD FMR V3, chapter 17, Paragraph 170204.
     Overhead is typically estimated at a rate in the range of 15%, but can vary on contract
     type, complexities, and location. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation
     paragraph 15.404-4(c) (4) (C), for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts which are not
     research related or are not architect-engineer services for public works or utilities,
     profit shall not exceed 10% of the contract's estimated cost, excluding profit.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   27


        3.5.15.1.7. Government Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) incident to a
        real property facilities project or program (see 10 USC § 2802 and DoD FMR V3,
        Ch. 17, Paragraphs 170102 D.1.e., 170203, and 170204). SIOH is a funded cost and
        must be included in the overall project cost. For purposes of determining approval
        and notification thresholds, SIOH must be accounted for both in programming and
        during execution. SIOH can include:
           3.5.15.1.7.1. Post award construction contract administration.
           3.5.15.1.7.2. Technical direction and coordination of awarded projects.
           3.5.15.1.7.3. Land planning studies or reports, appraisal, and title search after
           congressional authorization of a land acquisition or exchange.
           3.5.15.1.7.4. Construction project management and administration not otherwise
           identified above, such as: constructability review; source selection team
           participation regarding construction issues; construction quality assurance; testing
           of materials; claims analysis; forensic work; and expert consultation, litigation, or
           other costs related to determining A&E or construction contractor liability.
           3.5.15.1.7.5. SIOH performed organically (i.e., performed by local Air Force
           employees for locally-contracted or in-house-executed projects) must also be
           taken into account both in programming (by the programmer) and in post-award
           execution (by the construction manager). For SIOH performed organically, use of
           an Air Staff-approved SIOH factor of 4% of the sum of the subtotal and
           contingency is acceptable both in programming and execution. When SIOH is
           performed organically, this effort is not actually funded (or reimbursed) from the
           project. The 4% factor represents SIOH activities performed organically and is
           considered along with actual project costs for threshold determination.
        3.5.15.1.8. Reimbursable cost of materials, supplies, services, and items of installed
        capital equipment obtained from surplus stocks at estimated fair market value. Note:
        Acquisition of such materials, supplies, and items from those sources on a non-
        reimbursable basis is prohibited.
        3.5.15.1.9. Transportation. The costs applicable to transportation of materials,
        supplies, installed capital equipment, and government-owned material and capital
        equipment necessitated by a particular project. Projects accomplished by deployable
        Air Force units (Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron
        Engineer (RED HORSE), Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF), etc.) shall
        include these costs only when a deployment is intended for the sole purpose of
        accomplishing that particular project. Transportation costs incurred by deployable
        units shall not be included as a funded project cost when the deployment is conducted
        for training purposes. Transportation costs for materials transferred between supply
        offices are not included as a funded project cost.
        3.5.15.1.10. Travel. Travel costs incurred by DoD civilian employees and military
        personnel incurred in performance of a work order/project shall be charged as a
        funded cost when such travel can be identified specifically to the order/project, in
        accordance with DoD FMR V11A, Ch. 1, Paragraph 010203.C.
28                                                        AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


        3.5.15.1.11. Disposal. Removal and disposal of construction debris, including costs
        to reimburse the base for solid waste management.
     3.5.15.2. Unfunded Costs. Unfunded project costs are those capitalized for purposes of
     real property investment but are excluded from approvals or determinations relating to
     the funded costs of facilities projects. Programmers and project managers shall consider
     the following as unfunded project costs (the list may not be all inclusive (T-0):
        3.5.15.2.1. Military labor.      All costs funded from Military Personnel
        Appropriations, except for the cost of military personnel assigned to DoD WCF
        activities. DoD WCF activities shall be reimbursed by their customers for the cost of
        military labor. See DoD FMR V11A, Ch. 1, Paragraph 010203.B.1.
        3.5.15.2.2. Depreciation. Costs applicable to the depreciation of government-owned
        equipment.
        3.5.15.2.3. Surplus stock from sources outside the Air Force. Cost of materials,
        supplies, and items of RPIE obtained for a project on a non-reimbursable basis from
        sources outside the Air Force are not included in the project cost (e.g. excess
        distributions from other government agencies).
        3.5.15.2.4. Gifts from private parties if accepted in accordance with law. See
        AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force.
        3.5.15.2.5. Personal property equipment procurement and installation.
        3.5.15.2.6. Design Services. 10 USC § 9540, Architectural and Engineering
        Services, authorizes the SECAF to engage architect-engineer services firms to
        produce and deliver designs, plans, drawings, and specifications at a cost not to
        exceed 6% of the estimated funded project cost, which is reiterated in Federal
        Acquisition Regulation, Paragraph 15.404-4(c)(4)(i)(B). For UMC projects, the costs
        of producing and delivering designs, plans, drawings, and specifications, which are
        classified as Design Services for both Design-Build and Design-Bid-Build projects,
        are statutorily limited to 6% of the estimated funded project cost. Similarly for
        maintenance and repair projects, the costs of producing and delivering designs, plans,
        drawings, and specifications, for both Design-Build and Design-Bid-Build projects,
        are limited to 6% of the estimated funded project cost. O&M-funded design is not
        required to be reported to the appropriate congressional committee. As described in
        the following paragraphs, planning and design are unfunded costs and are excluded
        from the cost for purposes of determining compliance with the amounts established in
        10 USC § 2805 for UMC and 10 USC § 2811 for repair:
            3.5.15.2.6.1. Pre-construction contract award design costs associated with
            preparation and review of contract solicitation documents, including design plans
            and specifications (completed through either A&E contracts or in-house) in
            accordance with FMR V3 Chapter 17, Paragraphs 170102.C, 170102.I.4, and
            170302.
            3.5.15.2.6.2. Post-construction contract award design costs in accordance with
            DoD FMR V3, Ch. 17, Paragraphs 170102.I.4 and 170302.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        29


         3.5.15.2.7. Engineering Services. Services other than Design Services that may be
         performed by A&E firms prior to award of a repair or UMC contract include site
         investigations, surveys, subsurface investigations, existing facility investigations, and
         presentation materials. These services, classified as Engineering Services, are not
         subject to the 6% statutory fee limitation and are classified as unfunded costs.
         3.5.15.2.8. Land. Surveys, site investigations, appraisals, and other actions required
         for procuring land.
  3.5.16. Air Force Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Planners, programmers,
  and project managers shall comply with the following when determining how to classify
  GFE. (T-0) Policy regarding GFE and accounting for GFE when developing the cost of a
  repair or UMC facility project is addressed in the DoD FMR, V4, Ch. 6, and in AFI 65-
  601V1, Chapters 10 and 21. When RPIE designated as GFE is being added to a facility
  where that specific GFE did not previously exist, such GFE is generally classified as a
  funded cost of a facility project. See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance. If GFE is
  depreciated (i.e., is not new), then the depreciated value of the GFE, as opposed to the value
  of the GFE when newly procured, should be used in calculating the funded cost of a facility
  project. When unfunded equipment (such as communications equipment, systems furniture,
  desks, chairs, electronic alarm systems, etc.) is designated as GFE, such GFE should be
  classified as an unfunded project cost. Designation of either funded RPIE or unfunded
  equipment as GFE does not change the nature of the equipment, it simply signifies that the
  equipment was procured via means other than competitive sourcing by contractor.
  Document all GFE cost decisions and determinations. Refer to AFI 32-9005 for policy
  regarding the recording of the value of GFE in real property inventory records. .
  3.5.17. Artificial Turf. When determining the benefit of artificial turf use, installations
  should consider the life-cycle cost of sustaining both the artificial and natural turf fields prior
  to installing. Refer to Paragraph 4.2.2.12 for work classification guidance regarding repair
  by replacement of natural turf with artificial turf.
     3.5.17.1. Exterior Artificial Turf, Permanently Installed. Programmers must ensure
     artificial turf used in place of grass or natural turf is considered real property, an
     improvement to land, and is programmed as a funded, capitalized cost. (T-1)
     3.5.17.2. Interior Artificial Turf, Permanently Installed. Artificial turf used as an
     interior floor surface (such as carpet or court surface) is considered an improvement to
     real property. If installed when the facility is originally constructed, programmers will
     ensure the cost of the turf is a funded cost of the construction project and value of the turf
     will be capitalized. (T-1)
     3.5.17.3. Non-permanently Installed Turf--Interior or Exterior. If artificial turf may
     be rolled up or otherwise dismantled and is removed in practice, then planners and
     programmers will ensure such turf is classified as equipment and is user-funded. (T-1)
  3.5.18. Floodplain Management. Executive Order (EO) 11988, Floodplain Management,
  requires Federal agencies to carefully consider floodplain area use. Federal Emergency
  Management Agency flood hazard insurance maps may be used to identify if an installation
  or part of an installation is located within a designated 100 year floodplain area. EO 13653,
  Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change requires Federal agencies to
 30                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


   evaluate climate change risks and vulnerabilities so as to manage effects on missions and
   operations, and tasks Federal agencies with developing and implementing climate adaptation
   plans. Paragraph 2-2.16 of UFC 2-100-01, Installation Master Planning, provides guidance
   regarding protection of facilities in flood hazard areas. These documents and pertinent
   DUSD(I&E) guidance require that DoD components comply with the following:
       3.5.18.1. Planners and programmers will ensure renovation of existing facilities or
       construction within 100-year floodplain areas is minimized, but not prohibited. (T-0)
       3.5.18.2. Programmers will document on DD Forms 1391 that flood mitigation measures
       have been incorporated in the project when renovating or constructing facilities within a
       100 year floodplain areas; in particular, for restoration and modernization projects costing
       over $7.5 million, assess the vulnerability of mechanical and/or electrical subsystems to
       flood damage and program necessary measures to mitigate those vulnerabilities (T-0)
       3.5.18.3. This policy does not apply to leased space.
3.6. Project Documentation. The BCE shall prepare appropriate project documentation and
obtain appropriate approvals based on the work classification and total funded cost of a facility
project (or aggregated projects as appropriate) prior to obligating project funds or awarding the
project (ARC units will staff approval packages for ARC-funded work). (T-1) Planning and
design may be accomplished prior to project approval. Refer to the AFAMP playbook (or ARC-
specific guidance) on the CE Portal under the Playbooks menu in the Engineering Flight
Portfolio Optimization list for processes and criteria to determine when to enter requirements
into the Civil Engineer project management database system.
   3.6.1. Work Documentation. AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request; AF Form
   327, Civil Engineering Work Order; or DD Form 1391, FY ___ Military Construction
   Project Data are all acceptable means of documenting projects. Refer to AFI 32-1001, for
   coordination requirements. At a minimum, programmers will ensure all projects forwarded
   to Air Staff or MAJCOMs are documented on a DD Form 1391. (T-1) MAJCOMs shall
   establish guidance regarding work documentation for delegated approval thresholds. See
   Attachment 2 for guidance on preparing DD Forms 1391/1391c.
   3.6.2. Programmers shall ensure project documents are sufficient to allow an independent
   reviewer to understand the requirement, the benefit, the classification of work, the total cost
   (funded and unfunded), current impact to installation mission, the impact if not provided, and
   the timing of project requirements, including all potential phases. (T-1) User organizations
   must help develop a project scope and justification for user-originated projects. The project
   programmer determines whether the requirement will be incorporated into existing project(s)
   or made into a new project (create a new project record). Documents must indicate that the
   project will incorporate life-cycle-cost-effective sustainable design and procurement
   including impact on energy and water conservation when applicable.
   3.6.3. Programmers shall ensure a project containing multiple EEICs is programmed on a
   single programming document. (T-1) Companion projects may be programmed on a single
   programming document (see Paragraph 4.2.4 for clarification on “companion” projects), but
   if programmed separately, the programming documents should reference the other project(s).
   If necessary to execute a contracting strategy or to capture other interrelated actions, multiple
   projects may be programmed on a single “shell” programming document; however, details
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 31


  for each project must be provided (see Attachment 2) either within the primary
  programming document or in separate supplemental programming documents.
  3.6.4. Project Records. The installation Civil Engineer programming and project
  management offices are responsible for establishing and maintaining project records in
  accordance with established AF standards. Project folders will be created and maintained to
  capture project documentation, including evidence of proper approval. Project information
  will be input into the current Civil Engineer electronic programming and project management
  database in accordance with AF and MAJCOM policy and guidance. The Civil Engineer
  programming chief will ensure project documentation and electronic data meet the
  requirements in Paragraph 3.6 and applicable AMP requirements. (T-1)
  3.6.5. Project Approval. Project approval requirements are defined in Chapters 4, 5, and
  7 of this Instruction. BCEs must review current requirements in a single facility to ensure
  proper approvals are received before project execution. (T-1) The appropriate approval
  authority must verify that a project is programmed according to this instruction before
  signing and dating the approval document.
     3.6.5.1. MAJCOM programmers must ensure project approval request packages coming
     to the Air Staff include at a minimum the following documents: approval request
     memorandum signed or sent by the MAJCOM Engineering Division Chief (or
     equivalent), DD1391 (per Attachment 2), economic analysis or waiver as necessary, and
     Certificate of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions (see AFI 32-1021 for Certificate
     of Compliance guidance). (T-1) MAJCOM programmers must ensure each document
     includes an approval date or the date submitted to higher approval authority. (T-1)
     Programmers must ensure project documents (DD Form 1391 or AF Form 332 or 327)
     are signed by an appropriate certifying official. (T-1) Programmers must ensure DD
     Forms 1391 forwarded to Air Staff for approval contain the following signed certification
     from the senior MAJCOM Civil Engineer: “I have reviewed this document and certify
     it is complete and accurate, and is compliant with appropriate statute(s) and
     instructions. I have validated the project’s primary and supporting costs and work
     classification. It has been fully coordinated with the user and other appropriate
     agencies and approved by the Installation Commander.” (T-1)
     3.6.5.2. Programmers must ensure DD Forms 1391 forwarded to AFCEC for central
     funding under the energy program contain the following signed certification from the
     Base Civil Engineer: “I have reviewed this document and certify it is complete and
     accurate. It meets the intent of the energy program and the project is the best
     lifecycle cost solution. I have validated the project’s primary and supporting costs,
     Building Lifecycle Cost (BLCC) and work classification. It has been fully
     coordinated with the user and other appropriate agencies, and approved by the
     Installation Commander.” (T-1)
     3.6.5.3. Changes or modifications to the project cost, during pre-award or execution,
     may cause the cost to exceed an approval threshold thus requiring re-approval or higher
     authority approval. The BCE is responsible for obtaining appropriate approval prior to
     commencement of the work that causes the project to exceed the threshold. (T-1) See
     Paragraph 4.5 for repair projects and Paragraph 5.1.2 for UMC projects.
32                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     3.6.5.4. Electronic Signature. In accordance with AFI 33-321, Authentication of Air
     Force Records, use of electronic (including digital) signatures on documents supporting
     O&M-funded projects is authorized if the signature meets the criteria established in AFI
     33-321, Paragraph 3.1.3.
  3.6.6. Economic Analysis (EA). In accordance with AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, when
  total funded costs of a project (companion projects should not be summed) exceed $2 million
  (in constant dollars with the fiscal year baseline as referenced by AFI 65-501) and repair
  costs exceed 75% of the estimated cost of a military construction project to replace the
  facility, the BCE must notify financial analysis offices that an EA must be accomplished. (T-
  1) If at any time in the life cycle of a project the cost of the project exceeds these thresholds
  (prior to award or during execution), an EA or EA waiver must be accomplished before work
  can continue. (T-1) When the project scope of work includes infrastructure or utility
  systems, see Paragraph 3.5.4 to determine the extent of the physical plant to include in the
  facility replacement value calculation.
     3.6.6.1. BCEs must ensure an EA is submitted with all relocatable facility acquisition
     requests in accordance with AFI 32-1021. (T-1)
     3.6.6.2. BCEs and MAJCOM programmers must ensure waivers to EA requirements are
     approved by SAF/FMCE, through AF/A4C. (T-1) In accordance with AFI 65-501, EA
     waiver requests shall be forwarded to higher headquarters through the functional channel
     (e.g., Civil Engineering). The functional office is responsible for obtaining FM
     coordination before forwarding to the next level.
     3.6.6.3. If an EA is necessary, MAJCOM programmers must ensure all requests for Air
     Staff repair project approval include an EA or EA waiver. (T-1) See Paragraph 4.4.
     3.6.6.4. When the facility repair cost exceeds 75% of the replacement cost is because of
     lifecycle-cost-effective energy program improvements, the BLCC analysis may be used
     in the EA justification.
  3.6.7. Emergency Projects. Emergency projects require approval at the same levels as non-
  emergency projects, in accordance with designated thresholds. However, these projects may
  follow an expedited approval request process. At minimum, the request must include a front-
  page DD Form 1391 with additional information justifying the expedited approval process.
  Emergency repair projects exceeding the congressional notification threshold may proceed
  with SAF/IEE’s approval.        However, notification to the appropriate congressional
  committees is still required. To enable notification, the installation/MAJCOM must provide
  a complete project approval request package as soon as possible.

                                            Chapter 4

                               MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR

4.1. Maintenance (EEIC 521xx). Maintenance is the recurring, day-to-day, periodic, or
scheduled work required to preserve real property facilities, systems, or components and prevent
premature failure or deterioration, so these may be effectively used for their designated purposes.
Maintenance does not change the nature or function of a facility. All maintenance is considered
Sustainment Maintenance (EEIC 521xx). When programming this work classification
programmers will ensure the first word of the project title is “Maintain”. (T-1) See Attachment
2 for details on preparing a DD1391.
   4.1.1. Work which entails the application of “protective coatings” or “sealants,” removal of
   rubber from paved surfaces, dredging of existing features (not for new construction), and
   upkeep of existing dredging spoils areas should be classified as maintenance.
   4.1.2. Sustainment Services Contracts. Each service task must be evaluated to determine
   if it is investing in (sustaining) real property or not. Grounds maintenance not associated
   with a facility project is normally funded in Facilities Operation (FO) (PEC***79). The
   following services or commodities are examples meeting the definition of “investing in (or
   sustaining) real property”. These should be classified as maintenance:
       4.1.2.1. Real property installed appliance maintenance
       4.1.2.2. Elevator inspections
       4.1.2.3. Gas line surveys
       4.1.2.4. Real property installed hoist and crane testing
       4.1.2.5. Hood and duct cleaning
       4.1.2.6. Bridge inspections; and
       4.1.2.7. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) collective protection
       system maintenance, filter replacement and periodic system recertification.
   4.1.3. Energy System Re- and Retro-Commissioning. These projects restore complex,
   high energy systems to their optimal performance and are considered “maintenance” if the
   investment is less than 25% of the replacement cost of the energy system. If the investment
   is greater than 25% of the replacement cost of the energy system, planners and programmers
   will classify the work as “repair”. (T-1)
   4.1.4. Grading. Grading required solely to remove airfield obstructions or hazards to
   navigation should be classified as maintenance. This can include seeding to control erosion.
   See Paragraph 4.2.2.11 for landscaping guidance.
   4.1.5. Maintenance Funding. Maintenance is typically funded using O&M funds, but may
   also be funded using other fund sources made available for O&M purposes (RDT&E, WCF,
   etc.). There is no limitation on the amount of O&M funds that may be used for maintenance.
   However, some MAJCOMs and installations, and the NGB, sometimes set approval
   thresholds for maintenance project approval.
 34                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


4.2. Repair Authority (EEIC 522xx and 524xx). Repair means to sustain or restore real
property and real property systems or components to such condition that they may effectively be
used for their designated functional purposes. Repair does not change the nature or function of a
facility. Repair does not normally increase the volume or footprint of a facility, although repair
may result in greater usable floor space due to interior reconfiguration. Work required solely to
comply with accessibility, health, safety, seismic, security or fire standards and codes may be
classified as repair. Real property and real property systems or components need not have failed
to permit a repair project. Repair can be Restoration and Modernization Repair (EEIC 522xx) or
Sustainment Repair (EEIC 524xx). See Paragraph 6.1 of this Instruction for further definition
and guidance on appropriate assignment of EEICs for repair class work. When programming
this work classification, planners and programmers will ensure the first word of the project title
is “Repair” or “Renovate”. (T-1) See Attachment 2 for details on preparing a DD1391.
   4.2.1. Repair Funding. 10 USC § 2811 authorizes the use of O&M funds to repair facilities
   or functional areas of multipurpose facilities (10 USC § 18233 for ARC). There is no
   limitation on the amount of O&M funds that may be used for repair, but there are approval
   and congressional notification requirements, depending upon the funded cost of the project.
   See Table 1.2. for approval and congressional notification levels. Refer to Paragraph
   3.5.15 for definitions and guidance on funded and unfunded costs. Repair work may be
   accomplished via an MCA-funded project; however, the fund source does not change the
   work classification.
   4.2.2. Replacement. Existing components of a facility may be repaired by replacement, and
   replacements can be up to current industry, Federal, DoD, or AF standards, directives, or
   codes. As examples, repair may include the following:
       4.2.2.1. Existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can be
       replaced or sized to meet current standards or codes. (Note: Installation of HVAC where
       none exists is construction.) Replacing an evaporative cooler system with a central air
       conditioning system can be considered repair if the evaporative cooler system is ducted
       and the new air conditioning system uses or replaces that same ducting, but does not
       expand or add additional ducting to areas of the facility not currently served by
       conditioned air.
       4.2.2.2. Interior rearrangements and restorations of an existing facility can be classified
       as repair if they allow for effective use of existing space or to meet current building
       standards and code requirements (e.g., accessibility, health, safety, seismic, security, and
       fire). Repairs may include the movement or reinforcement of existing interior load-
       bearing members within a facility. However, programmers must classify any interior
       reconfiguration done to a facility necessitated by a conversion (change in functional
       purpose) as construction. (T-0) See Paragraph 3.3.3 for facility conversion guidance.
       4.2.2.3. Replacement of one type of roof system (e.g., a flat roof) with another, more
       reliable or economical type of roof (e.g., sloped roof) may be considered repair, but any
       additional structural supports or framework needed for the new roof system cannot
       increase the facility structural load capacity. If structural load capacity of the facility
       (e.g., walls, columns, foundations, or other facility structural elements) is increased to
       support the load of new roof system, programmers must classify this work as construction
       (unless required solely to comply with current standards or codes). (T-1)
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    35


     4.2.2.4. Installation of exterior appurtenances as a means of complying with building
     codes and access laws is considered repair (e.g., fire escapes and elevators, even if
     enclosed, and ramps directly adjoining facilities).
     4.2.2.5. The expansion of existing or installation of new fire protection systems, to
     include reservoirs, deluge storage tanks, pipes, pumps, valves, connections, and other
     integral parts may be classified as repair if undertaken to comply with appropriate UFC
     or building codes (not driven by a conversion). Refer to UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection
     Engineering for Facilities, Paragraph 1-3.2.2, and AFI 32-10141, Planning and
     Programming Fire Safety Deficiency Correction Projects, for policy regarding the
     programming of fire protection system work when facility repair costs equal or exceed
     50% of the facility replacement cost.
     4.2.2.6. Installation of backflow prevention devices in accordance with building/uniform
     plumbing code on drinking water systems may be considered repair.
     4.2.2.7. Existing pavement facilities may be repaired by replacement. In general, any
     work to expand the footprint of a pavement facility is considered construction (see
     Paragraphs 5.1.3.8., 5.1.3.9., and 5.1.3.14). However, replacement of pavement
     facilities (see Paragraph 3.5.4 for rules on defining pavement facilities) may include
     expansion of the paved footprint and depth of any course (to include in situ subgrade) if
     required to comply with international, Federal, DoD or AF standards, directives, or
     codes. For example, replacement of a runway facility may include the addition of paved
     shoulders to comply with paragraph 3-9 of UFC 3-260-01 (in accordance with Table 3.2,
     runways and their shoulders are considered components of a single facility). In these
     cases to expand footprint, repair must include replacement of at least 50% by area of the
     existing pavement facility, unless the underlying code or standard establishes a lower
     threshold of applicability. Changing a paved surface from Asphalt Cement Concrete
     (ACC) to Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) or PCC to ACC is considered repair (e.g.,
     changing existing paved surface of parking areas, driveways, runways, and taxiways or
     installing a PCC keel on a runway to replace an ACC surface).
     4.2.2.8. Above ground utilities installed below grade may be considered repair provided
     the utility follows the same general route and does not install new utility service. The
     repair/replacement lines can be modernized and/or functionally sized to current
     requirements plus an allowance for possible growth. The “aggregation rule” (Paragraph
     4.3.3) applies to utility repairs.
     4.2.2.9. Consider each wastewater treatment plant or water treatment plant as a single
     facility (inclusive of all components, but not the external collection or distribution
     systems/lines—see Table 3.2.). Existing components of the plants can be repaired by
     replacement, functionally sized, and modernized with state-of-the-art equipment. The
     components can be installed in a new location if required to keep the existing plant
     operational throughout project execution. However, if addition of a new capability
     requires expansion of the facility footprint (such as addition of a tertiary waste treatment
     process where none existed previously), programmer must classify the work as
     construction, as noted in Paragraph 5.1.3.19. (T-0)
     4.2.2.10. Golf Courses. Refer to AFI 32-1022, for programming golf course
     maintenance and repair. For work classification determinations, components of a “golf
36                                                             AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     course playing area” per AFI 32-1022, Paragraph 4.5.4. can be repaired by replacement.
     Installation of a component where it does not currently exist is construction. (T-1)
     4.2.2.11. Landscaping or planting work done in conjunction with a facility project, which
     is on previously improved land, is classified as repair. Landscaping unimproved land is
     classified as construction. See Paragraph 4.1.4 for guidance on natural infrastructure
     work to remove hazards.
     4.2.2.12. Artificial Turf. Installations may replace natural turf on existing recreation
     fields or other improved surfaces with artificial turf and classify the work as repair. If
     classifying the work as repair, the existing improved surface must have demonstrated use
     (prior to installation of the artificial turf) as the same functional purpose it will have after
     the installation of the artificial turf. If the functional purpose of the improved surface
     changes upon installation of the artificial turf, then installation of the turf must be
     classified as construction. Installing artificial turf on unimproved land/surface must be
     classified as construction. See Paragraph 3.5.17 for programmatic definitions of
     artificial turf.
        4.2.2.12.1. Multiple fields in a single recreational complex may comprise a single
        “facility,” with a single facility number. In such a situation, when comparing a repair
        project cost to the replacement cost (in accordance with Paragraph 4.4), the
        replacement cost includes the entire facility.
        4.2.2.12.2. In accordance with Paragraph 4.4., when a project to repair a natural turf
        surface by replacing it with artificial turf will exceed 75% of the replacement cost of
        the natural turf surface if a stand-alone facility, the BCE must ensure the project is
        approved by the MAJCOM Civil Engineer. (T-1)
        4.2.2.12.3. In those instances in which the cost to repair a natural turf surface by
        replacing it with artificial turf will exceed the replacement cost of the facility (e.g.,
        when a single field is a numbered facility), it may be possible to install the artificial
        turf surface under the classification of repair if it can be shown to be more cost
        effective than replacement. On a life cycle cost basis, if an artificial turf surface is
        less expensive than a natural turf surface because of recurring maintenance costs
        (watering, grass cutting, re-striping, etc.), it may be possible to replace an existing
        natural turf surface with artificial turf that has a higher initial cost than turf
        replacement. Programmers are cautioned to cite a realistic expected life of the
        artificial turf surface to preclude bias toward installation of an artificial turf surface.
     4.2.2.13. Combat Arms Training Facilities. Unless fulfilling a temporary requirement,
     Combat Arms Training Facilities are real property. Ventilation systems, baffles, and
     manufactured bullet traps (permanently installed) may be maintained and repaired as real
     property. Installation of these where they did not previously exist is construction.
     Typically, if these components meet the following criteria, then they are RPIE: 1)
     permanently installed, 2) not relocatable in practice, and 3) integral to function of the
     facility. Verify RPIE determination with the Real Property Officer. Built-in target
     movement and retrieval systems are not considered real property or RPIE, and are the
     responsibility of the user. See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance. Refer to ETL
     11-18, Small Arms Range Design and Construction, for combat arms training facility
     standards. Cleaning, inspection, disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous residues, and
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    37


     daily maintenance of range components is the responsibility of the user to fund or
     perform. Periodic maintenance, repair, and replacement of range components, if RPIE, is
     a Civil Engineer (CE) responsibility.
     4.2.2.14. Existing CBRN collective protection systems can be replaced with
     functionally-sized, state-of-the-art systems as repair.
     4.2.2.15. To classify any other work which adds a component which did not previously
     exist, but is necessary to bring a facility into compliance with other codes as repair,
     address on a case-by-case basis with HAF/A4C.
  4.2.3. Repair and Construction. Although repair and construction may overlap to some
  degree, it is important to distinguish between the two in programming and execution. See
  Chapter 5 for examples of construction.
  4.2.4. Multiple Fund Sources, Companion Projects, and Concurrent Work.
     4.2.4.1. When repair work is to be done in a facility which requires multiple fund sources
     (to include multiple EEICs) to provide a complete and usable facility, programmers must
     ensure all work is programmed on a single programming document, but with costs
     identified separately (e.g., Restoration and Modernization [R&M] Repair EEIC 522xx,
     Sustainment Repair EEIC 524xx, and UMC EEIC 529xx, each detailed on separate line
     items). (T-1) For example, if a dormitory (reconfiguration) requires construction of
     balconies to be complete and usable, program a single project including both the
     reconfiguration work classified as repair and the balcony work classified as construction.
     Similarly, when sustainment work is to be done in a facility and R&M work is also
     necessary to allow the work to be complete and usable, programmers must ensure both
     the sustainment (EEIC 521xx or 524xx) and R&M work (522xx or 529xx) are
     programmed together, but with the costs identified separately. (T-1) The work schedule
     for multiple fund sources must identify the various elements of work in each category
     (maintenance, repair, or construction) and include the costs for each element. The above
     guidance applies to both in-house and contract work. For contract work, project
     managers and contracting officers shall make sure this requirement is explained in the
     invitation for bids or request for proposals, included in the submittals, and incorporated
     into the resulting contract. (T-1) Additionally, project managers and contracting officers
     shall ensure the contractor clearly identifies the separate categories of work on the
     contract drawings. (T-1) Also, for all contract change orders, the project managers and
     contracting officers must identify changes against the applicable work schedules, and
     compute and fund the costs accordingly. (T-1)
     4.2.4.2. Do not confuse multiple fund sources with companion projects. Companion
     projects are complete and usable on their own, whether they are from multiple fund
     sources or not, but are both necessary to fulfill the requirement (e.g. a NAF project with a
     companion demolition project). Companion projects may be programmed on a single
     programming document, but if they are in separate documents, they must refer to each
     other. Companion UMC projects must comply with Paragraph 5.2.2. guidance on
     multiple projects in a single facility.
     4.2.4.3. Concurrent projects are independent projects taking place in the same facility
     and being accomplished at approximately the same time. Concurrent projects should not
38                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     be programmed on a single programming document; however, it is acceptable to develop
     a single document that serves as a comprehensive listing of multiple concurrent projects
     for the purpose of aggregating projects to determine if total cost of repair or construction
     work within a single facility requires higher-level approval. Programmers must ensure
     that if multiple “projects” are listed in a “shell” or “umbrella” document, each project
     must still have its own programming document, and it must be clear in the
     comprehensive document that it is a compilation of separate “projects”. (T-1) See
     Paragraph 4.3.3 for the definition of current repair requirements. Programming either
     companion or concurrent projects in separate programming documents does not prevent a
     contracting strategy of combining the projects for a single acquisition.
  4.2.5. Energy and Water Conservation and Renewable Energy Improvements. When
  programming projects which achieve energy conservation, programmers shall use the “EC”
  shred as the last two digits of the EEIC (e.g., 529EC, 522EC), regardless of fund source. (T-
  1) Modernization efforts to repair or replace existing systems for energy efficiency
  improvements can be considered repair by replacement projects. Adding any of these
  capabilities where none currently exists is construction. These capabilities can include:
     4.2.5.1. Heating/cooling Systems (decentralized heat plants, energy recovery, paint
     hangar HVAC recirculation, Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory efficiencies,
     infra-red heating, destratification fans, etc.).
     4.2.5.2. Heating/cooling/fuel distribution that supports existing infrastructure.
     4.2.5.3. Water conservation/water re-use (distribution, plumbing, fixtures, controls,
     wells, no-flow, xeriscape, etc.).
     4.2.5.4. Lighting efficiencies (daylighting, replacing lighting system technologies, etc.)
     as long as no new areas are lighted.
     4.2.5.5. Sensors (CO2, occupancy sensors, etc.) that support existing infrastructure.
     4.2.5.6. Meters/hardware/software that support existing infrastructure (Energy
     Management and Control Systems, Direct Digital Controls, Supervisory Controls and
     Data Analysis, Building Automation Systems, Industrial Control Systems that support
     existing infrastructure).
     4.2.5.7. Renewable Energy systems (solar hot water, ground source heat pumps, wind,
     solar (photo-voltaic) power, solar walls, geothermal, biomass, waste-to-energy, etc.) that
     support existing electrical loads.
     4.2.5.8. Adding roofing (cool roofs, green roofs, etc.) over existing roofed areas that
     improve existing facility energy performance. See Paragraph 4.2.2 for repair by
     replacement.
  4.2.6. Sustainability and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
  (LEED). The Air Force is committed to incorporate sustainable concepts in the planning,
  programming, design, construction, and operation of facilities and infrastructure. As project
  planning and programming is the first stage of the facility development process, decisions
  made during this stage set the project direction and have the greatest impact upon facility
  life-cycle costs. Installations must comply with Air Force sustainable design and
  development guidance to the maximum extent practicable. Programmers shall ensure all
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    39


   major renovations (50% of replacement cost) which provide a significant opportunity for
   substantial improvement incorporate Federal requirements for High Performance and
   Sustainable Buildings (HPSB). (T-1) UFC 1-200-02, High Performance and Sustainable
   Building Requirements provides guidance regarding HPSB requirements. See Paragraph
   6.13 for additional sustainability guidance.
4.3. Approval and Notification Levels.
   4.3.1. Approval and congressional notification levels for repair projects are set forth in
   Paragraph 1.6 and Table 1.2. See Paragraph 3.6.5.1 for project approval request
   requirements. Maintenance projects do not require approval under 10 USC § 2811
   (MAJCOMs and installations may have approval requirements for maintenance projects).
   4.3.2. Through Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive 1-18, SECAF re-delegated 10
   USC § 2811 project approval authority to SAF/IE, who further re-delegated the authority to
   SAF/IEE. SAF/IEE re-delegated approval authority for repair projects costing $7,500,000
   and less to HQ USAF/A4C. HQ USAF/A4C further re-delegated approval authority for
   repair projects costing $5,000,000 and less to each MAJCOM’s senior civil engineer, who
   may re-delegate as desired. Failure to seek proper approval before obligating project repair
   funds can expose personnel to a possible statutory violation. In a multi-phase project (single
   facility) which costs more than $7,500,000, failure to obtain SAF/IEE’s approval of all
   phases before obligating funds on any phase may expose personnel to a statutory violation.
   See Paragraph 3.6.5.1 for project approval request requirements.
   4.3.3. “Aggregation Rule”. Programmers shall ensure all current repair requirements in a
   facility are combined when determining the appropriate approval authority for a repair
   project. (T-1) Current repair requirements means anticipated repair requirements in a
   facility which are needed and planned for accomplishment during the current fiscal year (FY)
   to include in-house work exceeding $50,000. If a new requirement arises it must be
   aggregated with other known requirements within the current FY for approval threshold
   determination, even if those other requirements have been previously approved or awarded.
   Also, all phases (see guidance in Paragraph 3.5.2) of a repair requirement, even though they
   extend beyond the current FY, must be included in the current repair requirements. Do not
   include in the aggregation requirements/projects or phases of projects that have been awarded
   in previous FYs. However, approval requests should reference phases awarded in previous
   FYs. Un-awarded, previous-FY projects must either be cancelled or updated to reflect the
   newly required FY and must be considered current repair requirements. If the cost of un-
   awarded, previous FY, current year requirements, and new current requirements in aggregate
   exceeds the current approval authority, the BCE must seek appropriate approval authority for
   the combined cost. (T-1) Note: Do not manipulate the timing of a repair project or ignore
   repair requirements to influence a project’s appropriate approval level. See Table 4.1 for an
   example of determining the current repair requirement.

Table 4.1. Example of Determining the Current Repair Requirement.
Situation for Building XXX Requirements:
Current FY:
     -$1,500,000 plumbing project, unforeseen last FY.
     -Phase 2 of previously-approved HVAC replacement awarded for $2,000,000
 40                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


      -FY-1: Awarded $2,500,000 HVAC repair (Phase 1) as part of a multi-year phased
      requirement to replace the entire HVAC system in the facility. Total HVAC requirement is
      phased over three fiscal years and approved by AF/A4C for a total of $6,200,000.
      FY+1:
      -$4,000,000 of repair requirements unrelated to the phased HVAC requirement, which are
      planned to be executed before the end of the next FY in the same facility.
      -Phase 3 of previously-approved HVAC replacement for $1,700,000
Policy:
For determining the current approval authority, sum the following requirements:
      -Repair projects identified as needed and planned for the current fiscal year, including
      projects already awarded during the current fiscal year,
      -Phases of an ongoing multi-phase, multi-year project awarded in the current fiscal year
      and planned for the current and future fiscal years on the subject facility.
      -All unawarded, approved requirements. This ensures requirements are not split over
      consecutive years to avoid approval and notification.
Outcome:
The current repair requirement includes the unforeseen $1,500,000 plumbing project plus phases
2 ($2,000,000) and 3 ($1,700,000) of the HVAC replacement project
                        $1,500,000 + 2,000,000+ $1,700,000= $5,200,000
Because aggregation of the current repair requirement exceeds the MAJCOM approval authority,
AF/A4C approval is required.
The $4,000,000 in other repair requirements for next FY does not need to be included in the
current year request. However, next FY, the $4,000,000 work must be aggregated with any
other repair requirements in that FY, including previously-approved phases.
Note:
As demonstrated in this example, repair approval levels specified in Table 1.2. are not applied to
just the individual projects; they are applied to multiple repair requirements in a facility. When
unforeseen requirements arise, MAJCOMs and installations must review current
requirements to determine if reapproval is required.
   4.3.4. After approving O&M-funded repair projects in a single facility (individually or in
   aggregate) estimated to exceed $7,500,000 SAF/IEE will report the approval to the
   appropriate congressional committees and such projects may not proceed until AF/A4CF
   notifies the MAJCOM that the congressional notification has been completed. Failure to
   obtain SAF/IEE approval of such projects prior to the obligation of funds is a statutory
   violation. See Attachment 2, Paragraph A2.14 for details on the contents of a project
   approval request package. ARC will establish procedures within their respective chains to
   obtain necessary SAF/IEE approvals and notifications for O&M-funded projects.
   4.3.5. The “aggregation rule” (Paragraph 4.3.3) does not apply to emergency repairs
   required solely to correct a life, health, or safety threatening deficiency. However,
   emergency projects, standing alone, require approval at the appropriate level prior to
   obligating funds (without regard to other pending non-emergency repair projects), to include
   modifications or other changes. Programmers and project managers must ensure proper
   approval is in place prior to funds obligation. (T-0) See Paragraph 3.6.7 for additional
   emergency project guidance.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      41


4.4. Economic Analysis and Cost Effectiveness. If current repair requirements (defined in
Paragraph 4.3.3) exceed the EA thresholds and meet criteria laid out in Paragraph 3.6.6, the
BCE must ensure an EA documenting that repair is more cost effective than constructing a new
facility or EA waiver accompanies the DD Form 1391. (T-1) MAJCOM Civil Engineers must
approve requests to perform facility repairs (including EEIC 524xx sustainment repairs) which
exceed 75% of the estimated cost of a military construction project to replace the facility. (T-1)
See Paragraph 3.5.1 for facility replacement cost policy.
   4.4.1. Facilities on National Register of Historic Places. Repairs to facilities eligible for
   listing or listed on the National Register of Historic Places should be more cost effective than
   replacement. However, exceptions may be requested and require documentation from the
   State Historic Preservation Office noting that the repairs for the facility in question must be
   undertaken as proposed and the facility cannot be demolished.                  Even with this
   documentation, an exception is not assured.
   4.4.2. Replacing Overhead Electrical Distribution Facilities. In a case where overhead
   electrical distribution is being replaced with an underground system for the purposes of
   reduced maintenance cost, mitigating storm susceptibility, or AT mitigation, the repair cost
   may exceed the replacement cost of the portion of the system being moved underground. At
   minimum, for any project under this exception programmers must secure MAJCOM Civil
   Engineer approval. (T-1) Approval thresholds for staffing beyond the MAJCOM apply. A
   request for approval must include justification explaining the benefits.
4.5. Re-Approval “125% Rule”. Repair cost increases may not exceed 125% of the approved
amount without re-approval by the appropriate approval authority. When multiple projects are
approved in aggregate, each individual project will require re-approval at the 125% cost increase
threshold by the appropriate approval authority for that individual project. If the cost increase
for any individual project causes the aggregate total to exceed 125% of the approved aggregate
amount, the aggregated projects must be re-approved. Programmers or project managers must
ensure the work causing an individual project or aggregated projects to exceed 125% of the
approved amount does not commence until approved or re-approved by the appropriate
authority. (T-1) See Paragraph 4.3.3 for aggregation requirements.
   4.5.1. Cost Increase and Re-approval. Once approval for a scope of work is obtained in
   accordance with Paragraph 4.3, repairs may proceed without further review under 10 USC §
   2811. If, after AF/A4C approves an O&M-funded-repair project costing over $5,000,000
   and project costs later exceed $7,500,000, programmers or project managers must request
   SAF/IEE approval, including notification to the appropriate congressional committees,
   regardless of whether the cost is 125% of the approved amount. (T-0) The BCE must ensure
   any portion of the work that will cause the project (including all phases) to exceed
   $7,500,000 shall not start until after approval by SAF/IEE and SAF/IEE’s necessary report to
   the appropriate congressional committee is complete. (T-0) Do not proceed with obligation
   of funds until AF/A4CF provides written notification that the congressional notification and
   waiting period is complete.
   4.5.2. If modifications or additional phases of an already-approved project will cause the
   total project cost to exceed the current approval level or change the approved scope,
   programmers or project managers must obtain appropriate approval prior to obligating funds
   for the newly-added repair. (T-1) Also, if other current repair requirements in the same
42                                                       AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


  facility collectively cost more than the currently-approved level, programmers or project
  managers must ensure funds for the repair causing the aggregated amount to exceed the
  approval level may not be obligated until appropriate approval is obtained. (T-1)
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      43


                                           Chapter 5

                        UNSPECIFIED MINOR CONSTRUCTION

5.1. Unspecified Minor Construction (EEIC 529xx). The source of funds for UMC can be
either O&M or Military Construction Appropriations (MCA), which is referred to as unspecified
minor military construction (UMMC). This Instruction does not provide guidance for MCA-
funded UMMC. See AFI 32-1021 for MCA-funded UMMC guidance. As discussed in Chapter
1, under 10 USC § 2805 the cost of an O&M-funded UMC project may not exceed $750,000
($4,000,000 for laboratory revitalization and recapitalization projects).
   5.1.1. Construction. Construction means to build, develop, convert, or extend real property
   and real property systems or components, or any acquisition of land. It includes erecting,
   installing, or assembling a new facility; adding, expanding, extending, or converting an
   existing facility; or relocating an existing facility. This definition includes RPIE installed
   and made a part of such facilities, and related site preparation (excavation, filling,
   landscaping, or other land improvements). See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance.
   The product of a construction project must be complete and functional for its intended
   purpose. Refer to the examples of construction class work provided in this chapter to
   determine what constitutes construction. When programming this work classification within
   the Air Force Civil Engineering project management database, programmers will ensure the
   first word of the project title is “Construct” or “Add.” (T-1) See Attachment 2 for details
   on preparing a DD1391.
       5.1.1.1. Facility Conversion. As defined in Paragraph 3.3.3, conversion takes place
       when the functional purpose of a facility or portion of a facility changes from one of the
       Functional Purpose Categories outlined in Table 3.1 to another. The work necessary to
       affect the change in functional purpose is classified as construction, including interior
       reconfiguration. The work consistent with sustainment of the facility may be classified as
       repair or maintenance. When undertaking conversion work, programmers will take
       account of all work to be done, and properly classify each portion of the work according
       to the guidance of this paragraph. (T-1) The sum of the construction work and the sum of
       the repair work is each subject to respective approval thresholds. The total project (both
       the repair and construction work), must result in a complete and usable facility.
       Programmers will document the justification for classifying the work. (T-1)
       5.1.1.2. Classifying Post-Conversion Work. Within 24 months following a facility
       conversion (as defined in Paragraph 3.3.3) work consistent with sustainment of the
       facility, regardless of function, can be classified as maintenance or repair as appropriate.
       However, during this 24-month time period, work not considered consistent with
       sustainment, regardless of function, is construction. The 24-month “clock” begins upon
       award of a conversion project or the first demonstrated use of the affected portion of the
       facility as its new function (where a change in functional use occurs without or before
       construction) documented by a memorandum for record signed by the real property
       officer, whichever occurs first. If work is necessary to meet current standards or codes
       and is solely driven by the conversion (new function) within the 24 months following
       conversion, then the work must be classified as construction. If the work necessary to
       meet current standards or codes is justifiable regardless of the change in functional

     purpose, it can be classified as repair. Advise the real property accountable officer to
     complete AF Form 123 to document a category code change. Note: A category code
     change is not the equivalent of change in functional purpose.
  5.1.2. Cost Increases. Programmers or project managers shall ensure UMC cost increases
  do not exceed 125% of the approved amount without reapproval by the appropriate approval
  authority. (T-1) Programmers or project managers shall ensure that at no time may a UMC
  project exceed statutory thresholds. (T-0) Re-approval at the appropriate level is required if
  UMC project cost increases cause the total funded cost to exceed the current approval
  threshold. The BCE must ensure management controls are in place until project financial
  closeout to ensure total obligated costs do not exceed approval levels. (T-1)
  5.1.3. Specific Projects Classified as Construction. The following will, as a minimum, be
  classified as construction and, subject to the other limitations in this instruction, will qualify
  as UMC unless required solely to comply with accessibility, health, safety, seismic, security
  or fire standards and codes:
     5.1.3.1. Creating new or enlarging existing real property facilities (volume or footprint),
     including adding mezzanines (unless installed as free standing equipment), or expanding
     the coverage of real property facility systems or components which are not inside a
     building. However, during repair, these systems may be resized to current requirements
     (for example, replacing 8-inch pipe with 12-inch pipe) plus some allowance for possible
     future growth is repair.
     5.1.3.2. The decision to replace, rather than repair, a facility shall be based on sound
     engineering judgment, an EA, and be in the long term best interests of the Air Force. See
     Paragraph 4.4
     5.1.3.3. Purchase and installation of RPIE when the RPIE did not previously exist. See
     AFI 32-9005, Attachment 2, for a representative list of equipment that is considered as
     RPIE. RPIE determinations are made by AF/A4C in accordance with applicable General
     Services Administration and DoD policy. See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance.
     5.1.3.4. Expansion of any part of a facility’s foundation system beyond its current
     footprint and elevation, or expansion of functional space, including, but not limited to,
     ground level landings and sidewalk systems, balconies, and new basement areas.
     5.1.3.5. Increases to a facility’s total volume, although increases in the existing usable
     floor space and interior volume are properly classified as repair if they result from
     rearranging the existing space within a facility (i.e., the overall footprint of the facility
     did not increase). Refer to Paragraph 5.1.1.1. and 5.1.1.2 for conversion restrictions.
     5.1.3.6. Installation of building systems not presently installed (e.g., upgrading an
     existing ventilation system with air conditioning and/or heating).
     5.1.3.7. All work required to relocate a facility, including transportation, site work at the
     new location, and restoration of the vacated site.
     5.1.3.8. Upgrading the surface of unpaved roads, walks, trails, parking areas, driveways,
     runways, and taxiways; for instance, converting from unimproved soil to crushed
     rock/gravel or from crushed rock/gravel to asphalt pavement.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     45


     5.1.3.9. Increasing the footprint of existing paved surfaces. One exception is noted in
     Paragraph 4.2.2.7
     5.1.3.10. Changing the permanent route of roads, walks, trails, or other real property
     transportation systems, except when done solely to reduce the cost resulting from, or to
     avoid, unacceptable traffic disruption during repair. Costs to temporarily reroute traffic
     during repair projects are an integral part of the repair and should be classified as repair.
     5.1.3.11. Installation of real property walkways.
     5.1.3.12. Installation of roadway accessories such as curbs and gutters, not currently in
     place.
     5.1.3.13. Installation of bicycle or jogging paths and related benches, lighting, or other
     real property support structures.
     5.1.3.14. Installation of underground storm water conveyance systems not currently in
     place.
     5.1.3.15. Except to rectify code deficiencies (e.g., adding fire suppression systems),
     adding or expanding utility service (water, electric, HVAC, etc.) to a section of a building
     that currently does not have it (refer to Paragraph 4.2.2. for repair examples), to include
     the completion of any previous work associated with the expansion (e.g., adding
     plumbing fixtures to previously “roughed in” plumbing).
     5.1.3.16. Adding an additional story (including a mezzanine) within the existing
     footprint and volume of a facility. Any added space must be within the allowed square
     footage (see AFMAN 32-1084 or ANGH 32-1084 for ANG facilities).
     5.1.3.17. Installation of airfield navigational aids to include airfield lighting except
     upgrading existing aids and lighting to comply with applicable codes and AF standards.
     5.1.3.18. Installation of a protective cap on a solid waste landfill. Scope of work
     includes but is not limited to required sediment and erosion controls, establishing proper
     subgrade slopes, installing landfill gas vent wells and stone trenches, installing
     geosynthetic gas vent/liner/drainage layers, final cover soils, and the
     relocation/consolidation of waste material found unexpectedly outside the reported limits
     of waste.
     5.1.3.19. Adding or installing a new treatment component to a wastewater or water
     treatment plant that did not previously exist and that creates new footprint for the plant,
     even if done to meet code or standards.
     5.1.3.20. Allied support (e.g., site work, foundations, utilities, etc.) to non-RPIE is
     considered real property and is a Civil Engineer responsibility. Adding allied support
     that did not previously exist shall be classified as construction. For guidance regarding
     allied support for temporary facilities, see Paragraph 3.5.9.
     5.1.3.21. Any acquisition of land is classified as construction. If land acquisition is
     associated with another project, it is a funded cost to the project. Independent land
     acquisition is programmed as a construction project.
 46                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


5.2. Consolidating Projects.
   5.2.1. General Rule. Planners and programmers will plan and program all known UMC
   work required for a facility within the next 12 months (do not split the full requirement to
   stay under a cost threshold), whether O&M- or MCA-funded for accomplishment as a single
   construction project. (T-1) The 12-month window is defined as completion (placed-in-
   service date) of one project and start (award) of the next project or upon the start of
   construction for non-contract projects. Planners and programmers shall not combine funds
   from different appropriations (i.e., O&M, P-341-UMMC, RDT&E, and NAF) for a single
   UMC project, although you may program certain APF activities within a NAF facility (e.g., a
   military clothing sales store in a base exchange). (T-0) SAF/IEE must approve the combined
   use of APF and NAF for construction in a NAF facility, regardless of cost (see AFI 32-1022).
   UMC may be phased as long as the total cost of all phases does not exceed the statutory limit
   for minor construction. Phases are defined as being interdependent in achieving an overall
   requirement or objective, and are complete and usable on their own.
   5.2.2. Exceptions to Consolidation. Exceptions to the criteria for combining construction
   work into a single project as outlined in Paragraph 5.2.1. are as follows:
       5.2.2.1. The requirement for an additional construction project in a 12-month period
       could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time the previous construction project
       was initiated; or
       5.2.2.2. The requirement for an additional construction project is for an area of the
       facility with a different category code. Each project must be independently complete and
       usable, must be in clearly unrelated and noncontiguous areas of the building, and each
       programmed separately with its own approval threshold and statutory limit. For
       infrastructure and utility systems, construction on clearly unrelated and noncontiguous
       components of the system can be programmed as separate undertakings, each with its
       own approval threshold and statutory limit.
   5.2.3. Approval for Multiple Construction Projects. To carry out any of the exceptions
   noted in Paragraph 5.2.2 programmers must obtain prior written approval (signed
   programming documents) by the senior MAJCOM CE when the total, combined funded
   construction cost of such projects in a single FY exceeds the UMC statutory limit. (T-1)
5.3. Sustainability. Planners and programmers shall ensure all new vertical construction
meeting United States Green Building Council LEED Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs)
fully incorporate Federal requirements for HPSB. (T-0) See Paragraph 4.2.6 for additional
guidance regarding HPSV requirements. New vertical construction not meeting these MPRs
shall incorporate these Federal standards to the maximum extent practicable. Additionally,
installations must comply with Air Force sustainable design and development guidance. See
Paragraph 6.13 for additional sustainability guidance.
5.4. Aircraft Sunshades. AF/A4L establishes AF policy on aircraft sunshades. Siting,
energy/water consumption systems, and other considerations must be approved by the
installation Facilities Board. Allied support, such as power or water up to a stub at the sunshade
location, is considered real property and is a Civil Engineer responsibility. Adding allied support
that did not previously exist shall be classified as construction. See Paragraph 6.18 for
additional guidance on aircraft sunshades.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        47


                                            Chapter 6

                     SPECIAL PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS

6.1. Fund Source Categories. This paragraph addresses the source of funds for O&M-funded
work classified according to Chapters 4 and 5. It is critical that programmers first correctly
identify the work classification when programming projects to determine the appropriate
approval authority thresholds and fund sources. (T-0) Work classifications (maintenance,
repair, and construction) as well as demolition should not be confused with fund source
categories (Sustainment and R&M). Work classification, not fund source, determines O&M
threshold amounts for S/R&M projects. After the work has been classified, the proper O&M
funding category can be determined, as defined in Paragraphs 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 6.1.3 below.
O&M S/R&M funds (3400) are provided in two PECs: PEC ***78F, Sustainment and PEC
***76F, Restoration and Modernization.
   6.1.1. Sustainment.
       6.1.1.1. Sustainment Maintenance. Maintenance includes work to maintain the
       inventory of real property assets through its expected service life. It includes regularly
       scheduled adjustments and inspections, and preventive maintenance tasks. Maintenance
       is routinely completed through the Recurring Work Program and Direct Scheduled Work
       Program. There may be times when a contract effort is necessary to complete
       maintenance work. See Paragraph 4.1.2. for examples of contract maintenance work.
       Assign these projects EEIC 521xx (Sustainment Maintenance). All funded costs, in-
       house or contract, for this work should be charged to PEC ***78F. Refer to Paragraph
       6.2.1 for environmental compliance funding eligibility.
       6.1.1.2. Sustainment Repair. Sustainment repair includes scheduled repair activities to
       maintain the inventory of real property assets enabling them to reach their expected
       service life. It includes emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. It also
       includes major repairs or replacement of facility components (usually accomplished by
       contract) that are expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities, and
       any repairs to inadequately-sustained components. This work includes regular roof
       replacement that does not upgrade the facility’s structural members, refinishing of wall
       surfaces, repairing and replacement of heating and cooling systems, replacing tile and
       carpeting and similar types of work. Timing of the work (within or post life cycle) isn’t
       the determining factor between sustainment and R&M—the purpose of the work is the
       primary factor. Life cycle repairs accomplished post-expected life cycle (e.g., deferred,
       delayed, neglected) are still sustainment repairs. Use Asset Management concepts and
       tools to identify and program life cycle sustainment projects. Assign these projects EEIC
       524xx (Sustainment Repair). All costs for this work should be charged to Program
       Element ***78F. Refer to Paragraph 6.2.1 for environmental compliance funding
       eligibility. See Paragraph A3.2. for more details and examples for sustainment funding.
   6.1.2. Restoration and Modernization.
       6.1.2.1. Restoration Repair. Includes repair and replacement work to restore facilities
       collaterally damaged due to inadequately sustained components, natural disaster, fire,
       accident or other causes. This is considered non-life cycle repair of real property.
48                                                          AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


     Programmers shall assign these projects EEIC 522xx (Restoration & Modernization
     Repair). (T-1) All costs for this work should be charged to PEC ***76F. In the case of
     repairs necessary because of inadequate sustainment, any work required to directly
     resolve the lack of sustainment is still considered sustainment repair (not to include
     collateral damage).
     6.1.2.2. Modernization Repair. Includes alteration of facilities or components solely to
     implement new or higher standards (including regulatory changes and code compliance),
     or to accommodate new functions. This is considered non-life cycle repair of real
     property. Exceptions include work associated with functional conversion and work
     classified as construction (see Paragraph 5.1.3). Programmers shall assign these
     projects EEIC 522xx (Restoration & Modernization Repair). (T-1) All costs for this
     work should be charged to PEC ***76F
     6.1.2.3. Modernization Minor Construction. Includes work associated with functional
     conversion and work classified as UMC (see Paragraph 5.1.3). Programmers shall
     assign these projects EEIC 529xx (Minor Construction). (T-1) All costs for this work
     should be charged to PEC ***76F.
  6.1.3. Examples. Detailed examples of these categories of work are in Attachment 3.
  Refer to Paragraph 6.2.1 for environmental compliance funding eligibility.
  6.1.4. Demolition and Consolidation.
     6.1.4.1. Demolition. Programmers shall assign contract costs for independent facility
     demolition work PE***93F, EEIC 53601, Building Demolition. (T-1) When demolition
     is required to comply with AT requirements, assign EEIC 536XT. If demolition work is
     required to accomplish an UMC project or a repair project (i.e., the project depends on
     the demolition), the cost for demolition or removal work is a cost of the associated
     project and will be funded as an integral part of the associated project and carries the
     same class of work and (EEIC) as the associated project.
     6.1.4.2. Consolidation. Consolidation may be performed using PE***93F, EEIC 53601,
     Building Demolition, if the consolidation includes demolition. See Paragraph 3.3.1
     and 3.3.2 for definitions of demolition and consolidation. Any consolidation effort using
     PEC ***93F funds must include demolition that results in a net reduction of real
     property. Programmers or project managers must ensure the associated demolition work
     is awarded no later than the end of the period of performance of the consolidation project.
     (T-1) Design of a consolidation project which includes demolition may be funded with
     PEC ***93F funds. Consolidation-related work also may be funded with other PECs.
     Work classified as repair will be properly assigned Element of Expense Investment Code
     (EEIC) 522xx or 524xx, minor construction work will be assigned EEIC 529xx, and
     demolition work will be assigned EEIC 53601 (536XT for AT demolition requirements).
     Programmers must ensure the programming document indicates the appropriate Element
     of Expense Investment Code (EEIC) for the type of fund being used. (T-1)
  6.1.5. Programming for Different Fund Categories within a Single Project. If a single
  requirement includes both Sustainment work and R&M work which are dependent upon each
  other for the facility to be complete and usable, programmers shall ensure each type of work
  is accounted for separately, but programmed within the same project and on a single
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     49


   programming document. (T-1) If multiple requirements in a facility are independent of each
   other, then they can be programmed on separate programming documents.
   6.1.6. Program Element Code (PEC) and Element of Expense Investment Code
   (EEIC). Refer to Table 6.1 for the most commonly-used PECs aligned to each MAJCOM.
   Customers’ funding may require deviations from this table. Designating the proper EEIC
   may depend on several factors (work classification, acquisition method, type of project, etc.).
   The first three digits of many EEICs are discussed throughout this Instruction. Table 6.2
   lists the EEICs assigned to work classifications.

   6.1.7. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Restrictions. Major
   Force Program-11 (MFP-11) for facility O&M supports only minor construction (PEC 19578
   and EEIC 529xx) and only for special operations-specific requirements. When a USSOCOM
   unit is a tenant, the BCE shall ensure the USSOCOM senior civil engineer representative is
   included in MFP-11-funded project approval. (T-1)
6.2. Other Funding Considerations.
   6.2.1. Environmental Quality (EQ) Funding Eligibility. Primarily, EQ funding is to be
   used for the cost of initial construction, modification, or upgrade of a facility, system or
   component(s) to comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Once constructed,
   maintenance and repair of these systems should be accomplished with S/R&M funds even if
   the need to perform maintenance or repair is to satisfy environmental requirements, as cited
   by an environmental law, regulation, or permit. However, EQ funding is to be used for
   construction, modification, or upgrade necessary to comply with new or increased EQ
   requirements. See AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, for additional guidance on
   programming environmental projects and information on EQ exceptions including limited
   exemption on using EQ to address formal Enforcement Actions.
   6.2.2. Funding of Replacement Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE). If RPIE is
   being replaced and worked properly when originally installed, the repair or replacement of
   the item should be funded using O&M funds. Programmers and project managers shall
   ensure O&M funds are not used, regardless of funding source, to correct deficiencies in
   MCA-funded projects (when a component of the original MCA-funded construction has
   never functioned properly whether due to inadequate design, construction, or installation),
   including RPIE, throughout the life of the facility. (T-0) This is applicable whether the
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     51


   equipment is being replaced as part of a larger repair project or as a stand-alone replacement.
   If the equipment was initially and properly funded with procurement funds, then it is not real
   property and its replacement would be funded with procurement funds. See Paragraph
   3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance.
6.3. Joint Basing Responsibilities. Guidance regarding joint basing facilities management
responsibilities has been promulgated in Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Installations and
Environment) memorandum of 15 April 2008 “Department of Defense Supplemental Guidance
for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base”, AF/A4C memorandum of 27 April 2011 “Air
Force Guidance for Military Construction (MILCON) Programming and Budgeting at Joint
Bases”, and subsequent guidance that supersedes or supplements this existing guidance.
Memoranda of Agreement will govern where applicable. Questions regarding S/R&M
responsibilities at specific installations may be directed to AF/A4C.
6.4. Use of Troop Labor. As discussed in Paragraph 3.5.15.2., troop labor is an unfunded
project cost (except for the cost of military personnel assigned to DoD WCF activities).
Programmers and project managers must ensure the MAJCOM Civil Engineer responsible for
the real property being constructed or repaired approves minor construction or repair projects in
the United States, including Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, planned for
accomplishment with RED HORSE or Prime BEEF, if total funded and unfunded costs exceed
$750,000. (T-1) For ANG, SAF/IEE approval is required. The policy to combine funded and
unfunded costs is in consideration of fair competition with local contractors. This policy does
not apply to any other locations. Nothing in this paragraph affects the statutory limitations and
approval levels designated in Chapter 1 of this Instruction for funded project cost. Retain
documentation for such projects totaling over $100,000 at the installation. This policy does not
apply to facilities constructed with NAF.
6.5. Augmenting In-House Work Force. Programmers and project managers shall ensure the
MAJCOM Civil Engineer approves repair projects over $750,000 planned for accomplishment
by augmenting the in-house workforce with civilian overhires or temporary duty personnel. (T-
1) Further approvals may be required per the approval levels designated in Chapter 1 of this
Instruction.
   6.5.1. To use civilian overhires or temporary duty augmentees in the U.S., the Installation
   Commander must certify at least one of the following conditions exists: (1) use of troop labor
   or overhires is required as a consequence of a labor strike which precludes work being done
   on schedule, and delay will seriously impede the Air Force mission; (2) there are no
   responsive bids to an Air Force invitation for bids or request for proposals; (3) security
   clearance requirements prevent contractor accomplishment; (4) there is an overriding
   urgency for completion of the project by a specified date, not allowing time to prepare
   detailed plans and specifications; or (5) the safety and health of workers or the public is
   jeopardized. (T-1)
   6.5.2. Projects with scopes of work limited to demolition and asbestos and lead based paint
   abatement may be accomplished by organic, temporary duty, overhire, or contract labor, so
   long as the choice is made to achieve best value for the Air Force while continuing to
   recognize the imperatives of mission accomplishment, and adherence to the principles and
   provisions of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. This limited authority will
 52                                                          AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


   not be used in conjunction with repair projects and must be supported by an EA that
   compares contract accomplishment to other options considered.
6.6. Host-Tenant Relationships and Responsibilities.
   6.6.1. Host Base Planning Responsibility. Tenants will provide appropriate input to hosts
   in the preparation, implementation, and maintenance of the Installation Development Plan
   (IDP). The host planners will work with tenants to integrate tenant plans into the IDP. (T-1)
   The host installation approves facility projects as determined through delegation of authority
   regardless of which organization provides project funds (ARC units will staff approval
   packages for ARC-funded projects).
   6.6.2. Tenant Planning Responsibility. A tenant is responsible for providing the host with
   the tenant’s requirements and justification data to support construction and repair projects
   using the host installation requirements identification process (normally an AF Form 332).
   Tenants shall have membership in the host installation’s Facility Board. See AFI 32-10142,
   Facilities Board, for additional guidance.
   6.6.3. Host-Tenant O&M Funding and Programming Responsibility.
      6.6.3.1. Air Force Tenants on Air Force Installations (Intraservice). An Air Force
      host is responsible, in Air Force buildings with Air Force tenants, for funding all
      Sustainment requirements. The tenant is responsible for prioritizing and advocating all
      Restoration and Modernization (R&M) requirements with their parent MAJCOM. Parent
      MAJCOMs must incorporate and prioritize requirements of subordinate units which are
      tenants on other Air Force installations. Tenants without a parent MAJCOM must
      advocate for their R&M requirements through the host installation’s Facility Board.
      Paragraphs 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 provide the definitions of Sustainment and R&M
      respectively. Nothing precludes a tenant from funding facility support it deems
      necessary. The tenant must follow appropriate procedures for coordinating S/R&M
      projects with the host. The tenant’s real property permit and current support agreement
      may require reimbursement for specific support provided by the host.
      6.6.3.2. Contractor, Interservice, Interdepartmental, and Interagency Tenants. The
      real property permit, license, lease, or other outgrant to the tenant, and the current
      Support Agreement with the tenant, provide guidance for determining when a tenant will
      provide reimbursement for support provided by the host.
      6.6.3.3. The Air Force host is responsible for preparing or overseeing development of
      programming documents and obtaining proper project approval (per re-delegated
      approval authority thresholds), unless otherwise specified in a Memorandum of
      Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding, or current Support Agreement (ARC units
      will staff approval request packages for ARC-funded work). See Paragraph 6.10 for
      fuel system projects. The Air Force host shall program all O&M-funded facility
      requirements for new mission beddowns, including existing facility deficiencies,
      regardless of work classification, in accordance with AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
      Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems.
      6.6.3.4. The tenant is responsible for advocating for or funding projects unique to the
      operation of the tenant, such as rearrangement of interior partitions to improve operations
      or force protection measures necessitated by the nature of the tenant’s operation.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  53


       6.6.3.5. ANG. See Paragraph 6.7 for ANG facility considerations.
6.7. Air National Guard Facilities Considerations.
   6.7.1. ANG Facilities on Other Component Installations. The ANG is responsible for
   authorizing and funding all maintenance, repair, and construction projects for licensed,
   exclusive use ANG facilities per AFI 32-1012, Reserve Components Facilities Programs.
   The host installation engineer must review all ANG-funded construction and repair projects
   for potential conflict with other installation work. When the ANG is a tenant, the host is
   responsible for all O&M costs of jointly used areas which are not licensed to the ANG.
   O&M costs for unlicensed facilities used by ANG personnel performing an active duty
   mission shall be provided by the MAJCOM responsible for the mission.
   6.7.2. ANG Cooperative Agreements. ANG S/R&M (O&M) projects outside Air Force
   owned or leased property require an agreement between the ANG and local authority. This is
   done via a Military Construction Cooperative Agreement (MCCA). The MCCA program is
   comprised of requirements for the terms, conditions, and cost sharing ratios for the ANG
   share of improvements on non-federal land--refer to NGR 5-1, Grant and Cooperative
   Agreements, Chapter 40. For design and execution of ANG S/R&M projects, refer to ANGI
   32-1023, Criteria and Standards for Air National Guard Construction.
6.8. Air Force Reserves Facilities Considerations. Refer to AFRCH 32-1001 for guidelines
and information for facility requirements in support of AFRC missions.
6.9. Energy/Water Conservation. Incorporate energy/water efficient features to the maximum
extent possible in all construction and repair projects. See UFC 1-200-02 for energy criteria.
   6.9.1. To help meet the mandated energy/water goals, several different funding sources for
   capital investments may be available for renewable energy, energy conservation and water
   conservation projects. Sources can include regular MCA funds, regular S/R&M funds;
   Energy Initiative funds; Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) funds (Energy
   MILCON); Research, Development, Test & Evaluation; Environmental Security Technology
   Certification Program; Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) funds; and grants.
   Non-appropriated funds (NAF) may be used to fund energy and water conservation projects
   for facilities and activities where NAF is the appropriate fund source.
   6.9.2. Contact AFCEC regarding latest energy guidance pertinent to preparing project
   submittals and submit through MAJCOM.
       6.9.2.1. The Energy Initiative Funds are funds centrally managed by the AFCEC Energy
       Directorate (AFCEC/CN).
       6.9.2.2. ECIP funds are managed by OSD and administered by AFCEC/CN.
   6.9.3. Other funding sources include third-party-financed projects, such as Energy Savings
   Performance Contracts (ESPCs), Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs), and Renewable
   Energy Power Purchase Agreements. However, before considering these funding sources,
   installation or MAJCOM engineers must contact AFCEC/CN for process, approval, and
   implementation details. Third party financing of projects is normally considered when there
   are not sufficient funds available for a direct Air Force capital investment. Transportation
   Working Capital Fund (TWCF), Medical, and Defense Commissary Agency (DECA)
   projects are excluded from consideration for NRG funding and are managed by others.
 54                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


6.10. Petroleum, Oil, Lubricant (POL) Systems. Defense Logistics Agency-Energy (DLA-E)
funds and is responsible for project approval on Air Force installations (including ANG
installations) for the fuel systems and related appurtenances which receive, store, and dispense
DLA-E-owned fuels.          For guidance regarding POL project requirements, to include
programming and documentation, contact DLA-E.
6.11. Working Capital Fund (WCF). WCF activities (e.g. Transportation, Defense, etc.) are
responsible for costs associated with S/R&M (O&M) projects in accordance with DoD
Regulation 7000.14R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol. 11B, Chapter 12, §1205.
WCF activities use WCF funds to reimburse host installations or use direct cite funding for such
work. When a WCF activity partially occupies a building, WCF will, as established above, fund
costs in support of the space occupied by the WCF activity. WCF projects are subject to the
same statutory limitations as O&M-funded projects. The Defense Commissary Agency (DECA)
is a WCF activity; however, DECA facility S/R&M requirements are programmed, approved,
and funded with non-appropriated funds and guidance. AFI 65-601V1 details all WCF activities
on Air Force installations. Additionally, refer to any established base support agreements.
6.12. Accessibility. Planners and programmers shall ensure the scope of each construction and
repair project incorporates applicable accessibility standards as prescribed by the Architectural
Barriers Act (ABA). (T-0) Information on ABA guidelines may be found at their website at:
http://www.access-board.gov/ada-aba/aba-standards-dod.cfm.
6.13. Sustainability. Horizontal, vertical, and utility work must comply with Air Force
sustainable design and development guidance. To the maximum extent possible, incorporate
sustainable design principles in compliance with UFC 1-200-02; Air Force sustainable
development policy; EO 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and
Transportation Management; EO 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and
Economic Performance; Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; and the Federal
Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings memorandum of understanding,
consistent with budget and mission constraints. When applicable, programmers shall ensure
programming documents include the cost associated with sustainable design elements necessary
to achieve sustainable design guidance compliance, UFC and/or ETLs, as appropriate. (T-0)
Sustainability elements shall not be cut from scope to reduce cost unless it can be demonstrated
the only remaining option is to cut elements which directly impact mission.
6.14. Green Procurement. All projects, regardless of fund source or classification, shall
comply with the Air Force Green Procurement Program (GPP), and GPP language shall be
incorporated into contract documents. For specific compliance requirements refer to the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 23, Environment, Energy and Water Efficiency, Renewable
Energy Technologies, Occupational Safety, and Drug-Free Workplace; FAR, Part 11, Describing
Agency Needs; Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and
Economic Performance, dated 5 Oct 09; the DoD GPP Strategy; and the Vice Chief of Staff of
Air Force Memorandum, Air Force Green Procurement Program, dated 2 Jun 2011. All of the
referenced documents can be found on the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
Library webpage at:
https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/knowledge_center/pages/5323.aspx.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                          55


6.15. Historic Property Considerations. Title 16 USC § 470f, Effect of Federal undertakings
upon property listed in National Register; comment by Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation, requires the Air Force to consider the impact of undertakings on properties that are
potentially eligible (identified, but unevaluated), eligible for, or listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). For undertakings on historic properties (including force protection and
anti-terrorism measures), the Air Force must engage in consultation with the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) for Indian lands
and other consulting parties to identify, evaluate, and mitigate any adverse effects on historic
properties. Air Force undertakings that are found to adversely affect historic properties require
mitigation measures that are outlined in a Memorandum of Agreement or Programmatic
Agreement or cited in relevant concurrent National Environmental Policy Act documents (in
compliance with Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis
Process [EIAP]). When projects are programmed to repair historic facilities, some additional
cost may result from the use of materials and construction methods (life cycle costs may actually
show historic properties are less expensive to repair and maintain in the long term) that comply
with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. AFI 32-7065, Cultural
Resources Management Program, has additional guidance for undertakings on historic
properties.
6.16. Fire Safety Deficiencies (FSDs). For guidance regarding programming projects to correct
FSDs refer to AFI 32-10141.
6.17. Capitalizing Facility Improvements. Any capital improvements (e.g., extends useful
life; increases efficiency, capacity, or size; changes functionality) to a facility or any other
improvements with total cost of $250,000 or more must be capitalized by the installation Real
Property Office in accordance with AFI 32-9005. Refer to UFC 1-300-08, Criteria for Transfer
and Acceptance of DoD Real Property, for facility capitalization guidance. The project manager
is responsible for reporting all capital improvements on a DD Form 1354 to the Real Property
Office. (T-1) A capital improvement is defined in the Financial Management Regulation as an
improvement to real property that increases the real property asset’s square footage, size,
capacity, efficiency, or useful life. Replacing a facility or facility component of the same size or
capacity that has failed or is no longer performing the function for which it was designated is
NOT a capital improvement and should not be recorded in the real property inventory.
Capitalization costs include total project costs (both funded and unfunded). See AFI 32-9005 for
further details.
6.18. Aircraft Sunshades. AF/A4L establishes AF policy on aircraft sunshades. Aircraft
sunshades, which are comprised of a roof and maximum of two sides, are equipment items (refer
to AFI 21-136, Aircraft Sun Shade Management). Aircraft sunshades generally fulfill a long-
term requirement and are not considered as relocatable facilities per the definition of AFI 32-
1021. The sunshade user is responsible for advocating, procuring, installing, and maintaining
aircraft sunshades. Procurement will be made in accordance with AFI 65-601 V1, Paragraph
9.6., Funding Relocatable Buildings, STSs and Aircraft Sunshades and Table 9.2., Funding For
Relocatable Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters, Aircraft Sun Shades, And Other Modular
Structures. The user will appoint (to be designated by the contracting officer) a Contracting
Officer Representative (COR) from within the user’s organization for contract oversight of
procurement, installation, and long-term sustainment of aircraft sunshades. With concurrence
from the local Civil Engineer unit, the user may recommend a Civil Engineer as a technical
 56                                                             AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


representative to assist the COR in ensuring contractor compliance. Siting, energy/water
consumption systems, and other considerations must be approved by the installation facility
board. See Paragraph 5.4 for allied support guidance. See AFI 65-601V1, Table 9.2., Funding
For Relocatable Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters, Aircraft Sun Shades, And Other Modular
Structures, for information regarding appropriations for funding sunshades.
6.19. Tension Fabric Structures. For tension fabric structures assembled from modular
components intended to temporarily fulfill a requirement please refer to Paragraph 3.5.9
Planners and programmers shall ensure structures intended to fulfill a long-term or permanent
requirement are procured as real property and follow all appropriate construction guidance and
policy. (T-0) Those previously procured as equipment items will remain equipment and remain
the responsibility of the user. For guidance on converting equipment structures to real property,
see AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6. See AFI 65-601V1, Table 9.2., Funding For Relocatable
Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters, Aircraft Sun Shades, And Other Modular Structures, for
information regarding appropriations for funding tension fabric structures.
6.20. Equipment Structures. Refer to AFI 32-9005 for guidance on real property
determinations. Programmers should consider the following criteria when determining whether a
structure is equipment or real property. The structure is likely real property if it fulfills a long-
term requirement, is not mobile in practice, and has more than two walls. Also, if the structure
encloses or covers equipment that is considered RPIE (see Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE
guidance), then the structure is likely real property. Allied support, such as power or water up to
a stub at the equipment structure location, is considered real property and is a Civil Engineer
responsibility.
6.21. Claims. AFI 65-601 V1, Paragraph 6.3.6.7.2 states that claims against O&M-funded
minor construction projects are not to be counted against statutory limits. Similarly, claims
against O&M-funded repair projects are not to be counted against statutory limits.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    57


                                          Chapter 7

                 FACILITIES FOR OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Authority and Limitations. Congress may authorize specific, unique authorities for
O&M-funded facility construction supporting contingency operations (e.g., FY04 National
Defense Authorization Act, Section 2808—as amended and extended by subsequent Defense
Authorization Acts). When such authority is provided, provisions of this Chapter will apply to
the extent they are consistent with such authority and any Undersecretary of Defense
(Comptroller) (USD(C)) implementation guidance. Consult with AF/A4C as to the current status
of such authority. The fund source for facilities provided under this chapter will be Air Force
O&M Appropriation 3400.
   7.1.1. This chapter only applies to construction projects necessary to meet an urgent military
   operational requirements of a temporary nature in support of a declaration of war, a national
   emergency under section 201 of the National Emergencies Act (50 USC § 1621, Declaration
   of Emergency by President; Publication in Federal Register; Effect on Other Laws;
   Superseding Legislation), or a contingency operation as defined in 10 USC § 101(a)(13).
   7.1.2. Refer to DoDD 3000.10, Contingency Basing Outside the United States, for guidance
   regarding facility programming actions that may be undertaken in support of contingency
   basing outside the U.S. See AFI 10-504, Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host
   Nation Notification, for guidance regarding procedures for all basing actions affecting
   overseas installations.
   7.1.3. This chapter only applies to that geographical area for which the combatant command
   conducting the contingency operation is responsible and then only in the area where actual
   operations are being conducted. The requirement for projects carried out under this authority
   should be in immediate and direct support of combat operations or force protection for those
   engaged in combat operations. It does not apply to a rear echelon even if that echelon
   provides support to the front-line troops.
   7.1.4. This chapter is intended to address contingency facility requirements costing more
   than $750,000. Requirements costing less than $750,000 may be accomplished using other
   available authority, such as 10 USC § 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction, if applicable to
   the geographical area.
   7.1.5. This chapter only applies to an operational requirement expected to be temporary.
   This guidance is offered as a means by which to program contingency facility requirements
   identified too late for inclusion in a normal facility programming cycle such as MILCON.
   7.1.6. Without regard to standard Air Force or DoD facility construction standards, any
   facility provided under the authority of this chapter will be designed and built as temporary
   construction. The exception to this requirement is when the host nation requires a higher
   standard to obtain its approval or where the temporary standard and the permanent standard
   are essentially identical. The DD Form 1391 should explain any exceptions. The applied
   construction standard will recognize that the facility is being provided to meet a temporary
   need and will be abandoned at termination of operational requirements. No facilities
   provided under authority of this chapter will be built with the expectation they will
   eventually be turned over to and used by other organizations beyond the original Air Force
 58                                                             AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


   requirement. All such facilities will meet appropriate safety standards and force protection
   requirements applicable in the area, but will not necessarily be expected to meet the safety
   standards and force protection requirements that would apply to permanent construction.
   7.1.7. This chapter does not apply to construction to be carried out at a military installation,
   as defined under 10 USC § 2801(c), or at a location where the U.S. is reasonably expected to
   have a long-term interest or presence unless otherwise provided in specific authorizing
   legislation. In context of this Chapter, a military installation is defined as a location where
   the U.S. Armed Forces have operational control by virtue of a written basing agreement.
   7.1.8. No facility supporting morale, welfare, and recreation activities will be provided under
   the authority of this chapter.
7.2. Characteristics of Projects.
   7.2.1. Projects to which the authority of this chapter may be applied include erection of
   facilities, acquisition of temporary interests in land, and design.
   7.2.2. The requirement for such projects should be in immediate and direct support of
   combat operations or force protection for those engaged in combat operations. This authority
   is particularly applicable in countries, friendly or not, where the United States does not
   currently have a significant permanent military presence.
   7.2.3. Such projects may combine work typically considered as construction with work
   considered as FO (e.g., leasing a trailer, security, refuse, or custodial service etc.).
   7.2.4. Such projects may include repair of pre-existing facilities.
   7.2.5. Use relocatable or semi-permanent construction to the maximum extent possible. The
   types of structures normally used should be trailers, tension fabric structures, K-spans, air-
   supported domes, or pre-engineered buildings. More permanent construction materials
   should normally not be used, unless specifically required for security, force protection, or
   mission operations. Any departure from the use of semi-permanent construction must be
   well-documented and justified on the DD Form 1391. Program projects with all costs being
   funded for the structure, transportation, erection, site preparation, and related costs.
7.3. Project Documentation. Facilities that are part of a single undertaking (i.e., are
accomplished at the same time, for the same general need, and are required for the same time
period) can be listed on a single DD Form 1391 provided each facility to be approved under this
authority is identified separately with its associated justification, purpose, and cost. It is
important to identify each facility requirement in accordance with Paragraph 3.5, as part of the
same undertaking so a cost for each facility requirement can readily be identified. General costs
such as site preparation should be spread over the associated facilities with which it is associated.
Facilities that are satisfying separate facility requirements (e.g., lodging, administrative, base
operations, maintenance, utilities) but satisfy a general purpose such as a beddown should be
submitted and approved as part of the same undertaking. Facilities not meeting different
contingencies, not being accomplished at the same time, or are required for differing periods of
time, should be programmed on separate DD Forms 1391.
7.4. Approval Limitations. Submit project requests to AF/A4C, who will coordinate projects
with SAF/GCN before sending to SAF/IEE for review of conformance with Air Force
programming policy for O&M-funded projects promulgated in this Instruction. Upon
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      59


coordination by SAF/IEE, SAF/FMB will seek approval of the proposal by USD(C) before
proposed work may proceed. Programmers and project managers must ensure a project
approved under this chapter does not exceed 125% of the approved cost without re-approval,
unless limited by specific direction from USD(C). (T-1)
7.5. Documentation. All projects constructed under this authority must be documented on a
standard DD Form 1391 project document and signed by the appropriate approving official
including the approval date. The document must be dated and clearly identify the military
operation the work supports, and define the period of time the facility will be required, based on
known planning factors. The document must explain the urgency and how the temporary
construction will satisfy the mission requirements. The document can be classified, or not,
depending on the operational details and dates written in the text, and current classification
guidance for the military contingency. Personnel will mark classified documents in accordance
with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Classification of a project’s
information neither excuses nor waives compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

Terms
Aircraft Sunshade—A structure with the sole purpose of providing minimal protection for
personnel from the elements (sun, wind, rain, snow, etc.) with a roof and a maximum of two
sides. Aircraft sunshades generally fulfill a long-term requirement and are not considered as
relocatable facilities per the definition of AFI 32-1021. AF/A4L establishes AF policy on
aircraft sunshades (refer to AFI 21-136, Aircraft Sun Shade Management). Aircraft sunshade
procurement will be made in accordance with AFI 65-601 V1, Paragraph 9.6., Funding
Relocatable Buildings, STSs and Aircraft Sunshades and Table 9.2., Funding For Relocatable
Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters, Aircraft Sun Shades, And Other Modular Structures.
Allied Support—Real property support to a non-real property asset. Allied support includes
utilities roads, sidewalks, parking, fencing, signage, lighting (exterior and not attached to the
asset), foundations, and other site preparation.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        65


Collective Protection—Systems that protect those inside a building, room, shelter or tent against
contamination through the combination of impermeable structural materials, air filtration
equipment, air locks, and over-pressurization. See AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment
Companion Project—A project that enables a separate project. For example, the construction
of an AAFES facility requires the demolition of another facility. The demolition project is a
companion project. The programming documents for each project should reference the other.
Note: If a requirement (related work in a single facility) includes multiple work classifications
(e.g. repair or minor construction), these are not companion projects—they are interdependent
elements of the requirement.
Concurrent Project—A separate project in a facility that is independently a complete and
usable improvement to the facility from another coinciding project in the facility. For example, a
repair project to replace the roof on a facility is concurrent to a construction project that adds to
the facility. Each project is independent of the other; however, they are cross-referenced in the
programming documents.
Construction—To build, develop, convert, or extend real property and real property systems or
components. It includes erecting, installing, or assembling a new facility; adding, expanding,
extending, or converting an existing facility; or relocating an existing facility. This includes real
property installed equipment installed and made a part of such facilities, and related site
preparation (excavation, filling, landscaping, or other land improvements). The product of a
construction project must be complete and independently functional for its intended purpose.
Facility—A real property asset consisting of a building, structure, or linear structure. See AFI
32-9005 for more detail.
Facilities Operation (FO)—The FO program encompasses those services performed on an
installation that are related to real property such as refuse collection, grounds maintenance, and
custodial service. FO also includes Civil Engineer (CE) combat capabilities (i.e. Prime Base
Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF)). The FO program includes manpower authorizations,
support equipment, contracts, and associated costs belonging exclusively to and required to plan,
manage, and execute the functions defined throughout this document. The FO program excludes
sustainment, restoration and modernization of facilities, environmental services (such as disposal
of hazardous waste), Installation Services (IS), and mission-funded costs which are funded
through other Program Element Codes (PECs). The PEC for 3400 O&M FO is ***79.
Funded and Unfunded Costs—See AFI 65-601 V1, Paragraphs 9.14.3 and 9.15.1. [Note:
Paragraph 9.15.2. does not apply to facility O&M appropriations.] See clarifying guidance on
troop labor, design, and GFE in this Instruction.
Host—A unit or activity that has management control of facilities, and provides services or
facilities to another unit or activity (tenant). Within the Air Force, the host is the Air Force
MAJCOM that has jurisdiction over the installation and other real property (including use rights
such as leases, permits, easements, and licenses). Also, the host may be the organization which
has been designated by the MAJCOM, or by HQ USAF as a supplier (reference AFI 25-201), to
furnish tenant support.
Historic Property—Any district, site, building, structure, or object included on or eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (National Register). Title 36 Code of
 66                                                              AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 60.4, Criteria for Evaluation, explains criteria for determining
eligibility for listing to the National Register.
Interservice, Interdepartmental, and Interagency—A unit or activity of one department,
agency, or command that occupies the facilities of, or receives support from, another department,
agency, or command, usually on a continuing basis (see DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and
Intragovernmental Support ).
Intraservice—An Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard unit or activity that
occupies the facilities of, or receives support from, one another.
Joint Use—Concurrent use of host facilities and equipment by both host and tenant, as required
by the mission of each user.
Maintenance—The recurring, day-to-day, periodic, or scheduled work required to preserve real
property facilities, systems, or components and prevent premature failure or deterioration, so
these may be effectively used for their designated purposes. Maintenance does not change the
nature or function of a facility. All maintenance is considered Sustainment Maintenance (EEIC
521xx).
Major Force Program—A major force program is an aggregation of related budget items that
can be used to track resources that support a macro-level combat or support mission, such as
special operations forces.
Modernization—May include either repair or construction work. Includes the alteration of
facilities or components solely to implement new or higher standards (including regulatory
changes) or to accommodate new functions. Includes work associated with functional
conversion and work classified as construction.
National Register of Historic Places (National Register)—The Federal government's official
list of buildings, structures, districts, sites, and objects that are significant in American history,
architecture, archaeology, engineering, or culture, and are thereby considered for preservation.
The National Register is administered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service.
Criteria for eligibility, and the procedures for nomination, making changes to listed properties,
and for removing properties from the National Register are detailed in 36 CFR Part 60.4
Overhead—Includes personnel services and related expenses (such as travel, transportation,
printing and binding, rents and utilities, contractual services, supplies, and materiel) used to
perform the following: project management and administration; inspection and supervision of
construction; and direct administrative support of these two categories.
Phases—Interdependent portions of a project which achieves an overall requirement or objective
(e.g. renovating a facility, repairing a system), and are complete and usable on their own.
Plant Replacement Value (PRV)—Represents a modeled cost, in current year dollars, to design
and construct a notional facility to replace an existing facility at the same location. The notional
replacement facility will perform the same functions as the existing facility, within the same
capacity (size) as calculated in the assigned Facility Analysis Code (FAC) primary unit of
measure. The notional replacement facility will also be constructed to current standards of
materials and design consistent with DoD policies. PRV does not represent the actual cost to
construct a specific, existing facility, and should not be used as a cost estimate. Note: PRV for a
single facility does not include the costs for land acquisition, site preparation, earthwork,
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      67


landscaping, supporting facilities, associated facilities, or studies/surveys outside normal
planning and design for construction. Additionally, it does not include costs not associated with
recapitalization or replacement construction such as demolition or environmental
mitigation/remediation. Refer to UFC 3-701-01 DoD Facilities Pricing Guide, for the PRV
formula and factors.
Project—Includes the maintenance, repair, and construction work necessary to produce a
complete and usable single facility or a complete and usable improvement to an existing facility.
Project Splitting—The splitting of a project into separate parts where: it is done solely to
reduce costs below an approval threshold or the minor construction ceiling; or each part is not in
itself complete and usable; or the total project is not complete until all parts are complete.
Real Property Installed Equipment—Installed real property building equipment item affixed
or built into the facility which is an integral part of the facility. See AFI 32-9005, Attachment 2
for examples of RPIE and non-RPIE. See Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance.
Repair—Repair means to sustain or restore real property and real property systems or
components to such condition that they may effectively be used for their designated functional
purposes. Repair does not change the nature or function of a facility. Repair does not normally
increase the volume or footprint of a facility, although repair may result in greater usable floor
space due to reconfiguration of the interior. Repair can be Restoration and Modernization Repair
(EEIC 522xx) or Sustainment Repair (EEIC 524xx). In determining the total cost of a repair
project, include all phases of a multi-year repair project to a single facility.
Replacement Cost—Replacement cost is “the estimated cost of a military construction project
to replace the facility”. The replacement cost must be based on the existing facility (mission,
function, size, etc.), but can be brought up to current standards and codes. The facility used in
the replacement cost estimate cannot be expanded to accommodate new or additional
requirements beyond the existing facility function. Programmers must demonstrate use of an
acceptable cost estimating method for determining facility replacement cost, which may include
PACES, use of UFC 3-701-01 DoD Facilities Pricing Guide, use of RSMeans, or other industry
standard cost-estimating guides/tools, etc. Note: This definition is for programming in
compliance with Title 10 Chapter 169, and may not be consistent with real property definition.
Restoration—Includes repair and replacement work to restore facilities collaterally damaged
due to inadequately sustained components, premature aging, natural disaster, fire, accident or
other causes. This is considered non-life cycle repair of real property.
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)—The official appointed by the Governor of each
State and territory to carry out the functions defined in the NHPA, and to administer the State
Historic Preservation Program. SHPOs provide advice and assistance to Federal agencies
regarding their Cultural Resources Management programs and historic preservation
responsibilities. Throughout this Instruction, SHPO is understood to mean Tribal Historic
Preservation Officer (THPO) where consulting a designated THPO is appropriate.
Support Agreement—A host-tenant support agreement between Air Force units drawn up under
AFI 25-201 and recorded on DD Form 1144, Support Agreement.
Sustainment—Includes resources for cyclical maintenance and scheduled repair activities to
maintain the inventory of real property assets through its expected life. It includes regularly
 68                                                            AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response
and service calls for minor repairs. It also includes major repairs or replacement of facility
components (usually accomplished by contract) that are expected to occur periodically
throughout the facility life cycle. This work includes regular roof replacement, refinishing of
wall surfaces, repairing and replacement of heating and cooling systems, replacing tile carpeting,
and similar type work. Sustainment does not include restoration, modernization, environmental
compliance, historical preservation, or costs related to unexpected events, which are funded
elsewhere. See Paragraph 6.1.1 for details regarding fund source programming guidelines and
Paragraph A.3.2 for sustainment examples.
Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO)—The official appointed by an Indian Tribe in
accordance with the NHPA to administer the Tribal Historic Preservation Program and assume
duties and functions for tribal lands similar to those that the SHPO has for State lands. The
Secretary of Interior designates tribes with THPO responsibilities. Air Force installations must
consult with the THPO, instead of the SHPO, on undertakings on or over Indian tribal lands
where a Tribe has been granted THPO responsibilities by the Secretary of the Interior.
Undertaking—Any project, activity, action, or program wholly or partly funded under the direct
or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency. Includes projects and activities that are executed by
or on behalf of a Federal agency; Federally funded; require a Federal permit, license or approval;
or are subject to State or local regulation administered through delegation or approval authority
by a Federal agency.
Unspecified Minor Construction (UMC)—O&M-funded (to include all appropriations
available for operation and maintenance) minor construction projects authorized by 10 USC §
2805. These projects may not exceed $750,000 in funded cost, in accordance with 10 USC §
2805, Paragraph (c). 10 USC § 18233a(b) Notice and Wait Requirements for Certain Projects,
provides minor construction authority for the Reserve Component. Laboratory Revitalization
minor construction projects are authorized by 10 USC § 2805, Paragraph (d).
Unspecified Minor Military Construction (UMMC)—MCA-funded (to include all
appropriations available for MILCON) minor construction projects (often referred to as P-341)
authorized by 10 USC § 2805, Paragraph (a) (10 USC §18233(a) for the Reserve Component)
and are unlike O&M-funded UMC projects both in funding source and permissible project cost.
See AFI 32-1021 for additional details.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        69

                                 PREPARING DD FORM 1391

A2.1. Preparing DD Form 1391, FYXX Military Construction Project Data. Use the
following directions to prepare DD Forms 1391 for all projects funded from funds available for
operation and maintenance. This guidance is applicable for DD Forms 1391 submitted to the Air
Staff. If a software-generated form is not capable of meeting the guidelines, then it may be
necessary to modify or create a DD Form 1391 to meet the guidelines using an alternate method
(e.g., Adobe Professional). Since the DD Form 1391 is the basis on which individual projects
and some Air Force-wide programs are justified and approved, they must be carefully prepared
to provide complete, accurate, and essential information. The project documents must provide a
complete word picture of the work planned and reason for the work. For phased work, include a
clear description of the phased program’s ultimate goal. The appropriate authority must certify
project documents on the DD Form 1391 or DD Form 1391c for each facility project. Project
documents for O&M-funded projects should follow the same format as those for MILCON
projects to the maximum extent possible. Projects submitted for Air Staff approval must have a
Certificate of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions accomplished in accordance with AFI
32-1021 Chapter 2. Recommend projects approved at lower levels also include this certification.
A2.2. Block 1, Component. For O&M projects, enter the MAJCOM (or "ANG" or "AFRC")
requesting approval of the project. If the project is for a tenant requirement, identify in Block 11.
A2.3. Form Title Block. Enter the projected fiscal year of the funds paying for the project.
A2.4. Block 2, Date. Enter creation date or date of most recent amendment to project
document. Every DD Form 1391 must have the date of the current document.
A2.5. Block 3, Installation and Location. Put the name of the installation and the state or
country where located. If it is an off-base site, enter the name of the associated installation.
A2.6. Block 4, Project Title. To clarify what the project work will do, the first word will be
“Maintain”, “Repair”, “Renovate”, “Construct”, “Add”, “Consolidate”, or “Demolish”.
Abbreviations are acceptable when necessary. Include both the facility name and facility
number. Include all work classifications associated with each project. An example project using
these naming conventions is: “Add/Repair F-15 Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, Bldg 1000”. This
allows all parties reviewing the DD Form 1391 to understand the facility use. If the
programming document is a “shell” for multiple projects, use the word “Multi” in place of the
facility number, and list the applicable facility numbers in Block 11.
A2.7. Block 5, Program Element Code (PEC). Indicate the five-digit number corresponding
to the source of funds to be spent and the corresponding EEIC. Enter all PECs being used.
A2.8. Block 6, Category Code (CATCODE). For work in/on existing facilities, enter the
facility’s real property CATCODE that appears in the Real Property 7115 report. For single use
facilities, enter the “A line” CATCODE. For multi-use facilities, enter the appropriate “D line”
CATCODE for the area where the work will be accomplished. If the work will be accomplished
on a component or RPIE, do not list building service systems category codes that appear in the
“X lines” (e.g., HVAC, fire suppression, etc.), use the facility’s CATCODE. If the work is to
construct a new facility or convert an existing facility’s functional use, load the new CATCODE.

A2.9. Block 7, Project Number. This number is comprised of the installation’s 4-letter alpha
designation followed by the 2-digit fiscal year programmed and locally-assigned project
numbering convention (e.g. WXYZ130000). If the programming document is a “shell” for
multiple projects, use the word “Multiple” in place of the project numbers, and reference the
project numbers in Block 9 or in an attached DD1391c.
A2.10. Block 8, Project Cost. Show element of expense investment code (EEIC) and total
funded project cost, for example EEIC 529xx - $000K. Do not include unfunded costs in this
block. Round project cost to the nearest thousand. If the project includes multiple EEICs, the
costs for each EEIC should be identified separately within this block.
A2.11. Block 9, Cost Estimates. This section provides for a breakout of costs by identifiable
elements of work such as electrical, mechanical, structural, fire protection, AT protective
measures, site work, etc. Use these or other useful measures to provide a summary of the project
cost. If a lump sum cost is used in this block, use a DD Form 1391c to provide a detailed
breakout of the involved disciplines. Also, in this block, show elements which are part of the
overall effort but which are funded from other sources, such as equipment. Refer to AFI 65-601
V1 and AFI 32-1021 for detailed breakouts of funded versus unfunded costs. Show Supervision,
Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) when applicable. SIOH should not be rolled up in other line
items. Show the SIOH as its own line item either in Block 9 or in the DD 1391c. Do not show a
line item with a zero cost. [Note: If the DD Form 1391 software will not allow deletion of a line
item with zero cost, note and explain in Block 10.] Ensure there are no mathematic errors in the
cost estimate. Design costs for design-bid-build or design-build projects, when paid from O&M
funds or when design is accomplished by in-house personnel or troop labor, are unfunded.
Display estimated design cost as a separate line item in the “Unfunded” section. Use current
inflation indices to bring appropriate project costs into the year of expected execution (especially
for phased work). [Note: Though the design costs are unfunded, for D-B projects the design cost
should be part of the project funding requirement.]
   A2.11.1. Per Paragraph 4.2.4.1, all work necessary to result in a complete and usable
   facility, component, or improvement to a facility must be included in a single programming
   document. Include separate line item details for each EEIC. In cases where it is most
   practical to program multiple projects (i.e., multiple facilities) in a single programming
   document (e.g., repairing several roofs in one effort, installing meters on multiple buildings),
   identify the funded cost for each facility to determine the approval threshold. Inclusion of a
   DD 1391c may be necessary to break out cost by facility.
   A2.11.2. Per Paragraph 4.2.4, companion projects should be programmed on separate
   programming documents, and should reference each other.
   A2.11.3. Cost of work within each work classification determines approval level. Within a
   project, the repair and minor construction portions should not be summed for threshold
   determination. If repair work includes both 524xx and 522xx EEICs, the cost must be
   summed to determine the repair approval level.
   A2.11.4. Include demolition costs if appropriate and applicable (see Paragraph 3.3.1).
   A2.11.5. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate. Enter the rate used, when applicable.
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                         71


   A2.11.6. Contingency Costs. Identify contingencies as a percent of total, when appropriate.
   If the contingency cost exceeds 5% of the project’s funded cost or $1 million, whichever is
   smaller, justification is necessary in Block 11.
   A2.11.7. AT Measures. When AT measures are required, provide separate cost line items
   for interior and exterior AT requirements.
   A2.11.8. Include any unfunded costs such as design and non-RPIE equipment (e.g. systems
   furniture, communications systems) and display beneath the total funded cost. See
   Paragraph 3.5.15.1.2 for RPIE guidance.
A2.12. Block 10, Description of Proposed Work. Replace the word “Construction” in the
item 10 heading with the word “Work.” This section describes the scope of work. The
description of the work to be done must coincide with the classification(s) of work. Avoid use of
verbs or other language which would indicate another work classification. For example, “install”
and “alter” may give the idea that work is new (e.g., construction) whereas “replace” would
likely indicate repair. Use descriptive engineering terms to describe architectural features,
structural elements, and utilities. Include required site work. When an MCA-funded project is
concurrent to a repair project, ensure each project references the other. Identify additional scope
necessary to comply with executive orders and/or policies (OSHA, AT, sustainability, etc.). For
phased work, describe the work included in each phase. Be succinct, but descriptive.
A2.13. Block 11, Requirement. The Requirement block is sub-divided into five sections:
PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, CURRENT SITUATION, IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED, and
ADDITIONAL. Guidance for completing each section is as follows:
PROJECT: Restate the project title as in Block 4, followed by the facility number. Spell out any
acronyms and abbreviations. When appropriate, a sub paragraph can be added explaining the
purpose of the facility to the installation mission.
REQUIREMENT: Describe why this project is required to support the mission. If phased,
include the ultimate goal of all phases. Clearly and concisely define the proposed scope of both
the primary and supporting facilities and infrastructure that will result in a complete and useable
facility. Include information regarding the need for future phases, related construction, leases,
and other activities that will be required to be carried out as part of the project.
CURRENT SITUATION: This section provides critical details supporting why the project is
required. Describe the current situation and mission impact. Include as many user facts as
possible to describe impacts to mission, costs, personnel, time, efficiencies, functional conflicts,
etc. This section should also include pertinent information about the facility (when constructed,
recent major repairs, pavement condition index, general facility or component condition, etc.).
IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: With as much detail as possible, state impacts to mission if this
project is not completed (e.g., sorties lost, possible fines, accreditation lost). Avoid generalities.
ADDITIONAL: Provide the name of the BCE and commercial phone number. Include the
following statement: “The total funded cost of $X is Y% of the estimated cost of a military
construction project to replace the facility of $Z.” Enter the types of funds to be used for the
work, such as O&M, RDT&E, DHP O&M, WCF, etc. If categorically excluded (CATEXed),
put the CATEX number (verify applicability of CATEXes with appropriate subject matter
experts). Include explanation of compliance with executive orders, codes, policies, etc. If
phased, include a brief description of each phase (more detailed descriptions of the phases can be
included in a DD Form 1391c). Clearly identify, by project number and title, any companion
 72                                                           AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014


projects associated with this work. Include any other additional information pertinent to the
project, which is not provided above.
For repair projects, if the programmed amount is within 5% of the Air Staff approval threshold
or statutory notification threshold, include an explanation of measures to ensure the limitation
will not be exceeded. For UMC projects, if the programmed amount is within 5% of the
statutory threshold, include an explanation of measures to ensure the limitation is not exceeded.
   A2.13.1. If rented or leased facilities are involved, provide the following information in
   either the CURRENT SITUATION or ADDITIONAL section as appropriate:
       A2.13.1.1. Location. City, State (or Country), and street address.
       A2.13.1.2. Occupied By. Official name of agency using facility.

       of this Instruction.
       A2.13.2.6. 75% Repair versus Replacement Rule. MAJCOM Civil Engineers must
       approve requests to perform facility repairs which exceed 75% of the estimated cost of a
       military construction project to replace the facility. See Paragraph 4.4 Additionally, for
       repair projects notified to congressional committees, if the estimated repair cost exceeds
       75% of the estimated cost of a military construction project to replace the facility, 10
       USC § 2811 requires an explanation of why replacement is not in the best interests of the
       Government. See Paragraph 1.5.2.3
       A2.13.2.7. 125% Rule. See Paragraphs 4.5, 5.1.2, and 7.4 A project approved under
       Chapter 7 may not exceed 125% of the approved cost without re-approval, unless
       limited by specific direction from USD(C).

      EXAMPLES OF SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION AND MODERNIZATION

A3.1. Applicability. This attachment is primarily for the purpose of illustrating Sustainment,
Restoration, and Modernization funding categories (PECs and EEICs). See Table A3.1 for fund
source (PECs and EEICs) alignment with O&M work classifications. Funding categories are not
to be confused with work classification. For more detail on work classification, refer to
Chapters 4 and 5 of this instruction.

Table A3.1. O&M Work Classification and Fund Source Table.

                                                                  Fund Source

A3.2. Sustainment. This category of work provides resources for cyclical maintenance and
scheduled repair activities to maintain the inventory of real property assets through its expected
service life. It includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventive maintenance
tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. It also includes major repairs
or replacement of facility components (e.g., electrical, fire protection, HVAC, interior finishes,
plumbing, roofing) that are usually accomplished by contract and expected to occur periodically
throughout the facility life cycle. Timing of the work (within or post life cycle) isn’t the
determining factor between sustainment and R&M—the purpose of the work is the primary
factor. Life cycle repairs accomplished post-expected life cycle (e.g., deferred, delayed,
neglected) are still sustainment repairs. Work accomplished by sustainment does not include
unexpected repair (e.g., storm damage, accident).
Sustainment work includes regular roof replacement, refinishing of wall surfaces, repairing and
replacement of heating and cooling systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar types of
work. Replacement of permanent components (e.g., foundation, etc.) intended to last through the
facility’s life cycle is not sustainment repair. Sustainment does not include requirements funded
elsewhere, such as modernization, environmental compliance, historical preservation or costs
related to unexpected events.
   A3.2.1. Examples of sustainment projects include, but are not limited to:
       A3.2.1.1. Repairing a roof on a lifecycle basis (built up roof, standing seam metal roof,
       etc.) as long as the facilities structural members do not have to be modernized to support
       the roof (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.2. Replacing telephone poles periodically (EEIC 524xx).
AFI32-1032 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      75


       A3.2.1.3. Rebalancing an HVAC system (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.4. Inspecting or performing corrective maintenance fire detection/suppression
       systems (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.5. Repainting the exterior or interior of facilities (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.6. Performing spall repair or crack sealing on the airfield (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.7. Completely replacing a runway or taxiway that achieved its expected life cycle
       (concrete, base course, drainage system, etc.) and not expanding the footprint (EEIC
       524xx).
       A3.2.1.8. Cleaning out storm drainage systems on a periodic basis (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.9. Repairing a water line break caused by inadequate sustainment (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.10. Replacing the floor covering in a facility (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.11. Chip sealing a road surface (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.12. Restriping airfields and base parking lots (EEIC 521xx).
       A3.2.1.13. Mill and overlay existing pavement (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.14. Replacing wastewater treatment process components as required for
       maintenance on a cyclical basis as required to satisfy the installation wastewater permit
       (EEIC 521xx or 524xx).
       A3.2.1.15. Replacing overhead electrical power lines with underground lines when the
       existing lines have reached the end of their economic life. The underground lines must
       generally follow the same path as the overhead lines and cannot contain additional
       feeders but can be properly sized. Similarly, the replacement of other interior or exterior
       utility lines (sewer/water/gas/electrical) that have reached the end of their economic life
       is sustainment so long as the lines follow the same path as the existing lines and do not
       expand to new areas. Also, these utility lines can be properly sized (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.16. Replacement of HVAC systems, in kind or to current standards, that have
       reached the end of their useful life (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.17. Replacement of CBRN Collective Protection Systems, in kind or to current
       standards, that have reached the end of their useful life (EEIC 524xx).
       A3.2.1.18. Inspecting, recertifying, or performing corrective maintenance on CBRN
       collective protection systems (EEIC 521xx).
A3.3. Restoration and Modernization (R&M). Restoration includes non-life-cycle
(unexpected) repair and replacement work to restore facilities damaged by natural disaster (storm
damage), fire, accident, or other causes. Modernization includes alteration of facilities solely to
implement new or higher standards (including regulatory changes) or to accommodate new
functions. R&M also includes mission beddowns. Examples of Restoration and Modernization
projects include, but are not limited to:
   A3.3.1. Repairing collateral facility damage caused by a leaking roof (i.e. collapsed ceiling,
   drywall, floor, etc., resulting from lack of sustainment) (EEIC 522xx) [Repairing the roof
   will be sustainment repair. (EEIC 524xx)]

  A3.3.2. Repairing damage to a facility caused by a natural disaster (fire, tornado, hurricane,
  flood, earthquake, etc.)
  A3.3.3. Repairing a water line damaged by natural disaster or accidental damage (not caused
  by insufficient sustainment) (EEIC 522xx).
  A3.3.4. Repairing a facility (to include structural members) as a result of an explosion (EEIC
  522xx in accordance with 10 USC § 2811).
  A3.3.5. Completely replacing an existing road due to failure before the end of its expected
  useful life (EEIC 522xx).
  A3.3.6. Completely replacing a runway or taxiway that has not achieved its reasonably
  expected useful life (concrete, base course, drainage system, etc.) (EEIC 522xx).
  A3.3.7. Replacing a facility component or system that was poorly designed and/or never
  worked properly (EEIC 522xx). However, if initially MCA-funded, and it never worked
  properly, then MCA must be used to correct the deficiency.
  A3.3.8. Replacing the existing lighting with more energy efficient system before the end of
  its useful life (EEIC 522xx).
  A3.3.9. Converting a library to administrative space (a change in functional purpose
  category) within the minor construction threshold—(EEIC 529xx).
  A3.3.10. Reconfiguring/modifying a facility to accommodate new modular furniture (EEIC
  522xx).
  A3.3.11. Modernizing a facility (new walls, ceiling, floor covering, etc.) to house a new
  function (administrative, shop, etc.) (EEIC 522xx as long as the footprint and/or volume of
  the facility does not increase, otherwise EEIC 529xx); however, if the new function fits the
  definition of conversion per Paragraph 5.1.1.1, conversion rules apply.
  A3.3.12. Modernizing a facility (new walls, ceiling, floor covering, etc.) to beddown a new
  mission (EEIC 522xx as long as the footprint and/or volume of the facility does not increase,
  otherwise EEIC 529xx); however, if the beddown of the new mission fits the definition of
  conversion per Paragraph 5.1.1.1, conversion rules apply.
  A3.3.13. Replacing the roof trusses or floor joists of a facility (EEIC 522xx).
  A3.3.14. Installing a new fire suppression system to comply with an updated fire code (EEIC
  522xx), as described in Paragraph 4.2 Installing a new fire suppression system driven by a
  change in function should be classified as construction (EEIC 529xx). This example also
  applies to seismic improvements.
  A3.3.15. Constructing a new road or expanding the footprint of an existing road within
  O&M funding limits (EEIC 529xx).
  A3.3.16. Replacing a functioning facility component solely for modernization (EEIC
  522xx).
  A3.3.17. Adding striping to previously-existing, unstriped pavement to meet standards or
  codes (EEIC 522xx).
