SUMMARY OF CHANGES

(MCCONNELLAFB) This interim changes/clarifies types of jackets and gloves approved for
flight, implements/updates guidance on transition approved bases, identifies EPEX as sole source
 2                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009


for FCIF, adds guidance regarding winter weather package request timing, and crew step times,
as well as procedures for ONE mission. It also removes extraneous data on Orientation flights,
references to bird watch conditions, pub sticks, go/no-go , deployed FCIF procedures, local
weather procedures, crew bus procedures, taxi procedures, Cat E circling area, runway
displacement, a reference to squadron chief boom in cargo loading, and expiration dates on
UHF/VHF frequencies. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay or cancel a training mission
originating from McConnell AFB rests with the 22 OG/CC, or the designated representative.
Aircrews will not depart the aircraft until receiving approval through the Command Post. For
reserve aircrews, the 18 ARS/DO or the designated representative will have the final decision to
delay or cancel a reserve training mission; the 931 ARG will advise the appropriate base
agencies of mission delays or cancellations.
2.4.1.1. (Added) Emergency Diverts. Do not delay your divert once bingo fuel is reached or
during an emergency--even if you are still awaiting approval. Once a divert plan is formed,
inform command post (Shocker Control) of your intentions. For 22 ARW missions, Shocker
Control will notify the 22 ARW schedulers, 22 OG/CC, 22 MXG and 22 OG Sq leadership
(through automatic notification system). Command Post will ensure all required coordination
occurs between schedulers, weather forecasters, MOC, 22 MXG/CC, and the divert base to
ensure divert aircraft have the required support. The duty scheduler will relay appropriate divert
base weather, NOTAMS, and airfield advisories. For 931 ARG missions, Shocker Control will
notify the 22 OG/CC and the 18 ARS/DO. For 931 ARG missions, the 18 ARS/DO will ensure
that all appropriate agencies are notified.
2.4.1.2. (Added) Non-emergency Diverts. For 22 ARW missions, approval authority for non-
emergency diverts will be the 22 OG/CC. For 931 ARG missions, joint approval is required
from both 22 OG/CC and 18 ARS/DO. All required coordination IAW 2.4.1.1 should be
accomplished prior to approval.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. All TDY aircrews returning to McConnell should make a 3 hour
out call to inform Command Post of ETA, Maintenance Status, cargo or pax on board, request
Immigration/Customs (if required), and any other special handling requests.
2.5.6. Approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival, aircrew will contact command post to relay
estimated arrival time, maintenance brevity codes, and parking request. Command post will
relay all required information to maintenance and transportation then pass parking location to the
aircrew. If any clarification is required, the interested party (i.e. Maintenance) will contact the
aircrew directly using the appropriate call sign (i.e. “Shocker Maintenance”) and request the
additional information.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. RT formal and continuation training missions, to the maximum
extent possible, should include a navigator.
3.13.1.1. (Added) Standby Force Aircraft Generation (Alert). A preflight crew designated by
current operations may be used to conduct the aircrew preflight. 8010 Alert Force generation
will be IAW 10-101 Alert Planning Factors and Procedures and the Aircrew Alert Generation
Checklist
3.13.1.2. (Added) If maintenance action is required on a generated alert aircraft, MOC will
notify the command post. Uncocking a “cocked on” aircraft is not a standard procedure, but may
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009                                               3


be accomplished on a case-by-case basis to deal with maintenance problems. The aircraft
commander or designated aircrew representative will be present if access to the aircraft is
required. Aircraft status must be monitored continuously to ensure the aircraft remains launch
capable. When maintenance has diagnosed the problem as much as possible without uncocking
the aircraft, necessary parts will be ordered from supply. To minimize downtime of uncocked
aircraft, aircraft commanders or designated representatives will contact command post from the
aircraft for permission once the necessary maintenance personnel and parts are ready to be used.
Once contacted, command post will forward the request to the controlling agency (OG/CC,
TACC, etc). Do not uncock the aircraft until authorized and authenticated by command post. As
soon as necessary maintenance is performed, necessary checklist steps will be reaccomplished to
return the aircraft to cocked status. Command Post will be informed when the aircraft is returned
to “cocked on” status and will notify the appropriate controlling agency.
3.13.1.3. (Added) Pilots are approved to use the EWO mode for the APU on all alerts and/or
scramble start operations. This includes alert starts conducted for training, currency and
operational missions when alert starts are necessary to meet mission timing. Aircraft
commanders will ensure all crewmembers are thoroughly briefed on procedures to be used
before initiating the start procedure. Additionally, in order to minimize the amount of time that
the APUs are run in the EWO mode, the STARTING ENGINES AND BEFORE TAXI check
through step 13 (stopping the APUs) should be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. If an
APU is required for heating the aircraft following the alert start, both APUs must be shut down
in order to terminate operations in the EWO mode, and then one APU may be restarted for
heating use.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. During overseas deployment, where no OG-
level approval authority exists, detachment commanders may approve MEP status for personnel
on aircraft under their control. Further information on MEPs can be found in AFI 11-401.
3.14.1. Deleted
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. Once airborne, if a generator fails, the air
refueling may be completed, as long as the corresponding bus tie breaker remains closed and all
equipment powered by the affected load bus continues to operate. If practical, accomplish a full
stop landing at a base with KC-135R maintenance available to repair the generator prior to the
next flight. Transition is not permitted. (Ref. Table 4.12)
5.15.2.3.1. (Added) McConnell AFB takeoff and landing procedures. 22 OG/CC approval is
required for any takeoff or landing when the measured runway RCR, within 75 feet either side of
centerline, is less than 9.
5.15.2.3.2. (Added) Taxi/tow procedures. 22 OG/CC approval is required to taxi an aircraft if
the measured ramp or taxiway RCR is less than 7. 22 MXG/CC approval is required to tow an
aircraft, if the measured ramp or taxiway RCR is less than 7.
5.17. Quick-Turn Intervals and Over-fly Coordination. When takeoff time slips for any reason,
crews must receive permission from the executor to fly out their scheduled duration. Overfly
will be coordinated through the executor, MOC, and appropriate Sq/CC or Sq/DO.
5.18.3.4. Fuel jettison area and procedures are established in McConnell AFBI 13-201. For 22
ARW missions, the 22 OG/CC is approval authority for all non-emergency fuel jettisons. In the
absence of the 22 OG/CC, approval authority is the 22 ARW/CC. For 931 ARG missions, joint
 4                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009


approval is required from both 22 OG/CC or 22 ARW/CC and 18 ARS/DO or 931 ARG/CC.
Documentation for all in-flight fuel jettison will be maintained by 22 OG/OGV. Aircraft
commanders will submit fuel jettison documentation immediately after flight termination.
5.20.1. If a crew is delayed and slips into the BASH window, 22 OG/CC approval is required for
takeoff or landing IAW 22 ARW OPLAN 91-2.
5.20.2. Deleted.
5.20.6. (Added) For any suspected bird strike, the aircraft commander will fill out an AF Form
853, an AMC Form 97, and a MACA Map to depict where the birdstrike occurred. These forms
or electronic substitute will be located in and can be filled out at MX Debrief. The forms need to
be accurately filled out, however, if the time/location of the birdstrike is unknown; do not guess
to fill out the forms, simply state “unknown”. Ensure the forms are e-mailed to the BASH e-mail
listing.
5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). Unless a complete FCF is specifically requested, the FCF/ACF is only
required to check those systems affected by maintenance, inspection, or modification. Prior to
conducting an FCF, specific requirements will be reviewed by OGV or the most qualified
instructor pilot available. The review will reference procedures in T.O. 1C-135(K)R-6CF-1
(Acceptance and/or Functional Check Flight Procedures) and T.O. 1-1-300
(Acceptance/Functional and Maintenance Operational Checks).
5.21.1. Aircrew conducting FCF flights will receive ground training covering governing T.O.s,
regulations, and checklist procedures prior to certification. Aircrew who are certified to conduct
FCFs will be approved by 22 OGV. Certification will be annotated on the squadron's Letter of
X’s and a current list of crewmembers will be maintained at 22 OG/OGV. 931 ARG will
approve 931 crewmembers. 931 OGV will maintain approval letters, and provide 22 OGV with
a current list of 931 crewmembers.
5.21.2. (Added) Operational Check Flights (OCF). 22 MXG/QA determines the requirement for
OCF flights, coordinates with 22 OG/OGV for an appropriate crew, and designates the sortie
appropriately on the wing schedule. OCF flights are subject to the following restrictions (based
on guidance in T.O. 1C-135A-6 and T.O. 1-1-300):
5.21.2.1. The aircraft commander will be an Instructor Pilot. The crew will include an Instructor
Boom if any air refueling boom systems are the reason for the OCF. Crew changes made on
OCF sorties after the schedule has been approved will be coordinated with 22 OG/OGV. No
cargo or non-MEP pax will be carried on an OCF flight.
5.21.2.2. 22 MXG/QA will brief the crew, at the aircraft, on the specific systems that generated
the OCF and can be contacted beforehand for any clarification (x6696). The crew may contact
22 OG/OGV (x6116) to be briefed on T.O. 1-1-300 (as required) and local operational
requirements. Following the OCF, the crew will debrief MXG/QA at MX Debrief.
5.21.2.3. Flights will be conducted during daylight hours in Visual Meteorological Conditions
(VMC). Flights in IMC will be approved by OG/CC (18 ARS/DO for 931 crewed flights) on a
case by case basis depending on the systems requiring the OCF.
5.21.2.4. OCF sorties will normally be planned with a fuel load that allows an immediate
landing in case of aircraft malfunction.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009                                              5


5.21.2.5. The flight will be scheduled to takeoff and complete the requirements of the OCF and
remain in the local area (KOSAC). Exceptions will be coordinated through OGV. 22 MXG/QA
will attend de-brief for completion of necessary forms per MAFBI 21-111.
5.21.3. (Added) Boom OCFs. The following procedures will be utilized when performing
Operational Check Flights on KC-135 booms. Ensure previous OCF guidance is adhered to:
5.21.3.1. Accomplish AFTER TAKEOFF Checklist as normal.
5.21.3.2. After Level Off
5.21.3.3. Pilots set 275 KIAS
5.21.3.4. Lower boom normally, visually checking for any abnormalities
5.21.3.5. Extend boom to 10 feet
5.21.3.6. Ensure boom trails properly
5.21.3.7. Accomplish boom limits check
5.21.3.8. If limits check, add 5 units of trim
5.21.3.9. Ensure boom continues to trail properly
5.21.3.10. Accomplish another boom limits check
5.21.3.11. Extend and retract boom throughout the entire range
5.21.3.12. Stow boom
5.21.3.13. Note any abnormalities during each check and provide maintenance with a detailed
description of any problems.
6.1.2. (Added) Aircrew Uniform. The following clothing and equipment will be worn or carried
aboard all flights:
6.1.2.1. Boots, flying (winter/summer, or desert when approved) (worn)
6.1.2.2. Coveralls, flying (worn)
6.1.2.3. Jacket, Flying (Nomex or leather)
6.1.3. (Added) Clothing Requirements. When operating in the Arctic and Antarctic regions,
crew members will wear or carry the following personal equipment:
6.1.3.1. Gloves, flying, winter
6.1.3.2. Parka or winter flying jacket with hood, stocking cap, or any approved uniform hat that
provides cold weather protection for your head and ears.
6.1.3.3. Thermal knit underwear, one set
6.3.1.4. (Added) Pre-mission Actions. The PFPS laptop computer, with required cables, should
be carried on all off-station sorties to enhance the crew’s ability to handle mission profile
changes.
6.4. (Added) Aircrew Publication Requirements. The Master list of publications required by
crew position is maintained on the OGV website. All crewmembers are responsible for carrying
and maintaining checklists for their crew position for all missions in which they are qualified.

6.5.1. If a transition airfield is listed in the GDSS comments, 22 OG/CC (18 ARS/DO for 931
ARG sorties) or designated representative has granted approval for transition at that location.
6.5.2. Scheduling will contact the 22 OG/CC (18 ARS/DO for 931 ARG sorties) or designated
representative for approval anytime aircrews are requesting transition training at a base not in the
GDSS comments and not included in the approved list.
6.5.3. (Added) If conditions require off-station transition after airborne (e.g., traffic pattern
saturation, weather, or bird hazards), aircrews will notify 22 ARW Scheduling. Aircrews will
forward place of intended transition, expected arrival and departure time, and estimated landing
time back at McConnell. Scheduling will coordinate with the transition base, and notify the
aircrew of approval or disapproval. When requested, scheduling will relay airfield conditions,
weather, NOTAMs, and bird status to the crew prior to their departure from the local area.
6.5.4. (Added) Circling approaches at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport (ICT). Local KC-135s
will fly no lower than 2600ft MSL on any practice circling approaches until reaching a normal
visual glide path for noise abatement. Times that are considered "peak traffic" periods at Mid-
Continent are between 0915L and 1130L, and 1300L to 1800L Mon-Fri. This is for crew
awareness only and crews are not prohibited from requesting approaches during these times.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). FCIFs will be maintained at One-Stop shop as well as
on the 22 OGV website. Use Patriot Excalibur to document the review of FCIF,
volume 1. Crewmembers unable to sign off FCIFs prior to performing aircraft duties must place
the current FCIF number and their initials next to their name on the record copy of the flight
authorization, or on their Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) orders. A hardcopy FCIF binder is
also available at the One-Stop desk. Follow up by signing the FCIF as soon as possible.
6.8.4. (Added) Deleted
6.8.4.1. (Added) For home station sorties, do not add or delete any crew members without
approval (direct verbal/written) of a FAAO assigned to the squadron responsible for the sortie.
6.8.4.2. (Added) For off station sorties, do not add or delete any crew members without approval
of a competent command authority.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009                                                  7

6.8.5.2. (Added) Not flying unsupervised if non-current, NMR due to continuation training,
unqualified due to standardization/evaluation activity, or when informed of special supervised or
no-fly status by leadership.
6.8.5.3. (Added) Reporting status changes of DNIF or return to fly (RTF) immediately to ground
and flight schedulers.
6.8.5.4. (Added) Present AF form 1042 to schedulers to verify DNIF or RTF status.
6.8.5.5. (Added) Ensure schedulers load expected duration of DNIF in GDSS-2. If status is
“DNIF to quarters,” call unit scheduler to relay the information.
6.8.6. (Added) Deleted
6.10. Mission Kits. Inventory mission kits prior to departure and ensure you have current
publications (hardcopy or electronic).
6.11. Route Navigation Kits (FLIP). Crews will inventory route navigation kits. Ensure
volumes aren’t missing pages required for destination/alternate approaches.
6.11.3. Local area navigation kits will be used on local training sorties departing from and
recovering at McConnell AFB. Local area navigation kits will include the following:
6.11.3.1. 3 US High/Low Approach Books, Volume 8,
6.11.3.2. 1 set US High/Low Approach Books (Volumes 1 through 22)
6.11.3.3. 1 IFR Supplement Books

6.12.9. (Added) Emergency airfields will be briefed to facilitate decision making during an in-
flight emergency. Review NOTAMS for designated emergency airfields prior to flight to assess
suitability.
6.16. Departure Planning/Filing Procedures. Crews will file the appropriate local departure fix
based on the mission’s general direction of flight IAW the following:
       To the northeast: GOSSL (ICT 015/45)
       To the southeast: JAMEY (ICT 154/28) PER or BURDN (ICT 115/38)
       To the southwest: VARNR (ICT 249/40)
       To the northwest: KYLER (ICT 268/42)
       To the east: ROKNE (ICT 070/38)

Note: These preferred departure fixes do not restrict pilots from requesting direct routings to
adjust mission timing. Additionally, aircrew should not file the VARNR or KYLER departure
fixes when proceeding to orbit at AR-330E ARCP (ICT/254/50) because of their close
proximity.

Table 6.7. Deleted.


6.16.1. Arrival Planning/Filing Procedures. Crews will file the appropriate local arrival fix, then
IAB or the approach fix based on the mission’s general direction of arrival to McConnell IAW
the following:
       From the northeast: CASSO (ICT 040/40) IAB
       From the southeast: HUSKA (ICT 137/40) IAB
       From the southwest: ANTHONY (ANY) Navaid
       From the northwest: HUTCHINSON (HUT) Navaid
6.20.4. (Added) Local area radar approach guidance. Aircraft commanders will add the
following to the remarks section of the DD Form 175: “REQ MULTI APCH IAB X+XX
(expected transition time).” This provides Wichita Approach Control with advance notice of
transition training at McConnell.
6.21.5. When lightning is within 5 NM, crews should be aware that maintenance will not
marshal them to parking. Crews will have to coordinate with ground control for a place to park
their aircraft. Crews will ensure as a minimum, the nose gear is chocked prior to departing the
aircraft.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Aircraft Deicing. See MAFBI 11-220 or
current applicable FCIF.
6.31.3. (Added) Deleted.
6.31.4. (Added) Crews will coordinate through command post to resolve all issues with
scheduling, receiver units, and aircraft maintenance issues to include checking aircraft status and
preannouncement of aircrew stepping to aircraft if stepping early.
6.31.4.1. (Added) Normally, the crew bus arrives at One-Stop NLT 1+45 prior to the takeoff
time listed on the flying schedule. The aircraft commander may adjust this time should crew
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009                                                 9


composition, weather, cargo, passengers, or training dictate. The crew must arrive at the aircraft
no later than 1+30 prior to takeoff. The aircraft commander must inform command post of any
adjustment to timing. Command Post will coordinate the adjusted timing with transportation and
the Flight Line Pro Super/Expediter (through the MOCC).
6.31.4.2. (Added) Aircraft commanders will contact Command Post prior to departing for the
aircraft. Command Post will confirm aircraft status, parking, fuel load, takeoff time, and crew
arrival time at the aircraft. Command Post will coordinate this information with the MOC so
aircraft forms and crew chiefs will be at the aircraft at crew arrival time.
6.38. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. Declare emergencies as soon as practical. Advance
notification is necessary for the base to ensure emergency services are in place and the Duty IP is
available. The aircraft commander will notify the McConnell AFB Command Post (Shocker
Control UHF 321.0/311.0) as soon as aircraft control and conditions permit.
6.38.1. Shocker Control/Duty IP will notify the 22 OG/CC of all inbound emergency aircraft.
For 931 ARG missions, Shocker Control will conference call the 22 OG/CC and the 18
ARS/DO.
6.38.2. Under most KC-135 emergency situations, there is sufficient time to obtain assistance
from the Duty IP and OG/CC approval prior to adjusting gross weight or landing. Aircraft
commanders will wait until all local coordination is complete and OG/CC approval is received in
these situations. In the absence of the 22 OG/CC/CD, approval authority is the 22 ARW/CC.
For 931 ARG missions, joint approval authority rests with the 22 OG/CC and the 18 ARS/DO.
In a catastrophic situation, the aircraft commander will not delay necessary actions to ensure a
safe recovery of the crew or aircraft.
6.38.4. (Added) Duty IP Program. See OG OI 11-219.
6.60. (Added) Aircraft Commanders will turn in the Flight Planning Log (Form 8, also known
as “200”) mission charts, and printed CPDLC clearances or amendments to 22 OG/OGV if the
Aircraft Commander:
6.60.2. (Added) Filed a Form 651, HATR
6.60.3. (Added) Filed an AMC Form 97, Unusual Incident Report
6.60.4. (Added) Deviated from a flight rule or ATC clearance
8.6.3.5. (Added) Air Mobility Command Air Refueling Tracker (AMCART) is an automated
tool designed to process in-flight fuel transactions. Use of AMCART is required by 22 ARW
crews for all missions. Refer to AMCART user guide for specific instructions on completion of
electronic in-flight issue log.
9.7.2.14. (Added) Low Closed Pattern (LCP). LCP procedures are only authorized when
runways 01L/R are active. The LCP altitude is 2200 MSL. Aircrews will use the following
procedures:
9.7.2.14.1. Aircrews will request the LCP with tower prior to executing the maneuver (i.e.
“Turbo 12 heavy, request right low closed”)
9.7.2.14.2. Once cleared, aircraft will turn crosswind within 1.5 NM of McConnell AFB and
climb to 2200 MSL. If unable to start turn prior to 1.5 NM of McConnell, aircraft will climb to
3000 MSL prior to turning over/past Beech.

9.10.7.3.1. (Added) 22 OG/CC approval is required for any locally-executed landing with a
gross weight above 200,000 lbs.
9.12. (Added) Engine-running crew change (ERCC) procedures. The following procedures will
be utilized by 22 OG/931 ARG aircrews. Deviations are only permitted with express approval of
the appropriate operations group commander or deputy.
9.12.1. The following conditions must be met or a marshaller is required: 1. No support
equipment (age, fire bottles, chocks, etc.) will be present on adjacent parking spots. 2. Adjacent
parking spots must be unoccupied.
9.12.2. If multiple aircraft are planned to ERCC simultaneously, parking spots will be
coordinated one day prior by OSS Scheduling and Maintenance scheduling to ensure the parking
spots are clear of support equipment.
9.12.3. Aircrews flying the front half (off-going crew) of an ERCC will make a “30-minute out”
call. If the aircraft does not require maintenance and no engines will be shut down prior to the
back half (on-coming crew) of the ERCC, the off-going crew will inform Command Post that no
maintenance is required. If maintenance is required prior to the back half of the ERCC or if an
engine(s) will be shut down, the off-going crew will inform command post that maintenance is
required prior to the ERCC and request parking.
9.12.4. The crew on the front half of the ERCC (no maintenance required) will taxi into parking
and will ensure the aircraft is parked so the aircraft tail does not block any taxiway.
9.12.5. (Added) The off-going crew will:
9.12.5.1. Use all of runway/maximum flap setting possible.
9.12.5.2. Compute and brief oncoming crew brake energy, cooling time and AFTO Form 781A
entries.
9.12.5.3. Boom operators will only run the MULTIPLE FULL STOP checklist and turn off the
nacelle illumination lights.
9.12.5.4. The pilot or copilot will guard the brakes until one of the on-coming pilots is in
position to guard the brakes.
9.12.5.5. Leave FLIP onboard the aircraft.
9.12.5.6. Crew will ensure all bags are zipped, equipment is bundled, and FOD hazards are
minimized prior to exiting the aircraft.
9.12.5.7. Complete all sections of AFTO Form 781 binder. Take the AFTO Form 781 (AFORM
Aircrew Mission/Flight Data Document) to the Maintenance Debrief Office. Leave the AFTO
Form 781 binder with the aircraft and ensure the maintenance discrepancies are written in the
AFTO Form 781A section. All discrepancies will be thoroughly debriefed with maintenance by
the off-going crew, even though the 781 binder is still in the aircraft.
9.12.6. (Added) The on-coming crew will:
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009                                               11


9.12.6.1. Contact Command Post to verify aircraft maintenance status, fuel load, parking
location, and ERCC block time.
9.12.6.2. Receive a weather briefing, file, and pick up water.
9.12.6.3. Crews will ensure all bags are zipped, equipment is bundled, and FOD hazards are
minimized prior to exiting the vehicle.
9.12.6.4. Deleted.
10.3.2.1. Aircrew Chemical Operations and Procedures. When performing flying duties while
wearing AERPs, crewmembers will wear issued flying glasses.
12.4.3. (Added) Refer to McConnell AFBI 23-102 Aviation fuel management program for off
base fuel purchasing guidance.
13.1. General. Cargo Loading Procedures and Responsibilities.
13.1.1. OGV in coordination with the 22 LRS Air Terminal Operations (ATO) and/or the
Installation Deployment Officer will retain oversight and control of policy development
regarding cargo coordination/loading operations within the 22 ARW. Any desired changes will
be coordinated with OGV.
13.1.2. The lead squadron for all deploying aircraft, as depicted in the OSS scheduling program,
will ensure all coordination and tasks are properly accomplished during each deployment,
redeployment, CONUS/OCONUS TDY, Coronet, etc.
13.1.3. Coordination and tasks should follow the Wing DSOE.
13.2.1.4. Standardized Aircraft Configurations and Procedures.        Command standard
configurations are available in AFI 11-2KC-135V3 ADDENDA A and should be used to the
maximum extent possible. Additional required configurations are standardized through OGV
and posted on the OGV website. Changes to these configurations must be coordinated through
OGV.
14.1. General. Fuel Conservation. Aircrews/Mission planners will plan their mission IAW
current AMC fuel conservation directives. Mission planners will ensure their missions are
planned using PFPS flight planning software no later than 1200L the duty day prior to flight.
Fuel requirements will be cross-checked against the most current GDSS-2 flight schedule and
changes to required ramp fuel load will be made via their squadron scheduling office, if required.
14.2.2.8. For local sorties, plan to land with 16,000 pounds of fuel IAW Fuel Planning Gudiance
Memorandum and AFI 11-2KC-135V3 paragraphs 14.2.2 (Required Ramp Fuel) and 14.2.2.8.
(Holding Fuel Reserves). This is calculated by adding the 5,900 pound minimum landing fuel
plus 45-minute fuel reserve of 7,500 pounds plus 15-minute contingency fuel of 2,500 pounds,
which equals 15,900 pounds. Paragraph 14.2.2.10 authorizes units to develop standard alternate
fuel requirements.
15.13. (Added) MOA operations. MOAs utilized by McConnell crews will be scheduled and
planned through 22 OSS/OSOS. Coordinates and procedures for these areas will be maintained
by 22 OSS/OSOS. Crews may contact 22 OSS/OSOS (DSN 743-4916) for current information.
16.2. (Added) The local mission planning policies and timing factors in this supplement apply
to active duty crews. 931 ARG mission planning requirements and show times will vary due to
 12                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 23 DECEMBER 2009


consideration for civilian work schedules. Cell Formation sorties with both Active Duty and
Reserve crews will have a cell briefing annotated on GDSS, which all crewmembers are
expected to attend.
16.2.1. (Added) The 22 OSS/OSOK, Mission Planning Cell (MPC), completes mission planning
on all local 22 OG missions except OGS missions or any missions with navigators. If the
scheduled navigator is unable to mission plan, they will pre-coordinate with OSOK to ensure the
sortie is planned. Student navigators and navigators receiving a flight evaluation will plan their
own missions. The MPC completes much of the pre-mission planning on all 22 ARW OCONUS
and CONUS tasked missions, to include theater deployments, Coronets, and SAAMs
(CAPSTONES, Aeromedical Airlift, START missions, etc.). For Operation Noble Eagle
missions, the MPC will provide the flight plan, Falcon View Chart, current SPINS, ATO, and
Airspace info in the Crew Comm. safe at the CSOC. These items are classified and must be
returned to the safe or shredded on a classified shredder after the mission.
16.2.2. (Added) 22 OG/OGS plans all special operations missions.
16.7. (Added) Post-mission paperwork. The aircraft commander will consolidate the mission
paperwork and required forms in the mission package for mission review. Include the items
listed on the back of the briefing guide.
16.8. (Added) Upon completion of a TDY 22 ARW and 931ARG crews (or senior ranking
officer for several crews) should file an unclassified trip report and email a copy to 22 OG/OGV.
These trip reports are essential for passing current information on operations at various locations
to the entire crew force. OGV will make the trip reports available on the OGV website for
submission to the appropriate section of Vol I, Part D, of the FCIF. Only one trip report is
required to be filed for a multiple-ship TDY. Trip reports should remain in Part D for one year.
17.2. Responsibilities. 22 OSS/OSK is the OPR for the wing’s tactics program.
18.4. Ground Operations. All aircraft in the cell will use the same flap setting, take-off mode,
and climb gradient.
18.5.5. (Added) The Frequency Management Agency has approved four frequencies to be used
by McConnell aircrews for inter-plane communications during cell formation flights. These
frequencies are only authorized up to and including FL350 and for use in the following states:
AR, CO, KS, LA, MO, NE, NM, OK, and TX. Message AFAMC 97-1701 authorizes the use of
the following frequencies: UHF FREQUENCIES: 225.500 MHz, 225.450 MHz. VHF
FREQUENCIES: 138.350 MHz.
18.6. Launch, Departure, and Level-Off. When dissimilar aircraft are mixed in a single cell, or
aircraft gross weights differ by 10,000 pounds or more, the cell formation leader will brief and
use a constant-rate climb during the cell departure and join up.
18.6.6. Departure. Wichita Approach Control expects the formation leader to call “airborne” for
the flight immediately after the lead aircraft becomes airborne. Lead must not delay the
departure call while waiting for other aircraft in the formation to takeoff. Formation leaders will
direct each aircraft in the formation to report its passing altitude or flight level every 5,000 feet
when unable to maintain visual, TCAS, or radar contact.

18.6.6.1. For cell takeoff and departure from McConnell AFB, Wichita Approach Control has
approved and expects aircrews to use visual cutoff as necessary to expedite formation join up,
during day VMC conditions.
18.9. Formation Position Changes. Cell formation leaders will brief IMC and VMC cell
position change procedures on all missions.
