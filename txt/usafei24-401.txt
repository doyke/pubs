1. C88 Processing Procedures. USAFE-UK appointed customs clearance agents or the
receiving unit’s EUCOM appointed customs clearance officers are responsible for completing
the HMRC Form C88. SDDC UK Det, prepares manual C88s if there is no customs agent.
AMC (727AMS) prepares manual C88s for imports.
   1.1. HMRC Form C88 European Community Single Administrative Document is completed
   for the entry and clearance of goods being imported into the UK by U.S. Force. Imports must
   be for the exclusive use of U.S. Force’s units assigned to the UK.
   1.2. Prepare three HMRC Form C88s; an original and two copies. The original HMRC Form
   C88 and one copy are provided to HMRC and a copy is retained by the issuing office. See
   Attachment 12. HMRC will return approved copy after processed. Log the HMRC Form
   C88 in the customs form register. HMRC requires retention of C88s for a period of 4 years.
   See Attachment 8. When NATO Form 302-1 accompanies goods, NATO Form 302-1
   number will be referenced on C88 and NATO Form 302-1 copies 1, 2 and 3 presented to
   HMRC together with C88 and any supporting documentation. Copies 1 and 2 should be
   stamped and returned by HMRC to enable completion of reconciliation process.
   1.3. When goods arrive at commercial ports, and a USAFE-UK/A4 customs agent is not
   appointed, a U.S. Force’s Customs Clearance Officer is responsible for preparing HMRC
   Form C88 and submitting to HMRC together with accompanying documentation. The carrier
   will be instructed by U.S. Force Customs Clearance Officer to re-nominate shipment to IMP
   (import) to enable HMRC personnel at the hub to process U.S. Force’s C88 and clear the
   shipment. U.S. Force’s Customs Clearance Officer will monitor, respond to queries from
   HMRC and provide proof of clearance to carrier once obtained.
   1.4. Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Air Mobility
   Command (AMC) are the competent agencies for customs clearance at UK sea ports and
   military airports under their jurisdiction. Each Logistic Readiness Squadron and/or
   authorized area customs clearance officer is responsible for issuing HMRC C88s for
   movements which are not the responsibility of SDDC or 727 AMS (T-0).

2. Personal Effects. Where a consignment or conveyance within the Defense Transportation
System (DTS) consists of personal effects for a number of different personnel, only one HMRC
Form C88 is required to be completed by SDDC or 727 AMS. An HM Customs and Excise Form
C-2, Declaration of Personal Goods Imported by Member of Visiting Forces, March 1984 or DD
Form 1434, UK Customs Declaration for the Importation of Personal Effects of U.S.
Forces/Civilian Personnel on Duty in the UK, June 2002, is required to be completed by each
person importing goods in that consignment. These forms together with full inventory should be
attached to the HMRC Form C88 on presentation to HMRC; presentation will be completed by
U.S. Force’s Customs Clearance Officers or personal property Agents in accordance with
contracts and agreements with HMRC. See Attachment 12.
   2.1. Shipments from U.S. Force’s units located in EU countries. See Attachment 9 for a
   listing of EU countries. When imports from EU countries are accompanied by NATO Form
   302-1, only U.S. Forces Customs Clearance Officers based in the UK are authorized to
   present to HMRC. U.S. Force consignees in UK receive NATO Form 302-1 from U.S.
   Force’s units located in EU countries and receipt for the shipment on the NATO Form 302-1
   as prescribed in ECM 4504.01 and DoD 4500.9R, Part V, Chap 510. Completed NATO
   Form 302-1 will be forwarded to HM Revenue & Customs together with HMRC Form C88
   and supporting documentation. See Attachment 12. The destination Personal Property
   Shipping Office (PPSO), Installation Transportation Officer or Customs Clearance Officer in
   the UK will retain one completed NATO Form 302-1 in their file.
   2.2. Shipments to U.S. Force’s units located in EU countries. For movements between
   commercial premises/commercial companies, the commercial agent must take responsibility.
   For exports from the UK to other EU locations, HMRC requires use of New Computerised
   Transit System.
   2.3. Personnel will complete HMRC Form C2 to clear personal effects commercially
   imported after their initial entry into the UK. Personnel should be aware that bonded agents
   and warehouses in the UK are only given between 7-10 days of free storage for shipments to
   clear before daily storage accrual fees are assessed against the member. Personnel may
   contact their local PPSO for assistance in these cases.
   2.4. Shipments for personnel who are separating or retiring and settling in the UK will be
   processed by use of HMRC Form C3. Shipments processed by 727 AMS or SDDC will be
   submitted to National Clearance Hub Salford with a C-130 removal note.
3. Exports. The following procedures are to be used for the export of goods from UK:
   3.1. HMRC Form C88 is completed for the export of U.S. Force’s goods from the UK.
   Copies 2 and 3 are used. Goods exported must be those which were used exclusively by U.S.
   Force’s units assigned to the UK. DCMA – Northern Europe (NE), SDDC UK-DET, and 727
   AMS (AMC) may request modifications to export procedures to satisfy unique requirements;
   however, any modifications must be coordinated and approved by USAFE-UK/A4 and
   HMRC prior to implementation.
USAFEI24-401 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                11


   3.2. Prepare HMRC Form C88s copies 2 and 3. The original HMRC Form C88 is provided
   to HMRC and a photocopy is retained by the issuing office. See Attachment 12. HMRC will
   return copy (number 3) when processed. Log the HMRC Form C88 in the customs form
   register. HMRC requires retention of C88s for a period of 4 years. See Attachment 8.
   3.3. A NATO Form 302-1 is not used for exports to non-EU countries. A NATO Form 302-1
   may still be required if the shipment transits EU countries enroute to a non-EU destination.
      3.3.1. A NATO Form 302-1 will be used for U.S. Force loaded, sealed and dispatched
      surface (truck) movements within the EU; for such movements where destination is
      within the EU, no HMRC Form C88 will be required. UK policy states that movements
      completed under the NATO Form 302-1 procedure must commence and terminate at a
      NATO Visiting Forces base within the EC and that a competent NATO authority must
      complete the NATO Form 302-1. When NATO Form 302-1 is issued the movement is
      the responsibility of the Force and the releasing unit that prepared the NATO Form 302-1
      for HMRC will ensure personnel provide one copy of NATO Form 302-1 to HMRC
      following release of shipment. See Attachment 12. Consignor will retain one copy of the
      form but original and all other copies will accompany the shipment. Ensure carrier is
      instructed to provide form to U.S. Force at destination for presentation to host nations
      Customs. Full compliance with NATO Form 302-1 completion, reconciliation and close-
      out process is required IAW DoD 4500.9R part V Chapter 510 and ECM 4504.01.
      3.3.2. NATO Form 302-1 will be pre-authenticated by HMRC prior to issuance which
      includes stamping/marking, and signing blank NATO Form 302-1 provided by U.S.
      Force’s units. See Attachment 12. U.S. Force are responsible for maintaining adequate
      supplies of pre-authenticated forms; HMRC monitor following pre-authentication and
      may require forms to be marked void once 60 days has passed.
   3.4. For movements between commercial premises/commercial companies, the commercial
   agent must take responsibility. For exports from the UK to other EU locations, HMRC
   requires use of New Computerised Transit System.
   3.5. Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Air Mobility
   Command (AMC) are the competent agencies for customs clearance at UK sea ports and
   military airports under their jurisdiction. Each Logistic Readiness Squadron and/or
   authorized area customs clearance officer is responsible for issuing HMRC C88 for
   movements which are not the responsibility of SDDC or 727 AMS (T-0).
   3.6. Preparation of HMRC Form C88. This paragraph describes the information to be
   entered in each box of the HMRC Form C88 when it is used as an export declaration form by
   the U.S. Force. Boxes on the form will be completed in accordance with Table 2:

6. Non-U. S. Visiting Force Shipments. Unless specifically agreed between the U.S. and UK,
items which do not meet the criteria for the exclusive use of the U.S. Force in the UK, must not
be provided a Customs entry using any CPC listed in Table 1 or Table 2. Items which do not
meet Visiting Forces criteria include movements to UK contractors supporting Department of
Defense (DoD) contracts for repair/calibration and return to locations outside of the UK; exports
of production items, or imports of government furnished material for processing into an end item
to be exported from the UK; foreign military sales/items loaned/items transferred between U.S.
Force and MoD (including between U.S. and British Forces within the UK); movements to/from
museums including military museums; no shipments in these categories will normally qualify for
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) concessions. An HMRC Form C88 will NOT be issued
under normal circumstances. Goods are not permitted to be transferred between U.S. and British
Forces within the UK when Customs cleared into the UK for the exclusive use of the U.S. Force;
items are designated non-EU goods and remain bonded. An agreement is in place between
HMRC and USAFE-UK governing the process for movement of non-U.S. Visiting Forces
shipments using the Defense Transportation System (DTS). These DTS movements involving
military airlift are only approved in and out of the UK utilizing RAF Mildenhall. All shipments
must be reported to the Airlift Clearance Authority (ACA) at RAF Mildenhall as designated by
USAFE-UK/A4, and the DTS will only be utilized for class 1 items and/or other items requiring
transportation protection services. Other movements made by commercial means must not
transit U.S. Force locations in the UK, but must be shipped direct to the destination
Contractor/British Forces location, with consignee responsible for all import Customs processes.
See paragraph 6.2 for exception relating to contractor operated functions.
   6.1. Clearance of Non-U.S. Visiting Forces Shipments.
       6.1.1. Imports to the UK. When non-U.S. Visiting Forces destined shipments move via
       the DTS into the UK, the appropriate U.S. agency must notify the UK consignee and
       advise the consignee or the consignee’s agent to lodge a customs clearance request to HM
       Revenue & Customs. These shipments will not be released until customs clearance is
       granted. For shipments arriving via AMC aircraft into RAF Mildenhall, USAFE-UK/A4
       ACA at RAF Mildenhall notifies the UK contractor; for shipments arriving via Military
       Sealift Command (MSC) vessels, Universal Service Contract, or any other vessels that
       MSC has oversight over, SDDC UK-DET notifies the UK contractor. Should any items
       arrive at other than the authorized RAF Mildenhall military airfield, the responsible
       receiving Unit having knowledge of the shipment will ensure that the shipment is referred
       to the ACA at RAF Mildenhall for notification process; shipment will not be released
       from U.S. Force’s possession until clearance has been obtained and proof provided to the
       ACA.
       6.1.2. Exports from the UK. When movement from the UK is permitted via the DTS,
       DCMA, the UK contractor, UK museum or British Forces shipper (FMS and co-operative
       airlift agreement cargo) will be responsible for arranging their own customs clearance for
       export shipments. For military airlift, before any cargo is physically sent to RAF
       Mildenhall, it has to be cleared through the Airlift Clearance Authority (ACA), by
       providing a DD Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document, October
16                                                     USAFEI24-401 17 OCTOBER 2014


     2000, with any supporting documentation such as Shipper’s Declaration and proof of
     Customs export approval (Permission to Proceed status) via fax or email. Delivery can
     only be made once approved by the ACA who will liaise with 727 AMS. In addition, a
     copy of the documents must accompany the shipment when it is delivered.
  6.2. Contractor Operated Functions. Contractor operated functions directly supporting a US
  Force mission in the UK will generally qualify for import concessions under the SOFA. In
  these cases, HMRC Form C88s facilitate the importation/exportation of supplies and
  equipment into/from the UK when those items directly support the unit’s mission. Requests
  by contractors for HMRC Form C88s must be validated in writing by a competent authority.
  A competent authority may be an officer, senior noncommissioned officer or DoD Civilian
  equivalent of the supported unit or a DoD contracting authority operating in the UK. A
  competent authority is not a contractor or any of their employees. The competent authority
  must clearly identify the item(s) to be imported/exported and include a statement certifying
  that identified items are being imported/exported and are for the use of the U.S. Force
  stationed in the UK.
