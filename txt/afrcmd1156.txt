1. Mission: The 1 ASF, working in tandem with the Federal Aviation Administration, performs
flight inspections of navigational aid radar and instrument procedures at military and civilian
installations in the United States and overseas. They fly and help maintain the FAAs Bombardier
"Challenger" 601, 604 and 605.
2. Command. The 1 ASF Commander (CC):
     2.1. Reports to the Commander, 507th Operations Group.
     2.2. Exercises administrative control over assigned personnel.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Execute commander’s responsibilities as outlined in AFI 1-2, Commanders
     Responsibilities.
     3.2. Provides oversight and execution of the 1 ASF mission.
     3.3. MOAs/MOUs with the FAA define the 1 ASF operational mission sets. 1 ASF also
     augments the Air Force Flight Standards Agency Detachment 1, the on-site active duty unit.
4. Mobilization. AFRC forces are under the administrative control (ADCON) of AFRC/CC.
When activated or mobilized (e.g. under 10 U.S.C. §§ 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or
12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to
which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the
operational chain of command established by that commander.
