Section D—Use and Proper Control of Personal Electronic Devices (PED) and
Accountability/Marking of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)/Assigned or Issued
Equipment (Applicable to AFRC units)

13. Use and Proper Control of PED.
   13.1. Unit leadership will ensure proper use and control of PED.
   13.2. PED used on the flight line or in unit work areas will only be used for
   official/authorized business. Devices will not be used while actively performing tasks such as
   loading passengers/cargo or operating equipment/vehicles.
       13.2.1. During aircraft maintenance actions, PED not required in the performance of
       aircraft maintenance, will be powered off. Placing PED in the silent or vibrate mode does
       not satisfy this requirement. This restriction does not apply to personnel performing
       management duties, such as Duty Officer or Ramp Controller.
   13.3. Unit personnel will comply with PED restrictions in T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing
   of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding, AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, AFI

14. Accountability/Marking of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)/Assigned or Issued
Equipment.
   14.1. Only individual equipment items purchased by the unit are authorized for use in work
   centers and on the flightline. Individual equipment items authorized for use on the flightline
   includes but is not limited to: PPE, reflective vests/belts, ear defenders, gloves; light wands,
   fall restraint harnesses, Night Vision Goggles (NVG), Gerbers, Leathermans, Mag Lights,
   aircraft loading checklists; tools assigned to specific aircraft servicing equipment such as
   Lavatory Service Truck (LST) or Potable Water Trucks; and, aircraft intercom headsets.
   14.2. Units will ensure accountability/marking of equipment assigned/issued to an individual
   or team.
      14.2.1. Personnel will account for all equipment on their person or used on the flightline,
      before departing/returning to their work center or proceeding from one work
      assignment/task to another. Equipment accountability will be documented at the
      beginning and end of each shift.
   14.3. Marking of equipment assigned/issued to an individual will be accomplished prior to
   utilizing equipment.
      14.3.1. Minimize identification markings (first initial, last name, and GO81
      man/employee number or other code approved by AMC/A4TR) on equipment such as ear
      defenders, reflective vests/belts, gloves, etc., which allows continued use of PPE when
      individuals Permanent Change of Station/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCS/PCAs).
      PPE issued and marked following previous guidance does not need to be re-etched or
      replaced solely to comply with these marking requirements; however, if any part of the
      Social Security Number (SSN) has been used it will be removed. Markings are not
      required on issued individual clothing, with the exception of gloves.
          14.3.1.1. Contingency Response Wing (CRW) personnel will use the last four
          numbers of the DoD Identification (ID) number (found on the back of their ID card).
          Personnel may continue to use the last four digits of their SSN if they have an ID card
          with their SSN, until the ID card is replaced and a DoD ID number is assigned.
   14.4. Tools assigned to a vehicle or equipment, for example a screw driver, pliers, flashlight,
   etc., will be listed on the vehicle/equipment, AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
   Trouble Report, and marked with the Vehicle Identification number and unit work center
   (e.g., 723 AMS/TROF).
   14.5. Units will immediately initiate lost or missing equipment item(s) procedures.
      14.5.1. The person identifying the missing item will search the immediate work area.
      After completing an initial search and the item is not found, notify the Flight
      Commander/Chief and the Duty Officer, or the equivalent thereof.
      14.5.2. The Duty Officer, or equivalent, will:
          14.5.2.1. Initiate a search for the item and if the item is not found, determine when to
          terminate the search.
          14.5.2.2. Notify the Operation Terminal Operations Center and Unit Commander
          when an item cannot be found.
