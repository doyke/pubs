1. Purpose. The USAF Academy Preparatory School Advisory Committee (PSAC) reports to
the Superintendent and is focused on enhancing the integration of Preparatory School functions
and operations with other USAFA mission elements to best prepare Cadet Candidates to succeed
and lead at USAFA. The PSAC inquires into the morale and discipline; academic curriculum,
instruction, and methods; athletic and fitness programs; honor and character program; facilities
and infrastructure; and any additional subjects that impact Preparatory School mission
accomplishment or operations as determined by the PSAC chair.
2. Composition. The Superintendent’s USAFA Preparatory School Advisory Committee
(PSAC) is composed of:
     2.1. Vice Dean of the Faculty (USAFA/DFV), who will serve as chairperson.
     2.2. Vice Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CWV).
     2.3. Vice Commandant for Culture and Climate (USAFA/CWP).
     2.4. Director, Center for Character & Leadership Development (USAFA/CWC).
     2.5. Associate Athletic Director for Recruiting Support (USAFA/ADR).
     2.6. Director, Admissions (HQ USAFA/RR).
     2.7. Director, Manpower and Personnel (HQ USAFA/DP).
     2.8. Head, Department of Mathematical Sciences (USAFA/DFMS).
     2.9. Head, Department of Chemistry (USAFA/DFC).
     2.10. Head, Department of English and Fine Arts (USAFA/DFENG).
     2.11. Director, Student Academic Services (USAFA/DFRL).
     2.12. Commander, 10th Civil Engineer Squadron (10 CES/CC).
     2.13. Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (10 MSG/CD)
     2.14. As areas of special interest or as problem areas are identified, at the request of the
     chair, the PSAC may be augmented by adding other Academy officials when performing
     visits.
3. PROCEDURES. The PSAC will formally visit the Preparatory School twice each year. The
Committee or its members may make other informal visits to the Preparatory School in
connection with duties of the committee or to consult with the commander. A working-level
program of interaction between the Academy mission elements and their Preparatory School
counterparts is strongly encouraged. These activities include instructor exchanges, attendance at
each other’s faculty development programs, frequent cross talks, and establishment of joint
Process Action Teams to deal with specific issues that are not easily resolved. The PSAC should
be briefed on these activities during the formal visits.
4. RESPONSIBILITY. At least two weeks before each semiannual formal visit, committee
members will submit the findings of their informal counterpart meetings to the chair. After each
formal visit, committee members will submit individual or group reports to the chair on their
issues of interest. Within two months after the spring visit, the chair will submit a final written
report of the PSAC’s actions, reviews, and recommendations to the Superintendent. Units are
responsible to comply in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and are
