                                             Chapter 1

                            GENERAL POLICY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. T&E Purpose. The overarching functions of T&E are to manage risks, identify and help
resolve deficiencies as early as possible, and ensure systems are operationally effective and
suitable. T&E is conducted and reported independently of the developer, user, and system
contractor. There are two types of T&E in the defense acquisition system: developmental test
and evaluation (DT&E, or DT) and operational test and evaluation (OT&E or OT). Refer to AFI
99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, for amplified definitions. HQ AMC/TE
conducts OT and coordinates resources for DT.
     1.1.1. DT&E is conducted throughout the acquisition and sustainment processes to assist in
     engineering design and development and verifies that critical technical parameters (CTPs)
     and specifications have been achieved. DT&E supports the development and demonstration
     of new materiel or operational capabilities as early as possible in the acquisition life cycle,
     and may include contractor testing. Air Force Material Command (AFMC) is the lead
     agency for Air Force DT and designates Lead Developmental Test Organizations (LDTOs)
     through the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force
     Sustainment Center (AFSC) Program Offices.
        1.1.1.1. Qualification Test and Evaluation (QT&E) is a tailored type of DT&E conducted
        for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items, non-developmental items (NDI), and
        government furnished equipment (GFE).
        1.1.1.2. Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) is a type of DT&E that provides timely,
        rigorous, and credible vulnerability or lethality T&E of “covered” systems requiring
        LFT&E as they progress through the Engineering and Manufacturing Development
        (EMD) phase prior to Full Rate Production (FRP) or a major system modification that
        affects survivability.
     1.1.2. OT&E evaluates system effectiveness and suitability. The Air Force Operational Test
     and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) and MAJCOM testers determine if operational
     requirements have been satisfied and assesses system impacts to peacetime and combat
     operations. It identifies and helps resolve deficiencies as early as possible, identifies
     enhancements, and looks at changes in system configuration that alter system performance.
     OT&E includes a determination of the operational impacts of fielding and/or employing a
     system across the full spectrum of military operations. OT&E may also look at doctrine,
     operational concepts, system performance, procedures, tactics, training, organization, human
     factors such as workload, logistics support elements, intelligence support elements, and
     materiel issues. All programs that result in a FRP or fielding decision (full or partial
     capability) require an appropriate type of operational testing supported by sufficient
     independent evaluation to inform the decision. The operational test organization (OTO), in
     conjunction with the user and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) oversight
     organizations (if applicable), will determine the appropriate level of operational testing
     required.
     1.1.3. AFOTEC is the single Air Force operational test agency (OTA) for Initial OT&E
     (IOT&E), Follow-on OT&E (FOT&E), and Qualification OT&E (QOT&E). AMC conducts
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     5


   OT&E through Force Development Evaluations (FDE) and Operational Utility Evaluations
   (OUE) according to Chapter 1.3. AFOTEC and Major Commands (MAJCOM) may conduct
   OUEs, Operational Assessments (OA), and Multi-Service OT&E (MOT&E). AFOTEC
   requests MAJCOM resources according to paragraph 4.5.
       1.1.3.1. AFOTEC and MAJCOM testers determine the operational effectiveness and
       suitability of the system under test using production or production-representative articles
       that have demonstrated stabilized performance in an operational environment.
       1.1.3.2. IOT&E is the primary dedicated OT&E of a system before FRP or fielding as
       directed by DoDI 5000.02. IOT&E determines if operational requirements and critical
       operational issues (COI) have been satisfied and assesses system impacts to peacetime
       and combat operations. Tests are conducted under operational conditions, including
       combat mission scenarios that are as operationally realistic as possible. A dedicated
       phase of IOT&E is required for new acquisition category (ACAT) I and II programs, as
       well as for all Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) OT&E Oversight programs in
       accordance with (IAW) DoDI 5000.02. The determination of appropriate types of
       operational testing for subsequent modifications and upgrades, as well as applicability to
       other types of programs is addressed in AFI 99-103.
       1.1.3.3. QOT&E is a tailored type of IOT&E on the types of systems tested in QT&E.
       1.1.3.4. MOT&E can be IOT&E, QOT&E, or FOT&E, or FDE when two or more
       military Services are involved. It may be conducted by AFOTEC or as an FDE with a
       MAJCOM designated as the lead test organization.
       1.1.3.5. FOT&E is the continuation of OT&E after IOT&E or QOT&E. It answers
       specific questions about unresolved COIs and uncovered issues; verifies the resolution of
       deficiencies or shortfalls determined to have substantial or severe impact(s) on mission
       operations; or completes T&E of those areas not finished during OT&E.
   1.1.4. The generic term OT&E is often substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, OUE, and
   FDE and depending on the context, can have the same meaning as those terms. Operational
   tests conducted or directed by AMC focus on testing mobility systems in the operational
   environment and may generally be referred to as OT&E.
1.2. AMC T&E Purpose. HQ AMC/TE conducts OT to determine the operational
effectiveness and suitability of systems, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), training,
and doctrine, or the operational potential for the MAF. This information is provided to support
senior-level decision makers in mitigating risk associated with these programs. AMC testers
conduct T&E in the most realistic operational environment as possible to meet AMC’s lead
command requirements throughout the system’s life cycle or tactics employment. Conditions
should be representative of operational conditions to include wartime surge and combat support
requirements at austere sites and humanitarian operations. Testers may use modeling and
simulation (M&S) as an evaluation tool to augment, extend, or enhance field test results. AMC
conducts T&E to:
   1.2.1. Answer COIs to determine operational effectiveness, suitability, or capacity to achieve
   operational capabilities. AMC normally uses effectiveness and suitability as a basis for
   COIs.
 6                                                            AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


     1.2.2. Answer Assessment Objectives (AO) for potential effectiveness, suitability, or
     capability of a system, procedure, or tactic to perform the intended mission during
     operational assessments (OA). COIs may be more appropriate when the OA supports
     significant acquisition events (e.g., program funding increments, a MS, or entry into OT) and
     when criteria are defined. Applicability of COIs or AOs will be determined by integrated test
     teams (ITT). Exception: Use of AOs is not an AATC requirement.
     1.2.3. Identify and report operational capabilities, limitations, and deficiencies to include:
        1.2.3.1. Documenting deficiencies for resolution.
        1.2.3.2. Recommending changes in system configuration.
        1.2.3.3. Providing information for developing TTPs.
     1.2.4. Provide information to refine operations and maintenance (O&M) cost estimates and
     to identify system characteristics or deficiencies concerning operations and logistics.
     1.2.5. Identify, evaluate, and report logistics support capabilities to include reliability,
     availability, and maintainability limitations and deficiencies. Evaluate overall logistics
     supportability of a system to meet wartime usage requirements.
     1.2.6. Identify preventive maintenance requirements, costs, frequency, and complexity of the
     task.
     1.2.7. Assess the survivability and reliability of the system in the operational environment.
     1.2.8. Identify, evaluate, and design controls to minimize potential health effects that may be
     generated by the system.
     1.2.9. Evaluate system compatibility, interoperability, and integration, and assess test
     security of classified and/or sensitive information that is stored in or used by the system.
     1.2.10. Identify, assess, and mitigate, to the greatest extent practicable, human health, safety,
     and environmental risks resulting from the testing of systems.
1.3. AMC T&E Activity. AMC conducts OT and coordinates DT resources for MAF
programs. These efforts will be integrated with other testing whenever practicable including
early involvement during DT. T&E documents such as test plans, test reports, interim reports,
program documents including Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP) and Memorandums of
Agreements (MOA), consolidated staff coordination, and approval or concurrence documents
shall be entered into the AMC Test Information Management System (TIMS).
     1.3.1. Force Development Evaluation (FDE). AMC conducts FDEs to further develop
     doctrine, operational concepts, system performance, tactics, procedures, workload, training
     programs, organization, personnel, the logistics elements, and materiel issues. System
     operators use the force development processes to ensure their systems continue meeting
     operational needs. In addition, FDEs:
        1.3.1.1. Help refine employment doctrine and tactics in response to changing threats and
        operational procedures and training programs.
        1.3.1.2. Evaluate changes and verify correction of previously identified deficiencies from
        operational testing and new deficiencies discovered after system deployment.
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                       7


  1.3.2. Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E). TD&E is a tailored type of FDE
  conducted by MAJCOMs to refine doctrine, system capabilities, and TTPs throughout a
  system’s life cycle. TD&Es normally identify non-materiel solutions to problems or evaluate
  better ways to use new or existing systems. HQ AMC/TE shall test and evaluate tactics once
  developed. See AFI 11-260, Tactics Development Program, and AMCI 11-207, AMC
  Tactics Program, for the tactics development process and agency responsibilities.
  1.3.3. Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE). AMC conducts OUEs whenever an operational
  T&E event is required but the full scope of a formal IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, or FDE is
  not appropriate or required. OUEs may be used to support operational decisions (e.g.,
  fielding a system with less than full capability) or acquisition-related decisions (e.g., low-rate
  initial production [LRIP]) when appropriate throughout the system lifecycle. OUEs may be
  applicable when the test requester accepts risk factors such as less than standard confidence
  levels, only suitability or effectiveness, or scope limitations. OUEs should be conducted with
  minimal expenditures of time, funds, and assets, and be flexible in planning and reporting
  formats. AMC uses OUEs to:
     1.3.3.1. Identify deficiencies on fielded systems.
     1.3.3.2. Obtain insight into future operational effectiveness/suitability or military utility
     of commercial-off-the-shelf systems and non-developmental items to determine
     operational utility.
     1.3.3.3. Validate a system concept.
     1.3.3.4. Evaluate the expanded (modified) role or mission of fielded systems.
     1.3.3.5. Evaluate routine software block cycle changes, operational flight programs, pre-
     planned product improvements, modifications, upgrades, mission data updates, and other
     improvements or changes during sustainment. FDEs may be used for major upgrades.
     1.3.3.6. Assess competing concepts, alternatives, or systems.
     1.3.3.7. Evaluate new application of existing technology.
  1.3.4. Operational Assessment (OA). OAs are conducted by AMC or AFOTEC in
  preparation for dedicated operational testing and typically support milestone (MS) C or LRIP
  decisions. They are designed to be progress reports and not intended to determine the overall
  effectiveness or suitability of a system. OAs also provide a progress report on the system’s
  readiness for IOT&E or FDE, or support the assessment of new technologies. OAs will not
  be used as substitutes for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, FDE, or OUE. OAs are integrated with
  DT when possible and may be used to:
     1.3.4.1. Assess and report on a system’s maturity and potential to meet operational
     requirements during dedicated operational testing.
     1.3.4.2. Support increments of acquisition programs and may be used to support the
     assessment of new technologies or the gathering and assessment of data for command-
     directed mission capabilities.
     1.3.4.3. Identify deficiencies or design problems that can impact system capability to
     meet concepts of employment, concepts of operation or operational requirements.

       1.3.4.4. Uncover potential system changes needed which in turn may impact operational
       requirements, COIs, or the acquisition strategy.
       1.3.4.5. Support the demonstration of prototypes, new technologies, new applications of
       existing technologies, and proof of concept initiatives.
    1.3.5. Early Operational Assessment (EOA). EOAs are similar to OAs, except they are
    performed prior to MS B to provide very early assessments of system capabilities and
    programmatic risks. Most EOAs are reviews of existing documentation, but some may
    require hands-on involvement with prototype hardware and/or software.
    1.3.6. Trip Report. These may be general or specific observations for determining T&E
    requirements focusing on anomalies in a specific application (e.g., system demonstration or
    implementation by non-MAF organizations) and may stand alone or be integrated with other
    OT&E events. Such reports are not conclusive and shall not result in recommendations or
    publication. Test Managers (TM) and Test Directors (TD) shall identify focus areas after
    consulting program managers (PM) and functional managers (FM) for key observation
    interests. See paragraph 3.5.2. for reporting guidelines.
    1.3.7. Level I Information and Business Systems OT&E. An evaluation of operational
    effectiveness and/or suitability primarily using data from integrated test events other than a
    dedicated independent operational test including DT and may include certifications and
    independent observations of the capability being used in operationally realistic or
    representative conditions. Level 1 OT&E is appropriate for software and business
    information system capabilities determined as low risk by the program management office,
    user representatives, threat community, and the test team. Examples are low risk software
    maintenance upgrades, information system hardware upgrades, and software patches
    containing only minor capabilities or enhancements. See Attachment 2 for guidelines.
    1.3.8. Air Transportability Test Loading (ATTL). Validations and formal load T&E ATTLs
    are specific to the MAF. The customer submits a proposed shipping configuration
    considered a “transportability problem item” to the Air Transportability Test Loading
    Activity (ATTLA). In general, a cargo item may be considered problematic due to its
    physical size, weight, fragility, hazardous characteristics, or lack of adequate means of
    restraint. ATTLA will accomplish a technical analysis of the item and if analysis cannot
    determine the item can be safely loaded and airlifted, ATTLA will recommend either a
    loading validation or an ATTL.
       1.3.8.1. Loading Validation. ATTLA may request HQ AMC/TE to coordinate to have
       field unit evaluator or instructor loadmasters conduct load validation exercises prior to
       issuing final air transportability approval in lieu of an ATTL based on the technical
       analysis. Less rigorous load validations may be conducted by operational loadmasters in
       conjunction with the items first movement. Feedback on any required procedural
       adjustments to the airlift certification memorandum should be forwarded to HQ
       AMC/A3VX according to the appropriate Mission Design Series (MDS) AFI 11-2 series
       (chapter 13) procedures.
       1.3.8.2. ATTL. Test Loadings are coordinated by HQ AMC/TE to plan and execute
       ATTLs and report test criteria, results, and details of any specific procedures or
       preparations needed to load the item. ATTLA will usually approve an item for airlift
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     9


     based upon a successful test load via the air transportability certification memo. In
     addition, a copy of the memo is forwarded to HQ AMC/A3V for inclusion in their files
     and another copy of the memo is maintained permanently in the item's project file at
     ATTLA.
     1.3.8.3. Refer to DoDI 4540.07, Operation of the DoD Engineering for Transportability and
     Deployability Program, for air transport certification responsibilities. Also see AFMAN 24-
     204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments (Interservice) TM and
     ATTLA’s website at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AFLCMCEZF/ATTLA/SitePages/Home.aspx.
  1.3.9. Logistics Service Test (LGST). AMC conducts LGSTs to evaluate the operational
  effectiveness and suitability of specific logistic systems and subsystems when form, fit, and
  function replacement items are proposed by PMs or FMs. An LGST is smaller in scope than
  FDE or OUE and addresses candidate product improvement reliability, maintainability, or
  availability, and overall logistics supportability of proposed systems.
  1.3.10. Proposed Test Plan (PTP). AMC coordinates PTPs for airdrop T&E conducted by
  non-Air Force test agencies, mainly the U.S. Army and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA),
  submitted to AMC for approval when MAF resources are required. AMC support is
  described in paragraph 1.5.4.
  1.3.11. Joint Reliability and Maintainability Evaluation Team (JRMET). Established to
  collect, review, define, and categorize the reliability and maintainability (R&M) data during
  operational T&E, usually for OSD Oversight programs.
     1.3.11.1. The JRMET determines and documents operating and logistics procedures and
     defines failure categories including maintenance events.
     1.3.11.2. The JRMET will review the collected R&M data for accuracy and
     completeness. Data will only be collected from G081, an analytical system used to
     collect maintenance data for AF mobility aircraft.
  1.3.12. Integrated Systems Evaluation (ISE). This is a DT event intended to uncover
  potential problems when in an operational environment while system development is still
  covered by AFMC and contractors. Note: When ISEs or similar DT missions are to fly in
  the en route system TMs shall coordinate with 618th Air & Space Operations Center (Tanker
  and Airlift Control Center) (618 AOC (TACC))/XOOO to have the mission entered in the
  Global Decision Support System (GDSS), normally with a simulated AMC mission number.
  1.3.13. Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD). JCTDs are OSD-sponsored
  projects designed to exploit maturing technologies that have the potential to fulfill near-term,
  validated, joint military needs and rapidly transfer those technologies to operators. JCTDs
  are not a formal part of the acquisition process. They are highly tailored “demonstrations,”
  under the direction of a JCTD operator-sponsor that typically use operational demonstrations
  or military utility assessments for evaluation (OAs and OUEs may be conducted to meet this
  need). HQ AMC/TE may act as an independent assessor or as an OTO at the sponsor’s
  request.
  1.3.14. Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT). FCT is an OSD-sponsored T&E program
  centrally managed by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced
  Systems and Concepts) Comparative Testing Office. FCT is conducted on foreign nations’
10                                                      AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


  systems, equipment, and technologies to determine their potential to satisfy validated United
  States operational requirements.
  1.3.15. Sufficiency of Operational Test Review (SOTR)—An examination by MAJCOM
  operational testers of all available test data to: 1) determine if adequate testing has been
  accomplished for programs of limited scope and complexity; and 2) to assess the risk of
  fielding or production without a dedicated OT&E. SOTRs are not used in lieu of formal
  OT&E. HQ AMC/TE will provide test requesters with information to determine risk factors
  of not using T&E.
1.4. AMC T&E Management. HQ AMC/TE:
  1.4.1. Is the AMC single point of contact for all T&E issues.
  1.4.2. Manages and directs all AMC-conducted T&E through HQ AMC/TEP, the Policy and
  Resources Division, HQ AMC/TEA, the Mobility Test Management Division, and AMC
  Test and Evaluation Squadron (AMCTES), a Field Operating Agency (FOA) reporting to HQ
  AMC/TE.
  1.4.3. Coordinates MAF test projects conducted by AATC when tasked as the OTO for
  MAF T&E as a field test agency. OTOs from other MAJCOMs and Services will be
  arranged by mutual agreements. Test plans and test reports shall be reviewed and approved
  by HQ AMC/TE for all T&E issued by an HQ AMC/TE test order.
  1.4.4. Interprets and ensures compliance with DoD and HQ USAF T&E policy, formulates
  AMC T&E policy and procedures, and programs test resources.
  1.4.5. Reviews and coordinates on operational capability documents and other T&E-related
  acquisition documentation to ensure testability of requirements.
  1.4.6. Reviews and coordinates all Test Resource Plans (TRPs), TEMPs, and MOAs that
  require AMC resources.
  1.4.7. Budgets 3400 O&M funds for all AMC-conducted T&E, excluding test articles and
  procedure development. See paragraph 4.4.1 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 14.
  1.4.8. Validates all test requests through appropriate PMs or FMs at the 3-digit level and
  tasks AMC field test agencies to plan, conduct, and report on AMC T&E. Note: PMs may
  be at the MAJCOM, AFLCMC, AFSC, or other agencies and Services.
  1.4.9. Coordinates all T&E involving explosives or munitions with HQ AMC/SEW for
  safety issues and compliance.
  1.4.10. Staffs and coordinates non-AMC test plans and final reports from OTOs utilizing
  MAF resources with the AMC staff (division-level) and other agencies as appropriate, and
  provides an AMC approval memo prior to publishing. See paragraphs 3.3.3 and 3.3.4
  respectively.
  1.4.11. Approves or disapproves and processes any AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal,
  for temporary modifications for test (T-2 designation). See paragraph 3.6.
  1.4.12. Submits all Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) requests for AMC-
  conducted T&E. See paragraph 4.7.3.
  1.4.13. Reviews requests and authorizes release of any AMC test plans, reports, and data.
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   11


  1.4.14. Participates early in high performance teams (HPT) and ITTs which are cross-
  functional in nature and test integrated product teams (TIPTs) that focus on a specific test
  issue or problem in developing capabilities based requirements and test plans in support of
  acquisition and sustainment programs and operations.
  1.4.15. Chairs initial ITT for AMC-sponsored tests to establish COIs or AOs, evaluate
  baselines and organizational responsibilities, and determine resource requirements. The
  AFLCMC or AFSC Program Offices are co-chair for programs they manage. Composition
  of ITT members is based on the scope and type of test.
  1.4.16. Conducts on-going ITTs as needed in order to coordinate test planning, execution,
  and reporting efforts.
  1.4.17. Coordinates and obtains approval for Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
  passengers, test maneuvers, resource requirements defined in the plan, and assesses the need
  for waivers during issue of test orders and review of the draft test plan. See paragraph 3.3.3.
  1.4.18. Evaluates operational risk management (ORM) factors and test limitations.            If
  necessary, appropriate control measures will be addressed in the test order and ITTs.
  1.4.19. Coordinates all AMC-conducted T&E or other activity under an AMC test order with
  the environmental impact analysis process (EIAP) manager, HQ AMC/A7N, to determine the
  need for any additional environmental analysis beginning with the initial ITT. Exception:
  Ground testing only involving software loads or form, fit, and function checks. If an
  environmental analysis is required, HQ AMC/TE will initiate Section 1 of AF Form 813,
  Request for Environmental Impact Analysis.
  1.4.20. Coordinates AMC T&E requirements and efforts with the PM, FM, AFOTEC, the
  HQ AMC staff, 18 AF, and the 618th AOC (TACC)/XOB. See paragraph 4.7.1 concerning
  the tasking process.
  1.4.21. Closes out tests with test requesters by providing a final report recommendation
  summary and copy of the test report. The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)
  accession number (AN) for archived test documents shall be posted in TIMS.
  1.4.22. Field Test Agencies. AMCTES, with associated detachments and operating locations
  is the primary OTO for AMC. The Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test
  Center (AATC) may also be tasked as the OTO for MAF T&E. AMC field test agencies
  shall:
     1.4.22.1. Plan, execute, and report T&E for the MAF.
     1.4.22.2. Conduct safety review boards using             ORM     principles   and   include
     documentation of the safety review in the test plan.
     1.4.22.3. Develop internal processes to execute the guidance in this instruction when
     operating under an AMC test order.
  1.4.23. AMC PM/FM. The AMC PM/FM is the action officer who manages all aspects of a
  specific AMC materiel acquisition, tactics development, or training program. PM/FM
  responsibilities relating to T&E are to:
 12                                                         AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


      1.4.23.1. Coordinate with HQ AMC/TE at the beginning of all AMC materiel
      acquisition, procedure and tactics development, or training development programs when

      1.4.23.5. Assist the TM in securing operational unit support personnel, special
      equipment, and training for test execution when not included in 618th AOC (TACC)
      taskings. See paragraph 4.7.1 for tasking information.
      1.4.23.6. Ensure agreements have been made to exclude AMC test team liability for test
      articles reasonably used according to the test plan. Specifically, failure of a test article in
      an operationally representative environment will not be the responsibility of those
      conducting the test. See paragraph 3.3.3.3 for more guidance.
      1.4.23.7. Coordinate with HQ AMC/TE on all unsolicited proposals from contractors
      that could involve T&E.
1.5. AMC Management for Non AMC-conducted T&E. HQ AMC/TE reviews and
coordinates all non-AMC test documents and subsequent revisions that require the use of AMC
resources with the exception of LDTO T&E when AFMC has possession of the test resources.
HQ AMC/TE may conduct a singular review of test plans and test work request processes

                                           Chapter 2

                                    AMC T&E PROCESS

2.1. AMC T&E as a Continuous Process. AMC conducts T&E to allow senior leaders to
make informed decisions and mitigate risk throughout the acquisition, logistics support, and
tactics development processes. Figure 2.1 shows the AMC T&E process beginning as a user
need outlined in the test request. The test request identifies the requirement and its proposed
action. Test design is developed through the test order and test plan. The approved test plan
captures the detailed planning that structures the actual test conduct, data collection, and
analysis. The final report provides information for decision makers to mitigate operational and
acquisition risk.
2.2. Tailoring T&E. Since acquisition programs do not always follow a standard process,
AMC tailors T&E to meet specific program needs. LGSTs, ATTLs, OUEs, OAs, and certain
fast-track programs such as Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) may not require or allow for full
T&E. The test requestor shall assume operational or acquisition risk incurred to limitations in
these cases. HQ AMC/TE, field test agencies, and the user will determine the most cost-
effective, safe, best structured, and efficient manner to conduct T&E. Fast-track and other non-
standard programs are described in AFI 63-114, Quick Reaction Capability Process and AFI 10-
601, Operational Capability Requirements Development.
2.3. HQ AMC and Field Test Agency Process. Figure 2.1 shows the process to plan, execute,
report, and document AMC T&E activity. Validation of test requests and coordination of test
plans and test reports are completed at the HQ AMC division-level (three digit) or equivalent.
AATC processes are outlined in Attachment 3. Standard coordination includes HQ
AMC/A3D/A3V/A3T/A4M/A5Q/SEF/SEG/A7N/A6X/A6I. TMs shall discern appropriate
organizations to coordinate with based on possible impact to PM and FM responsibilities and
special mission requirements.
   2.3.1. Test requesters identify a requirement for evaluation (Step 1).
   2.3.2. HQ AMC/TE initiates the process with receipt of the HQ AMC division-level test
   request or validation for a request initiated outside HQ AMC (Step 2). The TM validates the
   test request when made by an agency outside the AMC staff by coordinating it through the
   appropriate functional areas (division or higher) of the AMC staff. At this point a
   determination is made whether or not to continue with OT planning. Discerning reasons may
   be that a DT effort is merited, OT has been previously accomplished, or a test article is not
   available. These factors are coordinated with the requester/validator.
   2.3.3. The TM conducts the initial ITT and the AMC PM/FM or AFLCMC/AFSC PM may
   co-chair at the TM’s discretion (Step 3). Identification of user defined criteria, critical
   requirements, limitations, COIs, and contractor document distribution requirements/
   limitations shall be identified early to promote test success. Further, any potential
   environmental risk factors should be addressed with HQ AMC/A7N.
   2.3.4. The TM uses initial ITT results to produce the test order (Step 4) which is used to task
   the appropriate test agency to begin planning and expending of resources. The AMC TM
   will confirm HQ AFRC or NGB requirements for AATC test order requests to identify
   similar work and follow-on logistic requirements incurred by AMC and the status of
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   15


  supporting documents (e.g., AF Forms 1067). AMCTES shall initiate the following
  processes upon receipt of the AMC test order (AATC and other OTOs use internal and
  congruent Air Force processes):
     2.3.4.1. AMCTES Test Order Review Committee (TORC). The TORC process ensures
     that the test order is understood and executable, reviews the requirements specified in the
     test order, ensures the proposed test has measurable criteria, and verifies the TD’s initial
     test strategy. The TORC will normally involve the TM and test requester.
     2.3.4.2. Safety Review Board (SRB). The purpose of the SRB is to review the draft test
     plan, identify hazards, determine hazard categories, review the operating hazard analysis,
     and assign an overall risk level to the test according to AMCTES OI 91-202, Operational
     Test Safety Planning (or AATC equivalent). Further, draft test plans and draft test reports
     will be reviewed by HQ AMC/SE for MAJCOM implications. ORM is a major
     consideration throughout the test process.
     2.3.4.3. AMCTES Technical Review Board (TRB). The purpose of the TRB is to review
     and approve the technical content of the test plan to ensure the proposed methodology
     will answer the Critical Operational Issues effectively and efficiently.
  2.3.5. The field test agency develops the draft test plan and submits it to HQ AMC/TE for
  headquarters staff coordination and AMC approval (Step 5).
     2.3.5.1. AATC will use internal corporate T&E processes to develop a test plan.
     2.3.5.2. Other OTO processes will be addressed and documented by ITT.
  2.3.6. The TM staffs the draft test plan, coordinates staff comments, resolves issues between
  the TD and staff when possible, and produces the HQ AMC/TE memorandum approving the
  test plan (Step 6). The TM and TD gather documents for OT readiness (e.g., DT report,
  Program Office or AMC PM determinations, AF Forms 1067, and air worthiness
  certifications).
  2.3.7. The field test agency publishes the final test plan and forwards a copy to DTIC (Step
  7) for archiving and AMCTES conducts a Test Readiness Review (TRR). The TRR is
  intended to determine that all pre-test activities are complete.
  2.3.8. The field test agency conducts the test and prepares situation reports as required (Step
  8). ITTs and/or test integrated product teams (TIPTs) may be convened as required. TIPTs
  are temporary and focus on a specific issue.
  2.3.9. The field test agency drafts a final report and AMCTES conducts a Squadron Report
  Review (SRR) to provide a critical review of the final report prior to submittal to AMC staff.
  The draft final report is then submitted by the field test agency to HQ AMC/TE for staffing
  and AMC approval (Step 9).
     2.3.9.1. AATC will use internal corporate T&E processes to develop a test report.
     2.3.9.2. Other OTO processes will be addressed and documented by ITT.
  2.3.10. The final cycle of staffing occurs when the TM staffs the draft final report, resolves
  issues between the TD and staff when possible, and produces the HQ AMC/TE memorandum
  with AMC approval of the final report (Step 10). During this staffing cycle, command
  Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPRs) are confirmed for each test recommendation.
 16                                                      AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


   2.3.11. The test is complete when the field test agency publishes the final report and
   forwards a copy to the test requester and to DTIC (Step 11) for archiving. The submitting
   office will provide the DTIC accession number (AN) to HQ AMC/TE after archiving is
   complete.
   2.3.12. The test process closes when the TM provides a test report and summary of test
   recommendations to the test requester. AATC or other OTOs will close any tests according
   to internal processes. Deficiency report follow-on actions such as review boards are
   described in paragraph 3.3.8.
2.4. AMC T&E Priority. A Test Priority List (TPL) is coordinated at the division level and
approved by directors. AMC test priority is based on urgency and timing of required test
information as determined by the user’s program needs. When conflicts occur, HQ AMC/TE
will meet with appropriate staff agencies for resolution. This is primarily used when there is a
shortfall in materiel, personnel, or T&E funding. Coordination takes place after inputs are
received in the February call for tests. See Chapter 4 for further information.
2.5. Reporting Responsibilities. During test planning, the TM, TD, and requester will
coordinate and conclude the report type, timeline for publication for the final report, and
requirement for an Interim Summary Report (ISR). These report requirements shall be
documented in the test plan.
2.6. Lessons Learned. TMs and TDs will document lessons learned throughout the course of
T&E activity to include situation reports, “hot washes,” and after action reports and forward to
HQ AMC/TEP for inclusion into Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) database as
applicable. HQ AMC/A9L provides guidance for JLLIS usage.

                                            Chapter 3

                               AMC TEST DOCUMENTATION

3.1. Introduction. The operational tester must be familiar with key AMC test documents and
their relevance to one another in order to plan, conduct, and report effective T&E. The reporting
requirement in this Chapter is exempt from licensing according to AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections.
3.2. Operations Security (OPSEC). T&E processes that involve mission critical information
(CI) concerning OPSEC vulnerabilities must be protected. The primary purpose of the OPSEC
program is to deny mission CI to our adversaries. AMC’s CI list can be obtained through HQ
AMC/A3D. OPSEC indicators, which are merely clues that when pieced together can lead our
adversaries to our CI, must be protected too. Mission CI and OPSEC indicators will not be
transmitted over unapproved or open communication-computer systems. Reports that clearly
identify mission CI should be marked at least For Official Use Only (FOUO). Always destroy
reports that identify mission CI and OPSEC indicators when no longer needed. See paragraph
3.4 for release of T&E documents.
3.3. Key Documents and Their Relevance to the AMC T&E Process.
   3.3.1. Test Request. HQ AMC division chiefs initiate or validate test requests and submit
   requirements to HQ AMC/TE. HQ AMC/TE identifies a TM to process the request and
   obtain validation as needed. See Attachment 4 for an example test request. The test request
   must contain a minimum of nine items:
       3.3.1.1. Test Purpose. Include test requirement originator.
       3.3.1.2. Need date for results. Impact and mitigation if not met.
       3.3.1.3. System description. Provide a general description of the article, procedure or
       tactic to be tested.
       3.3.1.4. Background including state of development and previous testing.
       3.3.1.5. Operational, logistics, and training concepts.
       3.3.1.6. Notional criteria.
       3.3.1.7. Funding plan including sources external to HQ AMC/TE.
       3.3.1.8. Additional information. Attach any supporting documentation.
       3.3.1.9. Points of contact.
   3.3.2. Test Order. HQ AMC/TE prepares a test order following the initial ITT which will
   include representation from the Program Office (if applicable), FMs, the test requester, the
   designated field test agency, and other involved contractors and operators. The test order
   will include:
       3.3.2.1. Test requester, test type, title, and project number.
       3.3.2.2. Purpose of test.
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                19


     3.3.2.3. Background for test request.
     3.3.2.4. Description of the candidate test article, system, procedure, or tactic and
     operational, logistics, and training concepts pertinent to the test.
     3.3.2.5. Emergency and special program (ESP) code.
     3.3.2.6. Contractor involvement. Identify funding, distribution restrictions, and use of
     proprietary data, if any. Note: Contractors may only be directly involved in OT when
     they are contractually included in the CONOPS/CONEMP for operational system
     employment (e.g., training, trouble-shooting, and sustainment).
     3.3.2.7. Scope and location to include in-place dates. Also identify test resources with
     OPRs, if known.
     3.3.2.8. Date results are required.
     3.3.2.9. Proposed COIs/AOs.
     3.3.2.10. Security classification and issues.
     3.3.2.11. Points of contact.
     3.3.2.12. Copy of the test request, capability or operational requirements documents, and
     CONOPS/CONEMP when available.
  3.3.3. Test Plan. The field test agency prepares a draft test plan and submits it to HQ
  AMC/TE for headquarters staff coordination. The approved test plan provides test program
  direction and guidance to AMC staff and designated units for the conduct of T&E.
     3.3.3.1. The test plan contains detailed test structure, evaluation methodology, required
     resources, and reporting requirements. The field test agency publishes the approved
     AMC test plan and submits it to DTIC.
     3.3.3.2. Contractor data may be used consistent with the contractor’s proprietary rights
     when appropriate and properly documented. For example, contractor data may be the
     only available data for non-fielded COTS systems. Contractors may only be directly
     involved in OT when they are contractually included in the CONOPS/CONEMP for
     operational system employment (e.g., training, trouble-shooting, and sustainment).
     3.3.3.3. Contractor provided test articles. HQ AMC/TE, AMCTES, or other field test
     agencies or OTOs operating under a HQ AMC test order will not be responsible for test
     articles without a documented arrangement. Agreements for loaned test articles that are
     non-AMC assets shall be the responsibility of the test requester. TMs shall ensure a test
     article loan agreement has been approved by HQ AMC/JA and that the terms of the
     agreement have been documented and provided to HQ AMC/TE. Part numbers shall be
     recorded by the TM and TD for all articles. See Attachment 5 for Policy Agreement for
     unsolicited articles, disclosures, inventions, and voluntary proposals for contracts.
     3.3.3.4. FDE, OUE, and OA test plan or test concept briefings are provided to and
     approved as directed by DOT&E for OSD Oversight Programs. Required timelines and
     criteria are outlined in AFI 99-103.
     3.3.3.5. MEP/Additional Crew Member (ACM) status for AMCTES and test participant
     personnel is IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift
20                                                        AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


     Operations policy. Approval authority for MEPs is the OG/CC with OPCON or the
     618th AOC (TACC) Senior for missions en route.
         3.3.3.5.1. When the need for MEP status is known prior to test plan approval the
         following statement should be included in the test plan: “The appropriate AMC
         command and control agency will ensure manifesting procedures are accomplished
         prior to reporting to the aircraft” and “MEPs do not have to process through the
         passenger terminal for anti-hijacking purposes which will be accomplished by the
         aircrew.”
         3.3.3.5.2. Test MEPs may be allowed on aircraft when unqualified pilots are
         undergoing training and on all training and operational missions concurrent with
         T&E.
     3.3.3.6. The test plan shall address any potential environmental risk factors and
     mitigation if required.
     3.3.3.7. Operational test plans issued under an AMC test order or using MAF resources
     require HQ AMC/TE approval or concurrence.
  3.3.4. Final Report. The field test agency (or other designated OTO) prepares a draft final
  report and submits it to HQ AMC/TE for headquarters staff coordination and approval. The
  final report is normally published within 50 calendar days after the last test event (normally
  completion of data analysis). Test acceleration will involve a HQ AMC/TE tasking with
  coordination and prioritization with AMCTES, AATC, or other designated OTOs.
     3.3.4.1. This report is an executive-level document which answers COIs or AOs and
     reports on overall operational effectiveness, suitability, or operational capabilities
     (progress toward or potential for AOs). The report includes test results, conclusions,
     deficiency reports, recommendations, comments on constraints and limitations, and
     operational impacts found. It is written objectively and directly relates test results to user
     criteria.
     3.3.4.2. The field test agency publishes the report and submits it to DTIC for archiving.
     It also provides a formal and permanent record of the results of all previous phases of
     T&E. The final report may include annexes consisting of the executive summaries from
     any previous phases of T&E when needed by the test requester for incremental
     development.
     3.3.4.3. FDE, OUE, and OA final reports are provided to DOT&E for OSD Oversight
     Programs. Required timelines and criteria are provided in AFI 99-103.
  3.3.5. Test recommendations. The final report identifies the HQ AMC/HQ AFRC/NGB
  division-level OPR for each recommendation. The field test agency will submit a change
  request when the test report identifies a publication discrepancy.
  3.3.6. Document change requests to technical orders on the AFTO Form 22, Technical
  Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply or AFTO Form 27, Preliminary Technical
  Order (PTO) Publication Change Request (PCR)/TO Verification Record/Approval.
  3.3.7. Document change requests to flight manuals and instructions on the AF Form 847,
  Recommendation for Change of Publication.
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                         21


   3.3.8. Deficiency Reports. The field test agency will accomplish administrative actions to
   report, investigate, and resolve deficiencies identified in the test report according to technical
   order (T.O.) 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution, and AFI
   63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. TDs will chair the Discrepancy Review
   Boards (DRBs) for reporting deficiencies and participate in resolution DRBs chaired by the
   PM as required.
3.4. Release of AMC Test Plans and Final Reports. AMCTES forwards all test plans and
final reports to the DTIC for publication. Other OTOs under HQ AMC test orders are
responsible for the same action.
   3.4.1. DTIC is the central facility for the collection and dissemination of scientific and technical
   information for the DoD and serves as the distribution center for all AMC published test plans
   and final reports. DTIC is the primary source for agencies or individuals to obtain test
   documents if they have distribution access (normally DoD and their contractors). Other requests
   should be sent to HQ AMC/TE. Exception: HQ AMC/TE may provide documents to the test
   requestor, FM, PM, or the sponsoring Program Office. All requests for AMC test plans or final
   reports should be submitted using the DTIC Form 55, Request for Release of Limited Document
   (online only) at http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/formsNguides/registration/form55.html.
   3.4.2. The distribution statement cited on AMC test plans and final reports normally
   authorizes the release of these documents to DoD components and their contractors. DTIC
   will release directly to any DoD component requesting a copy of an AMC test plan or final
   report. DTIC will forward all other requests to HQ AMC/TE for release determination for
   test plans and test reports generated by an AMC test order in accordance with AFI 61-204,
   Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, DoD Instruction 5230.24 Distribution
   Statements on Technical Documents and DoD Directive 5230.25, Withholding of
   Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure. Release of test documentation not held
   in DTIC must be approved by HQ AMC/ TE.
   3.4.3. Release of AMC test documentation to foreign agencies must be approved by the
   Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) in HQ AMC/A8XA and HQ AMC/TE. Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) requests are processed through the Information Access Section in
   HQ AMC/A6XX and in-turn through the Administrative Law Division and Ethics Material
   Division, HQ AMC/JAA.
   3.4.4. AMC test plans, test reports, and data will be openly shared with the test community
   when disclosure standards allow but will not be released prior to publication by the field test
   agency without the approval from HQ AMC/TE.
      3.4.4.1. Release of data requires full review and appropriate restrictions by HQ AMC/TE
      to avoid premature conclusions, ensure competition fairness, and prevent a violation of
      proprietary rights. Arrangements for release of data to contractors should be made
      through the DoD sponsor or test requester. Requests should be made prior to test
      execution whenever possible.
      3.4.4.2. Release of AMC test documents to contractors to advance system development
      for DoD when disclosure is “DoD only” may be pre-approved by HQ AMC/TE by
      inclusion in the document distribution list. Further distribution is prohibited.
 22                                                       AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


3.5. Other T&E Reports.
   3.5.1. Situation Report (SITREP). These reports focus on progress of test activity and on
   specific issues required to update leadership during execution and may be submitted by email
   or memorandum. SITREPS must only contain test status and schedule projections. Any data
   provided must be stated as conditional and inconclusive. These reports may be informally
   referred to as “status reports” by other T&E agencies. Other requests for SITREPs must be
   referred to HQ AMC/TE.
   3.5.2. Trip Report. Trip reports are subjective observations and are informative but
   inconclusive. These reports are prepared in memorandum format and are limited to the test
   requester, and HQ AMC FMs and PMs. Other requests for trip reports must be referred to
   HQ AMC/TE.
   3.5.3. ISR. The ISR summarizes preliminary T&E results in sufficient detail for the test
   requester to make programmatic decision based on assumed risk. The field test agency
   provides an ISR when requested by the test requester through the TM. These reports are
   prepared in memorandum format and are limited to test requester, HQ AMC FMs, and PMs.
   Other requests for ISRs must be referred to HQ AMC/TE.
   3.5.4. Semiannual Status Report (SSR). AMCTES will provide comprehensive semiannual
   status reports covering all current and recent AMC tests to HQ AMC/TE and agencies on a
   standard distribution list.
3.6. Documentation of Temporary Modifications for T&E. HQ AMC/TE is the single point
of contact for T-2 modification submissions for AMC. Temporary system modifications may be
required to conduct operational testing. Use AF Form 1067 to process all temporary
modification proposals for test (T-2 designation). Temporary modification approval is required
to attach new or modified equipment, to introduce devices that radiate electromagnetic energy, or
to attach instruments for test data collection. Refer to AFI 63-131, Modification Management;
AMC Supplement 1 to AFI 63-131 and AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
Management, for specific guidance.
   3.6.1. The AMC Configuration Review Board (CRB) shall approve all modifications on
   assets for which AMC is lead command according to AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
   Designation and Responsibilities for Weapons Systems. Exception: AFMC may conduct a
   Configuration Control Board (CCB) to approve T-2 modifications on AMC lead command
   assets it possesses for T&E under the condition that the aircraft/equipment will be returned in
   the original configuration when possession changes back to AMC. In these cases, an AMC
   CRB is not required. See AFMCI 21-126, Temporary 2 (T-2) Modification of Aerospace
   Vehicles.
   3.6.2. The AFLCMC or AFSC Program Office of the system being modified shall approve
   modifications through the program engineering authority and CCB prior to being
   implemented. The T-2 modification can be accomplished following Program Office
   approval. HQ AMC/TE provides command certification of the AF Form 1067s identified as
   a T-2.
   3.6.3. AMC T-2 modification approval and provisions will be included in the AMC staff-
   approved test plan along with air worthiness or safe-to-fly certification (AFLCMC/AFSC
   memorandums or AFMC Forms 273, Final Release for Flight Certificate).
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  23


  3.6.4. T-2 modifications will not be maintained on the system for longer than the approved
  test program requires. Systems will be returned to their original configuration upon
  completion of the test. Exception: Upon successful completion of testing, the modification
  may be left on aircraft at the request of an AMC division chief for follow-on T&E with
  AFLCMC or AFSC approval. The program will then be turned over to the appropriate AMC
  directorate for tracking purposes until final time compliance technical order is accomplished
  and a permanent modification approved.
  3.6.5. Modifications to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft should not
  cause the aircraft to lose its certification. All such modifications shall comply with AFI 63-
  131.
  3.6.6. Other Modifications. Temporary (T-1) and permanent modifications are used for
  operational requirements and T-2 designated modifications are not to be used as substitutes.
  Permanent modifications require full T.O. documentation are the responsibility of the
  PM/FM for the system. HQ AMC/TE reviews such modification proposals for the CRB to
  determine applicability for T&E.
  3.6.7. Additional documentation for modifications may be required to include explosive
  atmosphere testing (most often for tanker and C-17 aircraft due to fuselage fuel containment),
  Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC), Hazards of
  Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) testing, and ATTLA certification.

                                          Chapter 4

                                        RESOURCES

4.1. Resource Management. HQ AMC/TE plans and budgets for resources needed to support
the AMC T&E program using O&M 3400 funds.
   4.1.1. Test resources include, but are not limited to, personnel, flying hours, aircraft, test
   range support, M&S, instrumentation, T&E related travel and training, supplies, and special
   equipment.
   4.1.2. Test funds shall not be used to purchase test articles or development of tactics,
   techniques, and procedures.
4.2. Resource Funding. HQ AMC/TE operates from two different Operating Budget Account
Numbers (OBANs); NH and NJ. Test funds are managed by HQ AMC/TEP. All operating test
funds executed are recorded and tracked through HQ AMC/TE-issued Emergency and Special
Program (ESP) codes which are assigned for each approved test.
   4.2.1. NH T&E day-to-day support. The day-to-day mission of HQ AMC/TE is budgeted
   and funded from OBAN NH, Program Element (PE) 41898F (HQ Management Account).
   Day-to-day activities include temporary duty (TDY) travel, training, and supplies for both
   HQ AMC/TE and AMCTES and its associated Detachments and Operating Locations.
   4.2.2. NJ T&E Test Execution. The test execution mission of HQ AMC/TE is budgeted and
   funded from OBAN NJ, PE 48534F (Command Support). Test execution activities include
   resources required for test range support, M&S, instrumentation, contracted data reduction
   and analysis, and SAAMs. HQ AMC/TE manages all OBAN NJ funds.
   4.2.3. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding may be applied for NJ and NH
   costs when available and may be reimbursable.
   4.2.4. Range costs (NJ) at Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) facilities for
   OT&E may exceed budget limitations. AMC may mitigate by using OCO when appropriate
   and available, cost sharing with other MAJCOMS (normally Air Force Special Operations
   Command) and other Services.
4.3. Test Resource Requirements Planning.
   4.3.1. HQ AMC/TEP sends out an annual call for operational test requirements during the
   month of February to appropriate AMC 3-digit organizations and outside agencies requesting
   their next fiscal year (FY) T&E proposed test requirements. This call for test requirements is
   the first step in the annual TPL process.
   4.3.2. Flying Hour Program. Operational test flying hour requirements are provided
   annually to HQ AMC/A3TR by HQ AMC/TEP for inclusion in the Program Objective
   Memorandum (POM). Requirements for test hours generally must be provided at least 2
   years prior to the need date to be included in POM flying hour requirements.
   4.3.3. Military Personnel Appropriations (MPA) are Man-day sources for ANG and AFRC
   participation in T&E. The TMs provide an annual forecast of Man-days required to HQ
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     25


   AMC/TEP for submission into the AMC POM. Quarterly updates and any short notice
   requirements are identified to HQ AMC/TEP as soon as they are known.
4.4. AMC Test Program Resource Plans. AMC operational testers must plan and document
all resources necessary for AMC-conducted T&E for budget management and fiscal
accountability.
   4.4.1. TDs document Resource Plans in each test plan. Details shall include funding for
   AMCTES, HQ AMC/TE, and external agency TDYs, man-days, transportation and shipping
   costs, range support, instrumentation, aircraft, projected flying hours, service contract costs,
   SAAM requirements, special equipment, communication support, and office supplies. TMs
   will ensure their costs are included in the Resource Plan.
   4.4.2. TMs provide a summary of the AMCTES and HQ AMC/TE requirements to the TE
   spend plan on a quarterly basis (or as required).
   4.4.3. HQ AMC/TE may fund outside agency TDYs for:
      4.4.3.1. Aircrew and maintenance personnel required for test execution that are additive
      to normal AMC Service Mission Schedule unit taskings.
      4.4.3.2. Air Reserve Component (ARC) augmentation when requirements are to support
      AMC-conducted testing. TMs may arrange cost-share funding to meet component
      training requirements.
      4.4.3.3. Individuals required for on-site test planning and range support not funded by
      other sources.
   4.4.4. TMs shall ensure augmentee personnel funded by HQ AMC/TE shall provide
   pertinent information five duty days prior to travel for travel order preparation. They shall
   provide HQ AMC/TE a copy of the paid voucher within seven business days of completing
   TDY travel. Note: Members must file travel vouchers within five business days of
   completion of travel according to DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation.
4.5. TRPs. A TRP is an AFOTEC test resource plan that identifies resources and timelines
required to support AFOTEC-conducted IOT&Es, FOT&Es, MOT&Es, QOT&Es, OUEs, or
OAs. AFOTEC submits TRPs (normally October) once a year or twice a year when T&E is
within in two years of planned execution (normally April and October). They are sent to the
MAJCOMs as early as possible in the process by AFOTEC to allow resources to be submitted
into the POM if required. HQ AMC/TE coordinates TRPs with the HQ AMC staff for
supportability, accuracy, and commitment of future resources.
   4.5.1. HQ AMC/TEP serves as the focal point for the TRP coordination process. TRPs are
   staffed to the appropriate AMC-3 digit organizations for coordination of resource
   requirements by the TM. TMs integrate coordinated inputs (including comments from earlier
   versions not incorporated) into a formal concur or non-concur letter signed by HQ AMC/TE
   and directed back to AFOTEC through the TE Organizational e-mail account by HQ
   AMC/TEP.
   4.5.2. TRPs that only request air refueling support do not require HQ AMC staffing. TMs
   will ensure an Air Refueling Management System (ARMS) statement for submitting
   requested support is included in the Flying Hours section of the TRP and will also submit
   requirements to the AMC Service Mission Long Range Schedule when appropriate.
 26                                                       AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


4.6. Resource Usage.
   4.6.1. Testers must plan and conduct tests to take full advantage of existing or programmed
   test resources. Testers should reuse test assets when possible and eliminate duplication of
   effort to the maximum extent possible.
   4.6.2. Funds allocated for specific test programs and transferred to other agencies must be
   used for the express intended purpose as identified on funding document. Under no
   circumstance may agencies use such funds for other purposes without written approval from
   HQ AMC/TE.
4.7. Obtaining Test Resources. HQ AMC/TE is responsible for coordinating resources for
tests involving AMC personnel or equipment and the program manager/test requester shall
ensure the proper level of priority is assigned to task support for the test effort. HQ AMC/TE
may obtain test resources through the AMC staff by the following methods:
   4.7.1. Requests for MAF aircraft and aircrew support requirements for T&E are made
   through the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) Apportionment and Allocation
   Process (CAAP) by HQ AMC/TEP. An HQ AMC/TEP representative will act as the focal
   point for T&E requirements. CAAP is the primary channel through which HQ AMC/TE
   secures aircraft and aircrew required for accomplishing T&E, mainly through Training, Test
   and Ferry (TTF) flying time. Planned operational missions may be identified for testing on a
   non-interference basis. The 618th AOC (TACC)/XOBL places a call for inputs in January,
   April, July, and October. These inputs are included in the quarterly CAAP O-6 board to
   validate and prioritize requests. Once validated, 618th AOC (TACC) will add the
   requirements to the AMC Service Mission Long Range Schedule unit tasking approximately
   30 days prior to month of execution.
       4.7.1.1. Such requests for active duty forces will be coordinated through the appropriate
       group or maintenance commander and the HQ FM. When active duty support is tasked,
       HQ AMC/TE or the user/requester will fund TDY costs for personnel additive to the
       normal aircrew/maintenance compliment. This also applies to MPA man-days for
       augmentees.
       4.7.1.2. In the event the 618th AOC (TACC) is unable to secure active duty assets for
       testing activity, an attempt to solicit ARC support will be made by relaying the unfilled
       request through the 618th AOC (TACC) AFRC and ANG liaisons. At times, the ARC
       may be the only source of test assets or may volunteer to fill requirements. If the request
       does not go through the 618th AOC (TACC) for whatever reason, the TM shall
       communicate aircraft, aircrew, and maintenance requirements with the candidate ARC
       unit. If the unit agrees to participate, further coordination in the form of a 3-digit test
       support request memo must be submitted/coordinated through the AFRC Force
       Generation Center or the National Guard Bureau, as appropriate.
   4.7.2. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) missions, normally to support

Terms
Acquisition Category (ACAT)—Acquisition categories determine the level of review, decision
authority, and applicable T&E policies and procedures. They facilitate decentralized decision
making and execution, and compliance with statutorily imposed requirements. (See DoDI
5000.02, Enclosure 2)
Air Transportability Test Loading (ATTL)—A trial aircraft loading of a cargo item(s) that
due to its physical size, weight, fragility, hazardous characteristics, or lack of adequate means of
constraint might be considered a problem that requires evaluation for air transportability
certification.
Assessment Objective (AO)—A specific question for Operational Assessments with conditional
answers (not necessarily yes or no) to be examined by users concerning progress toward or
potential of operational effectiveness, suitability or capability of a system, process, or tactic to
perform the intended mission. Criteria for “potential” shall be established during ITTs for
inclusion in test plans.
Critical Operational Issue (COI)—A key question to be examined by operational testers and
users when evaluating overall operational effectiveness, suitability, or capability of a system,
procedure, or tactic to achieve operational capabilities. AMC uses effectiveness and suitability
as a standard.
Deficiency Report (DR)—The generic term used within the USAF to record, submit, and
transmit deficiency data which may include, but is not limited to, a Deficiency Report involving
quality, materiel, software, warranty, or informational deficiency data submitted using Standard
Form (SF) 368 or equivalent format according to T.O. 00-35D-54.
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)—Test and evaluation conducted to evaluate
design approaches, validate analytical models, quantify contract technical performance and
manufacturing quality, measure progress in system engineering design and development,
minimize design risks, predict integrated system operational performance (effectiveness and
suitability) in the intended environment, and identify system problems (or deficiencies) to allow
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     35


for early and timely resolution. DT&E includes contractor testing and is conducted over the life
of the system to support acquisition and sustainment efforts.
Follow—On Test & Evaluation (FOT&E)—FOT&E is the continuation of operational test and
evaluation (OT&E) after IOT&E or QOT&E and is conducted only by AFOTEC. It answers
specific questions about unresolved COIs and test issues; verifies the resolution of deficiencies
or shortfalls determined to have substantial or severe impact(s) on mission operations; or
completes T&E of those areas not finished during OT&E, QOT&E, or OUE.
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)—FDE is a type of dedicated operational test and
evaluation performed by MAJCOM operational test organizations in support of MAJCOM-
managed system acquisition-related decisions prior to initial fielding or for subsequent system
sustainment or upgrade activities. Use of OUE or FDE to support MAJCOM-managed
acquisition decisions is at the discretion of the appropriate MAJCOM staff or test organization.
Foreign Comparative Test (FCT)—A T&E program centrally managed by OSD which
provides funding for U.S. T&E of selected equipment items and technologies developed by
allied or friendly countries when such items or technologies are identified as having good
potential to satisfy valid DoD requirements.
Functional Manager (FM)—This instruction uses the term “FM” for an individual or
organization responsible for the management or oversight of an on-going activity, system, or
item.
Increment—A militarily useful and supportable operational capability that can be effectively
developed, produced or acquired, deployed, and sustained. Each increment of capability will
have its own set of threshold and objective values set by the user.
Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E)—IOT&E is only conducted by the Air
Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC). AFOTEC determines the operational
effectiveness and suitability of the items under test using production or production-representative
articles with stabilized performance and operationally representative personnel. Additionally,
AFOTEC will resolve the mission capability of the system. Tests are conducted under
operational conditions, including combat mission scenarios that are as operationally realistic as
possible. IOT&E determines if operational requirements and critical operational issues (COI)
have been satisfied and assesses system impacts to peacetime and combat operations. A
dedicated phase of IOT&E is required for new ACAT I and II programs according to Title 10
U.S.C. §2399. Dedicated IOT&E is also required for all OSD OT&E Oversight programs
according to DoDI 5000.2.
Integrated Testing—The collaborative planning and collaborative execution of test phases and
events to provide shared data in support of independent analysis, evaluation and reporting by all
stakeholders, particularly the developmental (both contractor and government) and operational
test and evaluation communities.
Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E)—An OSD-sponsored T&E program conducted among more
than one military Service to provide T&E information on combat operations issues and concepts.
JT&E does not support system acquisition. (DoDI 5010.41)
Life Cycle Management Plans (LCMP)—The PM develops the LCMP which integrates all
aspects of acquisition and sustainment into a single integrated life cycle plan according to AFI
 36                                                         AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


63-101. The LCMP is the overarching document that encompasses and integrates information
from all other program plans and assessments. It typically includes a summary of the program’s
strategy for T&E.
Lead Developmental Test and Evaluation Organization (LDTO)—The lead government
developmental test organization on the ITT that is most qualified to conduct and/or be
responsible for overseeing a confederation of DT&E organizations, each with different but
necessary skills, in support of an acquisition program.
Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E)—The firing of actual weapons (or surrogates if actual
weapons are not available) at components, subsystems, sub-assemblies, and/or full-up, system
level targets or systems to examine personnel casualties, system vulnerabilities, or system
lethality; and the evaluation of the results of such testing.
Logistics Service Test (LGST)—Assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of
specific systems and subsystems accomplished when FDEs are not practical. LGSTs are smaller
in scope than FDEs and address product improvements, reliability, maintainability, and logistics
supportability of proposed systems and subsystems. Form, fit, and function replacement items
proposed by Air Logistics Centers are typical LGST candidates.
Logistics Supportability—The degree to which the planned product support allows the system
to meet its availability and wartime usage requirements. Planned product support includes the
following: test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment; spare and repair parts; technical data;
support facilities; transportation requirements; training; manpower; and software.
Multi-Service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E)—MOT&E can be IOT&E,
QOT&E, or FOT&E when two or more military Services are involved. It can also be a Multi-
Service FDE if a MAJCOM is the lead test organization.
Operational Assessment (OA)—An analysis of progress toward operational capabilities made
by an OTO, with user support as required, on other than production systems. The focus of an
operational assessment is on significant trends noted in development efforts, programmatic
voids, areas of risk, adequacy of requirements, and the ability of the program to support adequate
operational testing. OAs may be made at any time using technology demonstrators, prototypes,
mockups, engineering development models, or simulations, but will not substitute for the
dedicated OT&E necessary to support full production decisions.
Operational Test Agency (OTA)—An independent agency reporting directly to the Service
Chief that plans and conducts operational tests, reports results, and provides evaluations of
overall operational capability of systems as determined by effectiveness, suitability, and other
operational considerations. Note: Each Service has one designated OTA according to DoDD
5000.01: The Air Force has the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC).
The Navy has the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR). The Army has the
Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The Marine Corps has the Marine Corps
Operational Test and Evaluation Agency (MCOTEA).
Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E)—1. The field testing, under realistic combat
conditions, of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the
purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions
for use in combat by typical military users, and the evaluation of the results of such test under 10
U.S.C. § 139(a)(2)). 2. Test and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational environment
AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     37


as possible to estimate the prospective system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and
operational capabilities. In addition, OT&E provides information on organization, personnel
requirements, doctrine, and tactics. It may also provide data to support or verify material in
operating instructions, publications, and handbooks. Note: The generic term OT&E is often
substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, OUE, FDE, and TD&E and depending on the context
can have the same meaning as those terms.
Operational Test Organization (OTO)—A generic term for any organization that conducts
operational testing as stated in its mission directive.
Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE)—Evaluations of military capabilities conducted to
demonstrate or validate new operational concepts or capabilities, upgrade components, or expand
the mission or capabilities of existing or modified systems. AFOTEC or MAJCOMs may
conduct OUEs whenever a dedicated operational test and evaluation event is required, but the
full scope and rigor of a formal IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, or FDE is not appropriate or
required. OUEs may be used to support operational decisions (e.g., fielding a system with less
than full capability) or acquisition-related decisions (e.g., low-rate production) when appropriate
throughout the system lifecycle. OUEs will not be used when IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E or
FDE are more appropriate per existing guidance and definitions.
Oversight Program—A program on the OSD T&E Oversight List for DT&E, LFT&E, and/or
OT&E. The list includes all major defense acquisition programs (MDAP) (e.g., ACAT I), Major
Automated Information Systems (MAIS) (e.g., ACAT IA), and any other programs selected for
3106 OSD T&E Oversight IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2430(a)(1). These programs require additional
documentation and have additional review, reporting, and approval requirements.
Participating Test Organization (PTO)—Any test organization required to support a lead test
organization by providing specific T&E data or resources for a T&E program or activity.
Program Manager (PM)—The designated individual with responsibility for and authority to
accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s
operational needs. This instruction uses the term “PM” for any designated person in charge of
acquisition activities at various organizational levels (MAJCOM, AFLCMC, or other agencies
and Services). Refer to AFI 99-103 definitions for additional applications.
Qualification Operational Test & Evaluation (QOT&E)—A tailored type of IOT&E
conducted only by AFOTEC. It is used to evaluate military-unique portions and applications of
COTS, NDI, and GFE for military use in an operational environment when little or no
government-funded R&D takes place.
Sufficiency of Operational Test Review (SOTR)—An examination by MAJCOM operational
3232 testers of all available test data to: 1) determine if adequate testing has been accomplished
for 3233 programs of limited scope and complexity; and 2) to assess the risk of fielding or
production 3234 without a dedicated OT&E. SOTRs shall not be used by AMC in lieu of
operational testing. Test requesters may examine of existing test data and determine risk factor
Tactics Development & Evaluation (TD&E)—A tailored type of FDE conducted to refine
doctrine, system capabilities, and tactic, techniques and procedures (TTPs) throughout a system’s
life cycle. TD&Es normally identify non-materiel solutions to problems or evaluate better ways
to use new or existing systems. HQ AMC/TE shall test and evaluate tactics once developed. See
AFI 11-260 and AMCI 11-207 for the tactics development process and agency responsibilities.
 38                                                       AMCI99-101 25 NOVEMBER 2013


Test Director (TD)—The TD is the AMCTES project officer for a specific test. They are
responsible for all aspects of the test, from planning to execution to reporting. The TD builds a
test project strategy that collects required data in the most efficient and effective way, with
respect to cost and schedule. TDs work hand-in-hand with the AMC/TE TM to attain required
support for test projects. They participate in ITTs. During test execution the TD is the focal
point concerning all day-to-day test decisions. The TD provides a comprehensive report of
findings, results, and conclusions for AMC decision-makers. Both the TD and TM must work
together as a team to ensure an effective, efficient, and responsive test project.
Test and Evaluation (T&E)—The act of generating empirical data during the research,
development, or sustainment of systems, and the creation of information through analysis that is
useful to technical personnel and decision makers for reducing design, acquisition and
operational risks. The process by which systems are measured against requirements and
specifications and the results analyzed to gauge progress and provide feedback.
Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)—Documents the overall structure and objectives of
the T&E program. It provides a framework within which to generate detailed T&E plans and it
documents schedule and resource implications associated with the T&E program. The TEMP
identifies the necessary developmental, operational, and live-fire test activities. It relates
program schedule, test management strategy and structure, and required resources to: COIs;
critical technical parameters; objectives and thresholds documented in the requirements
document and milestone decision points.
Test Manager (TM)—The AMC/TE TM is responsible for the overall management of assigned
test projects. They are the HQ on-site member of the test team and the TD’s primary interface
within HQ AMC. The TM works closely with the TD to obtain support and resources needed to
conduct a test project. TMs can secure support from external agencies, submit requests for
SAAMs, and coordinate test documentation through the AMC staff. They also review test
requests, develop test orders, chair or attend ITTs, staff test plans and reports, and may
observe/assist during test execution. Both the TD and TM must work together as a team to
ensure an effective, efficient, and responsive test project.
Test Resource Plan (TRP)—The single document AFOTEC uses to request personnel and other
resource support for OT&E from MAJCOMs and other agencies.
User—Refers to the primary command operating a system, subsystem, item of equipment,
procedure, or tactic, and generally applies to the terms “using command, ” “operator,”
“maintainer,” “warfighter,” or “customer.” The term “user” is preferred in this instruction for
test requesters.

                                         Attachment 2
   INFORMATION AND BUSINESS SYSTEMS GUIDELINES FOR LEVEL 1 OT&E

A2.1. The following guidance will be followed when evaluating information and business
system Level 1 OT&E capabilities determined to be low-risk. Software maintenance upgrades,
routine information technology hardware upgrades and software patches containing only minor
capabilities or enhancements are likely candidates for this process.
A2.2. Purpose And Applicability.
   A2.2.1. The 14 Sep 2010 DOT&E memo Guidelines for OT&E of Information and Business
   Systems “provide(s) a means to tailor OT&E (of Information and Business Systems) using a
   risk assessment of information and business systems deliverables.” The new guidelines may
   be substituted in place of the traditional OT&E approach described in DoDI 5000.02 of
   December 8, 2008, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System. These guidelines do not
   apply to weapons systems or strategic and tactical command and control systems.
   A2.2.2. The DOT&E memo defines three levels of OT&E for information and business
   systems. This document provides general guidance to follow when conducting Level 1
   OT&E, where assessment data is primarily collected from integrated test events other than a
   dedicated independent operational test event.
   A2.2.3. Any given software deliverable might contain several new or enhanced capabilities.
   Level 1 OT&E is appropriate for evaluating those capabilities determined to be low risk.
A2.3. Characteristics Of Level 1 OT&E.
   A2.3.1. Entry determined by assessment of low risk.
   A2.3.2. Does not require a dedicated independent OT event although one may be conducted.
   A2.3.3. The OT report answers Critical Operational Issues (COI) using data collected from
   integrated test events such as 1) Developmental Testing, 2) certification events and/or 3)
   independent observations of the capability being used in operationally realistic or
   representative conditions.
   A2.3.4. The OTO influences and monitors selected DT activities by recommending test
   cases that examine specific operational issues and collects data for the evaluation
A2.4. Risk Analysis. The heart of the new approach is a risk analysis of the software to be
tested which identifies:
   A2.4.1. The degree of risk inherent in the system.
   A2.4.2. The potential impact on mission accomplishment for each capability within the
   system.
   A2.4.3. The likelihood that a risk will occur vice the consequence if the risk does occur.
A2.5. Characteristics Of The Risk Assessment.
   A2.5.1. Developed using the Operational Test Organization’s (OTO) preferred procedures.
   A2.5.2. Includes program management office, user representatives, and threat community
   input.

   A2.5.3. Will be tailored as appropriate for the particular information system being assessed.
A2.6. Resource Options For Conducting Level 1 OT&E:
   A2.6.1. A dedicated independent OT event with Test Directors, operationally representative
   users of the system (warfighters, C4I users/planners, contractors) is the primary method.
   Note: contractors may be used only if included in the CONOPS for the system.
   A2.6.2. Coordination with DT organizations to include test cases for examining specific
   operational issues and then monitoring the execution of these test cases is appropriate.
   A2.6.3. When an operational user adds value to the OT data collection, a dedicated
   independent OT event is appropriate for the capabilities impacted by any software patches.
A2.7. Reporting Format For Level 1 OT&E:
   A2.7.1. Level 1 OT&E Test Plans and Final Reports may be issued in condensed
   memorandum format.
   A2.7.2. The Final Report memorandum should:
       A2.7.2.1. Identify the software or specific capabilities being tested
       A2.7.2.2. Discuss risk, likelihood of risk and mission impact
       A2.7.2.3. Identify resources involved in the test
       A2.7.2.4. Identify the test location and dates
       A2.7.2.5. Describe the test article
       A2.7.2.6. Answer COIs using one of the three methods discussed above
       A2.7.2.7. Provide a fielding recommendation
A2.8. For software patches developed and released as a result of previous OT, the memorandum
should include an attachment that lists: the change identifier, problem report title, description of
problem, how the fix was verified, and results of testing.

A3.1. The Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is an
independent test organization that plans, executes, and reports on Air Reserve Component
(ARC)-related, MAJCOM and DoD (as assigned) T&E. When executing AMC project orders,
AATC will:
   A3.1.1. Interpret and ensure compliance with DoD, HQ USAF, and MAJCOM T&E policy.
   A3.1.2. Coordinate with NGB/A5 and AFRC/A8 to determine priority, scheduling, and
   execution of AATC assigned T&E.
   A3.1.3. Assign a project manager for all tests. The project manager will lead planning,
   execution, and reporting of all test activities.
   A3.1.4. Coordinate T&E project order requests with AMC/TE for AMC-related projects.
   Send test requests along with all necessary background information to AMC/TE to support
   issuance of a project order.
   A3.1.5. Work with appropriate system Program Offices to co-chair ITTs. ITTs will establish
   resource requirements as well as organizational responsibilities with milestones, timelines,
   and OPRs.
   A3.1.6. Assist in developing capabilities-based requirements.
A3.2. Once tasked as the lead operational test organization, AATC/CC is the approval authority
for all test planning, safety reviews, test execution, data collection and analysis and test
reporting. Distribution of plans and reports is IAW established T&E guidelines. Exception:
HQ AMC/TE is final approval authority for test plans and test reports conducted under an AMC
test order.
