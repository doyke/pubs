2.4. Flight Manager Standardization/Evaluation Visits (FMSEVs).
   2.4.1. FMSEV Purpose. FMSEVs are the principal tool for evaluating FM operations and
   verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment. This is achieved through FM
   evaluations to ensure compliance with approved operational procedures and applicable
   special interest items. Additionally, the effectiveness of FM Stan/Eval and training programs
8                                                              AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


    are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization. This provides meaningful feedback
    to unit commanders.
    2.4.2. HQ AMC ASEV teams may request augmentation from units or MAJCOMs.
    2.4.3. FMSEV Evaluations. Normally, 5%-25% of FMs will be administered FMSEV
    Evaluations. This number is dependent upon the total number of evaluations conducted on
    unit personnel between ASEVs. The HQ AMC/A3V goal is 20% of the FMs between
    FMSEVs. All FMSEV evaluations will be completed by the AMC/A3V Command
    Evaluator(s).
       2.4.3.1. Primary FMSEV Evaluations. Command Evaluator(s) will administer
       evaluations to the Chief of FM Stan/Eval personnel and/or senior FM Evaluator(s).
       2.4.3.2. Do not extend the senior Stan/Eval FMs evaluation expiration date to allow
       evaluation during the FMSEV.
       2.4.3.3. If any senior Stan/Eval FMs are scheduled to change within 3 months following
       an FMSEV, administer evaluations to designated replacements.
       2.4.3.4. Pyramid evaluations received within 6 months before the start of an FMSEV will
       count towards the FMSEV FM requirement.
    2.4.4. FMSEV Requirements.
       2.4.4.1. FMSEV Scheduling/Notification. MAF FMSEV teams will normally visit
       units approximately every 24 months. Official FMSEV notification will be sent not less
       than 90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification message will include ASEV
       team composition, transportation requirements, special interest items, and other details of
       the visit. Initial planning dates for FMSEVs are coordinated with MAJCOM A3V
       counterparts, and are published semi-annually in the AMC/IG Command-Wide Inspection
       Schedule and posted on the AMC/A3V website. Scheduling conflicts should be reported
       to HQ AMC/A3V for resolution; all changes will be coordinated with the respective
       MAJCOM, with final approval by MAJCOM/A3.
       2.4.4.2. IG Mission Capability Compliance Inspection (MCCI)/FMSEV Scheduling
       and Notification. MAJCOM IGs manage the scheduling, notification, and coordination
       of MCCIs, normally scheduled at 24-month intervals.              AMCs Command FM
       (AMC/A3V) is the Functional area manager for the FMSEV-piece of MCCIs.
       MCCI/FMSEV notification will include inspection team composition, transportation
       requirements, special interest items, and other details of the inspection. Questions on
       overall MCCI process and scheduling should be directed to the MAJCOM IGs; FMSEV-
       specific questions should be directed to the AMC Command FM (AMC/A3V).
       2.4.4.3. All FMs may be asked to accomplish specific tasks to assess proficiency.
       FMSEV evaluations may be administered up to and including 90 days prior to the
       beginning of the FMSEV.
       2.4.4.4. FMSEV teams will complete all AF Form 8FM for evaluations before departure.
       If the individual being evaluated is within 4 months of their required periodic evaluation,
       the FMSEV will be credited towards that requirement, and they must complete remaining
       ground items within 2 months. If the periodic evaluation is required beyond 4 months,
       the FMSEV may be credited toward periodic evaluation requirements at the unit
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                     9


       commander’s discretion, and with FMSEV evaluator’s approval. This request must be
       made prior to the start of the evaluation. Complete remaining ground items within 2
       months. For evaluations graded Q-3 refer to paragraph 5.5.3.3
       2.4.4.5. FMSEV Grading. An overall FMSEV grade will be awarded. At the
       conclusion of the visit, the FMSEV team chief will provide feedback (oral or written) to
       the unit commander and staff. In addition, HQ AMC/A3 or designated representative
       will release an FMSEV written report following review/endorsement. FMSEV teams
       will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines and include as
       “required improvements”. Units will report corrective action, to AMC/A3V within 90
       days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the form of an official
       memorandum signed by the unit’s AOC commander to HQ AMC/A3V. It will provide
       specifics that corrective action was taken to resolve each of the “required improvements”
       to bring each of the designated areas into compliance.
       2.4.4.6. FMSEV Programs. All unit Stan/Eval and Training programs are subject to
       inspection. The AMC/A3V FMSEV Stan/Eval Program Review Checklist and Training

                FLIGHT MANAGER QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The FM Stan/Eval program utilizes FM evaluations for standardization of
operations and to qualify or requalify FMs. FM qualification evaluations are administered
periodically. Evaluators will use AF Form 3862FM, Flight Manager Evaluation Worksheet,
when administering an evaluation. All pertinent information will be transferred and documented
on AF Form 8FM, Certificate of Flight Manager Qualification, to document FM qualification.
5.2. FM Evaluations. FM evaluations are divided into three categories; Qualification (QUAL),
Instructor (INSTR), and (SPOT) consisting of two structured phases, academic and sortie
planning. NOTE: There are no academic requirements for SPOT evaluations. Each phase
requires the completion of requisite tasks. The academic phase includes one or more written
examinations. The sortie planning phase includes an evaluation of FM proficiency. This
evaluation will be based on a random sampling of available sorties during the shift.
   5.2.1. FM QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic FM qualification.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All FMs will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation. QUAL
       evaluations may be combined with INSTR evaluation. This evaluation should reflect the
       type and difficulty of tasks required in fulfillment of the unit’s mission.
   5.2.2. FM Qualification Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. To ensure FMs are qualified to accomplish the unit’s operational
       mission.
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All FMs will complete an initial QUAL evaluation prior to
       completing certification. This evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks
       required in fulfillment of the unit’s operational or DOC statement Missions.
   5.2.3. FM INSTR Evaluations.
       5.2.3.1. Purpose. To qualify FMs as instructors; this evaluation focuses primarily on the
       examinees instructional ability.
       5.2.3.2. Execution. FMs obtaining/regaining instructor qualification must complete
       evaluation of instructional capability during the evaluation.
          5.2.3.2.1. Accomplish Initial INSTR evaluations with an FM serving as the student.
          5.2.3.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualifications will be conducted during all
          subsequent periodic evaluations. During this evaluation the FME may serve as the
          student if one is not available.
          5.2.3.2.3. Instructors with an expired QUAL evaluation are not qualified to instruct
          until successful completion of a RE/QUAL and INSTR evaluation.
   5.2.4. FM SPOT Evaluations.
       5.2.4.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
       the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
 14                                                            AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


      5.2.4.2. Execution. A SPOT has no requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
      supplements/Organization Operating Instructions. AF Form 8FM is not required unless
      an examinee receives a less than Q-1 grade. When required, the AF Form 8FM will be
      completed IAW Chapter 7.
   5.2.5. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
   the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1. through 5.2.4
      5.2.5.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
      qualification (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT INSTR).
      5.2.5.2. Requalification (RE/QUAL). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
      qualification due to:
          5.2.5.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
          guidance for that periodic evaluation.
          5.2.5.2.2. Loss of currency that requires an evaluation. In this case, a Spot will be
          used for documentation. The recheck will include as a minimum those items for
          which the individual is non-current for more than 180 days.
          5.2.5.2.3. An evaluation recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck
          will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1
          5.2.5.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
          paragraph 5.10). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
          Form 8FM (see paragraph 7.4)
          5.2.5.2.5. The RE/QUAL prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
              5.2.5.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
              complete one or more of the academic phase requisites (see paragraph 5.4.1), but
              the sortie planning phase has successfully been completed within the eligibility
              period and the Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) determines
              that qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites
              without re-accomplishment of the sortie planning phase.
              5.2.5.2.5.2. For a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No qualification
              was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
5.3. Timing of FM Qualification Evaluations.
   5.3.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the sortie planning phase was successfully completed
   (e.g. a periodic evaluation in which the sortie planning phase was completed on 9 Oct 10
   expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.3.2. In-Eligibility-Period. All FMs will successfully complete periodic training, written
   exams, and the periodic qualification evaluation during the six month period that ends on the
   last day of the individual’s current qualification. The individual’s qualification month and
   expiration date will be established following the initial certification date. For example, an
   FM whose initial qualification month is January 2011 will be eligible for the Periodic
   qualification examination and evaluation between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2012.
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                        15


   5.3.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
       5.3.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. Chief, Flight
       Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) may authorize individuals to complete periodic
       evaluations prior to the eligibility period (document IAW paragraph 7.7.3.2.2).
   5.3.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an FM fails to
   complete an evaluation (either academic phase or sortie execution phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.4.3.1) or within
   the period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.4.3.2), the FM loses
   the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.8 will apply.
       5.3.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.3.4.2. Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM Equivalent) may waive the re-
       accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-by-case basis (document IAW
       paragraph 7.7.3.2.2).
5.4. Requisites. These include academic phase items. The academic phase includes a series of
examinations as well as completion of periodic training. The sortie planning phase includes a
shift evaluation of FM performance.
   5.4.1. Academic Phase Requisites. Academic phase requisites will include open book
   examinations and periodic training.
   5.4.2. Sortie Execution Phase Requisites. The sortie planning phase for FM evaluations is
   comprised of a random sampling of the sorties available.
       5.4.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the sortie planning phase requisite must incorporate all
       appropriate requirements set forth in this AFI, and allow accurate measure of the
       proficiency of the examinee.
       5.4.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, random, and consistent with daily sorties
       available, and incorporate current policy and procedures applicable to flight management.
   5.4.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.4.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or periodic evaluations in the
       eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.10). The Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM
       equivalent) may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis (document on the AF
       Form 8FM IAW paragraph 7.7.3.2.2).
       5.4.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period.
5.5. Grading System.
   5.5.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document FM performance.
       5.5.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
       include grading of areas/subareas of FM performance against established evaluation
       criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be documented.
16                                                          AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


     5.5.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
     compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.4).
  5.5.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
     5.5.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
     Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
        5.5.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed FM duties within the prescribed tolerances.
        5.5.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, or jeopardize
        flight safety.
        5.5.2.1.3. U indicates performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affecting mission accomplishment. An examinee receiving an area/subarea
        grade of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the FME.
     5.5.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.5.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the FME provides instruction concerning the discrepancy and
        determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency.
        5.5.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the FME to remedy
        deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
            5.5.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, or additional supervised
            shifts.
            5.5.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.5.2.2.2.3. If an FM exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional
            training, the Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) will review the
            situation and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances which
            exceed the allotted time with a Memorandum for Record (MFR). Include the
            MFR in the AF Form 8FM (see paragraph 7.6.3.2.2.1).
            5.5.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8FM IAW paragraphs
            7.3.5.6.1 and 7.3.7.3.4.1.
     5.5.2.3. The FME must grade the areas/subareas listed as required in Chapter 9.
     5.5.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the FME will grade any area/subarea
     observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific
     evaluation accomplished.
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                      17


       5.5.2.5. The FME may further identify any area/sub-area as Commendable if, in the
       FME’s determination, the FM has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge.
       Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
   5.5.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned to an individual as well as
   overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded as a compilation of all area/sub-area
   grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation of all requisite tasks associated with
   the required evaluation. Both individual and overall grades are based on the following.
       5.5.3.1. Q1. The FM demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of procedures,
       equipment, and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be
       awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when discrepancies are
       noted if:
          5.5.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
          5.5.3.1.2. In the judgment of the FME, none of the discrepancies preclude awarding
          of an overall Q1.
          5.5.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
          the evaluation debrief.
       5.5.3.2. Q2. The FM demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
          5.5.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
          assigned.
          5.5.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
          5.5.3.2.3. In the judgment of the FME, a Q2 may be given if there is justification
          based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
       5.5.3.3. Q3. The FM demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety, performance or
       knowledge.
          5.5.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3. (Applicable to both
          academic and sortie planning phases).
          5.5.3.3.2. In the judgment of the FME, a Q3 may be given if there is justification
          based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.5.3.4. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade, not to separate requisites. EQs will be documented
       on AF Form 8FM IAW paragraph 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.5.3.4.1. The FM has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of
          the evaluation;
          5.5.3.4.2. The FM has not failed any requisite and;
          5.5.3.4.3. The FM received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated. NOTE: AFI 11-
          255V2 may dictate the highest grade for an evaluation based on area and subarea
          performance, FME judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding the
          overall grade.
5.6. Evaluation Criteria.
 18                                                            AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


   5.6.1. AMC, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish and
   maintain standardized, QUAL, INSTR, and SPOT evaluation criteria in this AFI. AMC will
   coordinate with the Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) of any command-
   mandated software on any updates of evaluation criteria to aid in the expeditious revision of
   evaluation criteria files. AMC is also responsible for coordinating the establishment of the
   following:
      5.6.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
      required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
      and specific evaluation areas.
          5.6.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of the FM. Critical areas will include, but are not limited to,
          Judgment, Safety, and Read File.
      5.6.1.2. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
      and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
      outside of the NAS.
5.7. Conduct of FM Evaluations.
   5.7.1. FME’s will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the
   evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. FME’s will then evaluate the examinee in
   each graded area/ sub-area.
      5.7.1.1. FME’s will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained,
      recommended for upgrade evaluation, or if they are the first level supervisor of the
      examinee.
   5.7.2. FME’s may conduct the evaluation over the shoulder or while logged into a nearby
   workstation.
   5.7.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance criteria
   during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances provided in
   the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area/sub-area.
      5.7.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training session to avoid documenting
      substandard performance, nor will a training session be changed to an evaluation once the
      session is begun.
      5.7.3.2. The determining factors assigning am overall grade will be a combination of the
      examinee’s performance adherence to standards in this instruction and flight safety, and
      the FME’s judgment. The FME will thoroughly critique all aspects of the sorties flight-
      managed during the evaluation. During the critique, the FME will review the examinee’s
      overall rating, specific deviations, area/sub-area grades assigned, and any additional
      training required.
      5.7.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the FME will determine and
      document additional training requirements. Normally, additional training should not be
      accomplished during the same shift.
      5.7.3.4. Additional training on the same shift is allowed when the situation presents
      valuable training opportunities (i.e., unique locations, air refueling, etc.). This option
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                        19


       requires utmost evaluator discretion and judicious application. When used, the examinee
       must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
   5.7.4. Rechecks will be administered by an FME other than the one who administered the
   original evaluation.
5.8. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
   5.8.1. Recheck. If an FM fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be completed by the
   end of the third month after the date of the first failure, (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12,
   complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.8.1.1. The Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) may approve waivers
       to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case basis.
          5.8.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8FM
          IAW paragraph 7.7.2.4.2.2.
       5.8.1.2. The Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) will determine the
       number of shifts to be allowed during this period, based on the individual’s experience
       level, present qualifications and hours of training required.
       5.8.1.3. A recheck is successfully completed when the FM performs to Q or Q-/debriefed
       criteria for each area graded U.
       5.8.1.4. Requisites that are valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.2 or 5.5.3.3
       remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.8.2. Status Downgrade. An FM receiving a Q3, QUAL and/or MSN evaluation are not
   qualified to work unless under the supervision of an instructor. For instructor evaluations,
   instructors need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor
   areas/subareas.
       5.8.2.1. QUAL Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status (see paragraph
       5.9) if the examinee failed the qualification evaluation. Instructors need not be
       downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor area/subareas.
       5.8.2.2. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
       evaluated). Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor area(s) will not
       perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
   5.8.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
   judgment of the FME, the examinee will remain in supervised status until successful
   completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
       5.8.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific areas and/or subareas that require
       supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
5.9. Supervised Status.
   5.9.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervision (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) and an MFR placed
   in the examinee’s training record.
 20                                                           AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


   5.9.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.10. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (level above Chief, Flight
Management (or MAJCOM equivalent) may direct a downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-
area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a commander may direct a downgrade
that either removes a qualification (e.g. Instructor FM (IFM) to FM) or completely unqualifies an
individual (e.g. IFM to FM). Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation
using the following guidance:
   5.10.1. Use in cases where such incidences directly affect the commander’s confidence in
   the FMs ability to correctly develop aircrew departure papers (ADPs).
   5.10.2. Place the FM in Supervised Status for downgrades that either remove qualifications
   or completely unqualifies an individual. The affected FM will cease acting in the
   qualification(s) from which he/she have been downgraded effective with the date the
   commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.10.3. Commander directed downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                    21

AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                         23


                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the FM qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an FM is to be evaluated are determined by the
Chief, Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent). This chapter provides documentation
guidance for members that require FM evaluation to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of FM evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8FM. The chronological
   history of evaluations for an FM recorded on an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These
   AF forms are maintained in the FMEF. Use an AF Form 3862 worksheet to ensure all
   required areas have been completed for evaluations. Maintain the worksheet until the
   completed AF Form 8FM is placed in the FMEF. There is no requirement to retain the
   worksheet once the Form 8FM is completed.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FMEFs. In all instances, computer-generated
   forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8FM, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, FM upgrades, etc.).
7.3. AF Form 8FM, Certificate of Flight Manager Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8FM is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an FM.
       7.3.1.1. Completion of an AF Form 8FM is accomplished by four individuals: the FME,
       a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the Examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8FM, Attachment 4
   for sample AF Forms 3862FM
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
       INSTR), use upper case letters.
       7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
       data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
       desired.
   7.3.3. Date Completed.

        7.3.5.2.1. Flight Manager Evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.1.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): QUAL, INSTR, or SPOT. If combined, include the
            designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL, INSTR/QUAL, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.1.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, PE, and/or RE/QUAL. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.5.

           FLIGHT MANAGER CERTIFICATION AND DECERTIFICATION

8.1. FM Certification. Certification provides a consistent standard against which FMs are
judged. Certification officially recognizes the FM as being qualified to support all applicable
mission areas. Certification is contingent upon assessment of an individual’s progress by the
FMs supervisor and the certifying official. All FMs must be certified prior to performing
unsupervised duties. FM certification is the responsibility of the AMC 618 AOC (TACC),
USAFE 603 AOC/AMD, and PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, or his/her designated representative.
The certification process serves to officially recognize that the individual has attained the
necessary skill level to represent the MAJCOM as an FM. Certification is maintained by
completion of all periodic training and evaluation requirements. Failure to maintain established
certification standards will result in an unqualified status resulting in an immediate entry into
supervised status additional training. Certification will be accomplished following satisfactory
completion of the MSN QUAL.
8.2. FM Decertification. The Chief, Flight Management Division/Branch (or MAJCOM
equivalent), is charged with ensuring FMs remain proficient in FM tasks, taking immediate
action to correct deficiencies, and recommending the decertification or removal of FMs found
not suitable for flight management duty. Reassignment, retraining, or other administrative action
will be coordinated with the AMC 618 AOC (TACC), USAFE 603 AOC/AMD, and PACAF 613
AOC/AMD. The certifying authority will be the decertifying authority.
   8.2.1. Reasons for Decertification. FMs can be decertified for various reasons, to include
   extended periods of absence (in excess of 90 days), that negatively impact performance of
   FM duties, repeated failures of written or task evaluations after corrective measures are
   taken, or withdrawal of the individual’s security clearance. Decertification will be
   accomplished by the certifying authority, but should be based upon the recommendation of
   one of the following: FM’s immediate supervisor, MAJCOM/Unit FME, and/or Chief, Flight
   Management (or MAJCOM equivalent).
   8.2.2. FM Evaluation Board. Once a decertification recommendation is made, the
   certifying authority will convene an FM Evaluation Board consisting of the evaluator making
   the decertification recommendation; the individual’s immediate supervisor; the Chief of
   Flight Management (or MAJCOM equivalent); and a union representative (if applicable).
   The Board will be chaired by the AMC 618 AOC (TACC), USAFE 603 AOC/AMD, and
   PACAF 613 AOC/AMD or his/her designated representative. The Board will review
   pertinent performance documentation and circumstances to determine a course of action to
   attain recertification or removal of the individual from the FM program.
8.3. FM Certification Documentation.
   8.3.1. Certification. A separate FM Certification Record is prepared for each FM. The FM
   Certification record will be maintained in the individuals training record (AFI 11-255Volume
   1).
   8.3.2. Decertification. Memos concerning decertification will be documented in the
   individual’s training record (AFI 11-255Volume 1). Remarks will be included on the form to
   state the reason for the decertification.
38                                                         AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013


  8.3.3. Recertification. Document recertification in individuals training record IAW AFI11-
  255Volume 1
  8.3.4. FM Certification/Training Records. A record of each FMs certification and
  periodic training will be maintained by AMC 618 AOC (TACC), USAFE 603 AOC/AMD,
  and PACAF 613 AOC/AMD.
AFI11-255V2 22 MARCH 2013                                                                   39
