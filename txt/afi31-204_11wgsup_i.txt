This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement. It assigns
responsibilities and establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations
in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) areas. This includes, but is not lim-
ited to, granting, suspending, or revoking the privilege to operate a privately owned vehicle (POV); regis-
tration of POVs; administration of vehicle registration and driver performance records; driver
improvement programs; police traffic supervision; and off-installation traffic activities.

(11WG) This publications supplements AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. It
applies to all activities and individuals, military and civilian, on Bolling AFB (BAFB). It provides
detailed information and instructions concerning traffic management. It is the responsibility of unit com-
manders and supervisors to ensure that all personnel are aware of base regulation requirements, as supple-
mented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change eliminates the requirement for privately owed vehicles to be registered with the Air
Force or other DoD agency to be operated on an Air Force installation. The IC re-titles Chapter 3 from
2                                                                         AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


“Motor Vehicle Registration” to “Privately Owned Vehicle Operation Requirements.” A bar ( | ) indicates
a revision from the previous edition.
Chapter 3, REPLACED. This chapter has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
(11WG) This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify definitions for “abandoned vehi-
cles,” “unreasonable periods,” and other terms relevant to enforcement action as stated in AFI 31-204,
Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. Procedures for impounding abandoned vehicles are refer-
enced in SFOI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.

                                      DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
   granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
   and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
   everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
   security police, the following:
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
      Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
      Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
      media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
      mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
      tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
      civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
      non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
      should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
      2.1.1.2. (11WG) Military, DoD civilians and Foreign Officers/Civilians on TDY orders are
      authorized to use international driver’s licenses on Bolling AFB for the duration of their TDY not
      to exceed one year. Military members, military dependents, and DoD civilians who are in posses-
      sion of a license issued in a foreign country by the Armed Forces of the United States (interna-
      tional driver’s license) may operate a motor vehicle on Bolling AFB using that license for a period
      of not more than 30 days from the date that person returned to the United States. Military mem-
      bers and their family members permanently assigned to Bolling AFB must comply with DC Code,
      and the policy of the DC Department of Public Safety stated in the DC Drivers Manual, as appro-
      priate.
      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
      vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
      other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
      instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
      condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
      inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
      able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
      operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
      comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
      requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
      or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
      commander.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
    2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
    mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
       and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
       impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
       areas.
       2.2.1.2. (11WG) Policies and procedures for Random Installation Entry Point Checks (IEPC) and
       Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) can be found in 11WGS1 to AFI 31-101, The Air Force
       Installation Security Program, paragraph 8.7, 11WGI 31-1, Bolling Air Force Base Entry Control
       Procedures and 11WG Consolidated Response Plan, Tab K to Appendix 1 to Annex C.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
       POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
       regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
    2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
    manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
    This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
    commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
    their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.
2.3. (11WG) Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. The chemical test for all personnel will
be by breath, subject to the availability of an intoxilyzer and operator. Blood tests will be offered in the
absence of the Intoxilyzer, Breath Analysis Instrument.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
2.4. (11WG) Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. 11 SFS Security Forces will make every effort
to identify vehicles which are on BAFB in violation of directives contained in this supplement and/or
which constitute a public nuisance. Security Forces will ticket an illegally parked vehicle with DD Form
1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. After 72 hours, an abandoned vehicle notice will be placed on the
vehicle. Vehicles may be towed in a shorter period when necessary for Force Protection reasons.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                    9

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
2.5. (11WG) Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. The 11 MSG/CC may suspend or revoke
base driving privileges and POV registration.
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
        lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
        revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
        or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
        determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
        a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
        ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
        these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
        known to the general public.
        2.5.1.1. (11WG) Unit commanders may, for cause, request suspension/revocation of base driving
        privileges of a military/civilian member assigned to their unit after a pattern of irresponsible driv-
        ing (personal behavior such as drug or alcohol abuse) has been noticed. Such requests will be pre-
        sented to the 11 MSG/CC, through the CSF. The requests will include full justification for the
        action and all supporting documentation.
        2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
        authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
        privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
        tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
        personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
        Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
        occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
        review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
        resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
            2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
            alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.

         2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
         by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
         or BrAC level below 0.10.
         2.5.1.3.3. (11WG) Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Driving Under the Influence (DUI)
         levels will be determined by District of Columbia law and are subject to change. As of the
         date of this publication, the levels are as follows; DWI: Requires a BAC or BrAC of .08 or
         higher and must have other substantial evidence (i.e., Failure of Field Sobriety Test). DUI:
         Requires a BAC or BrAC of .05 to .07 percent.
         2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated

         when a military or civilian member assigned to AFDW/11th Wing has been involved in an
         intoxicated driving incident, serious traffic violation, or accident. Preliminary suspension
         actions are not initiated by 11 SFS until after receipt of the civilian police reports. The on-duty
         Security Forces flight will accomplish and forward a AF IMT 3545, Incident Report, to 11
         SFS/S5I. The 11 SFS/S5I will review, process and forward the Incident Report to the mem-
         ber’s respective commander to determine appropriate action. If final disposition of the case is
         received prior to the arrival of the civilian police report, final suspension or revocation actions
         may be initiated based on the final disposition given. Refer to AFMAN 31-201, Security
         Forces Administration and Reports, Vol 7, paragraph 2.11.4 for guidance on policies and pro-
         cedures for sharing/exchanging information with local authorities.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
     not less than one year in the following circumstances:
     2.5.2.1. (11WG) The following offenses may result in suspension of base driving privileges:
     Abuse of vehicle or specialized decals (30 days), failure to show proof of current vehicle insur-
     ance while operating a motor vehicle (30 days), parking in a handicap slot (30 days), failure to reg-
     ister a POV in accordance with this instruction (30 days) and illegal parking resulting in towing of
     the vehicle-second offense within one year (60 days).
         2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or

         tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
         2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
         resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
         documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
         2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
         mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
         safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
12                                                      AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


        2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
        records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
        records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
        2.5.2.2. (11WG) The SFS/S5I will forward revocation, suspension and driving records to gaining
        commanders via the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS). If an individual
        with a revocation, suspension or driving record is scheduled to PCS to a non-Air Force installation
        or to any location where SFMIS is not used, a memorandum will be sent to the gaining installa-
        tion’s military police unit with a copy of their driving record. When a revocation/suspension
        package is received from a losing commander of inbound personnel, 11 SFS/S5I initiates a letter
        continuing the revocation/suspension, and coordinating the letter with the applicable gaining com-
        mander.
        2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
        from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
        were restored pending resolution of charges.
        2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
        currently.
        2.5.2.4. (11WG) If an intoxicated driving conviction also involves a test refusal, the one year
        revocation required by the conviction is served consecutively with the one year revocation
        required by the test refusal; the combination totaling 24 months.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
     2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
     manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
     ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
     commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
     revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.
     2.6.1. (11WG) The 11 MSG/CC will honor revocations issued by other base commanders regardless
     of service component affiliation.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
     writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
     base legal office.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
     hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
     ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
     tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
     revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                     13


  statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
  testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
     2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
     sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
     2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
     intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
     affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
     either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
     the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
     2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
     intoxicated driving:
         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
         AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-

         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
         the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
         by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
         effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
         made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
         leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
  enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
  trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
  cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
  alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
  refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
  or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
  allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
  apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
  methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
     2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
     mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.

            2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
            of the revocation.
            2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
            send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
            showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
            2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
            Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
            driving privileges.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.

        intoxicated driving must attend an alcohol/drug evaluation/treatment program designated by the
        conviction authority.
            2.8.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) For military personnel subject to this instruction, use Life Skills
            Flight’s ADAPT program.
            2.8.1.1.2. (Added-11WG) For all others (convicted in U.S. Magistrate Court) the state/DC
            education program suffices.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
2.9. (11WG) Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding of not
guilty is received, the suspension of driving privileges will be restored except when an intoxicated driving
charge was reduced to a lesser offense.
     2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
     the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                     15


   2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
   commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
   military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
   ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
   2.10.1. (11WG) Persons that have their on-base driving privileges revoked or suspended may request
   limited driving privileges, probation, or full reinstatement. The member will submit a written request
   endorsed by their commander (Per AFMAN 31-201, Security Forces Administration and Reports, V7
   para 2.1.6). The driver must show a valid driver’s license before limited privileges/reinstatement is
   considered. The letter must be endorsed by their commander and submitted to the Chief, Security
   Forces (CSF) through 11 SFS/S5I. The letter should state the reason for the limited privileges and the
   location on base where the individual requests to go. The 11 SFS/S5I will review the case and for-
   ward to the CSF for recommendation. The request will then be forwarded to the 11 MSG/CC for final
   determination. The request letter and the 11 MSG/CC's ruling will be forwarded to the member by the
   11 SFS/S5I. The decision of the MSG/CC is final and cannot be appealed.
   2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
   any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
   nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
   nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
   ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
   in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
   which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
   granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
   the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
   inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
   allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
   ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
   military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
   ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
   also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.1. (11WG) An individual discovered driving on BAFB while on a two-year revocation will
   receive an indefinite revocation of base driving privileges. Military personnel may also receive addi-
   tional administrative or disciplinary action in accordance with the UCMJ. DoD civilian personnel
   may also receive administrative or disciplinary action in accordance with applicable guidance. Con-
   tractor or non-base affiliated personnel may receive an administrative barment under Title 18, USC
   Section 1382.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
   pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
   necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.

     2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
     revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
     ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
     receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
     within its own jurisdiction.
     2.12.1. (11WG) When military personnel are cited on the base for intoxicated driving, 11 SFS
     Reports and Analysis personnel notifies the licensing authority of DC or the state where a license is
     issued following final adjudication of the citation.
        2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
        reciprocity:
            2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
            individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
            administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
            tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
            2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
            when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
            following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
            BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
            level.
     2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
     concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
     When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
     procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
     such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.

                PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE OPERATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. The installation commander is responsible for ensuring all vehicles entering their installa-
tion are controlled. Installation commanders may extend or deny the privilege of operating a motor vehi-
cle on the installation to anyone they deem appropriate.
   3.1.1. (Added-11WG) Individuals who reside on Bolling AFB, but work at another DoD site within
   the NCR are authorized to register their vehicle (s) with the 11 SFS/S3OV (Visitor Control Center).
   The 11 SFS/S3OV (Visitor Control Center) is the office of primary responsibility to register vehicles
   entering the base.
       3.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) All active duty military, their authorized dependents, and DoD civilian
       employees assigned to BAFB or its tenant agencies, all reserve force personnel assigned to
       AFDW/11 WG or who maintain a close affiliation with the base and all employees of non-DoD
       and non-military tenant activities authorized base identification credentials will register their
       POVs within 3 duty days of arriving on the base. Bicycles with fractional horsepower (less than
       one horsepower motors) do not have to be registered. Failure to register a vehicle or properly
       place issued decals within three duty days of Permanent Change of Station to Bolling AFB, will be
       cause to issue the vehicle operator a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, for failure to
       properly register. Failure to properly register the vehicle within three duty days may be grounds
       for a 30 day driving suspension. The MSG/CC may extend registration to those individuals
       deemed appropriate, such as local dignitaries, community leaders, etc. Stepparents, guardians or
       minor children authorized to use base facilities are not granted vehicle registration privileges.
       These personnel will be granted access to the base as long as the minor child is present in the vehi-
       cle and possesses a valid identification credential.
       3.1.1.2. (Added-11WG) When rental vehicles are used by military or DoD personnel in conjunc-
       tion with official business, they will be treated as government vehicles. All drivers will be
       checked for the proper installation entry credentials and if in order the vehicle may proceed in the
       same manner as a marked government vehicle.
   3.1.2. (Added-11WG) Off Road Vehicles (ORV) intended for construction and material handlng (i.e.
   tractors, cranes) will not be operated on Bolling roadways; therefore, registration is not required on
   Bolling AFB.
   3.1.3. (Added-11WG) Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 has been autho-
   rized to identify visitors on a temporary basis. The pass is issued to personnel who do not have per-
   sonal or vehicle credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the base. The pass is also
   used to register vehicles on a temporary basis pending permanent registration. In this instance, the
   pass may be issued for up to 30 days unless special circumstances exist. At no time will the AF Form
   75 be issued for a period that exceeds six months. Policy and procedures for the issue of the AF Form
   75 are maintained by 11 SFS/S3OVI. All retirees, their dependents, survivors of deceased active duty
   and retired military members authorized to use base facilities and who reside in the local area are
   required to register their POVs with a temporary one day pass or a DD Form 2220, DoD Registered
   Vehicle Sticker.

            The visitor must sign the consent to search and towing/impounding warning. Failure to sign
            their consent will be justification to deny the vehicle access to the base.
            3.1.3.2. (Added-11WG) The form will be displayed in the lower left (driver’s side) corner of
            the windshield with the expiration date displayed so one can see and view it from outside the
            vehicle.
            3.1.3.3. (Added-11WG) Upon termination of the visit, the visitor will deposit the used form
            in the box provided at the base entry/exit point when they depart the base.
     3.1.4. (Added-11WG) Bolling AFB will honor vehicle registrations from other military installations
     in the National Capital Region for personnel assigned to the base, providing that the vehicle has a DD
     Form 2220 properly affixed. Personnel not assigned to the base, may operate a vehicle registered
     from any DoD installation.
        3.1.4.1. (Added-11WG) Vehicle registrations from the following local installations may be hon-
        ored for base assigned personnel: Andrews AFB, Fort Myers, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Fort
        Belvoir, Fort McNair, Military District Washington (MDW), Quantico, Fort Meade, Henderson
        Hall and Naval District Washington (NDW).

            troller must check ID/Drivers License, insurance and registration), and Capital/Park/Metropol-
            itan marked Police Cars on official business (they must show credentials).
                3.1.4.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) If conducting an investigation, Metropolitan Police Depart-
                ment (MPD) will be escorted to the location on base after coordination with 11 SFS/S2I.
                If responding to a 911 call, MPD will stand by at the gate while SF responds. If MPD
                assistance is required, they will be escorted to the location of the incident.

            some circumstances in support of visitor control. The pass may be issued to contractors, visi-
            tors, students or any other person requiring access to BAFB. Some automated passes have
            restrictions on them allowing access during certain times/days of the week. Recipients of the
            automated visitor pass are issued a separate vehicle pass (i.e., AF Form 75) if a different vehi-
            cle is being operated than what is on the BIC..
     3.1.5. (Added-11WG) Registration Requirements for Contractors. DoD Contractors operating vehi-
     cles on the base are required to register their POVs IAW paragraph 3.2., of this instruction. If vehicle
     information on the Bolling Identification Card (BIC) matches the vehicle being driven, the vehicle
     registration requirement for base access has been met. Contractors authorized/issued a Bolling Iden-
     tification Card (BIC) are limited to registering one POV. Contractor vehicles registered in the com-
     pany name, which also have the company logo on the vehicle, are issued vehicle passes.

     another vehicle, the member must remove the DD Form 2220 from the vehicle traded in and turn it
     into the issuing agency. Failure to do so could result in a 30 day suspension of base driving privileges
     and denial of registration for the new vehicle. If an individual is registering a vehicle, the SF Visitor
     Center will check and ask the individual if it’s a renewal or a new vehicle/replacing an old vehicle. If
     old replacing new, they will ask for the decal. If individual does not have it, SFVC can go into SFMIS
     and delete the old decal number and issues a new one.

   traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
   with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
   every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
   the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
   efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
   tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
   the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
   communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
   rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
      for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
      directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
      neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
      a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
      ture planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
   and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
   studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
   control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
   TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
   CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
      4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.

     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
     75-88, Highways for National Defense.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
     4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
     installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
     empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
     contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
     host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
     and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
     following:
        4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
        4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
        by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
        CFR 1204.
        4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
     4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
     impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
     lowing:
        4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
        4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
        4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
        4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
     4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
     tained in the subparagraphs below:

        ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
        cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
        Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
        operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
        roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
        the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
        safety requirements.
        4.2.3.1. (11WG) Motorcycles and mopeds. The use of “Pocket Motorcycles” or “Pocket Rock-
        ets” is prohibited on Bolling AFB. This follows the restriction of local law that prohibits the oper-
        ation of Pocket Bikes in the District of Columbia.
            4.2.3.1.1. (Added-11WG) DC law provides that a motorcycle is a 2 or 3 wheeled motor vehi-

            primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
        while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
        4.2.3.4. (Added-11WG) In accordance with Title 32 Code of Federal Regulations 634.25, Instal-
        lation Traffic Codes paragraph 3, “Driver Distractions”; Vehicle operators on a DoD Installation

            4.2.3.4.2. (Added-11WG) A DD Form 1805, AF IMT 1408 or District of Columbia Notice of
            Infraction (DC NOI) can be issued for this violation. On an AF IMT 1408, the violation will
            be included in the category of “Other moving violations (involving driver behavior only)” and
            count for 3 points against the violators base driving record.
        4.2.3.5. (Added-11WG) Tinted Windows: Vehicle windows are required to conform to the crite-
        ria established by the city/state which that vehicle is registered in. Should a question arise whether
        the vehicle is in compliance with the criteria, the owner/operator may be required to have the win-
        dows tested.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                    25


     offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
     installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
     installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
     tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
     lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
     imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
     not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
     a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
         4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
         traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
         tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
  4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
  when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
  vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
  ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
  gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
  However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
  develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
  supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
  any off-road vehicle use area.
  4.2.6. (11WG) All Terrain Vehicles (ATV): No passengers are authorized on an ATV, unless the oper-
  ator is in the performance of official force protection duties.
  4.2.7. (Added-11WG) Bicycles: Every person riding a bicycle on a Bolling AFB roadway will be
  granted all of the rights and will be subject to all of the duties applicable to the driver/operator of a
  vehicle by this instruction, except special rules in the instruction which by their nature can have no
  application.
     4.2.7.1. (Added-11WG) Bicycle riders must obey the same traffic laws as motor vehicle opera-
     tors. In addition, bicyclists must wear a reflective outer garment or material when riding during
     periods of reduced visibility (hours of darkness, inclement weather, etc).
     4.2.7.2. (Added-11WG) Helmets: Everyone who rides a bicycle on a military base is required to
     wear approved bicycle helmets. This includes dependents, contractors, and retirees. An approved
     helmet must meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Snell Memorial Foundation, or
     the American Society of Testing/Measurement for Protective Headgear for Use in Bicycling
     guidelines. Workers operating bicycles in areas that require the use of ANSI-helmets (hard hats)
     for protection from falling and flying objects are allowed to use those helmets instead of approved
     bicycle helmets. The ONLY exception is for workers operating bicycles in industrial areas desig-
     nated no-hat areas due to potential of foreign object damage need not wear the bicycle helmet.
     4.2.7.3. (Added-11WG) Head Lamp: Every bicycle operated during the hours of darkness or
     periods of reduced visibility caused by rain, fog, snow, etc., will be equipped with a front lamp that
     emits a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet during periods of reduced visibility.
     4.2.7.4. (Added-11WG) Rear Reflector: Every bicycle will be equipped with a red reflector,
     which will be visible from 100 feet to 600 feet to the rear when directly in front of lower beam
     motor vehicle headlamps. In addition, a lamp emitting a red light visible from a distance of 500

        feet to the rear will be used in addition to the red reflector. Also, the front wheel will have a col-
        orless or amber reflector in its spokes while the rear wheel will have a colorless or red reflector in
        its spokes. Each reflector shall be visible on each side of the wheel from a distance of 600 feet
        when directly in front of lawful lower beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle.
        4.2.7.5. (Added-11WG) ) Sirens and Whistles are Prohibited: A bicyclist will not equip their
        bicycle with or use any siren or similar audible device. Exception: A bell or horn which can be
        heard at a distance of no more than 100 feet is permissible to warn other operators of their pres-
        ence.
        4.2.7.6. (Added-11WG) Brakes: Every bicycle shall be equipped with brakes that will enable the
        operator to stop the bicycle within 25 feet from a speed of 10 miles per hour on dry, level, and
        clean pavement.
        4.2.7.7. (Added-11WG) Park and secure your bicycle in racks where available. Bicycles may be
        parked on secured or seeded areas, next to buildings, and on a sidewalk if it does not impede nor-
        mal/reasonable movement of pedestrian or other traffic. Bicycles will not be parked or secured in
        building entry ways/approaches to entry ways, a spot clearly intended for a motor vehicle, or adja-
        cent to a traffic control sign or device.
     4.2.8. (Added-11WG) Usage of skateboards, scooters, roller skates, or inline skates is permitted, pro-
     viding the operators observe and comply with all traffic devices/signs and wear approved Department
     of Transportation ANSI or Snell Memorial Foundation headgear. The chinstrap must be properly fas-
     tened under the chin while wearing the helmet. The wear of elbow, wrist and kneepads are optional,
     but highly encouraged. Usage of skateboards, scooters, roller skates, or inline skates is permitted on
     sidewalks (provided pedestrians are not present) and in housing areas.
     4.2.9. (Added-11WG) Hearing Impairment. Wearing portable headphones, earphones or other lis-
     tening devices (i.e. cell phones) while operating a motor vehicle or jogging, bicycling or skating along
     traffic environment on BAFB is prohibited. Note: An exception would be BAFB bicycle/jogging
     paths, individuals with hearing aids or persons on motorcycle with intercom system between operator
     and passenger.
     4.2.10. (Added-11WG) Jogging, running, skating, walking and skateboarding on BAFB roadways
     during high peak traffic periods (0600 – 0800 and 1500 – 1700, M-F) is prohibited.
     4.2.11. (Added-11WG) Where there are no sidewalks, run against the flow of traffic on the extreme
     shoulder of the roadway but, in no case will this be conducted during peak traffic periods (0600 –
     0800 and 1500 – 1700, M-F)
     4.2.12. (Added-11WG) Overtaking and Passing Foot Troops. Drivers will yield the right-of-way to
     all troop formations running on a street or roadway. The maximum speed while passing troop forma-
     tions in any directions is 5 mph. Drivers will exercise extreme caution while overtaking a formation
     going in the same direction and will not pass unless signaled by the troop formation leader or traffic
     guides.
     4.2.13. (Added-11WG) Speed Limits. No driver will drive a vehicle at a speed greater than the
     posted speed limit. Drivers must drive at a slower speed if existing weather, road, potential hazards
     and/or traffic conditions make traveling at the posted speed unreasonable. The maximum speed limit
     on AFB is 30 mph unless otherwise posted or indicated below. Note: Emergency vehicles may
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                 27


   exceed posted speed limits by no more than 10mph over the posted speed limit when responding to a
   situation in which lights and sirens would normally be used.

      nue housing, which is 20 mph.
      4.2.13.2. (Added-11WG) Parking Lots: 10 mph.
   4.2.14. (Added-11WG) Speed Enforcement Procedures. The 11 SFS uses radar/laser detection
   devices for speed violations and traffic compliant measures to enhance compliance. The following
   reflects how these initiatives are me.
      4.2.14.1. (Added-11WG) To cite a person for speeding on BAFB, the 11 SFS personnel must
      meet the training and certification requirements prescribed by District of Columbia and/or the
      Chief, Security Forces (CSF).
      4.2.14.2. (Added-11WG) Use an approved speed-measuring device. Exception: Security Forces
      and DOD Police officers may use the vehicle calibrated pace method to issue speeding citations,
      provided they are trained and certified.
      4.2.14.3. (Added-11WG) Unless directed by 11 SFS/S3 or higher authority, speeding tickets
      based solely on visual assessment are not authorized on BAFB. However, properly trained 11 SFS
      personnel may issue warning tickets if they personally witness an obvious violation of base speed
      limits.
   4.2.15. (Added-11WG) Unlawful Riding. No driver will.
      4.2.15.1. (Added-11WG) Permit a person riding on bicycle, coaster, roller skates, sled, or toy

      4.2.15.2. (Added-11WG) Permit a person to ride any vehicle or any portion thereof not designed
      or intended for the use of passengers.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
   and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
   emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
   developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
      Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
      Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.

     4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
        4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
        4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
        niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
        4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
        4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
        their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
     4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
     and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
     model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
     certification courses used by local authorities.
     4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
        4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
        certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
        Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
        the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
        tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
        speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
        ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
        ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
        to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
        ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
        program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
        ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
        successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
            ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-
            ment(s).

           4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
           mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
   4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
   state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
   dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
   4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
       4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
       4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
       devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
       of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
4.5. (11WG) Traffic Accident Investigation. The only personnel authorized at the scene of a vehicle acci-
dent are senior commanders, Security Forces, Base Safety, Alert Photographer, emergency responders,
medical attendants (in cases involving personal injury) and AFDW/11 WG/JA. Base Safety is notified by
the Security Forces Control Center on all vehicle mishaps.
Furnish copies of AF IMT 1315, Accident Report, DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, or DD
Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice, pertaining to major vehicle accidents to Ground
Safety, legal office, and Logistics Readiness Squadron Vehicle Management Flight.
   4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
       4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
       4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
       mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
       the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.
   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
   local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
   security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
   sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
   and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
   other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.6.1. (11WG) All traffic accidents occurring on base must be reported to the Security Forces within
   72 hours. Response to minor accidents is at the discretion of the on-duty Flight Chief as delegated by
   the CSF. If the accident is deemed to be minor in nature, the individuals involved will be directed to
   report to the SFCC to complete required paperwork. Security Forces members will record pertinent
30                                                     AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


     information on Bolling AFB’s Security Forces Minor Accident Report and make an entry into the
     daily blotters.
        4.6.1.1. (Added-11WG) Operators of vehicles involved in accidents with one or more of the
        aforementioned circumstances will not move the involved vehicles unless their positions further
        endanger life, property, or could potentially create another accident. Additionally, operators and
        witnesses involved will not leave the scene of the accident before Security Forces arrive unless
        medical personnel deem the individuals involved are in need of immediate medical attention.
            4.6.1.1.1. (Added-11WG) The operator of a vehicle striking an unattended vehicle must stop
            immediately and attempt to find the owner/driver. If unable to find the owner/driver, contact
            the security forces at 202-767-5000/1/2/3 and leave a note affixed to the windshield. This note
            must include; your name, address, contact number, vehicle registration number and insurance
            information.
            4.6.1.1.2. (Added-11WG) If the vehicle operator is physically incapable of accomplishing an
            accident report, a vehicle occupant at the time of the accident may accomplish the report for
            the driver.
     4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
     Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
     accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
     4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
     cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
        4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
        4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
        4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
        4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
        4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
        4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
        cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
        on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
     4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
     hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
     accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
     not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
     brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
     any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
     established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
     a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
     The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
     property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
     techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                    31


   4.6.4. (11WG) Major accidents are determined as follows: 1) Any accident which results in an injury
   or fatality, 2) Damage to a vehicle leaving it disabled or unable to be driven from the scene under its
   own power, 3) When a GOV, POV or property damage is involved and total damage exceeds $10,000,
   and 4) When a pedestrian is involved.
       4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
       accident:
          4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
          4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
          4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
          any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
   frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
   in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
   trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
   exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
   cleared to receive accident and incident data.
   4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
   indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
   deployed.

4.8. Parking.
   4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
   enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
   and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
   where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
   authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
   towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
   cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
       4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
       ing to specific offenses.
       4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
       unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
       compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
       safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
       4.8.1.2. (11WG) The “Denver Boot” may be used to temporarily secure a vehicle that is consid-
       ered evidence of criminal activity until such time that the vehicle can be removed to a secure loca-
       tion. The Denver boot may also be used when directed by the CSF as a more serious enforcement
       measure when education/awareness fails in areas where illegal parking is a problem. These areas
       include, but are not limited to, immobilizing unsafe vehicles, vehicles not inspected or registered,
       high offense areas, or to compel the presence of repeat offenders. The Denver Boot will not be
32                                                     AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


        used if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations,
        etc., prove more effective, will not be used if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings,
        ticketing, reprimands, revocations, etc., prove more effective.
        4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
        ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
        4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
        boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
        4.8.1.4. (11WG) Individuals whose car is “booted” will be instructed to contact the 11 SFS,
        Investigations Section or the Security Forces control center to have the boot removed.
     4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
     reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
     traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
     reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
     lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
     publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
     cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
     under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
     4.8.2. (11WG) Reserved Parking. Request for reserved parking will be forwarded to the unit com-
     mander for each facility who will in-turn submit their request to the Traffic Planning Board for
     approval. If several units are located in the building, the requests should be forwarded to the Real
     Property Building Manager (RPBM) for coordination with their commander.
        4.8.2.1. (Added-11WG) Business facilities that do not operate in conjunction with a designated
        squadron (i.e., AAFES, Commissary, Credit Union, Bank) will coordinate all reserved parking
        requests through the 11 MSG/CC or Deputy for approval under the provisions outlined in this
        requesting reserved parking. Only personnel included in AFI 32-1024/BAFBSUP1, Standard
        Facility Requirements, paragraph 2.2 will be considered for a reserved parking space. All requests
        are processed through the facility manager on behalf of the commander.
            4.8.2.1.1. (Added-11WG) The facility manager is responsible for maintaining a list of
            reserved parking slots and whom they are issued to for each facility.
            4.8.2.1.2. (Added-11WG) The facility manager will evaluate each request and complete an
            AF IMT 332, CE Work Order Request that will indicate the type of work requested and justifi-
            cation. A diagram of the target area shall also be attached.
            4.8.2.1.3. (Added-11WG) Once coordination is obtained, the work request will be forwarded
            to the 11 CES/CC for action. Disapproved requests will be returned to the originator.
            4.8.2.1.4. (Added-11WG) Requestor may appeal this decision by forwarding a letter to the 11
            CES/CC outlining why his/her reserved parking request should be reconsidered. The appeal
            will be reviewed by the full Traffic Planning Board and a recommendation will be forwarded
            to the 11 MSG/CC who will render the final decision.
            4.8.2.1.5. (Added-11WG) Facility Managers are also responsible for completing an annual
            review each anniversary month of the original or updated request. This review shall be docu-
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                   33


         mented and kept on file along with a legible copy of the current AF IMT 332 and diagram that
         was approved by 11 CES/CC.
  4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
  and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
  bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
  ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
  identification media discussed above.
  4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
  within off-street parking facilities.
  4.8.4. (11WG) The unit commander exercising jurisdiction over a particular facility or building may
  appoint parking wardens for the building/facility.
     4.8.4.1. (Added-11WG) Units who elect to utilize parking wardens will appoint them as such via
     appointment memorandum to 11 SFS/S5I. Wardens will be in the grade of E-5 or above; if civil-
     ian, GS-5 or above.
     4.8.4.2. (Added-11WG) 11 SFS/S5 (Plans and Programs) and 11 SFS/S3T (Training) will ensure
     parking wardens are trained on the base parking rules and instructions and how to write DD Form
     1408s.
     4.8.4.3. (Added-11WG) Parking Wardens will maintain a roster of reserved parking spaces for
     their building/facility and of people authorized to use reserved parking assigned to their building/
     facility.
     4.8.4.4. (Added-11WG) Parking Wardens will enforce compliance with these parking rules and
     regulations by writing parking tickets and/or calling Security Forces to report a vehicle for towing.
     White and yellow copies of completed/voided DD Form 1408s will be turned into 11 SFS/S5I no
     later than the following duty day for processing.
  4.8.5. (Added-11WG) The following violations can result in penalties and fines. No person will stop
  or park a vehicle in the following locations: Note: Maintenance and emergency vehicles may be tem-
  porarily parked in these areas while performing official duties)
     4.8.5.1. (Added-11WG) In the roadway.

     lot after normal duty hours other than outside or near the owner’s residence for the principal pur-
     pose of displaying vehicle for sale.
     4.8.5.20. (Added-11WG) Occupants of military family housing are assigned one reserved park-
     ing space for each residence or have a driveway for use. Visitors will park in spaces provided for
     visitors. Overnight parking for a non-resident is limited to properly sponsored guests.
     4.8.5.21. (Added-11WG) Recreational Vehicles (RV) are defined as trailers, campers, oversized
     vehicles to include, truck mounted campers, motor homes, boats, and motorized jet skis. Except
     as indicated below, no one will leave, park or maintain private or commercially-owned recre-
     ational vehicles/trailers on Bolling AFB for more than 24 hours.
     4.8.5.22. (Added-11WG) In Preparation for a Trip/Weekend/Emergency. When preparing for a
     trip, on weekends, or in emergencies, persons residing on base may park their RV/Trailers outside
     the authorized RV parking lots for a period not to exceed 24 hours.
     4.8.5.23. (Added-11WG) Primary Transportation. Persons who use their RV as their primary

       the law enforcement desk to complete a long-term parking registration sheet. Vehicles may be
       parked at the long-term parking lot for the duration of a temporary duty assignment.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
   within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
   its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
       because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
       lative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
       court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
   or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
   rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
   Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
   itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
   duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
   10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
   DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
   4.9.3. (11WG) All Security Forces personnel, DoD Police, READY Augmentees, IMAs, and
   appointed parking wardens for parking violations only around their respective duty areas on Bolling
   AFB are authorized to issue DD Form 1408s after being trained by 11 SFS Training Section. Only
   Security Forces assigned personnel are authorized to issue DD Form 1805 after being trained by 11
   SFS Training Section.
   4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
   administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
   federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
   ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
   Control.
   4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
   violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
   first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
   DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
   the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
       4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
       publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
       form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
36                                                     AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
        4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
        CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
        4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
        advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
        eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
        4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
            4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
            (Central Violation Bureau).
            4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
            4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
        4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
            4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
            instructions as determined by the installation commander.
            4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
            the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
            action within the unit/organization.
            4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
            and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
            mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
            the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
            ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
4.10. (11WG) Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers. Formal training on the
Intoxilyzer 5000 is conducted by the United States Park Police/Metropolitan Police Department or other
agencies trained to do so. Security Forces training section conducts training using a National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration DWI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Testing course. No
refresher training is required, however, local standards for monthly practice tests must be adhered to.
     4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
     ing:
        4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
        cles.
        4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
        documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      37


      4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
      sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
      local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
      tests.
      4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
      is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
      4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
      4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
      4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
   4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
   lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
   graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
   and involuntary testing.
   4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
   their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
   manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
   advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
   ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
   staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
   sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
   graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
      4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
      person is not under the influence of alcohol.
      4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
      this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
      influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
      delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
      state, or host nation standard.
      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
      standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
      been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
      2.5.1.3.
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
   based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
   standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
   ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
        4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
        entific and medical methods and standards.
        4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
        4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
     4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
     apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
     stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
     techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
     ufacturer's operating instructions.
        4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
            4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
            specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
            any substance.
            4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
            turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
            4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
            manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
     4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
        4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
        any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
        ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
        the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
        soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
        medical reports.
        4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
        from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
     behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
     ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
     The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
     standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
     found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
     dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
     reduction measures.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      39


4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
4.14. (11WG) Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent. Security Forces
personnel utilize the Intoxilyzer 5000 for the initial testing of breath. An alternate means for testing mil-
itary personnel is the Blood Alcohol Test (BAT).
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
       vehicle on the installation.
       4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
       alcohol or drugs.
       4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
       voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
       tion of on-base driving privileges.
   4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
   the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
   plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
   deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
   4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
   consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
   Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
   medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
   extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
   procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
   medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
   be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
   ical doctor.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
   ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
   cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
   ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
   and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
   tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
   extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
   Clinical Services.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
   zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
   quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
40                                                       AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


     involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
     an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
     property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
     a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
     following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
     obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
     extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
     indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
     essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
     and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
     and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
     appropriate commander or military magistrate.
        4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
        nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
        Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
        time an authorization is sought.
            4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
            ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
            4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
            not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
            extraction.
            4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
            ual in determining probable cause.
     4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
     qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
     such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
     cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
     Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
     enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
     or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
        4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
        Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
        cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
     4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
     paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
     laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
     of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
     method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
     arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        41


   stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
   pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.
4.17. (11WG) Off-installation Traffic Activities. All military personnel who are cited or apprehended
by civil law-enforcement authorities (reporting of minor traffic infractions with no resulting injuries
requiring medical attention will be as determined by their commander) are required, as soon as possible or
after release from the hospital, jail, etc., to notify their commanders, or first sergeants, who, in turn, will
notify the Security Forces desk sergeant. The SF desk sergeant will complete a detailed blotter entry
with pertinent information for serious cases only (cases involving the subject being charged with an
offense) and forward it to 11 SFS/S5I (11 SFS Reports and Analysis). 11 SFS/S5I will follow the case
through the civilian courts and accomplish supplement reports until the case is closed. Once the case is
closed, 11SFS/S5I will complete a final report and forward it to the squadron commander for appropriate
action..

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
   4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
   operating government vehicles on or off base.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
   ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
   length, width, or other standards.
   4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
   encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
       accidents or incidents.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
       motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
       laws.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
       driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
   tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
   erate and provide proper support and participation.
   4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
   gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
42                                                      AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


     traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
     Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
     affairs officers should take part.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                   43

                   DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
   tim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
   mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
   “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead of
 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.

NOTES:
     1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
        date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
        host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
       2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied con-
          sent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
          nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
          addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revo-
          cation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24
          months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy sys-
          tematically and not on a case-by-case basis.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      45


5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).

specific violations).

NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense
     having the greater value.
     2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to
        correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period
        on a warning ticket).
     3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster
        seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no
        restraint system of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
     5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
     as a basis for determining point assessment.
     5.4.1. (11WG) A DD Form 1408 or DC NOI will be completed on all offenders that are active duty,
     AFRES on active duty orders, civilians operating government vehicles and juvenile traffic offenders
     for all traffic violations which will not be referred to the Federal Magistrate’s Court.
        5.4.1.1. (Added-11WG) The applicable forms will be forwarded to the appropriate commander
        or supervisor for action.
        5.4.1.2. (Added-11WG) Juvenile offenders will be processed through SJA for referral to the
        Juvenile Court for the county where they reside.
        5.4.1.3. (Added-11WG) All DD Form 1408 rebuttals will be completed IAW AFMAN 31-201,
        Vol 7, Para 2.1.6.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                   47


     5.4.1.4. (Added-11WG) A DD Form 1805 will be completed for all traffic violations, which will
     be referred to Federal Magistrate’s Court by AFDW and/or 11 WG/JA. This includes all offenders
     who are civilian (including dependents) and not operating a GOV and AFRES personnel not on
     active duty orders.
  5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
  (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
  mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
  5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
  5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
  ate:
     5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
     acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
     acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
     have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
     5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
     attitude.
     5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
     ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
     alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
  5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
  instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
  5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
  or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
  consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
  offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
  The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
  in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
  severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
  cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
  before reinstatement of driving privileges.
  5.4.6. (11WG) Any person who has accumulated 12 traffic points in 12 consecutive months or 18
  traffic points in 24 consecutive months will have their base driving privileges suspended for one year.
  5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
  secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
  recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
  based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.

     5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
     chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
     driving records for the period of time indicated below.
        5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
        5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
     5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
     their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
     gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
     or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
     transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
     5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
     37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
     from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
     officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
     rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
     ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
     5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
     entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
     Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points
     accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or
     chargeable accidents from the driver records except per para 5.4.7. and 5.4.8.

                                                Chapter 6

                         IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
   traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
   and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
   convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
   abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
   possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
   ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
   owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
   police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
       6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
          flow of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
          lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
          hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
       6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
          (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
          ways.
          6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
          cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
50                                                    AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


            6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
     6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
     on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
     6.3.1. (11WG) Any vehicle parked illegally for an unreasonable period of time, interfering with mil-
     itary operations, creating a safety hazard, in a “designated” construction zone, disabled by incident,
     left unattended in a restricted/controlled area, or abandoned may be towed.
        6.3.1.1. (Added-11WG) The SFCC will contact a patrol to respond to the scene. The patrol will
        confirm the situation to be one where towing is authorized under regulations and call for towing
        equipment after coordination with SFOI.
        6.3.1.2. (Added-11WG) The offending vehicle will be photographed to determine pre-existing
        damage and to provide visual evidence of the offense or condition justifying towing.
        6.3.1.3. (Added-11WG) The tow truck operator will take possession of the offending vehicle
        under the contracts in effect and will remove the vehicle to the impound lot location identified in
        the contracts.
        6.3.1.4. (Added-11WG) Owners/operators of the impounded vehicle can contact the SFCC for
        information to regain possession of their vehicle(s) and are responsible for the cost involved for
        the towing.
        6.3.1.5. (Added-11WG) Anyone whose vehicle is towed can, after regaining possession of the
        vehicle, appeal the towing within 15 calendar days. Appellants must do so by requesting a hearing
        in writing from 11 WG/SJA.
        6.3.1.6. (Added-11WG) The appellant must provide the date, time (approximate), and location of
        the towing, and the year, make, model and color of the vehicle towed. The appellant will be noti-
        fied in writing of the date and time of their appeal hearing by 11 WG/JA.
        6.3.1.7. (Added-11WG) Individuals who have had their vehicle(s) towed without authority and
        are requesting reimbursement for towing costs will have to file a claim through 11WG/SJA.
     6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
     an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
     vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
     keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
     6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
     in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
     6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
        6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
        on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
        the security police blotter.
AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      51


       6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
       the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
       complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
       6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
       2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
           6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
           personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
           tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
           container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
           6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
       6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
       tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
       impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
       vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
       6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
       recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
       enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
       6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
       Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
       through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
       and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
       take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
       mander.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
   impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
   band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
   doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
   or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
   exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
   otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
   search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
   a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
   dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
   or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
52                                                     AFI31-204_11WGSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2006


     erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
     sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
     Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
     or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
     tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
     bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
     vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
     period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
     letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
        abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
        commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
        property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
        potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
        vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
        and DoD directives.

NOTES:
  1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-base offense, the effective date is the
     same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation state or district driving privi-
     leges. This effective date can be retroactive.
     2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
        violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, non-judi-
        cial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in
        this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as
        one year for intoxicated driving, revocations can run consecutively (total of 24 months) or concur-
        rently (total of 12 months). Apply the base commander’s policy systematically and not on a
        case-by-case basis.
     3. Barment may be required; check with on-call JAG.
