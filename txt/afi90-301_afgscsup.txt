IG that an investigation may be warranted.
2.30.1.1. (Added) Provide an electronic copy of the complaint with attachments, analysis, and
proposed framed allegations to HQ AFGSC/IGQ for review by the Investigation Review Board
(IRB). The IRB will review the documents to determine whether all allegations were captured,

will appoint a member of AFGSC/IGQ to conduct an investigation when the subject is an O-6,
O-6 select, GS-15, and NSPS Pay Band 3. The NAF commander will act as the appointing
authority if the subject is a wing commander and not a general officer. If the NAF commander is
not available, HQ AFGSC/IG will act as the appointing authority.
2.30.1.4. (Added) Once the investigation is completed by the IG or assigned IO, the report will
undergo an initial legal review by the respective JA. When found legally sufficient the report
will be forwarded to HQ AFGSC/IGQ for quality review and to HQ AFGSC/JA for legal review,
and forwarded to higher headquarters if appropriate. If the investigation is accomplished by HQ
AFGSC/IGQ, the legal review will be accomplished by HQ AFGSC/JA.
2.30.1.5. (Added) Commanders are an integral part of the IG complaints resolution process.
Therefore, once the investigation is approved by the appointing authority and receives HQ
AFGSC/IGQ concurrence, a copy will be provided to the respective commander for information
