A1.1. Be familiar with 689 CCWI 36-2802 and ensure strict adherence to this instruction.
A1.2. First, review the score sheet. Note what each category is worth, how the points are broken
down, and the fact that all accomplishments must have occurred during the award period.
Ensure each bullet is in the proper category.
A1.3. Finally, find a quiet space and objectively review each package in detail. Judge how
important each bullet is, based on your own intellect, experience and common sense. Don’t
bring in your own knowledge of the person, just the facts contained on the AF IMT 1206 and
SURF. Grade each nomination package individually, awarding points based on three factors:
the acts performed, their impact, and scope of responsibility. Packages will be scored using a 0,
1, 2 point per bullet scoring with a rank-ordered system. Board members will assign the proper
points and rank accordingly. It is important to take notes during the scoring process so you are
prepared to openly discuss scoring considerations if the Board President deems necessary.
Complete ALL blanks on each score sheet and return completed Awards Board Score Sheets to
the 689 CCW Command Chief’s organizational email. Also, though you may not know for
certain whom the overall category winner is, you may develop a good idea based on the content
of the packages and board proceedings. It is your duty to maintain secrecy. Don’t tell anyone
until AFTER the 689 CCW Commander has officially approved and released awards.
A1.4. An important benefit of serving as a board member is the knowledge you’ll gain of the
process and the ability to improve your group’s competitiveness at future boards. Pass this
insight on to your group and squadron. Let everyone know how to improve packages in the
future.
