IC-1 TO AFI 16-1202 CL-1, Pararescue Operators Briefing Checklist 

20 July 2009

*SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements the most recent guidance provided by the Military Free-fall
Committee concerning emergency parachutist bailout procedures identified in AFMAN 11-411
Special Forces Military Free-Fall Operations. This guidance changes the critical altitude in
determining bailout procedure to utilize from 2000 ft AGL to 2500 ft AGL to eliminate the
potential for a dual main and reserve deployment upon activation of main parachute. Update

WARNING: Top jumper may be fatally engulfed in the
canopy of the low jumper if the low jumper performs a cut
away prior to the top jumper.

       7.10.5.3. Last resort - both jumpers deploy
       reserves in an attempt to slow descent
         7.10.5.3.1. If only one deploys - jumper with the
         good canopy brings the other entangled jumper to
         the ground

     hand
     10.3.6. Pull cutaway handle
     10.3.7. Pull reserve ripcord

NOTE: For easy pull, handles must be peeled upward and
outward and then pulled down.

     10.3.8. Throw away cutaway handle and reserve
     ripcord
     10.3.9. Arch and ensure reserve pilot chute has
     deployed
     10.3.10. Perform post-opening procedures

AFI 16-1202, CL-1                        1 November 2002

   10.4. Post opening procedures
   10.4.1. Steer to avoid - use rear risers to avoid other
   jumpers - turn to the right to avoid head on collisions
     10.4.2. Release brakes
     10.4.3. Check canopy
     10.4.4. Resolve post-opening malfunctions
     10.4.5. If controllability is questionable - perform a
     controllability check
     10.4.6. If a malfunction cannot be resolved and
     canopy is uncontrollable - cutaway no lower than
     2,500 feet AGL.

NOTE: For RAMZ and HAHO operations - cutaways
should be initiated immediately if any main canopy
performance is questionable.

     10.4.7. Orient yourself to the DZ
     10.4.8. Locate other jumpers and achieve separation
     10.4.9. Activate strobe light
     10.4.10. Maintain altitude awareness

Tandem EP Brief                                               98
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                        1 November 2002

NOTE: Controllability check is accomplished only when
canopy controllability is questionable.

     10.5.1.   Maintain altitude awareness
     10.5.2.   Release brakes (if not already accomplished)
     10.5.3.   Look left, turn left 90 degrees
     10.5.4.   Look right, turn right 90 degrees
     10.5.5.   Determine stall point

NOTE: If canopy requires more than 50% opposite toggle
to counter turn, canopy is uncontrollable. If canopy stalls
prior to 50% brakes, it is uncontrollable.

     10.5.6. If the canopy is uncontrollable - perform
     cutaway procedures
   10.6. Opening and post-opening malfunctions

WARNING: Time is of the essence when dealing with
high-speed tandem malfunctions. The inertia generated by
a tandem pair at tandem terminal exceeds the reserve’s and
the tandem pair’s category rating for opening shock.
Perform the correct emergency procedure before you reach
tandem terminal.

     10.6.1. Student interference




Tandem EP Brief                                           99
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                       1 November 2002

NOTE: Prevention is the key to keeping free from student
interference. Keep your arms out of the passenger’s reach
until after the main canopy has opened.

NOTE: Do not attempt release of captured arm with your
free arm.

       10.6.1.1. Yell at passenger to release your arm(s)
       10.6.1.2. Pull arm(s) down and back away from
       passenger
       10.6.1.3. Use free arm or your forehead to
       incapacitate passenger
       10.6.1.4. If right arm is free
         10.6.1.4.1. Throw drogue
         10.6.1.4.2. Release drogue using secondary
         release
       10.6.1.5. If left arm is free - pull reserve
     10.6.2. Lost drogue
       10.6.2.1. Re-identify landmarks and attempt to
       locate drogue once more
       10.6.2.2. If unsuccessful - pull reserve
     10.6.3. Drogue hard pull
       10.6.3.1. Pull in direction of pocket once more,
       locking elbow against side of the container
       10.6.3.2. If unsuccessful, pull reserve
     10.6.4. Pulled drogue release before deploying
     drogue
       10.6.4.1. Deploy drogue immediately

Tandem EP Brief                                         100
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                       1 November 2002

      10.6.4.2. This will result in a near normal main
      canopy opening
     10.6.5. Drogue hesitation/un-inflated drogue
      10.6.5.1. Vigorous over the shoulder check
      10.6.5.2. If drogue is still on your back
        10.6.5.2.1. Check vigorously, again
        10.6.5.2.2. If drogue does not deploy fully - pull
        reserve
      10.6.5.3. If drogue is fully deployed but not
      inflated
        10.6.5.3.1. Pull drogue release(s)
        10.6.5.3.2. Main should deploy slower than
        normal, if releases fail - pull reserve
     10.6.6. Entanglement with drogue/drogue bridle
      10.6.6.1. Un-inflated drogue - pull reserve
      10.6.6.2. Inflated drogue
        10.6.6.2.1. Analyze and attempt to clear, quickly
        10.6.6.2.2. Pull reserve if unable to clear

NOTE: Do not release drogue before pulling reserve
during a drogue/drogue bridle entanglement.

     10.6.7. Inflated drogue-in tow
      10.6.7.1. Pull other drogue release
      10.6.7.2. If drogue does not release - pull reserve
      10.6.7.3. After reserve opening reach back and reel
      in the drogue, if main is deploying - cutaway
     10.6.8. Deflated drogue-in-tow

Tandem EP Brief                                         101
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                        1 November 2002

       10.6.8.1. Pull other drogue release
       10.6.8.2. If no "trap door"/drogue release - pull
       reserve
       10.6.8.3. After reserve opening reach back and reel
       in the drogue, if main is deploying - cutaway
       10.6.9. Drogue/canopy entanglement - perform
       controllability check
     10.6.10. Horseshoe, bag lock, streamer, and riser
     separation - cutaway
     10.6.11. Snivel - if sniveling through 2500’ AGL -
     cutaway
     10.6.12. Hung slider, closed end cells, premature
     brake release, broken control lines/broken lines, line
     twists, rips, tears, tension knots, pilot chute over the
     nose, and combinations - perform controllability
     check
     10.6.13. Dual main and reserve deployment
       10.6.13.1. If both parachutes deploy completely -
       cutaway main
       10.6.13.2. If only the reserve pilot chute and bridle
       deploy - attempt to contain them
       10.6.13.3. If the reserve parachute partially
       deploys - slow the main parachute, and be prepared
       to cut away should the reserve parachute fully
       inflate
   10.7. Parachute collision avoidance
     10.7.1. Pre-brief all other jumpers on the same pass
     that the tandem pair has "right-of-way"

Tandem EP Brief                                           102
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                       1 November 2002

     10.7.2. Since others jumpers may forget or not
     receive the brief - always give the lower jumper the
     "right-of-way".
     10.7.3. Maintain safe vertical and horizontal
     separation (25 meters to the rear and above)
     10.7.4. Look before turning
     10.7.5. If unable to avoid collision - spread arms and
     legs in an attempt to bounce off canopy/lines
   10.8. Canopy entanglements
     10.8.1. Communication between jumpers and
     altitude awareness is the key to successful
     disengagement
     10.8.2. Above 2500’ AGL - top jumper has a good
     canopy
       10.8.2.1. Top jumper attempts to clear himself of
       the canopy
       10.8.2.2. If the canopy clears it should reopen in
       150-200’
       10.8.2.3. If canopy cannot be cleared - check
       altitude
       10.8.2.4. Above 2500’ AGL - lower jumper
       perform cutaway
     10.8.3. Between 1500 - 2500’ AGL - top jumper has
     a good canopy
       10.8.3.1. Lower jumper has two options
          10.8.3.1.1. Perform cutaway if above 1500’ AGL
          10.8.3.1.2. Stay with top jumper and perform
          procedures for “below 1500’ AGL”

AFI 16-1202, CL-1                       1 November 2002

     10.8.4. Below 1500’ AGL - top jumper has a good
     canopy
       10.8.4.1. Top jumper - maintain control of lower
       jumpers canopy
       10.8.4.2. Lower jumper - jettison equipment
       10.8.4.3. Top jumper - flies a straight and level
       final approach and lands with 50% brakes

NOTE: Stall point is higher with added suspended weight.

       10.8.4.4. Both jumpers - perform a PLF

WARNING: Turns can cause a severe pendulum effect
and should be avoided at low altitude. Do not attempt a
flared landing.

     10.8.5. Both jumpers entangle and neither has a
     good canopy at any altitude
      10.8.5.1. Top jumper clears himself of entangled
      lines and performs cutaway (altitude permitting)
      10.8.5.2. Lower jumper performs cutaway after top
      jumper clears the entanglement (altitude
      permitting)




Tandem EP Brief                                            104
AFI 16-1202, CL-1                       1 November 2002

WARNING: Top jumper may be fatally engulfed in the
canopy of the low jumper if the low jumper performs a cut
away prior to the top jumper.

      10.8.5.3. Last resort - both jumpers deploy
      reserves in an attempt to slow descent
         10.8.5.3.1. If only one deploys - jumper with the
         good canopy brings the other entangled jumper to
         the ground
         10.8.5.3.2. If both reserves deploy - both jumpers
         cutaway from entanglement
   10.9. Emergency landings
   10.9.1. Trees
      10.9.1.1. Do not release or loosen waist straps
      10.9.1.2. Turn canopy into wind
      10.9.1.3. Brake to achieve vertical descent
      10.9.1.4. Prepare for PLF and tell passenger to put
      feet and knees together
      10.9.1.5. Tell passenger to use forearms to protect
      face and neck
      10.9.1.6. Place your hands on the passenger’s head
      and bury your face to the side of his head
     10.9.2. Wires
      10.9.2.1. Throw away ripcord
      10.9.2.2. Turn off oxygen
      10.9.2.3. Avoid contact at all cost, even if
      downwind

      10.9.2.4. Scissor passenger’s legs between yours,
      streamlining pair
      10.9.2.5. If hung up - remain motionless until
      power is disconnected
      10.9.2.6. Prepare for PLF and tell student to put
      feet and knees together
      10.9.2.7. If the chute is hung up and pair is on the
      ground - pull cutaway handle

NOTE: If time and altitude permit - unhook RSL and
jettison equipment.

     10.9.3. Water (unintentional)

      may have tucked in the top of your jump suit
      10.9.3.7. Tell passenger that the pair may go
      underwater initially but should surface with small
      kicks from the pair
      10.9.3.8. Tell passenger to take a deep breath,
      cross their arms in front of them, and to prepare for
      a normal tandem "skid" landing

NOTE: If a leak is suspected, determine the exact location
by submerging the valve assembly and the regulator in a
tank of water and watch for escaping bubbles.

NOTE: Frequently the problem can be traced to an
improperly seated regulator and is corrected by closing the
valve, bleeding the regulator, detaching and reseating. If
the leak is at the O-ring and reseating does not solve the
problem, replace the O-ring and check again for leaks.

   2.5. Life Preserver/Buoyancy Compensator (BC)
     2.5.1. Orally inflate preserver to check for leaks and
     then squeeze out all air.

NOTE: The remaining gas should be removed after entry
into the water by rolling onto the back and depressing the
oral inflation tube just above the surface.

WARNING: Never suck the air out, as it may contain
excessive carbon dioxide.

     2.5.2. Inspect the carbon dioxide cartridges to ensure
     they have not been used (seals intact) and are the
     proper size for the vest being used and for the depth
     of dive.
     2.5.3. The cartridges shall be weighed in accordance
     with the Planned Maintenance System.

   GENERAL CALL FOR FIRE PHRASEOLOGY

Phraseology:

Tally: Have targets in sight.

Visual: Have friendlies in sight.

Contact: Have reference point in sight.

Rope: Using an IR pointer to ID your position by circling
it around the Acft cockpit.

Sparkle: Term used to mean any IR pointer such as a
PACK 4 or Ground Command Pointer. In close air
support, a laser is a coded marking devise that is not in the
IR light spectrum. A sparkle is visible with NVGs only.

Snake: Using the Sparkle to mark a reference point or a
target, by moving it around on the ground. You can snake
an area for a pilot when they are coming in to land or hoist
(don’t shine it in team member’s eyes though).

Will co: I understand your x-mission, and will comply
with your x-mission. (Never say Roger-will co).

Say flight conditions: Used to request a Pilot Report, or
Pirep. If WX is sketchy, this is a good thing to know.

1. Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind
direction.
2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the
target.
3. Immediately upon release, make left/right turn to
observe descent and position of spotter chute/streamer.
4. Establish rectangular drop pattern oriented so that the
final approach will be aligned with the spotter
chute/streamer and the target, respectively.
5. Turn on approach. Make minor changes in heading to
pass over the spotter chute and the target on a direct line.
Aircraft drift correction should be established prior to
passing over the spotter chute.
6. Initiate uniform count over the spotter chute/streamer.
7. Reverse count over the target.
8. Deploy the second spotter chute/streamer or PJ at last
digit of reverse count
9. After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the
accuracy of the drop.
  a. The normal flight pattern will be a rectangular or
  racetrack pattern with the final approach from WDI to
  target. Each leg of the pattern must be long enough to
  allow the JM and jumpers the preparation needed prior to
  deployment.
    (1) For high performance aircraft, the turn to the
    crosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after the
    WDI is released. A pattern with crosswind and base
    legs of not over one half minute and with downwind

   and final legs of 1 to 1 ½ minutes will allow time for
   heading corrections on final. This allows the JM time
   to observe the descent of WDI device or jumpers. If a
   delay is expected, another full pattern should be flown,
   as opposed to extending the downwind leg, this
   maintains the aircraft close to the area for continued
   evaluation. This pattern will place the aircraft a
   maximum of 5 minutes from the site at any one time.
   (2) The aircraft will be flown over the target at a
   predetermined altitude and airspeed. When directly
   over the target a minimum of one WDI will be dropped.
   The JM and aircrew will make every effort to keep the
   WDI in sight from release to impact. Over land, the
   pilot may have to circle over the WDI to ensure the
   definite location of , or orientation to the impact point
   to the target. After the first WDI has reached the
   ground and its position NOTEd, the aircraft will return
   to the normal pattern. The final approach should pass
   directly over the WDI and the intended target, in that
   order. This pattern automatically aligns the final
   approach into the wind.
   (3)A right or left hand pattern may be flown depending
   on terrain and aircraft configuration. The aircraft will
   be flown in this pattern with minor course corrections
   on final. As the aircraft passes directly over the first
   WDI, the JM will start a uniform count to measure the
   time from the WDI to the target. When the aircraft is
   over the target, the count will be stopped and

   immediately a new count will begin, when that count
   equals the first, the second WDI or jumper will be
   deployed. The increasing count will measure the same
   distance past the target with the accuracy of the
   deployment dependent upon the JMs alignment and
   count.

1. MOVING TARGET PROCEDURES
  a. Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind
  direction.
  b. Release the spotter chute directly over the target.
  c. Immediately upon release, make a left/right hand turn
  to observe the descent and position of the spotter chute.
  d. Establish rectangular drop pattern oriented so the final
  approach will be aligned with the spotter chute and the
  target, respectively. The pattern should be adjusted so
  that the aircraft will be over the target five to nine
  minutes after the spotter chute is deployed.
  e. Turn on approach. Make minor changes in heading to
  pass over the spotter chute and the target on a direct line.
  Aircraft drift correction should be established prior to
  passing over the spotter chute. Initiate a uniform count
  over the spotter chute.
  f. Reverse count over the target.
  g. Deploy PJs when the last digit in reverse count is
  reached.
  h. After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the
  accuracy of the drop.
  i. Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading and
  count established in steps 5, 6, and 7.
  j. Disregard the spotter chute for subsequent passes.
  k. When the target drift rate is changed (drogue chute is
  installed on target, know wind shift occurs, etc.) the
  entire spotter chute procedure must be re-accomplished

  and a new drop heading and count established starting
  with step 1.
2 MOVING TARGET PATTERN. Deployment
procedures to a moving target are similar to those
employed for a stationary target. The moving target
procedures takes into consideration target drift and will
place the team on the downdrift line of the moving target
and not necessarily on target. Special attention should be
paid to the following items:
  a. The pattern must be adjusted so that the initial pass
  over the target after WDI deployment is not less than 5
  minutes and not more than 9 minutes, 7 minutes being
  ideal. If the initial pattern requires more than 9 minutes,
  the team will be too far downdrift/downwind and with a
  high target drift rate may not be able to locate the target
  visually.
  b. On the initial pass after the WDI deployment, an
  accurate count can be obtained by the JM and the heading
  noted by both the JM and pilot. All subsequent passes
  will be made on this initial heading using the count
  obtained on the first pass. No attempt should be made to
  recheck the count or change the initial heading because
  the target will have drifted.
NOTE: On subsequent passes requiring a change of
heading to place the aircraft over the target, ensure the pilot
corrects back to original heading. Moving target
procedures are normally conducted from fixed-wing
aircraft.

             CROSSWIND PROCEDURES




Crosswind Procedures.

1. Spotting and Aerial Delivery - Crosswind Procedures.
  a. Fly over target on heading in a direction to permit a
  left/right hand pattern.
  b. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over target.
  c. Accomplish a 180 degree turn (terrain permitting) in
  direction of drift and observe distance of spotter
  chute/streamer from target.

AFI 16-1202, CL-1                         1 November 2002

  d. Make another 180 degree turn to place the aircraft on
  the approach leg the same distance upwind from the
  target as the spotter chute is downwind.
  e. Deploy PJs, equipment or additional spotters
  chutes/streamers (as required) just prior to when the
  aircraft is in direct line with the target and spotter
  chute/streamer.

2. Crosswind pattern. A crosswind pattern may be
required by terrain conditions or possible sun reflection on
the waters surface. The pilot and JM must accurately judge
the upwind distance from the target in order for this
technique to be effective. The easiest method for obtaining
an accurate upwind distance is the utilization of a
reference/release point. It is imperative that the jumpers be
deployed prior to reaching the reference point due to the
forward ballistics of the parachute as opening occurs. The
objective is to place the reference point at the center of the
stick after forward throw is considered.

3. Spotting techniques. Reference points may be used on
all JMD land deployments. The utilization of reference
points will increase the JMs accuracy in determining the
proper release point. Also an established reference/release
point will allow the aircraft to be flown in any direction as
long as it will pass over the reference/release point. These
points are a necessity when accomplishing a crosswind or

downwind deployment pattern. The correct method for
establishing e reference/release point is:
  a. Upon completion of the initial over the target WDI
  deployment, establish the impact location of the WDI.
  b. Pick out a spot that is an equal distance on the opposite
  side of the target as the WDI. This spot can be any
  readily identifiable feature, i.e. discolored ground,
  bushes, trees, etc.

NOTE: The JM should pass the reference/release point to
the pilot to assure that both are utilizing the same point of
reference
