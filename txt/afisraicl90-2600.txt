1. General.
     1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs). Compliance and
     Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs) are the primary lists used during the AF ISR
     Agency Inspector General’s (AF ISR Agency/IG) Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) visits to
     access unit compliance with established guidance governing each particular area of
     operations. C&SRL items are defined by the AF ISR Agency staff and based upon existing
     ―by-law‖ requirements, Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, Air
     Force (AF) and AF ISR Agency instructions, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or AF
     ISR Agency leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or
     performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment
     of required capabilities.
     1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO). Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO)
     represent the highest priority of inspection items and are fundamentally derived from the
     Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the fourteen missions areas defined in AFI
     90-201. Lower tier Core and General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to
     a CCO. It is the intent to examine, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the
     inspected unit, during the UCI visit. However, listed C&SRL items do not limit the scope of
     the inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
        1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An area or item where unit failure to
        comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
        serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are: Airman development
        programs, ability to deploy forces, ability to employ forces. CCOs are shown in BOLD
        AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
AFISRAICL90-2600 28 APRIL 2009                                                              3


      1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
      and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical."
      Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
      result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
      1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
      successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
      impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
      litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
