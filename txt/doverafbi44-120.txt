1. Roles.
   1.1. The 436th Medical Group Commander (436 MDG/CC) is the OPR for the Dover Air Force Base
   Drug Demand Reduction Program.
   1.2. The Demand Reduction Program Manager (DRPM) is responsible for all aspects of drug urinal-
   ysis testing under the 436 MDG/CC. The DRPM will oversee the routine random computer selection
   of a number of military members assigned to Dover Air Force Base (DAFB) for random drug testing
   based on a required monthly quota.
       1.2.1. The DRPM, in coordination with JA, will conduct annual Staff Assistance Visits to all
       units. See Attachment 8, Unit Trusted Agent Checklist.
   1.3. The Drug Testing Program Administrative Manager (DTP AM) will coordinate drug testing
   activities with the DRPM and other agencies as appropriate.
   1.4. Commanders are responsible for ensuring drug tests are conducted within their respective units.
   In addition to supporting the random urinalysis program, commanders are highly encouraged to use
   unit inspection, commander-directed, probable cause, and consent testing to ensure the security, mili-
   tary fitness, or good order and discipline of their units. Commanders will contact the 436th Staff Judge
   Advocate (436 AW/JA) when considering any of the aforementioned actions outside of random uri-
   nalysis.
       1.4.1. Medical group lab personnel are responsible for after hours drug testing. The Ambulance
       Response Team at 677-2604 or pager 735-6349 keeps a recall roster for medical lab personnel on
       call. In addition, the command post will also maintain a copy of the lab personnel on call and will
       provide the requesting officials contact information.
   1.5. The 436th Staff Judge Advocate, or authorized representative, will monitor the drug testing pro-
   gram's compliance with applicable rules, regulations, and policies; will advise commanders, the
   DRPM, DTPAM, and other officials and agencies regarding the legal aspects of the drug testing pro-
   gram; and will coordinate all requests for urinalysis drug testing other than routine random inspec-
   tions, to include unit inspections.
   1.6. "Trusted Agents" are commanders, first sergeants, and other designated individuals Staff Ser-
   geant (E-5) and above. The unit commander may designate an individual to be a Trusted Agent - the
   person designated must possess unquestionable integrity and trustworthiness. The designated Trusted
   Agent can provide his/her commander flexibility in meeting the objectives of the drug-testing pro-
   gram. The extent of the designated Trusted Agent's involvement with the drug testing program will be
   governed at the commander's discretion. (The duties of the Trusted Agent can include retrieving test-
   ing rosters, notifying personnel who have been selected to submit a specimen, and serving as an alter-
   nate point of contact in the absence of the commander and first sergeant). Trusted Agents must be
   appointed in writing, and each commander must forward the name and specific authorized duties of
   the Trusted Agent to the DTP AM before the Trusted Agent can assume his/her responsibilities. The
   DTP AM will provide and document mandatory annual training of the Trusted Agents.
   1.7. Medical Review Officer will review all positive notifications first, to rule out false positives.
   Once confirmed positive, the DDRPM or DTPAM will notify Office of Special Investigation (OSI). If
   OSI puts a hold close order, asking the Drug Testing Office to stop the notification process, then it is
   the responsibility of the OSI to notify both JA and the member's commander. If no hold close order is
4                                                                DOVERAFBI44-120 28 AUGUST 2005


    issued, then the DRPM or DTP AM will notify the commander, JA, and Alcohol Drug Abuse Preven-
    tion Treatment (ADAPT) offices.

2. Routine Random Selections and Notification.
    2.1. All military members assigned to the 436th Airlift Wing, activated members of the 512th Airlift
    Wing, Tenant Units and Detachments, regardless of their rank or position, will be subject to routine
    random selection for urinalysis in accordance with this instruction.
    2.2. On testing days, the DRPM or DTP AM will first obtain the computer-generated list of names of
    those who have been randomly selected to test (selectees) and then provide the names to the Trusted
    Agents. Regardless of the method by which they receive testing information (written or verbal),
    Trusted Agents must be discreet with names, dates, and the frequency of testing. If notification to the
    Trusted Agent is in writing, the Trusted Agent must safeguard the list and maintain its confidentiality.
    If a Trusted Agent reads his or her own name on the list, he/she must report to the testing site directly
    or as soon at the Drug Testing Office is open for operation.
    2.3. The Trusted Agent will notify each selectee, on an individual basis, both verbally and with a noti-
    fication letter (Attachment 2).
       2.3.1. NOTE: If the selectee is present for duty, the Trusted Agent will send the selectee to test on
       the date selected by the DRPM or DTP AM; testing is mandatory on this date. The hours of oper-
       ation for the Drug Testing Office are from 0730-1230 Monday through Friday. Testing should take
       place during the regular hours of operation for the Drug Testing Office. After-hours appointments
       can be scheduled in advance by contacting the Drug Demand Reduction Office at 677-2762.
       NOTE: In all cases, Trusted Agents must consider these hours when notifying selectees.
       "Appointment date" is defined as the same day the individual is selected for testing. NOTE: Test-
       ing is mandatory on the day of selection.
       2.3.2. If a selectee is not present for duty, the Trusted Agent will notify the DRPM or DTP AM no
       later than 1100 hrs of the selectee's duty status. In addition, the Trusted Agent will provide the
       DRPM or DTP AM (via fax or e-mail) with the projected makeup testing date for the selectee.
       Members are "not present for duty" when they are TDY, in leave status, on quarters, flying, or on
       crew rest. Additionally, non-duty days include rest days, break days, days given as compensatory
       time off, pass days given to award winners, and other authorized days away from the duty section.
       A selectee who is not present for duty for any of the aforementioned reasons must be tested on the
       first testing day after his/her return to duty. Trusted Agents are required to keep a roster of individ-
       uals who are selected for testing and not available for testing on their appointed day. Trusted
       Agents will ensure that members who return to duty are notified as soon as testing is possible.
       Trusted Agents will coordinate closely with the DRPM or DTP AM to ensure these selectees are
       tested.
       2.3.3. When a flight crew member is selected for testing, but the testing will adversely affect a
       mission, the Trusted Agent will not notify the crew member of his/her selection. The Trusted
       Agent will report the crew member is "performing flight duties." Flight duties include crew rest,
       preflight, the mission, post-flight duties, and post-mission crew rest. The Trusted Agent will wait
       for the first available testing day when the mission and crew rest permit, and then notify the crew
       member of the requirement to report for testing. The DRPM or DTPAM must be notified of the
       adjusted appointment date.
DOVERAFBI44-120 28 AUGUST 2005                                                                             5


      2.3.4. Selectees who are shift workers or who routinely work alternative duty weeks with "week-
      ends" during the regular duty week must be tested on the first available testing day upon return to
      duty. Commanders and/or first sergeants will coordinate such activities with the DRPM or DTP
      AM to ensure testing of these individuals. Trusted Agents must not notify selectees before the
      Drug Testing Office is open for operation.
      2.3.5. If a selectee has PCA'd to another unit, the Trusted Agent will inform the gaining unit's
      Trusted Agent, so the member's name can be added to the gaining unit's list and the member can
      be tested. Trusted Agents should document this communication and notify the DRPM or DTP AM
      via e-mail or hard copy letter.
   2.4. Each selectee must report to his/her commander's support staff or designated location immedi-
   ately after the Trusted Agent has directed him/her to do so. When the selectee reports, the Trusted
   Agent will serve the selectee with a commander's letter, directing the selectee to sign the letter, and
   note the date and time of notification. The Trusted Agent's signature must be an original, but the com-
   mander's signature can be photocopied (unless the commander is acting as the Trusted Agent for the
   selectee).
   2.5. The selectee must report directly to the testing site upon notification and present a valid military
   identification card (ID). If the ID is damaged, unreadable or not presented, the selectee's first sergeant
   or supervisor will escort him/her to the MPF to obtain a new valid ID. At the testing site, the DRPM
   or DTP AM will sign the commander's letter and annotate the time of the selectee's arrival. The
   selectee must remain at the testing site until he/she has given a valid sample. Upon providing a sam-
   ple, the selectee will report back to the Trusted Agent and return the completed notification letter.
   Selectees who fail to report directly for testing will be considered for administrative or disciplinary
   action. If a selectee reports for testing more than two hours after notification, the DRPM or DTP AM
   will generate a late for testing letter and forward it to the 436 A W/JA and the selectee's commander.

3. Observers.
   3.1. The Drug Abuse Testing Program is designed to deter the illegal use of controlled substances.
   The urinalysis collection observer detail is established to directly support the initial process manage-
   ment integrity of the urinalysis inspection testing.
   3.2. The 436 A W Command Chief is responsible for designating the units who will choose personnel
   to serve as drug testing observers. Observers should be Staff Sergeants (E-5) thru Senior Master Ser-
   geants (E-8) and Second Lieutenant (0-1) thru Captain (0-3). This is a six person (primary and alter-
   nate) monthly tasking. This detail roster is done on a six month rotating schedule. Monthly personnel
   requirements are as follows:


    GRADE                               GENDER                               NUMBER REQUIRED
    SSgt-SMSgt & 2Lt-Capt               Female                               2 (PRI {I} & AL T {I})
    SSgt-SMSgt & 2Lt-Capt               Male                                 4 (PRI {2} & ALT {2})

   3.3. Detailed units will provide the names of those individuals selected for this detail to the Drug
   Demand Reduction office, either via telephone at extension 2612 or email, as soon as possible but not
   less than 15 days prior to the assigned detail date.
6                                                               DOVERAFBI44-120 28 AUGUST 2005


    3.4. In the event a unit has no available NCOs to perform observer duties, the unit commander may
    appoint a member in the grade of Senior Airman (E-4), but only with concurrence of 436 AW/JA. Any
    unit considering the limited use of Senior Airman (E-4) or below will provide 436 AW/JA with a jus-
    tification as to why observer duties cannot be performed by NCOs. If concurrence is granted by 436
    AW/JA, the letter will be forwarded to the DRPM.
    3.5. Units tasked with this detail will ensure personnel selected for this detail are aware that they may
    be notified to report for this detail at any time, day, night, or weekends. Do not schedule personnel
    who have firm TDY commitments or long term leave requested. If primary personnel are unavailable
    after selection, the unit will provide an alternate. Both primary and alternate personnel will be
    required to attend training. Detailed personnel cannot observe and test in the same session.
       3.5.1. The observers selected must meet the following criteria:
           3.5.1.1. Must be a Staff Sergeant (E-5) or above.
           3.5.1.2. Must have a minimum of six months retain ability on station.
           3.5.1.3. Must not have an Unfavorable Information File (UIF), have or be pending action
           under Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
           3.5.1.4. Must not have received letter of reprimand or similar administrative action specifi-
           cally for misconduct involving dishonesty (such as a false official statement), fraud, or drug
           abuse only.
           3.5.1.5. Must be of character credible for possible court-martial testimony.

4. Unit Sweeps.
    4.1. DDRP's quarterly unit sweeps. Every quarter the DDRP office will randomly select one squadron
    for urinalysis testing (unit sweep). That squadron's commander and/or first sergeant will be immedi-
    ately alerted by DDRP. The squadron commander and/or first sergeant will advise the DDRP which
    day of the quarter the squadron is to be tested. DDRP will randomly select a percentage of the squad-
    ron, not to exceed 200 members. The DDRP must randomly select at least 15% of the squadron. The
    list of randomly selected members will be generated no sooner than 0001 hours on the day of the unit
    sweep. The squadron commander and/or first sergeant will review the list of members, annotate each
    member's duty status, and return the list to DDRP. Members are "not present for duty" when they are
    TDY, in leave status, on quarters, flying, or on crew rest. Additionally, non-duty days include rest
    days, break days, days given as compensatory time off, pass days given to award winners, and other
    authorized days away from the duty section. Those members who are not present for duty on the day
    of the unit sweep must be tested upon return to duty. DDRP will track unavailable members and notify
    the first sergeant when those members need to be tested. Members who are present for duty will be
    tested at the beginning of the duty day. Squadron commanders and/or first sergeants will determine the
    reporting time for shift workers and mission essential members; however, testing is mandatory for
    these members on the day of the unit sweep. DDRP, in coordination with squadron commanders and/
    or first sergeants, will determine the appropriate facility location for testing.
       4.1.1. Observers used for unit sweeps will be selected from those who have been trained within
       the last year; observers from the squadron selected for testing will not be used.
    4.2. Unit sweeps upon request by squadron commanders. In addition to the quarterly unit sweeps ran-
    domly selected by DDRP, squadron commanders may request to have their entire squadron, a percent-
DOVERAFBI44-120 28 AUGUST 2005                                                                            7


   age of their squadron, or one or more flights of their squadron tested. If one or more flights are
   selected for testing, DDRP will randomly select the flights to be tested. Squadron commanders will
   send a written request to DDRP and JA simultaneously at least one week prior to the requested unit
   sweep date. See Attachment 3. The request will indicate the time/date of the requested unit sweep
   and the number of flights or percentage of personnel to be tested. The request letter must be signed by
   the squadron commander. If number of members to be tested exceeds 200, written requests must be
   received by DDRP at least two weeks prior to the date requested to ensure DDRP can obtain the req-
   uisite manpower. Once DDRP has confirmed facilities are available to perform the unit sweep as
   requested, DDRP will provide the list of members selected for testing to the first sergeant. If entire
   unit is to be tested, the first sergeant will provide the alpha roster to DDRP, indicating duty status of
   each member. The remainder of the process will continue as indicated in paragraph 4.1. above.
      4.2.1. All units that are tested at the squadron commander's request will remain eligible for selec-
      tion under the quarterly random selection process.

5. Dorm Sweeps.
   5.1. See Attachment 4. These guidelines apply to all active duty, Air Reserve Component and TDY
   personnel residing in permanent party and/or transient dormitories assigned to Dover AFB.

6. Weekend Testing.
   6.1. The weekend testing is designed to deter the illegal use of club drugs. The urinalysis Wing Com-
   mander's Trusted Agent detail is established to directly support the initial integrity of urinalysis
   inspection testing. The weekend drug testing Wing Commander's Trusted Agent is the Wing Com-
   mander's personal representative in delivering a written order to a military member to report for drug
   testing. The Wing Commander's Trusted Agent should be a field grade officer, preferably a com-
   mander, and will be responsible for oversight of the vehicle selection process, service of the written
   order upon members selected for testing, making determinations regarding personnel temporarily
   excused from testing for mission critical reasons, and coordinating with appropriate agencies (e.g.
   AW/JA, SFS) as circumstances require.
   6.2. The weekend random drug testing program will be conducted by means of random stops at all
   gates, including Eagle Heights and Eagle Meadows housing areas. SFS personnel will stop all vehi-
   cles entering the base, based on the Wing Commander's selection of dates, location, hours, and meth-
   odology of selecting vehicles (for example, every vehicle until the prescribed number is achieved) and
   direct them to the Trusted Agent, who will be located close at hand (the guard shack or adjacent park-
   ing lot). The Wing Commander's Trusted Agent identifies all occupants of the vehicle who are active
   duty personnel its resident tenant units, and serves the written order upon members selected for test-
   ing. Members have up to one hour, after notification, to report to Drug Testing.
   6.3. All active duty members randomly selected will be drug tested.

   A4.3.2. Inspection Day Actions.
18                                                              DOVERAFBI44-120 28 AUGUST 2005


        A4.3.2.1. Two and one half hours before the inspection time, First Sergeants are notified via recall
        from A W/CCC. (President of the First Sergeant Councilor senior First Sergeant will be notified
        first, who in turn will notify senior First Sergeant for each Group, who will then continue the recall
        within their groups.)
        A4.3.2.2. First Sergeants will recall the designated amount of unit Senior NCOs, and have them
        report to the rally point 45 minutes prior to inspection start time. First Sergeants will brief them
        not to disclose any information and notify them of uniform and/or special equipment require-
        ments.
        A4.3.2.3. As directed by the AW/CCC, First Sergeants will assign inspectors to tasks and posi-
        tions around the dorm building in question as recalled personnel arrive and sign in, then conduct
        appropriate training for each position.
        A4.3.2.4. Thirty minutes prior to the inspection, briefings will be held at the designated rally point
        with the help of visual aids (as appropriate) including dorm floor plan, drug information and drug
        paraphernalia displays. Briefings from SJA, SFS, AW/CCC, and DDRPM will explain overall and
        individual expectations.
     A4.3.3. Inspection Time Actions.
        A4.3.3.1. Inspectors will depart for the designated dorm at the same time, caution must be used so
        residents are not alerted of the inspection before "GO" signal is given. Senior NCOs assigned to
        "over watch" positions must take their places first to monitor all exits and windows.
        A4.3.3.2. Inspection teams (two Senior NCOs) and First Sergeants (one per section) will move
        into predestinated assigned sections. When the "GO" signal is given, every effort will be made to
        alert each room simultaneously. If this is not possible, as many rooms as possible will be notified
        at the same time and the remainder as quickly as possible thereafter. If no one answers the door
        immediately, the First Sergeant will use a master key to open the room. All occupants of each
        room must unlock all locked compartments, exit the room with ill Card, and stand-by near their
        room for further instructions.
        A4.3.3.3. Inspectors will take each resident's name, age, and room number, write it on the "Order
        to Provide Urine Sample" letter, give one copy to resident and maintain one copy. All Active Duty
        personnel in the room (including over night guests) will provide a urine sample for drug testing.
        Inspectors will accompany resident into dorm room and direct they unlock all secured compart-
        ments.
        A4.3.3.4. Residents will report to the designated room(s) dayroom with their "Order to Provide
        Urine Sample" letter (Attachment 6) and ID Card for specimen collection and remain there until

        room(s) to await their sponsor's release.
        A4.3.3.5. Inspection teams will enter each room, conduct a quick visual sweep then use the pro-
        vided checklist to inspect each room exactly the same. Attachment 5 is used as a guideline and
        not as an exhaustive listing of areas to be inspected. The parameters of the inspection will be
        briefed prior to the beginning of the inspection. Inspectors must ensure that all rooms are
        inspected in the same manner. If an inspector wishes to inspect an area not on the checklist he must

     stop; notify the First Sergeant in their section, the First Sergeant will notify appropriate personnel
     who will determine the appropriate next step (i.e. continue inspecting or have SFS take over).
     A4.3.3.6. In instances where a room is currently unoccupied, the First Sergeant will use the mas-
     ter key to enter the room to inspect. Inspectors also will cut off all locks on locked compartments
     if a key is unavailable. Inspectors must bring an adequate amount of locks to replace the ones cut
     off, and will re-secure the compartments before departing the dormitory.
     A4.3.3.7. Should urinalysis testing be directed for the MWH Inspection, any resident (and mili-
     tary guest) arriving during set-up or execution of the MWH Inspection will report to the DDRPM
     to sign-in and await their turn to provide a urine sample. If testing is not required, residents (and
     military guests) will report to the designated control center to sign in, and residents will then be
     escorted to their room to stand by for inspection of the room. Military guests will report to the des-
     ignated waiting room(s). Any non-military guests will report to the designated waiting room(s) to
     await release of their sponsor.
     A4.3.3.8. Inspectors or other competent authorities will, as appropriate, turn over to SFS for test-
     ing, any military member suspected of illegally consuming alcoholic beverages or any individual
     (military or otherwise) suspected of having driven under the influence of alcoholic beverages.
  A4.3.4. Post Inspection Action.
     A4.3.4.1. After a set (suite system set-up) of rooms is completed and the checklist is filled out for
     both rooms, the resident may return to his/her room if they have completed urine sample collec-
     tion, have been released by DDRPM, and all evidence and/or contraband has been collected from
     both rooms.
     A4.3.4.2. After all room inspections are complete, inspection personnel will rally at a point to be
     determined by MSG/CC for debriefing, paperwork and equipment turn-in.
     A4.3.4.3. Should contraband/illegal drugs/classified material/etc., be discovered in a room, the
     MSG/CC or authorized designee, in close coordination with the JA, may consider inspection of
     the resident's/military or non-military guest's privately owned vehicle (by hand and/or NDD
     Team).
