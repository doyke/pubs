USAFA and the USAF. It applies to all USAFA personnel including, but not limited to, Air
Force Academy Athletic Association (AFAAA) personnel, US Air Force Reserve (AFRC) and
Air National Guard (ANG) personnel, coaches, staff and athletes who are involved with the
preparation for, and participation in, a post-season football bowl game or intercollegiate post-
season contest. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office

1. USAFA Football Team Bowl Participation.
    1.1. Acceptance of Bowl Invitation.
       1.1.1. USAFA is a member of the Mountain West Conference (MWC) and, as such,
       USAFA is required to participate in scheduled conference athletic events. To participate
       in these events, USAFA is obligated to send athletic teams to away contest locations and
       to pay associated costs. The requirements and rules for participation in these events are
       established by the MWC and are binding on all MWC members. The MWC negotiates
       and executes bowl contracts, both with individual bowls and through the Bowl Alliance,
       and teams selected to participate are bound by those contracts. When a team is selected
       or invited to a bowl game, that acceptance is merely an acknowledgement of the
       obligation to participate. This acknowledgement is the same as the acknowledgement of
       obligations to play MWC regular season schedules issued by the MWC. T he
USAFAI24-102 30 AUGUST 2009                                                                  3


     acknowledgement (acceptance) of USAFA’s obligation to participate in a bowl game is
     not a procurement action requiring the approval of a contracting officer.
     1.1.2. The Director of Athletics (USAFA/AD) will brief the AFAAA Advisory Council,
     chaired by the NCAA Faculty Representative, on bow l invitations (including the
     applicable bowl operations manuals). T he final travel plan will be submitted to the
     AFAAA Advisory Council and approved by the Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CC).
  1.2. Mode of Travel . It is the policy of USAFA to travel by chartered aircraft because of
  the size of the USAFA contingent and the difficulty of making scheduled airline reservations
  during the holiday season.
     1.2.1. If airlift capability is available through the Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC),
     the Directorate of Athletics’ Chief of Football Operations (USAFA/ADSL) will
     coordinate with HQ AMC/A34YAB to secure the required aircraft. USAFA/AD will
     make every effort to provide advance notice of potential bowl sites and dates to
     HQ AMC to assist them in their planning process. Only authorized personnel will travel
     military air when transportation is provided by HQ AMC in accordance with AFI 24-101,
     Passenger Movement, and USAFAI 24-101, Airlift Support for USAF Academy
     Activities.
     1.2.2. If the MWC or the bowl provides charter airlift, the traveling contingent will use
     this chartered airlift and no procurement action by HQ AMC is required.
     1.2.3. HQ AMC, in coordination with USAFA/AD, will procure the necessary airlift
     support if more than one charter is required. The Vice Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CV)
     must approve the use of more than one charter or reliance on scheduled air carriers.
     1.2.4. When the team, coaching staff, and government personnel are required to be on
     location at the bowl site by a specific date prior to the bowl game, their travel
     requirements have priority in scheduling the charter. If a substantial number of official
     travel party members do not have to arrive when the team does, a cost comparison will
     determine whether it is more economical to take more than one charter or to rely on
     scheduled air carriers.
  1.3. Travel by the Official Travel Party and Reimbursement of Expenses.
     1.3.1. The official travel party includes football players and coaches, football support
     personnel (i.e., equipment managers, trainers, team physician, cadet video technicians),
     and USAFA and USAFA/AD personnel as outlined in USAFAI 24-103, Football Team
     Charter Aircraft Management.
     1.3.2. Football coaches, football support personnel, players, and cheerleaders will travel
     at AFAAA expense unless HQ USAFA/CV authorizes their travel by commercial air, and
     they are authorized to do so at appropriated fund expense. All travel arrangements will
     comply with applicable NCAA rules.
     1.3.3. All other members of the official travel party will travel under appropriated fund
     orders or at AFAAA expense. F unding to cover these travel expenses will be in
     accordance with Attachment 2 of this instruction. If a member of the official travel
     party is an active duty member, he (or) she must inform their CSS of their duty status
     (when they depart and immediately upon return from temporary duty [TDY] status).
4                                                            USAFAI24-102 30 AUGUST 2009


       1.3.4. All members of the official travel party are expected to travel to and from the bowl
       game using the chartered aircraft. Requests to travel by commercial air will be reviewed
       by USAFA/AD, and approved by HQ USAFA/CV.
       1.3.5. All members of the official party traveling in an appropriated fund status will pay
       for their charter seat in advance of travel. A paid receipt will be provided to the traveler
       by AFAAA for submission with their final travel settlement voucher.
       1.3.6. Members of the official travel party will be entitled to per diem to cover their
       meals; however, any meals provided as part of official bowl events will be identified as
       government-provided meals on their travel voucher. Members of the official travel party
       who are under contract with AFAAA will be reimbursed according to the terms of their
       contract.
       1.3.7. Military and civilian members of the official travel party below the grade of
       colonel (or civilian equivalent) are expected to share a room unless they are traveling
       with their spouse, gender considerations do not permit the sharing of a room or when a
       room with two beds is not available.
       1.3.8. All requests for additional rooms must be submitted 7 da ys prior to departure to
       ensure an accurate room count. These will be reviewed and approved by USAFA/AD or
       the Vice Director of Athletics (USAFA/ADV) after coordination with the Chief, Football
       Operations (USAFA/ADSL). Individuals requesting additional rooms must pay for these
       rooms at the time of the reservation, and they are responsible for all expenses incurred.
       1.3.9. Official travel party members traveling in an appropriated fund status will be
       individually responsible for checking out of the hotel and settling their hotel bill prior to
       departure.
       1.3.10. Official travel party members traveling in a nonappropriated fund status will be
       individually responsible for settling any charges to their room, other than the basic room
       charge, prior to departure.
       1.3.11. All members of the official travel party who are required to submit travel
       vouchers will do so within 5 duty days of their return to the USAFA.
    1.4. Travel by the Advance Party.
       1.4.1. Bowl arrangements normally require travel to the bowl game location by an
       advance party to prepare for the arrival of the official travel party. The advance party
       will consist of: the Chief, Football Operations (USAFA/ADSL); Head Equipment
       Manager (USAFA/ADSME); Athletic Ticket Manager (HUSAFA/ADET); Associate
       Athletic Director of External Affairs (USAFA/ADEM); and the Associate Athletic
       Director of Communications (USAFA/ADEC). The advance party is expected to make
       arrangements for hotel rooms, ground transportation, airport arrival requirements, meals,
       special events, practice location, ticket marketing, advance media events, and
       promotional events.
       1.4.2. The advance party will arrive at the bowl game location no s ooner than is
       necessary to prepare for the arrival of the official travel party and ensure that necessary
       arrangements have been made.
USAFAI24-102 30 AUGUST 2009                                                                                       5

        USAFA mission and are authorized appropriated funding. H owever, in the event
        appropriated funds are not available to fund this travel, AFAAA funds may be used at the
        approval of the AFAAA Advisory Council and the Superintendent. Transportation will
        be provided from Colorado Springs to the bowl game location and return to Colorado
        Springs. Itineraries will be developed in accordance with the Joint Federal Travel
        Regulation (JFTR) and will consider cadet morale, holiday vacation time lost, and
        economic factors.
        1.5.2. Lodging will be arranged by the Intercollegiate Logistics Office (USAFA/ADSL).
        All rooms will be double occupancy or greater except when gender considerations
        prevent double occupancy. C harges to rooms beyond the cost of the room itself (e.g.,
        movies, phone calls) are not reimbursable and will be the responsibility of the room
        occupants. Any such charges must be settled with the hotel prior to departure
        1.5.3. Cadets and related staff members will be reimbursed in accordance with applicable
        Joint Travel Regulations. T ravel vouchers must be submitted within 5 days following

       associations or foundations that provide support to USAFA athletics, parents and family
       members of players and coaches, season ticket holders, etc. These seats will be made

USAFAI24-102 30 AUGUST 2009                                                                     7


     1.7.5. The cost for any reimbursable seat on the charter aircraft will be established on a
     per capita basis (total cost of charter divided by number of seats). USAFA/ADSL will, in
     coordination with the Commercial Ticketing Office (CTO), determine current rates for
     airline tickets. If the prevailing industry rate is lower than the per capita cost, the
     Directorate of Athletics’ Associate Athletic Director for Resources (USAFA/ADF) may
     set a rate determined to be economically advantageous to AFAAA. All travel costs must
     be fully paid in advance of travel.
  1.8. Game Tickets.

     of game tickets. AFAAA will purchase these tickets and all tickets required for official
     travel party members. Official travel party members traveling on appropriated fund
     orders will reimburse AFAAA for the ticket provided to them. AFAAA will provide the
     following bowl game tickets:
        1.8.1.1. Six tickets to each football player and cheerleader (per NCAA rules).
        1.8.1.2. One ticket to each member of the official travel party who requires a ticket in
        order to attend the game. Any personnel in the official or authorized travel party who
        have a working credential to enter the stadium will not receive a ticket.
        1.8.1.3. One ticket each to the AOG CEO and President if traveling as guests of the

        game.
     1.8.2. A comprehensive marketing program will be developed and pursued to encourage
     good representation and attendance by USAFA fans and sell as many bowl game tickets
     as possible. U SAFA/ADEM will include distributions for promotional advertisement
     purposes. W hen further ticket sales are no longer practicable, HQ USAFA/CV may
     authorize distribution of remaining tickets at no cost. This distribution will be carried out
     in a manner to maximize attendance at the game. (NOTE: Members of the official travel
     party may purchase adjacent seats for spouses and family members. Otherwise, these
     seats will be sold to the general public. Under no circumstances will adjacent seating
     tickets be “reserved” for free distribution to official travel party members; they may only
     obtain free tickets under the same conditions and from the same distribution outlets as the
     general public; they will not be given any preferential treatment in the distribution of free
     tickets).

2. All Other Post-Season Contest Participation for USAFA Intercollegiate Sports.
   2.1. Acceptance of Post Season Contest Invitation. USAFA intercollegiate athletic teams
   belong to various conferences and are eligible to participate in conference and NCAA
   championships in representation of USAFA. T o participate in these events, USAFA is
   obligated to send athletic teams to away contest locations and may be required to pay
   associated costs. The requirements and rules for participation in these events are established
   by the conference and (or) NCAA and are binding on a ll conference members. T he
   conferences may negotiate and execute post-season contracts. When a team is selected or
   invited to a post-season contest, that acceptance is merely an acknowledgement of the
   obligation to participate, which arises out of membership in the NCAA or the various
   conferences. This acknowledgement is the same as the acknowledgement of obligations to
   play regular-season schedules issued by the conference. The acknowledgement (acceptance)
   of USAFA’s obligation to participate in a post-season contest is not a procurement action
   requiring the approval of a contracting officer.
   2.2. Mode of Travel . The athletic team will travel to the post-season competition by bus,
   charter aircraft or commercial airlines as scheduled by the team, conference or NCAA-
   designated travel agent.

      the Director of Athletics (USAFA/AD). Only mission essential changes will be made to
      the manifest less then 36 hour s prior to departure. T he team travel manifest is based
      upon team travel sizes identified in the USAFA/AD Operating Instruction (OI) 24-101,
      Intercollegiate Team Travel, and post-season NCAA directives (see Attachment 7 for an
      example manifest).
      2.2.2. USAFA/ADSL will coordinate travel arrangements based upon t he guidelines of
      the conference and (or) the NCAA. USAFA/ADSL will submit travel manifests as
      identified in AD OI 24-101 for lodging and transportation as applicable based on t he
      travel timeline. USAFA/ADSL will also accomplish orders based upon the travel
      manifest.

      2.3.1. The official travel party includes the athletes, coaches, support personnel,
