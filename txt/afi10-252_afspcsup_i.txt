                                             Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide guidance to understand and utilize
DRRS to meet reporting responsibilities. In compliance with Title 10 United States Code
(U.S.C.) Section 117, DRRS is intended to be the sole readiness reporting system for the
Department of Defense (DoD) in the future, and as such, DRRS is used by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant
Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Combat Support Agencies. DRRS establishes a
capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system for the DoD to measure
the readiness of military units to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense
(SecDef).
1.2. General. The initial authorization to develop the DRRS application came from DoDD
7730.65, which called for the establishment of a readiness assessment network to calculate the
capabilities and preparedness of military units to conduct wartime missions and other
contingencies. As a capabilities-based system, DRRS indicates what tasks a unit can
accomplish, based upon the mission(s) for which a unit was organized or designed. DRRS
provides this information on measured units at a specific point in time. This information
supports crisis planning, deliberate planning, and management responsibilities to organize, train,
and equip combat-ready forces for the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs). DRRS data will be
used as part of the Global Force Management and Adaptive Planning and Execution processes.
DRRS provides the CJCS and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) an assessment of unit
information to achieve adequate and feasible military responses to crisis situations. The Air
Force (AF) uses DRRS information in assessing readiness, determining budgetary allocation and
management action impacts on unit level readiness, answering congressional inquiries, analyzing
readiness trends, and supporting readiness decisions.
     1.2.1. DRRS will not be used as input for the performance appraisal of a unit or a unit
     commander. However, unit commanders are ultimately responsible for all unit data and
     readiness assessments that appear in the unit’s DRRS account.
     1.2.2. DRRS measurement criteria (Mission Essential Tasks (METs) / Mission Essential
     Task Lists (METLs)) are the basis for capabilities-based readiness reporting. Standard
     measurement criteria are necessary to provide similarly capable/trained units globally.
     Where units present unique capabilities above the standard measurement criterion,
     MAJCOMs may supplement the unit’s Core METL with additional METs and/or
     performance standards. Where units do not possess the full capability reflected in the
     standard measurement criterion, MAJCOMs may delete those METs and/or performance
     standards that do not apply from the unit’s Core METL. Unit commanders or their designated
     alternates, assess measurements against the unit’s mission to provide a realistic indication of
     the unit’s readiness with the intent of informing higher headquarters. It is critical that unit
     commanders identify those areas that are rated less than desired in order to promote and
     justify corrective action (including funding, personnel, and equipment allocations). A
     fundamental premise of DRRS reporting is integrity. Commanders must “tell it like it is” and
     not allow masking of deficiencies to affect their ability to provide capability or other
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         5


   readiness related information. Risk must be balanced with responsibility.          Effective
   management of unit resources requires accurate information at all levels.
   1.2.3. MAJCOMs may supplement this guidance. In the event of conflict between this AFI
   and MAJCOM Supplements or CCDR guidance, this instruction will take precedence.
1.3. References. All of the latest updates, training documents, checklists, and other references
can be obtained by contacting the HAF Operational Readiness Division (AF/A3O-IR).
1.3. (AFSPC)References. Unit requests for references will be channeled through their Wing or
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) DRRS POC, who in-turn will present the request to the AFSPC
SORTS Office (HQ AFSPC/A3OP).
1.4. DRRS Data Management. DRRS draws data from many authoritative data sources.
Unique AF data requirements, not currently covered by DRRS, should be forwarded to AF/A3O-
IR through MAJCOM Readiness Offices for submittal to the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD/P&R) for consideration and possible inclusion in
upcoming software releases.
1.5. DRRS Measured Units. All units with an AF Personnel Accounting Symbol will be
registered in the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) until such time as DRRS is
capable of entering Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) information directly. All units that are
required to report in SORTS will report on METL(s) in DRRS. Additionally, NAFs and
MAJCOMs will make an individual DRRS assessment. Wings and groups may report in DRRS
to include their own organic capabilities (i.e., wing staff agencies).
   1.5.1. DRRS measured units will assess their designed capabilities (Core) readiness in
   accordance with (IAW) their AF standardized unit/functional area Core METL provided in
   the Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL) – Core METL document (Secret Internet
   Protocol Router (SIPR) document). MAJCOMs/NAFs can select tasks from the AFUTL or
   Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) for use in their Core METL. DRRS measured units will
   assess readiness against Core, Named Operations (if applicable), and Top Priority Plans (if
   applicable). Measured unit DRRS assessments begin as soon as possible after a unit
   activates and continue until the unit is inactivated.
       1.5.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC Functional Area Managers (FAMs) will develop
       Functional METLs in coordination with HQ AFSPC/A3OP, utilizing the UJTL, AFUTL
       and/or through development of new METs for inclusion in the AFUTL. All Functional
       METLs will be approved by the HQ AFSPC/A3. All AFSPC DRRS measured units will
       report against their AFSPC approved Functional METLs.
       1.5.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Activating AFSPC DRRS measured units, and those newly
       identified to begin DRRS Enhanced Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS)
       reporting, will begin assessing within 72 hours of receipt of their AFSPC approved
       Functional METL or when directed by HAF or AFSPC.
   1.5.2. All DRRS measured units (Active, Guard, and Reserve) will complete MET/mission
   assessments to include performance standard(s) monthly, no later than (NLT) the 15th of
   each month, and will continuously monitor and report changes in the unit's Mission-readiness
   level and individual MET readiness; significant changes in the unit Mission assessment
   and/or MET readiness levels will be reported within 24 hours. Units will continue to report
 6                                              AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014


     in DRRS when committed to combat operations (i.e. located in a combat zone), when on
     Temporary Duty (TDY) for training, when involved in local training (base exercises, base
     inspections, etc.), or deployed.
     1.5.2. (AFSPC) All AFSPC DRRS measured units will complete their MET/mission
     assessments to include performance standards between the 1st and 15th of each month. If an
     urgent report was submitted after the 15th calendar day of the month, the unit is still required
     to submit a new monthly report between the 1st and 15th calendar day of the following
     month.
        1.5.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ FAMs/MET Points of Contact (POCs) will update their
        respective AFSPC DRRS ESORTS METs beginning on the 1st, with all METs updated
        no later than the 10th of each month, or within 24 hours of a significant change, and HQ
        AFSPC/A3OP will complete the overall AFSPC assessment for approval no later than the
        15th of each month. This timeline must be enforced in order for the MAJCOM to
        complete accurate and timely assessments.
1.6. DRRS Data Classification. MET assessment levels (i.e. Yes, Qualified Yes, and No),
mission assessment levels, and limiting factors are classified SECRET. The association of the
unit with its Operations Plan (OPLAN) tasking is normally classified at the level of classification
of the OPLAN. Classified material exceeding the classification of the DRRS Database
(SECRET) will not be entered into DRRS.
     1.6.1. Worksheets/briefing materials reflecting measured unit data will be given the same
     classification level as the material from which it was derived. Although sources used to
     compile a unit’s DRRS report may be unclassified, once compiled and associated with DRRS
     ratings, it becomes classified at the highest level associated with the data.
     1.6.2. Composite or aggregate data will be classified at the same or higher level as the
     highest classified component of data.
     1.6.3. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
     restating, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly
     developed material consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
     Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry forward to any newly created
     document the classification markings from the original source.
     1.6.4. Classification Authority.       The OSD DRRS database is classified SECRET.
     Information extracted from this database is classified by CJCSI 3401.02B, Chairman of the
     Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3150.02B, Global Status of Resources and Training
     System (GSORTS), or by the reporting organization (i.e., the Air Force). Information
     extracted from the database must contain derivative classification markings consistent with
     DoDM 5200.01, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information,
     except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
     contain exempted data. If no classification authority source exists, use CJCSM 3150.02 as
     the classification authority. Use "Derived From: CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of
     Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Declassify On: (date)” to mark material when
     this reference is used as classification guidance. The date of declassification is 10 years from
     the date of the original classification decision, unless the original classification authority
     otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           7


   declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original classification decision. The
   reporting headquarters will determine the downgrading of classified material on a case-by-
   case basis. If other sources direct a classification higher or for a longer period, list the
   classification guidance as the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.
   Information that is not Enhanced Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS) based
   and does not show a deficiency may still require classification through channels other than
   ESORTS. Unit and wing security managers and the Chief, Information Protection (wing or
   MAJCOM-level) should be consulted in these events. At a minimum, all classified
   documents will be properly marked with the overall classification on the top and bottom.
   Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be conspicuously
   marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the appropriate overall
   classification marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of the notebook, binder,
   folder, etc. (IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management).
       1.6.4.1. All working papers must contain highest overall classification, destroyed when
       no longer needed, and if kept more than 180 days, marked as a finished document.
       Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created in the preparation of
       finished documents and material. This is IAW AFI 31-401.
   1.6.5. Downgrading Authority. Downgrading of DRRS data and aggregate information will
   be determined by the reporting headquarters IAW CJCSI 3401.02B. The authority resides
   with Headquarters Air Force, AF/A3/5, Director of Operations, Plans, and Requirements.
   AF/A3/5 will review classified ESORTS data and ascertain whether the classification level
   still applies and will determine the downgrading of classified material on a case-by-case
   basis.
1.7. Releasing DRRS Data to Outside Agencies. CJCSI 5714.01D, Policy for the Release of
Joint Information governs the release of DRRS information. To protect against unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive information, requests for DRRS access from non-DoD agencies will be
forwarded to AF/A3O-IR for submission to the Joint Staff (JS). Authorized holders of AF
DRRS data can release it only to military components with a valid need-to-know and appropriate
clearance. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated through AF/A3O-IR.
   1.7.1. Specific policies for auditors, Congress, and the general public: Auditors and
   inspectors of the General Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of the Inspector
   General of the Department of Defense (OIG-DoD) possess legal authority under 31 U.S.C.
   §716, Availability of Information and Inspection of Records, and Public Law 95-452,
   Inspector General Act of 1978, codified at 5 App. U.S.C., to access DRRS data for specified
   purposes. Release data to GAO and OIG-DoD auditors and inspectors in accordance with
   DoDD 7650.01, GAO and Comptroller General Access to Records and DoDI 7050.3, Access
   to Records and Information by the DoD IG. Only the President and SecDef can deny final
   access. Refer denial proposals to AF/A3O-IR for submission to the JS.
       1.7.1.1. Release data to Congress and its committees, staff, and investigators according

         2.1.9.1.1. Designate a minimum of one and a maximum of three alternates for the UC
         role for their unit. Only the commander or the designated alternate(s) may approve
         unit DRRS mission readiness assessments. Only individuals assigned to the unit may
         be designated as alternate UCs. Designated alternates will have their own UC
         account; shared DRRS accounts are not allowed and are a security violation.
         Commander designees will be O-1 or above or GS-7 or above. If a unit has only one
         O-1 or above (i.e., one officer) / GS-7 or above, then the commander designee can be
         an E-7 or above. UCs must complete HAF-approved DRRS training within 90 days
         of appointment or at the first opportunity if a Mobile Training Team course is
         available.
         2.1.9.1.1. (AFSPC) Commander designees will be O-3 or above, E-7 or above or
         GS-10 or above.
         2.1.9.1.2. Appoint and ensure that a minimum of two, but no more than six, UAs are
         trained to perform DRRS duties to ensure continuous coverage by a trained UA while
         others are on leave, TDY, or deployed.
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       17


        2.1.9.1.3. Approve unit mission assessment(s) to include performance standard(s)
        monthly, NLT the 15th of each month; significant changes in the unit mission
        assessments will be approved within 24 hours.
        2.1.9.1.3. (AFSPC) Ensure unit mission assessment(s) in DRRS are accomplished
        monthly, submitted between the 1st and 15th calendar day of each month. If an
        urgent report was submitted after the 15th calendar day of the month, the unit is still
        required to submit a new monthly report between the 1st and 15th calendar day of the
        following month.
        2.1.9.1.4. Upon assumption of command, review the unit’s Core METL to ensure it
        adequately reflects the unit’s ability to undertake the mission(s) for which the unit
        was organized or designed, and review the unit’s Named Operation(s) (if applicable)
        and Top Priority Plan(s) (if applicable) METL(s) to ensure they reflect the unit’s
        assigned missions. Recommend completing this review in conjunction with the AFI
        10-201, Status of Resources and Training System mandated DOC Statement review.
           2.1.9.1.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Measured unit commanders and their alternates
           will review, sign and date their unit’s Core METL NLT 30 days after assumption
           of command.        Signature does not acknowledge agreement/disagreement.
           Signature indicates the review has been accomplished and the commander and
           their designated alternates understand the reporting requirements in the Core
           METL. The signed METL is to be maintained by both the Wing DRRS POC and
           each unit with a Core METL.
        2.1.9.1.5. Review data and remarks for quality and assign a mission readiness
        assessment. Commanders will cross-check their SORTS and DRRS assessments. If
        the assessments are not aligned (e.g., C-4 in SORTS and ‘Y’ for a DRRS Core
        mission assessment), then provide an explanatory remark (IAW paragraph 3.6) in the
        applicable DRRS mission assessment. Explain readiness deficiencies in layman’s
        terms capturing the operational impacts and address planned corrective actions with
        realistic resolution date(s).
        2.1.9.1.5. (AFSPC) When completing the unit’s mission readiness assessment, unit
        commanders will provide a summation of all the shortfalls affecting the unit’s
        mission. This summary will include fully explaining the unit’s shortfalls, identifying
        the mission impact of those shortfalls, identifying any ESORTS/Global SORTS
        (GSORTS) disconnects tied to the shortfalls and provide realistic get better dates and
        get well dates, as applicable. This mission readiness assessment will also include a
        3/6/12 month forecast formatted as follows:
           2.1.9.1.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) 3 month forecast/(next anticipated rating)/(MET #
           (s) driving anticipated change)/forecast comments (bullets describing reasons for
           next anticipated rating change or “No Expected Problems”). Units will only
           submit one 3/6/12 month Forecast remark in the commander’s overall assessment
           remarks section and will not include a forecast remark for each MET.
               2.1.9.1.5.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Example Format: 3 month forecast/Q/Air
               Force Operational (AFOP) 1.1.4.9/personnel permanent change of station
               (PCS) with no replacements identified; 6 month forecast/Y/no expected

               problems;12 month forecast/Y/no expected problems.
        2.1.9.1.6. Continue to report MET/mission status during unit combat operations (i.e.
        located in a combat zone), TDYs, exercises, and deployments.
        2.1.9.1.7. Be responsive to Wing DRRS POC’s guidance and requests.
        2.1.9.1.8. (Added-AFSPC) All SORTS reporting units are required to provide up to
        five Top Readiness Concerns , in priority order, as applicable, no later than the 15th
        calendar day of each month. For GSORTS related readiness concerns, use the
        REASN remark in GSORTS. For non - SORTS related readiness concerns, use the
        Top Concerns Tab in DRRS. Follow remark guidance in AFI 10-252 DRRS,
        paragraphs 3.6.1.1. - 3.6.1.4.
     2.1.9.2. DRRS Unit Administrators (UAs) will:
        2.1.9.2.1. UAs must complete HAF-approved DRRS training within 90 days of
        appointment or at the first opportunity if a Mobile Training Team course is available.
        2.1.9.2.2. Ensure an appropriate number of DRRS UUs are associated with each task
        through the Manage Office function. UUs should be the SME for the task for which
        they are POC.
        2.1.9.2.3. Be responsive to Wing DRRS POC’s guidance and requests.
        2.1.9.2.4. Ensure assigned UUs receive HAF-approved training. Maintain training
        documentation for duration of appointment to position. MAJCOMs may supplement
        the HAF-approved training as required.
        2.1.9.2.5. Load the AF-standardized Core METL for their type unit/functional area as
        published in the AFUTL and as supplemented by the MAJCOM. Units are also
        responsible for creating, in coordination with the Wing DRRS POC, METL for all
        assigned Named Operations and Top Priority Plans.
        2.1.9.2.6. Conduct self-inspections on unit DRRS program. Self-inspections should
        be conducted a minimum of annually or more frequently if required by unit,
        wing/base, or MAJCOM. Follow unit or wing/base self-inspection schedule if one
        exists. Conduct self-inspections IAW AFI 90-201.
        2.1.9.2.7. Maintain unit DRRS program supporting documentation, i.e., appointment
        letters, training records (if applicable), current METL(s), etc., as required by
        MAJCOM or Wing DRRS POC. Maintain the supporting documentation IAW AFI
        33-322, Records Management Program.
        2.1.9.2.8. Make MET assessments monthly, NLT the 15th of each month, or within
        24 hours of a change that affects the units MET/mission readiness assessment. Make
        MET assessments informed by available resource data (i.e., SORTS) and/or observed
        performance. Provide supporting remarks explaining deficiencies in layman's terms
        capturing the operational impacts and addressing planned corrective actions with
        realistic resolution date(s). Review data and remarks for quality and accuracy.
        2.1.9.2.8. (AFSPC) Make unit mission assessment(s) in DRRS monthly, submitted
        between the 1st and 15th calendar day of each month. If an urgent report was
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          19


        submitted after the 15th calendar day of the month, the unit is still required to submit
        a new monthly report between the 1st and 15th calendar day of the following month.
     2.1.9.3. DRRS Unit Users (UUs) will:
        2.1.9.3.1. UUs must complete HAF-approved DRRS training within 90 days of
        appointment or at the first opportunity if a Mobile Training Team course is available.
        2.1.9.3.2. Make MET assessments monthly, NLT the 15th of each month, or within
        24 hours of a change that affects the units MET readiness assessment. Make MET
        assessments informed by available resource data (i.e., SORTS) and/or observed
        performance. Provide supporting remarks explaining deficiencies in layman's terms
        capturing the operational impacts and addressing planned corrective actions with
        realistic resolution date(s). Review data and remarks for quality and accuracy.

        mission impact of those shortfalls, any ESORTS/GSORTS disconnects tied to the
        shortfalls and provide realistic get better dates and get well dates, as applicable. If an
        urgent report was submitted after the 15th calendar day of the month, the unit is still
        required to submit a new monthly report between the 1st and 15th calendar day of the
        following month.
        2.1.9.3.3. Be responsive to UA’s guidance and requests.

                                           Chapter 3

                              ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General Rules. Unit’s MET/mission assessments will require close integration of
OPLANs, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), FAM expertise, training, evaluations, inspections,
exercises, and those SMEs responsible for different aspects of a unit’s readiness. The MET OPRs
draw on their subject matter expertise, and the unit's ability to perform the task when making
MET readiness assessments. Commanders should use the MET readiness assessments and
consider the results of training, evaluations, inspections, exercises, and their SORTS and Air and
Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Unit Type Code Reporting Tool (ART) reports to support
their mission assessment(s). The capabilities-based approach identifies the responsibilities of
individuals and organizations in the form of tasks, conditions, and performance standards. The
assessment of resulting performance is captured in ESORTS in the form of MET/mission
assessments to validate AF and Joint training and indicate unit task/mission readiness.
Commanders will cross-check their SORTS and DRRS assessments. SORTS complements and
informs MET and mission area readiness assessments in DRRS. If the assessments are not
aligned (e.g., C-4 in SORTS and ‘Y’ for a DRRS Core mission assessment), then provide an
explanatory remark in the applicable DRRS mission assessment, and explain the reason for the
difference in layman’s terms IAW paragraph 3.6.
3.2. Task Readiness Assessments. Commanders are responsible for assessing their unit’s
ability to accomplish the tasks (METs) to prescribed performance standards under specified
conditions. This assessment should be informed by observed performance, resource availability
(i.e., SORTS), and military experience and judgment. However, when observed performance is
not recent, assessed performance will be used. The currency of observed performance depends
on many factors: complexity of tasks, the type of exercise, size, unit personnel changeover,
experience, etc. The ultimate authority is the commander.
   3.2.1. All assessments will be documented in accordance with the following definitions:
       3.2.1.1. "Yes" (Y/Green):     Unit can accomplish task to established standard(s) and
       condition(s).
       3.2.1.2. “Qualified Yes" (Q/Yellow): Unit can accomplish most of the task to
       standard(s) under most conditions. The specific standard(s) and conditions that cannot be
       met as well as shortfalls or issues impacting the unit's ability to accomplish the task must
       be clearly detailed in the MET assessment.
       3.2.1.3. "No" (N/Red): Unit is unable to accomplish the task to prescribed standard(s)
       and condition(s) at this time.
   3.2.2. Commanders will assess a current status and an anticipated status.
   3.2.3. Remarks are mandatory whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a
   "Yes" assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
3.3. Staff Supporting Tasks, Subordinate Unit Tasks, and Command-Linked Tasks. As
applicable, unit commanders/MAJCOMs/FAMs may use assessments of their subordinate units,
internal staffs, or other pre-designated external supporting organizations to inform their own
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       21


MET assessments. This information is derived from staff supporting tasks, subordinate unit
tasks, and command-linked tasks.
   3.3.1. A staff supporting task is performed by the organization’s internal staff elements.
   OPRs will work with staff elements in determining appropriate tasks, conditions, and
   standards. Staff supporting task OPRs are assigned. As with METs, these tasks should
   strongly connect to the mission – they should not be routine activities, such as keeping the
   facility clean, maintaining computers, conducting training (unless one of these is the
   organization’s mission), etc.
   3.3.2. A subordinate unit task is performed by organizations one level below a MET owner
   and in the same chain of command. The MET owner identifies subordinate unit task(s) from
   the linked unit’s existing METL that are essential to accomplishing the MET. If the
   appropriate task, conditions, and standards cannot be identified, the higher headquarters
   coordinates with the subordinate unit headquarters to determine how to identify the required
   support.
   3.3.3. A command-linked task is performed by organizations external to the MET owner’s
   chain of command. The MET owners identify command-linked tasks directly from the
   linked unit’s existing METL. If the appropriate task, conditions, and standards cannot be
   identified, the linking organization coordinates directly with the service component /
   headquarters or agency to identify the required support. Command linking is normally done
   across equivalent levels of command (e.g., an operational unit linking to maintenance unit
   MET(s)). However, by exception, command linking can be made at different levels provided
   both organizations agree and the linking is coordinated.
   3.3.4. The MET assessment guidelines with regard to staff-supporting, subordinate-unit, and
   command-linked tasks, in addition to MET performance standards assessment, are as
   follows:
       3.3.4.1. “Yes” (Y/Green): If the majority of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as
       "Y," and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Q," then the MET assessment
       should be "Y."
       3.3.4.2. “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow): If the majority of the MET supporting tasks are
       assessed as "Q," and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Y," then the MET
       assessment should be "Q."
       3.3.4.3. “No” (N/Red): If any of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as “No,” then
       the commander must make a judgment as to whether the mission objectives can still be
       accomplished. If the commander makes a subjective upgrade for an overall mission
       assessment to anything other than “No,” the commander will clearly explain how the
       mission will be accomplished despite the inability to accomplish the MET(s) and any
       mitigation actions that will be taken.
       3.3.4.4. The above guidelines are subject to unit commander's judgment/weighting of
       supporting tasks.
3.4. Mission Assessment Categories. All measured units will accomplish a mission
assessment(s) by reporting their ability to accomplish METs and their associated conditions and
standards – referred to as a METL. METLs provide the means for a commander to assess the
 22                                           AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014


organizations ability to conduct their designed and assigned mission(s) with a focus on the
capabilities units provide to CCMDs. The assessment of resources (e.g., SORTS) informs
METL assessments, and commanders (if their unit assesses in SORTS) will consider the
resources they report in SORTS in the readiness assessment of their Core METL/mission. There
are three categories of mission assessments that are used to reflect the unit’s capabilities: Core,
Named Operations, and Top Priority Plans (Level IV). The Core category relates to the
“designed” mission of the unit, while the Named Operations and Top Priority Plans categories
relate to the “assigned” mission(s) of the unit. Mission assessments inform both joint and Air
Force organizations and provide commanders readiness information and status.
   3.4.1. Core METL. A Core METL consists of the fundamental capabilities for which a unit
   was organized and designed. AF/A3O-IR maintains a standardized list of Core METL by
   unit type. Core METLs are part of the AFUTL document and can be accessed on SIPR
   (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx).          All
   measured units will assess a Core METL. Commanders will consider all unit-assigned
   resources (deployed and in-garrison) as available when assessing METs for the Core METL.
   For civilian personnel, use AFI 10-201 rules to determine if civilian personnel should be
   included in the the Core METL. If the personnel are included for SORTS, then include them
   for Core METL assessments.
       3.4.1.1. Augmenting Core METL. Units will use the Core METL within the latest
       approved AFUTL.
           3.4.1.1.1. In special cases, a unit with an approved Core METL may provide a
           specialized capability not common to this type of unit. When this is the case, the
           MAJCOM, in coordination with the FAM (as identified in Attachment 3), will
           authorize the unit to add these specific tasks and/or task performance standards to the
           unit’s Core METL.          The MAJCOM operations readiness office will keep
           documentation of these Core METL modifications to include original date of
           approval and coordination with the FAM (as identified in Attachment 3).
           3.4.1.1.2. In other cases, a unit may not provide a capability that other like-type units
           provide. When this is the case, the MAJCOM, in coordination with the FAM (as
           identified in Attachment 3), will authorize the unit to delete these specific tasks
           and/or task performance standards from the unit’s Core METL. The MAJCOM
           operations readiness office will keep documentation of these Core METL
           modifications to include original date of approval and coordination with the FAM (as
           identified in Attachment 3).
       3.4.1.2. If the AFUTL does not contain a Core METL for a unit, then the unit will notify
       the MAJCOM readiness office. The MAJCOM operations readiness office will elevate
       this to AF/A3O-IR who will determine the approprate FAM (HAF or MAJCOM) to
       develop a Core METL.
       3.4.1.3. If a unit commander believes the unit’s AF-standard Core METL should be
       updated, then contact the MAJCOM readiness office who will elevate this to AF/A3O-IR.
   3.4.2. Named Operations METL. Named Operations are those operations designated by the
   President, Secretary of Defense, and/or the Joint Chiefs of Staff (e.g., Operation Enduring
   Freedom (OEF) and Operation Noble Eagle (ONE)). Measured units will assess a Named
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         23


  Operation METL for a full or partial unit deployment. However, units will only report
  against a Named Operation(s) if 5% or more of the unit is preparing to deploy or is deployed.
  Reporting is required no later than 120 calendar days prior to the deployment or upon receipt
  of an appropriate order -- Prepare to Deploy Order (PTDO), Deployment Order (DEPORD),
  notification from the Installation Deployment Officer, etc. Named Operation reporting
  continues until redeployment or release from orders for the assigned mission. While a
  Named Operation normally requires a unit to deploy away from its home station, Named
  Operation requirements can also apply to assigned missions which can be executed by a unit
  from its home station (e.g., ONE). When reporting against a Named Operation, a
  commander will only assess resources organic to the unit, and the assessment will only
  consider those assets directly supporting the Named Operation. For example, a unit might
  have 24 aircraft and 36 crews, but only 6 aircraft and 9 crews are supporting a Named
  Operation. The commander’s assessment would be for the 6 aircraft and 9 crews, and their
  ability to execute the Named Operation. If a unit uses loaned equipment, aircraft and/or
  personnel to complete a Named Operation, then the unit is meeting its Named Operation
  requirement. However, any impact to the unit’s ability to meet its full-spectrum mission(s)
  (i.e., the situation that created the need for loaned resources) should be addressed via the
  Core METL assessment. If a unit has resources preparing for a specific Named Operation in
  addition to other resources already deployed for the same Named Operation, that unit will
  assess the assets that are deployed, accompanied by commander’s remarks to show an
  assessment(s) of the resources preparing to deploy.
     3.4.2.1. A Named Operation METL assessment will not necessarily correlate with a
     unit’s Core METL assessment. Commanders must analyze the mission orders and then
     specify which of the METs in the unit’s Core METL will be assessed as part of the
     Named Operation METL. The Wing DRRS POC will assist units as required. A unit can
     assess all of the METs in the Core METL or a portion of the METs in the Core METL as
     the Named Operation METL. More information regarding METL development can be
     found in the AFUTL document which can be accessed on SIPR
     (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx).
  3.4.3. Top Priority Plans METL. Top Priority Plan assessments are only required for Level
  IV plans as designated in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. Level IV plans are those with
  detailed Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD). Any unit assigned or sourced
  at execution to a Level IV plan will assess their ability to provide capabilities tasked in the
  plan and to execute the plan. Reporting of the Top Priority Plan continues until released
  from the Level IV plan.
     3.4.3.1. A Top Priority Plan mission assessment will not necessarily correlate with a
     unit’s Core mission assessment. Commanders must analyze the plan, and then specify
     which of the METs in the unit’s Core METL will be assessed as part of the plan’s METL.
     The Wing DRRS POC will assist units as required. A unit can assess all of the METs in
     the Core METL or a portion of the METs in the Core METL as the Top Priority Plan
     METL. More information regarding METL development can be found in the AFUTL
     document          which         can        be        accessed           on        SIPR
     (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx).
     3.4.3.2. When assessing Top Priority Plans, units will count deployed assets (or those
     already committed/engaged at home station) as unavailable (e.g., unit personnel/aircraft
 24                                           AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014


       supporting Operation Noble Eagle from home station, would be unavailable for a Top
       Priority Plan assessment). If a Top Priority Plan assessment is degraded (i.e., Q or N)
       due in part or in full to deployed assets, then commanders will clearly annotate this in the
       Top Priority Plan remark. In this case, personnel can review the unit’s Core METL
       assessment to get an overall readiness picture of the unit. Resources at exercises /
       training events will be counted as available.
3.5. Mission Assessments. Mission assessments will also be based on the "Yes," "Qualified
Yes," or "No" basis, but will consider the mission as a whole. As such, this assessment should
reflect the commander’s military experience and judgment on all the tasks, MET assessments,
and factors that affect the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements.
   3.5.1. The following guidelines will be used to ensure consistent mission assessments:
       3.5.1.1. “Yes” (Y/Green): If the majority (51 percent) of the METs are assessed as
       “Yes,” and the remaining METs are assessed as “Qualified Yes,” then the overall
       assessment should be “Yes.”
       3.5.1.2. “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow): If the majority (51 percent) of the METs are
       assessed as “Qualified Yes,” and the remaining METs are assessed as “Yes,” then the
       overall mission assessment should be “Qualified Yes.”
       3.5.1.3. “No” (N/Red): If any of the METs are assessed as “No,” then the commander
       must make a judgment as to whether the mission objectives can still be accomplished. If
       the commander makes a subjective upgrade for an overall mission assessment to anything
       other than “No,” the commander will clearly explain how the mission will be
       accomplished despite the inability to accomplish the MET(s) and any mitigation actions
       that will be taken.
   3.5.2. Commanders will assess current status and a projected status for each METL being
   assessed.
   3.5.3. Remarks are mandatory whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a
   "Yes" assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
   3.5.4. The "Yes”, "Qualified Yes", and "No" guidelines should guide the mission assessment
   decision; however, they are not a substitute for commander judgment and experience.
3.6. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of readiness
assessments and are required whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a "Yes"
assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
   3.6.1. Commanders will use the following format whenever “Q” and “N” assessments are
   used, and remarks for tasks will be formatted: issue, impact, fix, and get well date. In
   addition, if MAJCOMs/NAFs, etc. use the “Top Concerns” tab in DRRS follow this guidance
   for the remarks.
       3.6.1.1. Issue: Provide a thorough explanation of the issue using layman's terms. If the
       issue is resource-centric; e.g., lack of equipment on-hand, provide all appropriate details,
       such as part numbers, NSNs, nomenclature, quantity authorized, quantity on-hand,
       quantity on-order, expected delivery date, etc. In addition, include a remark date.
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           25


       3.6.1.2. Impact: Describe the mission impact providing a risk assessment when
       appropriate. Provide a layman's explanation of the mission impact.
       3.6.1.3. Fix: Identify those actions being taken or assistance needed to improve the unit's
       readiness. Identify previously requested assistance and remedial actions in progress;
       explain unit, wing, or MAJCOM actions taken to resolve shortfalls.
       3.6.1.4. Get Well Date (GWD): Using the date from the "Anticipated Change" section
       of the task or mission assessment as a reference, provide a realistic GWD for each
       remark.
       3.6.1.5. (Added-AFSPC) Measured unit commanders will provide a 3/6/12 Month
       Forecast remark at the end of the overall Commanders’ Overall assessment remark for
       their ESORTS assessment. The remark will forecast the assessment rating at 3, 6 and 12-
       month points in time from the date of the report being submitted. The forecast remark
       will be entered in the following example format:
          3.6.1.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) 3 month forecast/Q/AFOP 1.1.4.9/personnel permanent
          change of station (PCS) with no replacements identified; 6 month forecast/Y/no
          expected problems; 12 month forecast/Y/no expected problems.
   3.6.2. Use remarks to provide supporting information concerning unit assessments.
   3.6.2. (AFSPC) For each MET within a unit’s METL, provide supporting remarks fully
   explaining unit shortfalls, the mission impact of those shortfalls, any ESORTS/GSORTS
   disconnects tied to the shortfalls and provide realistic get better dates and get well dates, as
   applicable for each shortfall identified in the remark.
   3.6.3. Remarks must be checked and verified for accuracy each time a unit readiness
   assessment is approved. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the
   details needed. They must contain a detailed functional explanation of the situation to
   provide details needed for functional management. Revise content as necessary to maintain
   validity. Remove remarks that no longer apply.
       3.6.3.1. As DRRS is dynamic and remarks may change from assessment to assessment,
       do not refer to previous assessments. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks.
       Each remark must stand on its own content.
       3.6.3.2. To eliminate confusion by DRRS customers, abbreviations should not be used,
       and acronyms must be spelled out once in each remark.
       3.6.3.3. Provide the classification for each remark, and ensure every paragraph is
       marked.
3.7. Direction for units with a mission change. When a unit is transitioning to another
mission, the unit will continue to assess its current METL until mission change is reflected in
SORTS (i.e., C-5 rules) per policy in AFI 10-201. Core METL will be developed and
coordinated in advance, if possible, by the POC listed in Attachment 3 and included in the next
update of the AFUTL by AF/A3O-IR. If a POC is not identified in Attachment 3, then AF/A3O-
IR will assign a POC to develop the METL.

3.8. Total Force Integration (TFI). The TFI units are critical to Air Force operations. They
are organizational constructs that functionally integrate units from the regular Air Force, Air
National Guard, and Air Force Reserve.
   3.8.1. Each unit in the association (host and associate) will independently assess their
   readiness in DRRS. The host and associate will each assess a Core METL. In some cases, a
   host or associate may not provide a capability that other like type units provide. In this case,
   MAJCOMs (IAW paragraph 3.4.1.1.) may delete that MET from that specific host or
   associate Core METL. The overall status of a combined host and associate TFI unit can be
   determined by reviewing DRRS assessments from both units and confirming this assessment
   through communication with the associated unit commanders.
   3.8.2. Wings with Operational Control (OPCON) of associate units will monitor and ensure
   associate unit(s) load appropriate Core METL in the associate unit's DRRS account and
   assess their mission readiness.

                                           Chapter 4

                                      METL GUIDANCE

4.1. NAF and MAJCOM Mission Assessments
   4.1.1. MAJCOMs and NAFs will assess a Core METL that covers their organize, train, and
   equip (OT & E) role.
   4.1.1. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC, 24 AF and 14 AF will assess their Core METLs between the
   1st and 15th calendar day of each month.
   4.1.2. AF component headquarters (C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs) will develop a Core METL,
   derived from CCMD JMETL(s), that includes the task(s) the AF provides in support of the
   CCMD JMETL. Components will have to do a mission analysis of the capabilities the AF
   provides to the CCMD and develop / report METL for Named Operation(s) and Top Priority
   Plan(s), as applicable. A component can assess all of the tasks in the Core METL or a
   portion of the tasks in the Core METL as the Named Operation(s) and Top Priority Plan(s)
   METL. Task(s) conditions and standards should be tailored to the specific Named Operation
   or Top Priority Plan. These METL(s) will generally consist of tasks at the Operational (OP)
   or Strategic Theater (ST) level, but can include tasks at other levels if necessary.
   4.1.3. The AFUTL-Core METL document (on SIPR) and CJCSM 3500.03C, Joint Training
   Manual for the Armed Forces of the United States contain guidance which can be applied to
   AF component, NAF, and MAJCOM METL building.
4.2. Installation METL.
   4.2.1. The Installation METL contains five METs: Airfield Operations; Munitions Supply,
   Storage, and Distribution; Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL); Unaccompanied Personnel
   Housing to include Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLFs); and Range Operations.
   Installations must submit a report annually or within 72 hours of a change as outlined below:
      4.2.1.1. A change in status resulting in a “No” assessment for any of the installation’s
      METs.
      4.2.1.2. New encroachment concerns or environmental impacts.
      4.2.1.3. Natural disasters affecting installation operations.
      4.2.1.4. Legislative changes impacting training capability.
   4.2.2. Don't assess tasks an installation does not perform. In these cases, the installation’s
   designated agent (see paragraph 4.2.3) will coordinate with the MAJCOM readiness office
   for approval to delete the non-applicable task. Once approval is received, the installation will
   invalidate the non-applicable task via Build METL.
   4.2.3. Wing commanders will name the Mission Support Group commander, Civil Engineer
   Squadron commander, or the organization that supports the installation and facilities as the
   designated agent to assess the installation mission for the UIC/installation (unit) registered in
   DRRS. Commanders will assess the ability of the installation to accomplish assigned tasks
   to standard(s) under specified conditions as documented in the AFUTL. The AFUTL can be
   accessed                                         on                                         SIPR
 28                                          AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014


   (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx). These
   assessments should be informed by performance measures, resource availability (i.e.,
   SORTS), and military experience/judgment.
   4.2.3. (AFSPC) Wing DRRS POCs will provide the HQ AFSPC/A3OP office with a copy
   of current appointment letters and will submit updates as changes occur.
   4.2.4. Installations with multiple MAJCOMs: Each MAJCOM will assess the capabilities
   they provide. The lead MAJCOM (i.e., base host) will make an overall assessment for the
   base.
   4.2.5. For Joint Bases, AF wings/groups that are not the lead Service will only assess the
   capabilities they provide. Joint Bases that are hosted by the AF will be assessed by the agent
   as appointed by the Wing Commander (see paragraph 4.2.3.)
4.3. METL Development. See the AFUTL for additional information about MET/METL
development.        The         AFUTL         can       be        accessed      on        SIPR
(http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx). Once on this
SIPR website, click on ‘Readiness Publications,’ and then you can access the AFUTL.
Attachment 3 of this AFI lists the POCs for the Core METL. POCs are assigned by AF/A3O-IR
and are generally the FAM from the MAJCOM designated as the lead command or the
appropriate HAF FAM. For multifunctional units (i.e., OSS, LRS, etc.), the FAM for the
functional area with the preponderance of the unit mission (to include equipment) will serve as
the OPR. The other FAMs for multifunctional units will serve as OCRs.

XP—Plans and Programs

Terms
Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL)— The AFUTL incorporates AF unique tasks. The
AFUTL expands on the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) to show hierarchy, and mirrors the
taxonomy of the UJTL. The AFUTL and UJTL are the resources from which to select tasks to
build a unit’s METL. The AFUTL is incorporated into the DRRS on the ESORTS page and is
accessible when adding a task to a unit’s METL. It further correlates, aligns and maps to the
Universal Joint Task List and replaces the obsolete 1998 AFDD 1-1, Air Force Task List.
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART)— Enables
commanders to report the ability of a standard UTC to perform its mission anywhere in the world
at the time of the assessment and identify capability through the next AEF pair. It highlights
missing resources and helps quantify missing requirements for additional justification when
submitting budgets. It also provides the ability to evaluate a UTC prior to tasking and picks the
UTC with the best capability to meet the tasking. ART is the only assessment system that goes
down to the UTC level. It does not measure a UTC’s availability to deploy, only its ability to
meet its mission.
Combat Support Agency— A DoD agency so designated by Congress or the Secretary of
Defense that supports military combat operations.
Commander’s Assessment— Unit commander’s evaluation of data (obtained through
DRRS/ESORTS measurement and/or information available to the commander outside the
measurement system) and judgment as to which assessment rating best represents the actual
readiness of commander’s unit.
Current Unit Status Tool (CUS)— Allows AF users to review unit resources and assess METs
/ METLs.
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES)— The AF
standard automated data processing subsystem of the Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System (JOPES), which is used by operations, logistics, and force support planners at all
command levels, to develop and maintain force packages and task requirements for operation
plan Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data.
Department of Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)— The means to monitor the
readiness of the DoD Components to provide capabilities to support the NMS as specified in the
defense and contingency planning guidance, Theater Security Cooperation Guidance, and the
Unified Command Plan.
Enhanced Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS)— The capability-based
readiness reporting system that provides current readiness status for operational forces and
defense support organizations in terms of their ability to perform their tasks and missions.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)— The FAM is the individual responsible for the
management and planning of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to
support wartime and peacetime contingencies.
Guest— A DRRS user role that has read-only access to ESORTS information. There are no
assessment or build METL editing privileges associated with this user role. It is a role the
AFI10-252_AFSPCSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             35


software temporarily assigns when viewing a unit's METL where there is no account set up. The
DRRS Support Center normally assigns "no role" when a DRRS account is first approved. The
UA then has to assign the correct role for the UU. Also known as “viewer.”
Joint Force Readiness Review (JFRR)— The principal assessment of the Chairman's
Readiness System. Combines and analyzes unit and joint C/S/A readiness assessments, pulled
from DRRS and SORTS, to capture DoD's strategic readiness to execute the NMS. The JFRR
assists the Chairman in providing the best military advice to the President and SecDef by
informing the Chairman's Risk Assessment, Annual Report on Combatant Commander
Requirements, Capability Gap Assessment, and Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress.
Addresses three primary topics; these may be supplemented by additional data and analysis as
best supports the Chairman and senior leadership: a. Overall Department Readiness Assessment.
The Department's overall ability to execute the NMS. b. C/S/A Readiness Data. Resource and
capability readiness assessments against J/AMETs/JCAs and assigned missions. c. Readiness
Metrics and Analysis. Service oriented Health of the Force metrics, force availability for
contingency operations. Submitted quarterly to the DJS via JSAP, provided to Chairman's Risk
Assessment, Annual Report on Combatant Commander Requirements, Capability Gap
Assessment, and Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress process leaders and posted in DRRS
and on designated SIPRNET web sites after approval.
Measured Units (Reporting Units)— Measured units are all planned and actual Joint Task
Force HQs, NAFs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air
National Guard, AF Reserve and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a
CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, OPLAN 8010, or Volume 3 of
the AF WMP-3, or assigned in the Forces For Unified Commands document, Global Force
Management Allocation Plan. At a minimum, AF units that report SORTS will assess a DRRS
METL.
Mission Essential Task (MET)— A task based on mission analysis and approved by the
commander that is absolutely necessary, indispensable, or critical to the success of a mission.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)— A list of METs required to accomplish an assigned or
anticipated mission that includes associated tasks, conditions, and standards, and requires the
identification of command-linked and supporting tasks.
Operational Control (OPCON)— Command authority that may be exercised by commanders
at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for
logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.

Operation Plan (OPLAN)— A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried
out simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the
form of directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare
supporting plans and orders. The designation “plan” is usually used instead of “order” in
preparing for operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a
prescribed time, or on signal, and then becomes an operation order. Plans are prepared by
Combatant Commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs
of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the
establishing unified commander. OPLANs are prepared in either complete format of an OPLAN,
or as a CONPLAN. OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be
used as a basis for developing an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies
required to execute the combatant commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of
these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD
files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the
appropriate annexes, appendices, and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES manuals
containing planning policies, procedures, and formats. A CONPLAN is an operation plan in an
abbreviated format that would require considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an
OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the combatant commander’s strategic concept and
those annexes and appendices deemed necessary by the combatant commander to complete
planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are not calculated and TPFDD files are not
prepared.
Readiness (Department of Defense)— A measure of the Department of Defense's ability to
provide the capabilities needed to execute the missions specified in the National Military
Strategy.
Unit Administrator (UA)— DRRS user role that has privileges to customize unit information
and manage offices, add, build and assess METs, manage unit user accounts, and save
assessment snap shots for their unit(s) of assignment. At HHQ (Group/Wing/NAF/MAJCOM),
will supervise/manage subordinate units' DRRS implementation and monthly mission readiness
assessments.
Unit Commander (UC)— DRRS user role that has privileges to approve overall mission
assessments for their unit of assignment. This role also permits unit information customization,
MET adding, building, and assessment, and office management.
Unit Identification Code (UIC)— A six-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies
each Active, Reserve, and National Guard unit of the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02,Global
Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Unit Type Code (UTC)— A five-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies each
type of unit in the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02B, Global Status of Resources and Training
System (GSORTS)). A UTC is a potential capability focused upon accomplishment of a specific
mission that the military Service provides.
Unit User (UU)— DRRS user role that can view/edit ESORTS information. A UU has
privileges to assess the specific tasks assigned by their Office of Primary Responsibility.
Universal Joint Task List (UJTL)— Identifies what is to be performed in terms common to the
Joint Staff, Services, combatant commands and components, activities, joint organizations, and

agencies responsive to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is a menu of tasks in a
common language, which serves as the foundation for capabilities-based planning across the
range of military operations.
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)— The AF supporting plan to the Joint Strategic
Capabilities Plan. The five volumes of the WMP extend through the FYDP to provide continuity
in short and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current planning cycle policies
and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations. It establishes
requirements for development of mobilization and production-planning programs to support
sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces. The WMP encompasses all
functions necessary to match facilities, manpower, and material with planned wartime activity
(AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
