SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been renamed from a Niagara Falls Air Reserve Instruction to a 914 Airlift
Wing Instruction. Removed all 107th AW and MOF references. Updated web link for AFI 21-
101, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Sup Checklist (CL)-1, C-130 Debriefing Checklist. Added
 2                                                             914AWI21-110 13 AUGUST 2014


Command Post contact information to Attachment 2, Abort/Incident Information Worksheet.
Added Zulu time block to Attachment 3, Debriefing Worksheet.
1. Policies. Debriefing will be accomplished IAW this instruction, using one of the following
methods:
     1.1. During normal duty hours, the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will accomplish
     a face-to- face aircrew debriefing using AFI 21-101, AMCSUP CL-1 located at
     http://static.e- publishing.af.mil/production/1/amc/publication/afi21-101_amcsupcl-1/afi21-
     101_amcsupcl-1.pdf as a guide.
     1.2. During non-duty hours or a non-duty day, a face-to-face aircrew debriefing will be
     performed by the crew chief using the Debriefing Worksheet (Attachment 3), or the AMC
     Form 278, Debriefing and Recovery Plan. AFI 21-101, AMCSUP CL-1, can be used as a
     guide to the fullest extent possible. The next duty day, a complete review of the AFTO Form
     781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, will be performed by the Aircraft
     Production Superintendent/Expeditor and the forms taken to the MOC to complete the
     debrief process, prior to the daily maintenance production meeting.
     1.3. Missions landing with other than code 1 discrepancies, a specialist (when available) and
     debriefer will meet the aircrew at debrief to discuss the discrepancies.
     1.4. The aircrew will identify the fault reporting code for each discrepancy. If required,
     MOC debriefer/crew chief will ensure fault reporting codes are included for all discrepancies
     in the aircraft forms.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. Debriefing is conducted at the termination of each sortie/mission or when a
     sortie/mission is aborted.
     2.2. Whenever GO81 is down or not readily available, MOC will document aircraft
     debriefing discrepancies on a locally devised debrief worksheet/job control number (JCN)
     log. Cannibalization (CANN) discrepancies will be accurately recorded on a locally devised
     cannibalization log. When GO-81 comes back on line, MOC will input all data to maintain
     historical integrity of aircraft. As a minimum, the last four automated debriefing sortie recaps
     will be maintained in the Sortie Recap File Book for discrepancy identification.
     2.3. Deployed Debriefing Procedures. Use automated debrief tools as the primary debriefing
     instrument. If GO81 is available at the deployed location, GO81 will be used. If GO81 is
     unavailable, a locally devised debrief worksheet/JCN log will be used. Retain duplicates at
     the deployed site to help in future debriefings. Turn-in, validate and reconcile paperwork
     from the last five missions to MOC upon re-deployment.
     2.4. Missions exceeding 24 hours off station, the aircraft commander will be responsible for
     calling in daily aircraft status when the status changes to non-mission capable (NMC) to the
     Niagara Falls Command Post during normal duty hours. In-turn, the Command Post will call
     the MOC with aircraft status.
     2.5. Aircraft debriefing discrepancies will be input into GO-81 from screen 9050. JCN’s
     will be assigned from the Manual JCN and Debrief Log. JCN’s will be issued IAW 914 th
     Maintenance Group Operating Instruction (MXGOI) 21-123, Job Control Numbers.
914AWI21-110 13 AUGUST 2014                                                                     3


   2.6. The Julian date used to create JCN will be the Julian date aircraft departed on mission or
   flight.
3. Repeat/Recurring Discrepancies. Repeats and recurs will be identified by the MOC upon
input to GO-81, screen 9050.
   3.1. Repeat – Enter (1) on GO81 screen 9050 (repeat/recur block), and notify QA IAW
   Paragraph 1.3AA
   3.2. Recurring – Enter (2) on GO81 screen (9050) enter (repeat/recur block), and notify QA
   IAW Paragraph 1.3
4. Abort/Incident Reporting: Air abort determinations are made by MOC with information
provided by Operations. The MOC will use the locally developed Abort/Incident Information
Worksheet, Attachment 2, to provide the QA section with abort and incident information. A
completed copy of the worksheet will be provided to QA immediately upon completion of the
debriefing process, or when notified of an aircraft incident.
   4.1. The Production Superintendent/Expediter or designee is responsible for: Providing
   dropped object, aborts or in-flight emergency (IFE), flight control impoundment actions,
   Foreign Object Damage (FOD), bird strike and engine malfunction information to MOC
   using Attachment 2.
   4.2. The MOC is responsible for: Upon receiving notification of a dropped object, abort or
   IFE, flight control impoundment action, FOD, bird strike and engine malfunction
   information, MOC initiating the applicable emergency action checklist (REF: MOC
   Emergency Action Checklists) listing required actions and personnel and/or offices to be
   notified during such discoveries. This procedure is necessary to ensure that key personnel
   are alerted and that any required reports can be filed.
      4.2.1. At debrief, when requested, the MOC will enter Dropped Object Prevention
      (DOP) inspection into GO81 and notify the Production Supervisor and/or Expeditor
      when action is accomplished.
   4.3. MOC will notify QA and Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) of all
   abort/incident occurrences for investigation purposes and possible impoundment procedures.
   4.4. For non-duty hours or a non-duty day incident reporting where there is a possibility for
   aircraft impoundment, the senior maintenance team member will refer to 914th MXGI 21-
   106, Aircraft Impoundment, and contact one of the following MXG officials:
      4.4.1. *Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Superintendent
      4.4.2. *Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Superintendent
      4.4.3. *Maintenance Group Superintendent
      4.4.4. *QA Superintendent
      4.4.5. MXS Commander
      4.4.6. MOF Commander
      4.4.7. MXG Vice Commander
      4.4.8. MXG Commander

        4.4.9. * Indicates primary contact
5. Flying Time.
     5.1. MOC will input flying time from AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
     Document, into GO81, Screen 9020.
     5.2. MOC will check flying time against AFTO Form 781 by using GO81 screen 8038.
     Ensure take-off times and landing times, total sortie time and departure and arrival locations
     match
