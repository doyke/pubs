This AFMCI directs designated Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) senior personnel to
inform the AFMC Command Center of their location and identify their Designated Alternates
when they depart their permanent duty stations (PDS). This AFMCI applies to AFMC Center
Commanders (CCs)/Directors (CLs), Installation Commanders, HQ AFMC Directors (two
letters), Installation Command Posts (CPs), and the AFMC Command Center. Ensure all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Record Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Revisions change Designated Alternate succession procedures for AFMC Center CCs/CLs,
Installation Commanders, and HQ AFMC Directors.
1. Purpose. Establishes policy and procedures for AFMC senior personnel (see para. 5) to
advise the AFMC Command Center of their location, and for identifying Designated Alternates
when Center CCs/CLs, Installation Commanders, and HQ AFMC Directors leave their PDS (out
of local area or on leave).
2. Center Commander/Director, Installation Commander, HQ AFMC Director Succession
Policy.
2                                                         AFMCI 10-203 3 SEPTEMBER 2009


    2.1. Center Commanders/Directors. When a Center CC/CL leaves his/her PDS, leadership
    responsibility to act as the Designated Alternate (see para. 4 for duties and responsibilities)
    will pass in the following order:
       2.1.1. Center Vice Commander (Center/CV), IAW AFMCMD 401, para. 2.5,
       Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command. Note: if the Center/CA is senior to the
       Center/CV, then the Center/CA will be second in succession, the Center/CV third in
       succession.
       2.1.2. Center Executive Director (Center/CA), IAW AFI 51-604, para. 6.2, Appointment
       to and Assumption of Command.
       2.1.3. Center Wing/Division Commander/Director, IAW AFI 51-604, para. 6.2,
       Appointment to and Assumption of Command.
           2.1.3.1. Center CCs/CLs will formally establish a Designated Alternate line of
           succession among their Wing/Division Senior Leaders in the following order:
           General Officer Wing/Division Commanders/Director, Senior Executive Service
           (SES) Wing/Division Directors, and Installation Commander. Note: for purposes of
           this AFMCI, AFRL’s Technical Directorates are synonymous with “Wing” or
           “Division.”
           2.1.3.2. At Centers without an assigned CV or CA, Center CCs/CLs may
           permanently     designate   the    senior     General    Officer   Wing/Division
           Commander/Director as the third in succession such that a “triple absence” would
           only occur if the Center CC/CL, Center CV/CA, and the designated Wing/Division
           Commander/Director all concurrently leave their PDS (see Attachment 2).
    2.2. Specialty Center Commanders/Directors. Specialty Centers will coordinate their line of
    Designated Alternate succession through HQ AFMC/CS for AFMC/CV approval. The line
    of succession will adhere to the succession intent/structure of para. 2.
    2.3. HQ AFMC Directors. When a HQ AFMC Director leaves his/her PDS, leadership
    responsibility to act as the Designated Alternate (see para. 4 for duties and responsibilities)
    will pass in a line of succession to deputies, next Division Chiefs, followed by other
    Colonels, then Supervisory Pay Band 3s/GS-15s. For Directorates with only one deputy, the
    Director may permanently designate a senior (O6/supervisory pay band 3/GS-15) Division
    Chief as the third in succession such that a “triple absence” would only occur if the Director,
    Deputy, and the designated Division Chief all concurrently leave their PDS (see Attachment
    2). Small Directorates without a deputy or divisions will coordinate their line of succession
    through HQ AFMC/CS for AFMC/CV approval.
Example 1: HQ AFMC/A4 has a Director and two Deputy Directors, thus a triple absence
occurs and AFMC/CV pre-approval is required only when all three will not be at their PDS.

Example 2: HQ AFMC/A3 has a Director and one Deputy. If HQ AFMC/A3 permanently
designates the A3X Division Chief as its third in succession, then a triple absence occurs and
AFMC/CV pre-approval is required only when the A3 Director, Deputy, and A3X Division Chief
will not be at their PDS.
AFMCI 10-203 3 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 3


   2.4. Installation Commanders. When an Installation Commander leaves his/her PDS,
   leadership responsibility to act as the Designated Alternate (see para. 4 for duties and
   responsibilities) will pass in a line of succession to the Vice Commander (CV), Executive
   Director (DV), followed by the Mission Support Group Commander. Installations without an
   assigned Vice Commander or Executive Director will coordinate their line of succession
   through their respective Center CC/CL.
3. Availability.
   3.1. Command Posts must maintain adequate knowledge of the availability/location of their
   Center CC/CL and Installation Commander at all times. The AFMC Command Center must
   maintain adequate knowledge of the availability/location of AFMC/CC/CV/CA and HQ
   AFMC Directors at all times.
   3.2. Timely and responsive accessibility to voice communications is the primary criterion for
   establishing adequate knowledge of CC/CL availability/location.
   3.3. Center CCs/CLs, Installation Commanders, HQ AFMC Directors, or their Designated
   Alternates must keep the AFMC Command Center advised of their availability/location using
   the Commander/Director/HQ AFMC Director/Designated Alternate Availability Memo
   (Attachment 1).
   3.4. Center CCs/CLs, Installation Commanders, HQ AFMC Directors, or their Designated
   Alternates will be available to the AFMC/CC/CV/CA via phone patch within 15 minutes
   through the AFMC Command Center (see para. 5).
4. Duties and Responsibilities of Designated Alternates.
   4.1. Acts on behalf of the CC/CL, Installation Commander, or HQ AFMC Director as is
   routinely done when he/she is present (AFI 51-604, para. 3.4.2).
   4.2. Acts for the CC/CL, Installation Commander, or HQ AFMC Director except where
   statute or higher headquarters guidance requires personal action by the CC/CL, Installation

Notification Procedures.
  6.1. Organizations listed in paragraph 5 will transmit a Commander/Director/HQ AFMC
  Director/Designated Alternate Availability Memo (Attachment 3) each Tuesday to the
  AFMC Command Center. Center CCs/CLs and Installation Commanders must provide a
  copy to their local or Installation CP. Memos detail Center Commanders’ and Directors’,
  Installation Commanders’, HQ AFMC Directors’, and their Designated Alternates’
  availability for the next 3 weeks. The AFMC Command Center closely monitors receipt and
  will notify the unit's Command Section when a memo is not received by 1200 Eastern Time
  (ET). When preparing Attachment 3, follow the example provided with special attention to
  the following:
     6.1.1. Send      to      AFMC   Command           Center        via     e-mail
     HQAFMC.Command.Center@wpafb.af.mil. If unable to email, fax to DSN 787-1473 or
     commercial 937-257-1473.
     6.1.2. When a leave or TDY period extends beyond the reported period, include the
     planned return date in part three.
     6.1.3. Eastern Time (ET) is used throughout the memo.
     6.1.4. When present for duty during the entire period, part three shows the reporting
     period followed by PRESENT FOR DUTY (PFD) and part five contains the term NOT
     APPLICABLE.
     6.1.5. Always provide a message POC and DSN number in part six.
     6.1.6. Resubmit a Commander/Director/HQ AFMC Director/Designated Alternate
     Availability Memo (Attachment 3) any time changes to availability occur. The
     Center/Installation/Directorate will first advise the AFMC Command Center
     telephonically (DSN 787-6314, commercial 937-257-6314) and then follow up with a
     revised hard copy memo. When the change occurs during after duty hours, the AFMC
     Command Center may defer the hard copy requirement until the next duty day.
6                                                        AFMCI 10-203 3 SEPTEMBER 2009


       6.1.7. Itineraries will be designated a minimum of FOR OFFICAL USE ONLY (FOUO);
       consider classifying CONFIDENTIAL when transiting high threat areas. Those
       responsible for the Commander’s/Director’s/HQ AFMC Director’s itineraries will
       determine the need to classify the itinerary. If an itinerary is classified, it will be
       declassified on the day following completion of travel.
       6.1.8. It is the responsibility of CPs to maintain adequate knowledge of the location of
       their Commanders/Directors/HQ AFMC Directors or their Designated Alternates at all
       times. Installation CPs will keep the AFMC Command Center informed of all changes to
       availability.      The AFMC Command Center will maintain availability of
       Commanders/Directors/HQ AFMC Directors or their Designated Alternates listed in
       paragraph 5.
    6.2. Exemption from Licensing. Reports required by this instruction are exempt from the
    report control system outlined in AFPD 37-1, Air Force Information Management; and AFI
    37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program (ICR Program);
    Controlling Internal, Public, and Inter-Agency Air Force Information Collections.
7. Concurrent (Dual/Triple) Absences of Commanders/Directors/HQ AFMC Directors and
Designated Alternates.
    7.1. Pre-Approval process (see Attachment 2).
       7.1.1. Keep concurrent absences to an absolute minimum.
       7.1.2. Center CCs/CLs must request prior approval through AFMC/CVE from
       AFMC/CV (Cc: HQ AFMC/CS Executive Officer) if the Center may potentially have a
       triple absence (see para. 2) NLT 5 duty days prior to the triple absence. If AFMC/CV is
       not available to approve, then approval may come from AFMC/CA or HQ AFMC/CS.
Example: If ASC/CC, CV, and CA may potentially all not be at their PDS (a “triple absence”),
then ASC would need to obtain pre-approval from AFMC/CV.
       7.1.3. Installation Commanders will request prior approval from their respective Center
       CCs/CLs if the installation may potentially have a triple absence (see para. 2.4) NLT 5
       duty days prior to the triple absence.
       7.1.4. HQ AFMC Directors must request prior approval through AFMC/CVE from
       AFMC/CV (Cc: HQ AFMC/CS Executive Officer) when both the Director and Deputy
       Director(s) will not be at their PDS during the same time frame NLT 5 duty days prior to
       the dual/triple absence. If AFMC/CV is not available to approve, then approval may
       come from AFMC/CA or HQ AFMC/CS.
           7.1.4.1. If a Directorate has more than one assigned Deputy, then AFMC/CV pre-
           approval is only required if the Director and both Deputies will all not be at their PDS
           (a “triple absence”) (see para 2.3).
           7.1.4.2. If a Directorate with only one assigned Deputy opts to permanently designate
           a senior (O6/supervisory Pay Band 3/GS-15) Division Chief as the third in
           succession, then AFMC/CV pre-approval is only required if the Director, Deputy, and
           the permanently designated Division Chief are all concurrently not at their PDS (a
           “triple absence”) (see para 2.3).
AFMCI 10-203 3 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  7



  7.2. Send all requests for concurrent (dual/triple) absence via e-mail to:
  hqafmc.cve@wpafb.af.mil; hqafmc.cae@wpafb.af.mil. and hqafmc.cs.exec@wpafb.af.mil
  Subject: FOUO/Concurrent (Dual/Triple) Absence for AFMC/CV Approval, [applicable
  date(s)] (see Attachment 2). The request must answer the following before a concurrent
  dual/triple absence can be approved:
     7.2.1. Who is in charge during their absence?
     7.2.2. How can the principals be contacted during this time frame (cell phone, TDY
     location, etc.)? (Provide all contact numbers)
     7.2.3. What are the reasons for all of the leaders to be absent simultaneously?
     7.2.4. What high risk/high visibility events are occurring during this time frame
     (milestone decisions, Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection, flight tests, congressional visits,
     etc.)?
  7.3. If approved, Commanders/Directors will update their respective availability reports with
  their local CP and the AFMC Command Center.
8. AFMC Command Center.
  8.1. The AFMC Command Center provides availability information to the AFMC
  Commander each duty day.
  8.2. Procedures. The AFMC Command Center reviews all availability memos as they are
  received and resolves problems through the POCs by 1430 ET on Tuesday. Each duty day
  the AFMC Command Center compiles availability information and transmits it to the AFMC
  Command Section via e-mail NLT 0730 ET.
  8.3. Connectivity exercises. The AFMC Command Center will test the ability of
  Commanders/Directors and HQ AFMC Directors (listed in para. 5) to meet the 15-minute
  contact requirement on a quarterly basis. Upon notification by the AFMC Command Center
  that an AFMC/CC telephone contact test is required, the installation CP has 15 minutes to
  connect the appropriate Commander/Director (or Designated Alternate) with the AFMC
  Command Center. To avoid having these tests disrupt important meetings or occasions,
  Commanders/Directors/HQ AFMC Directors may establish procedures that would allow an
  alternate official to respond to the test (e.g., "this is Major Jones, Executive Officer,
  responding on behalf of Major General Smith to the AFMC Commander telephone contact
  test"). However, these procedures must ensure that the desired leader could actually have
  been connected in the required timeframe. The AFMC Command Center will provide the
  results of these exercises to HQ AFMC/A3X Division Chief within 2 weeks after the end of
  each calendar quarter for review.

9. Reporting Availability of the AFMC Commander to Air Force. AFI 10-205 and AFMC
Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 10-5 prescribe policy and procedures used to keep HQ
USAF advised of the AFMC Commander's location and availability.
