                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. General Operational Concept and Supported Mission Areas:
   1.1.1. Space and cyberspace are joint operational domains (like air, sea, and land), not
   missions.    The Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigns responsibility to the
   CDRUSSTRATCOM for planning and conducting space and cyberspace operations.
   1.1.2. AFSPC performs a critical mission to organize, train and equip space and cyberspace
   forces in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) warfighting needs and on behalf of the
   nation. The Command performs this mission within a diverse and wide-ranging enterprise
   involving multiple organizations and agencies. The decisive advantage space and cyberspace
   bring to the fight demand an organization that is resilient, focused and highly capable. As
   adversarial capabilities increase and national security budgets tighten, AFSPC must eliminate
   fragmented approaches, improve internal and external partnerships, and ensure all elements
   of the weapon system life cycle are effectively developed and supported.
   1.1.3. AFSPC is responsible for identifying space and cyberspace requirements and for
   presenting those capabilities and forces to Unified commands with the UCP authority and
   responsibility to execute space and cyberspace missions. 14 AF (AFSTRAT) and 24 AF
   (AFCYBER) are designated as Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAFs) through which
   space and cyberspace forces are presented to Joint Force Commanders (JFCs).
   1.1.4. The integration of air, space and cyberspace capabilities is a key enabler to effective
   operations. This integration requires an effective C2 system of systems that spans air, space
   and cyberspace mission needs. AFSPC will define the operational construct for the space
   and cyberspace domains (via concepts documents), from which the requirements for
   integration can be framed. This will allow operational requirements to be promulgated to the
   acquiring entities in the Air Force (AF) to field needed capabilities.
1.2. Commander’s Intent.
   1.2.1. AFSPC will create a responsive MHQ with processes and relationships to ensure
   effective execution of its organize, train, and equip functions. This MHQ will: orient to
   efficiently support field commanders; interact with and leverage partners in and outside the
   space and cyberspace enterprise; and focus on producing mission success. AFSPC will look,
   feel, and act as a single, integrated organization that rapidly and effectively delivers combat
   capability to CCDRs and other mission partners. AFSPC will be a valued member of the
   space and cyberspace enterprise and will be sought as a principal source of advice on space
   and cyberspace issues.
   1.2.2. AFSPC will establish command relationships with Combatant Commands,
   Headquarters Air Force (HAF), other MAJCOMs, Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), Centers,
   national agencies and mission partners to ensure space and cyberspace capabilities are
   effectively developed, integrated, tested, evaluated, operated, sustained, and presented to
   CCDRs. AFSPC personnel will do this by aligning education, training, test, and component

    activities with existing and new organizations, leveraging those organizations and mission
    partners, and ensuring all remaining Command activities are properly structured for
    efficiency and effectiveness in accordance with AF policies and directives.

                                         COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS

3.1. Combatant Commands and Component Organizations.
   3.1.1. USSTRATCOM: The UCP is signed by the President and promulgates assigned
   missions to the CCDRs. AFSPC organizes, trains, equips and primarily provides forces for
   CDRUSSTRATCOM assigned missions. Figure 3.1 shows the relationship between
   USSTRATCOM’S Title 10 unified mission execution responsibilities and the Title 10 force
   provisioning responsibilities of AFSPC.
   3.1.2. USSTRATCOM is organized for force employment around Joint Functional
   Component Commands (JFCC), Task Forces (TF) and a subordinate unified command. This

3.2. AFSPC: The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) designated AFSPC as a Component
MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM). As a C-MAJCOM, AFSPC is responsible for organizing, training,
equipping and providing space and cyberspace forces.
 10                                                          AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   3.2.1. In accordance with the Forces For and Joint Doctrine AFSPC is designated as the AF
   Service Component to USSTRATCOM for space and cyberspace operations. Therefore, the
   Commander, AFSPC (COMAFSPC) serves as the COMAFFOR for all AF space and
   cyberspace forces assigned to USSTRATCOM.
   3.2.2. Additionally as the lead commander of space and cyberspace forces, COMAFSPC is
   responsible for decisions and corresponding recommendations to the HAF, CSAF, SECAF,
   CDRUSSTRATCOM and other joint commanders as required.
   3.2.3. COMAFSPC, as the COMAFFOR to CDRUSSTRATCOM, presents space and
   cyberspace forces through the Commanders of 14 AF (AFSTRAT) and 24 AF (AFCYBER).
3.3. Fourteenth Air Force (Air Forces Strategic) (14 AF (AFSTRAT)): As a C-NAF, 14 AF
(AFSTRAT) is the AF space operations component to USSTRATCOM and the headquarters
element designated to support the AF component commander. 14 AF (AFSTRAT) includes an
Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) and Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff and is responsible
for presenting space forces and units to the Joint Functional Component Commander-Space
(JFCC-SP).
   3.3.1. As a C-NAF, 14 AF (AFSTRAT) is focused on delivering combat effects to
   CDRUSSTRATCOM. HQ AFSPC supports the C-NAF through robust reachback support,
   effective lines of communication and responsive staff action.
   3.3.2. CSAF designated 14 AF (AFSTRAT) as the AF space component to USSTRATCOM.
   14 AF (AFSTRAT) executes assigned missions and operates space forces as part of JFCC-
   Space, fitting the model where an operational AF Commander has two lines of authority: one
   to the “provisioning” Commander (MAJCOM Commander) and Service, and the other to the
   mission executing CCDR. Even though 14 AF (AFSTRAT) is an AF entity, the
   Commander, also dual-hatted as Commander, JFCC-Space, directly reports to
   CDRUSSTRATCOM with a separate but co-located joint staff and C2 node. See Figure 3.2
   for 14 AF (AFSTRAT) and JFCC-Space command relationships.

Figure 3.2. 14 AF JFCC-SP Command Relationships
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                   11


   3.3.3. This construct formalizes the relationship for Joint space concepts, requirements,
   policy, employment and sustainment between the “provisioner” (USAF/AFSPC) and
   CDRUSSTRATCOM in numerous ways to include requirements and capabilities
   identification and advocacy through both the Service and Unified chains of command
   (example; IPL development). To accomplish space missions, 14 AF (AFSTRAT) is assigned
   two space support wings, one space control wing and two space force enhancement wings.
   Functionally, these wings are supported and sustained by HQ AFSPC with 14 AF
   (AFSTRAT) “skipped” but monitoring and knowledgeable.
   3.3.4. As a C-NAF, 14 AF (AFSTRAT) establishes advanced training requirements for its
   operational and tactical-level units and communicates those requirements to the USAF
   Warfare Center (USAFWC). The USAFWC will plan and execute advanced training events
   in support of 14 AF (AFSTRAT) units to ensure those units are better prepared to execute
   contingency or wartime taskings. The USAFWC will work closely with 14 AF (AFSTRAT)
   operational and tactical-level units in the planning and execution of these events.
   3.3.5. The 614th Air and Space Operations Center (614 AOC) is directly subordinate to 14
   AF (AFSTRAT) and forms the core of the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), the C2
   center for the Commander, JFCC-Space.
3.4. Twenty Fourth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber) (24 AF (AFCYBER)): As a C-NAF, 24
AF (AFCYBER) is the AF cyberspace operations component to USSTRATCOM and the
headquarters element designated to support the AF component commander. 24 AF (AFCYBER)
includes an Operations Center (OC) and AFFOR staff and is responsible for presenting
cyberspace forces and units to the Commander USCYBERCOM.
   3.4.1. As a C-NAF, 24 AF (AFCYBER) is focused on delivering combat effects to
   CDRUSSTRATCOM. HQ AFSPC supports the C-NAF through robust reachback support,
   effective lines of communication, and responsive staff action. CSAF designated 24 AF
   (AFCYBER) as the AF cyberspace component to USSTRATCOM. 24 AF (AFCYBER)
   executes assigned missions and operates cyberspace forces through a subunified command,
   USCYBERCOM. USCYBERCOM is authorized DIRLAUTH with other CCDRs for UCP
   assigned cyberspace missions.
   3.4.2. This arrangement, between 24 AF (AFCYBER) and USCYBERCOM, formalizes the
   relationship for Joint cyberspace requirements, policy, employment, sustainment and
   concepts between the AF “provisioner” and CDRUSSTRATCOM in numerous ways to
   include requirements and capabilities identification and advocacy through both the Service
   and Unified chains of command (e.g., IPL development). To accomplish cyberspace
   missions, 24 AF (AFCYBER) is assigned three cyberspace wings. Functionally, these wings
   are supported and sustained by HQ AFSPC with 24 AF (AFCYBER) “skipped” but
   monitoring and knowledgeable. See Figure 3.3 for cyberspace command relationships.
   3.4.3. Units conducting cyberspace operations and tasks (operate, defend, exploit and attack)
   are assigned to 24 AF (AFCYBER) and subordinate to the operational authority of 24 AF
   (AFCYBER)/CC. This chain of command is responsible for all operational matters and usual
   administrative control (ADCON) responsibilities. Authority to perform Computer Network
   Exploitation (CNE) is derived through normal service cryptologic means and with oversight
   by the Service Cryptologic Component (SCC) Commander.

   3.4.4. The 624th Operations Center (624 OC) is directly subordinate to 24 AF (AFCYBER)
   and is the 24 AF (AFCYBER)’s C2 center for the C-NAF as it interfaces and integrates joint
   cyberspace operations with the C2 node at USCYBERCOM.
   3.4.5. AFSPC has responsibility for Air Force Network Operations (AFNetOps). The 24 AF
   (AFCYBER)/CC, dual-hatted as the AFNetOps/CC, is authorized DIRLAUTH with US
   military and civilian Departments and Services for the purpose of coordinating cyberspace
   infrastructure integration and implementation matters. The AFNetOps/CC directs AF
   cyberspace forces in executing missions and tasks assigned by the Cyberspace Joint Force
   Commander (USCYBERCOM) and exercises OPCON over Air Force forces
   assigned/attached to USCYBERCOM to implement NetOps actions in support of joint
   objectives. The AFNetOps/CC also executes AF service responsibilities (COMAFFOR
   actions) to protect the AF portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG).

                     HQ AFSPC ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC)
   4.1.1. AFSPC is the AFs’ Lead MAJCOM for space and cyberspace. AFSPC’s responsibility
   is to organize, train, and equip space and cyberspace forces. AFSPC is the authoritative
   source of space and cyberspace information and services, capability requirements, priorities,
   synchronized portfolio funding, roadmaps, and concepts (i.e. functional, enabling, and
   operating) for space and cyberspace capabilities.
   4.1.2. AFSPC monitors, tracks and interfaces with SAF/CIO-A6, the Air Force Program
   Executive Officers for Space (AFPEO-Space)/SMC, Command and Control and Combat
   Support/ESC (C2/CS) and other AFMC product centers to define, develop, acquire, field and
   sustain space and cyberspace requirements. Included in this role, HQ AFSPC provides
   guidance, prioritization, and oversight to its centers and the S&T communities to ensure
   future needs are met. HQ AFSPC, SMC, AFSMO and AFNIC also work with ESC and
   HQ AFMC, its product and logistics centers, and laboratories to ensure space and cyberspace
   systems are properly planned and sustained, and that science and technology support is
   focused and balanced.
   4.1.3. HQ AFSPC is responsible for the approval of all AF 3-1 Tactics, Techniques, and
   Procedures (TTP) Manuals for space and cyberspace tactical systems as well as AF 3-3
   Operational TTPs for space and cyberspace systems at the operational level. The 561st Joint
   Tactics Squadron (JTS) develops such manual and TTPs and will forward all new and
   revised space and cyberspace AF 3-1 and 3-3 manuals through the USAFWC/CC for
   endorsement and approval by the AFSPC/A3.
   4.1.4. HQ AFSPC is responsible for creating an annual schedule including all combat      and
   contingency taskings; Service level training, exercise, wargame and test requirements;   and
   Joint training, exercise, and test requirements. This schedule is complementary to       and
   coordinated and deconflicted with other Combat Air Forces (CAF) testing, exercise        and
   wargame activities to the maximum extent possible.
   4.1.5. HQ AFSPC is responsible for certifying all space and cyberspace systems as
   operationally safe, suitable, and effective. USAFWC/CC will make space and cyberspace
   fielding recommendations from space and cyberspace operational test units to AFSPC/A3 for
   final approval and fielding direction. The USAFWC/CC will also conduct annual non-
   kinetic space and cyberspace Weapon System Evaluation Programs (WSEP) and present
   those results to the CSAF and COMAFSPC.
   4.1.6. AFSPC wing organizations interface with HQ AFSPC for certain functional support
   activities such as civil engineering, personnel, basing issues, etc. with NAF Commander
   knowledge and tracking (skip echelon concept).

   headquarters element designated to support the AF component commander at the strategic
   level in providing organized, trained and equipped forces to the Combatant Commander.
   4.2.3. Lead MAJCOM. HQ AFSPC is also a Lead MAJCOM for space and cyberspace
   forces. Lead MAJCOMs are MHQs that have the full range of functional staff and
   consolidate responsibilities for particular functions or weapon system capabilities in a single
   headquarters, supporting the entire AF as applicable.
4.3. Command Leads: COMAFSPC established Command Leads (normally an O-6) and
associated Capability Teams for each major capability element within the MAJCOM. The
Command Lead is the knowledgeable agent and leads a matrix team drawn from across the A-
staff and, in some case, from across the space/cyberspace enterprise. Command Leads are
accountable for program decisions and related program activities within their assigned capability
element from cradle-to-grave. The Command Lead/Capability Team structure exists in
conjunction with the headquarters A-Staff and Special Staff structure. In general, the Command
Leads execute AFSPC’s organize, train and equip responsibilities while the A-Staff and Special
Staff provide MHQ support through policy, guidance and oversight.
   4.3.1. Command Leads are designated in writing by the AFSPC/CV. Command Leads
   report to an A-Staff Director. Program Element Monitors (PEMs) perform their
   responsibilities in direct support and at the direction of the appropriate Command Lead.
4.4. Capability Teams: Capability Teams will be formed for each major core capability area
with the primary purpose to facilitate, coordinate and synchronize issues for their assigned
capability. These teams are headed by the Command Lead and composed of experts from across
the A-staff, SMC Systems Directorates, Air Staff, AFNIC, and other government partners for
specific capabilities. Capability teams are supported as needed by Federally Funded Research &
Development Centers (FFRDC) and other contract support. Capability Teams will meet
regularly and address the full set of issues in defining, developing, fielding and operating a new

 18                                                            AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   4.12.2. Provides oversight of modeling and simulation efforts, as well as scientific analyses,
   assessments and lessons learned.
   4.12.3. Responsible for managing AFSPC’s classified/unclassified resource allocation and
   Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development processes. Serves as the focal point
   for command interaction and coordination with the AF Corporate Structure for all POM and
   Program Budget Review (PBR) issues.
   4.12.4. Manages AFSPC basing, international affairs and foreign disclosure processes.
4.13. HQ AFSPC/FM: Responsible for budget formulation, distribution of budget and
execution oversight for base infrastructure and space weapon systems sustainment, funds control
and distribution for all appropriations and overall financial resource management, accounting
and oversight for AFSPC. AFSPC/FM supports AFSPC/A5 in the requirements definition
process, specifically in leading the cost analysis working group for AoA studies for satisfying
warfighter requirements and furnish expertise for independent review, when applicable, of cost
estimates produced by other entities.
4.14. Special Staff: The AFSPC Director of Staff leads the special staff. The special staff
supports the COMAFSPC, A-staff directors, and AFSPC commanders with safety, financial
management, history, legal, chaplain, inspector general, public affairs, surgeon and other
specialized expertise.
4.15. Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC): SMC designs, develops, acquires and
sustains space and related systems and programs. Responsible for acquisition and sustainment of
space capabilities, including life cycle management planning, sustainment planning and
sustainment management for all assigned AF space and missile systems.
   4.15.1. The SMC/CC has two separate, but closely related chains of authority, responsibility
   and reporting: (1) as the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space (AFPEO/SP)
   reporting to the DAE and SAE; and (2) product center commander reporting to COMAFSPC.
   These chains are shown in Figure 2.1.
       4.15.1.1. In the acquisition chain, the AFPEO-Space (SMC/CC) executes National
       Security Space programs under the direction of the SAE in accordance with statutory and
       regulatory requirements and DoD and AF policy. The AFPEO-Space is accountable for
       all programs assigned to him that are executed by the SMC/ESC systems organizations
       and reports directly to the DAE and SAE and other DoD acquisition officials as required.
       Program execution roles and responsibilities include formulating programs and system
       solutions derived from COMAFSPC capability needs and requirements, as well as
       defining, budgeting and managing resources provided by AFSPC (and other supported
       organizations such as the National Reconnaisiance Office (NRO), Department of
       Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA) for
       successful program execution. The AFPEO-Space establishes contractual relationships
       with industry to execute programs and manages/monitors contract execution.
       4.15.1.2. In the AF product center chain, the SMC/CC receives requirements from
       COMAFSPC, which have been refined, validated and programmed in concert with
       HAF/Joint Staff processes. SMC also executes typical ADCON responsibilities for
       which they receive administrative, resource and other support from HQ AFSPC. Other
       responsibilities include organizing, training and equipping the Center for successful
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                     19


     mission execution to include recruiting, training and retaining a qualified acquisition
     workforce. SMC implements critical processes, standards and best practices in systems
     engineering, program management, financial management, contracting, mission
     assurance, specifications and standards, and develops and manages capabilities and
     competencies for life cycle management of AF space systems.
  4.15.2. The SMC/CC is responsible and accountable to COMAFSPC for delivering space
  capabilities to perform AFSPC missions. This includes establishing and maintaining
  Development Plans and systems roadmaps as well as establishing overall space system
  sustainment and industrial base viability strategies in coordination with AFMC.
  4.15.3. SMC plays a critical role in translating AFSPC operational requirements and
  concepts into system/technical requirements and executable programs that meet cost,
  schedule, performance and risk objectives. SMC proposes and defines systems and programs
  that provide the capabilities to meet established requirements with COMAFSPC serving as
  the final decision authority for approving system definition. As the COMAFFOR to
  USSTRATCOM, COMAFSPC ensures that supported CCDR requirements and integrated
  priorities are met (with appropriate interface with the AF and Joint processes) while staying
  in concert with CSAF and SECAF direction and AF and AFSPC priorities.
  4.15.4. Once acquisition programs begin, any needed operational requirements, schedule and
  budget/funding trades are proposed by AFPEO-Space/SMC, synchronized and orchestrated
  under the leadership of HQ AFSPC, and approved by COMAFSPC for HAF and Joint Staff
  consideration. This process prevents introduction of new requirements into approved
  program baselines (“requirements creep”) without specific approval from COMAFSPC.
  SMC/CC keeps COMAFSPC informed of program progress via periodic, formal program
  reviews.
  4.15.5. SMC also performs a critical role in the launch, operational checkout and transfer of
  operational space capabilities to 14 AF (AFSTRAT). This role is different from the aircraft
  model where the operating command “accepts” an aircraft at the factory after successful
  flight-testing. For space systems, authority, responsibility, accountability and resources for
  placing capability on-orbit are ultimately aligned under COMAFSPC. The SMC/CC has
  contractual and Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) responsibility for
  the launch system through satellite vehicle separation and the satellite through on-orbit
  delivery. The 14 AF (AFSTRAT)/CC is responsible for launch day execution, public safety,
  range support, collision avoidance analysis, satellite control network support and operational
  execution. SMC/CC exercises overall authority, responsibility and accountability for space
  system flight worthiness until the system is formally transferred to 14 AF (AFSTRAT)/CC
  on orbit. Therefore, all authority, responsibility and accountability for successful acquisition
  through delivery of AF capabilities on orbit and subsequent operations, are aligned within
  AFSPC under the working authority of COMAFSPC.
  4.15.6. SMC is the single focal point for life cycle management of space systems logistics
  and sustainment functions for AFPEO-Space delivered systems. SMC consolidates,
  coordinates, and provides a single focal point for logistics/sustainment activities including
  cross system integration, acquisition logistics, logistics readiness, sustaining engineering and
  program support of assigned System Support Managers (SSMs).
 20                                                             AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   4.15.7. SMC’s Space Development and Test Directorate develops, integrates, tests, launches
   and operates experimental technologies and prototypical space systems, and evaluates these
   for residual and/or future tactical exploitation. As such, they must work closely with 14 AF
   (AFSTRAT), JFCC-Space and the Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) in
   executing assigned functions.
4.16. Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC): The SIDC/CC reports to
COMAFSPC and is a supporting commander to the USAFWC/CC for advanced training,
operational test activities, and tactics development for space. SIDC also performs: space
experimentation as assigned; cross-domain integration; rapid prototyping and tactical
exploitation of emerging technologies; and plans, supports, executes exercises and wargames;
and develops advanced space modeling tools. In this capacity, the SIDC/CC functions as a full
member of the USAFWC and participates fully in all USAFWC processes.
   4.16.1. The SIDC/CC also identifies resource and personnel shortfalls impacting its ability to
   execute USAFWC missions and works with the HQ AFSPC and USAFWC staff to develop
   inputs to HHQ programming and budgeting processes in order to address the shortfalls.
       4.16.1.1. The SIDC works with the USAFWC/CC, as needed, to develop or mature the
       organizations, processes and capabilities required to further normalize space-related
       advanced training, operational test, and tactics development.
       4.16.1.2. AFSPC/A3, in coordination with AFSPC/A1, SIDC/CC, 688 IOW/CC and the
       USAFWC/CC, develops operating concepts and associated courses of action for
       organizational changes needed to fully address integrated USAFWC space (SIDC) and
       cyberspace (688 IOW) advanced training, operational test, and tactics development for
       mission requirements. These courses of action include potential locations such as
       Schriever AFB, Hurlburt Field, Nellis AFB, Kirtland AFB and Lackland AFB.
       4.16.1.3. There are closely related and synergistic capabilities resident within the SIDC’s
       and the Space Development and Test Directorate’s test, experimentation, operational
       prototype and tactical exploitation functions for space systems. These two organizations
       should work closely together to determine opportunities to leverage best practices and
       expertise, and develop Courses of Action (COAs) for the most effective alignment of
       these functions and certification milestones.
       4.16.1.4. The SIDC, through the 595th Space Group (SG), provides operational test,
       advanced training, and space control tactics development. The 595th SG is responsible
       for demonstrating new technologies and testing space experiments; operating the Space
       Test and Training Range (STTR); integrating space capabilities through exercise
       planning and execution; and developing space modeling tools and simulated space
       environments. It serves as the focal point for coordinating test activities and advanced
       training events between HQ AFSPC, 14th AF, space wings, test squadrons and external
       agencies.
       4.16.1.5. As a part of the 595th SG, the Advanced Space Operations School (ASOpS)
       provides advanced training on space sub-systems and theater deployment training (all
       supporting enhanced delivery of space and missile capabilities to the warfighter).
       Advanced courses are designed to train and educate space professionals in warfighting
       TTPs, enhance subject matter expertise, support development and evaluation of new
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                     21


       TTPs and guide students through the process of integrating space capabilities, limitations,
       vulnerabilities and threats into doctrine. Warfighter Preparation training courses are
       designed to train Space Professionals with broad based space applications with an
       emphasis on theater integration. ASOpS also offers fundamental courses designed to
       educate non-credentialed Space Professionals, other space enablers, and foreign allies on
       space capabilities and integration. The school capitalizes on the synergy of being located
       alongside the SIDC and the USAFWC to tap into the latest innovations in TTP
       development.
4.17. Air Force Spectrum Management Office (AFSMO): AFSMO plans, provides and
preserves access to the electromagnetic spectrum for the AF and selected DoD activities in
support of national policy objectives, systems development, and global operations. The
AFSMO/CC reports directly to COMAFSPC, however, AFSMO maintains a relationship with
SAF/CIO-A6 in their role as the AF CIO. AFSMO communicates directly with AF, Federal
Government agencies, private sector entities, and international organizations on tasks for which
AFSMO is responsible. Specific responsibilities include:
   4.17.1. Serve as OPR for all AF spectrum management requirements supporting spectrum-
   dependent (S-D) programs throughout their life cycle.
   4.17.2. Implement DoD, national and international spectrum management guidelines and
   instructions specific to supporting the AF mission. Ensure such instructions and procedures
   comply with national and international telecommunications rules and regulations, and
   appropriate multinational and bilateral agreements.
   4.17.3. Provide spectrum engineering (allocation) and radio frequency spectrum
   management (assignment) procedural guidance to MAJCOMs, field activities, operational,
   and functional communities, to include acquisition, research, development, test, and
   evaluation (RDT&E), and logistics to certify and license S-D systems.
   4.17.4. Monitor spectrum developments in DoD, national, and international arenas; evaluate
   impacts on AF operations, RDT&E programs, and spectrum-dependent systems acquisition
   efforts.
4.18. Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC): AFNIC shapes and integrates the
AFNET enabling assured core cyberspace capabilities to achieve warfighting advantage in
support of AFSPC. AFNIC communicates, collaborates and coordinates with other AF
organizations and domain experts to develop "speed of need" cyberspace net-centric concepts,
architectures, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures. Additionally, AFNIC leverages
emerging cyber technologies to meet requirements for current and future air, space and
cyberspace operations; allowing the AF to complete the sphere of information dominance.
   4.18.1. The AFNIC/CC reports directly to COMAFSPC; however, AFNIC maintains a
   coordination relationship via DIRLAUTH with SAF/CIO-A6 in their role as the AF CIO and
   with other MAJCOMs. The coordination relationship with the MAJCOMs includes:
   Common Core Training; Certification and Accreditation (C&A); Long Haul
   Communications; Information Technology and Asset Management (ITAM); Information
   Assurance (IA) Management; Command Records Management; Maintenance and
   Sustainment; Publications and Forms Management; High Frequency Global Communications
   System (HFGCS); and Video Teleconferencing (VTC) Management.

  4.18.2. AFNIC supports AFSPC in shaping the AFNET to expand cyberspace capabilities
  for warfighter needs. AFNIC characterizes the cyber battle space, develops the infrastructure
  portion of cyber architecture (AFNET), serves as an integral member of the AFSPC
  Cyberspace Capability Teams, and provides cyberspace engineering services and strategic
  and capability planning support. AFNIC provides cyberspace technology assessment input to
  the AFSPC S&T guidance development process.
  4.18.3. AFNIC provides standardization for the AFNET and manages the network for
  mission assurance. AFNIC pursues and implements the AFSPC initiative to standardize the
  network and determines interoperability requirements in collaboration with 24 AF
  (AFCYBER) and ESC for deploying AFNET components and systems. AFNIC identifies
  capability shortfalls and implements/improves cyber surety by developing and disseminating
  security standards, policies and procedures; modernizes, transforms and sustains
  Cryptological Systems; and performs IA and C&A Management. AFNIC provides
  cyberspace technology assessments, including risk assessments, and assesses requests for
  system and application network connection for networthiness attributes (SISSU-Security,
  Interoperability Supportability, Sustainment and Usability).
  4.18.4. AFNIC supports AFSPC (as the lead operating command for Comm and Information
  Systems Management) and ESC to sustain the AFNET. A prime priority for the cyberspace
  enterprise is developing and implementing the Single Integrated Network Environment
  (SINE) for the entire AF. The SINE will deliver the promise of full range net-centric
  capabilities, finally closing gaps and seams within the kill chain, and achieving warfighting
  advantage across the entire air, space, and terrestrial domains. AFNIC works with ESC to
  fulfill responsibilities for cradle-to-grave sustainment. AFSPC/A5 has appointed AFNIC
  Requirements Leads to support the AFSPC Command Leads to ensure life-cycle planning,
  sustainment, and resource Management cradle-to-grave activities. As AFNIC partners with
  AFSPC/A4/7, A5, A6, in the sustainment workshops and summit, these functional areas will
  be integrated and aligned to meet Command strategic goals for HQ sustainment program.
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                       23

                         ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS

5.1. Major organizational relationships.
5.1.1. MAJCOM to MAJCOM relationships.
   5.1.1.1. Air Combat Command (ACC): ACC provides combat airpower to America’s
   warfighting commands and serves as the Lead MAJCOM for the CAF (AFSPC is one of six
   MAJCOMs comprising the CAF). To support global implementation of national security
   strategy, ACC operates fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management, and electronic-
   combat aircraft. It also provides command, control, communications and intelligence
   systems, and conducts global information operations.
      5.1.1.2. As a force provider, ACC organizes, trains, equips and maintains combat-ready
      forces for rapid deployment and employment to meet the challenges of peacetime air
      sovereignty and wartime air defense. ACC NAFs provide the air component to US
      Central, Southern and Northern Commands, with HQ ACC serving as the air component
      to Joint Forces Command. ACC also provides forces to US European, Pacific and
      Strategic Command.
      5.1.1.3. The purpose of the CAF is to integrate and leverage capabilities, systems, forces
      and operations in and through all domains to deliver precise effects for the JFC across the
      full range of military operations. Under ACC leadership, the CAF members establish
      consistent, well-integrated plans, goals and priorities to ensure effective operations in air,
      space and cyberspace. The fundamental reason for strategic planning across the CAF is
      integration. The primary organization for CAF integration is the USAFWC.
      5.1.1.4. ACC provides primary funding and administration oversight of the USAFWC.
      The USAFWC reports to ACC, but works for and is responsible to all MAJCOMs and
      AFOTEC for integrated combat training; support for operational testing and evaluation;
      and advanced tactics development. AFSPC both directly supports the USAFWC
      (primarily through the SIDC) and is a “demanding customer” to advocate and establish a
      consistent set of requirements and capability development on behalf of the warfighter.
      This relationship necessitates strong communication and coordination between ACC and
      AFSPC to avoid duplication of effort, conflicting guidance, and consistent prioritization
      of requirements.
   5.1.2. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC): AFMC conducts research, development, test
   and evaluation, acquires systems, provides acquisition management support and ensures
   logistics support necessary to keep AF weapon systems ready for operations. AFMC and
   AFSPC have a supporting/supported relationships in these areas.
      5.1.2.1. Several space and space support programs are executed by AFMC product
      center personnel but fall within the AFPEO/SP portfolio. In addition, other AFSPC
      programs are executed by AFMC under ESC-led AFPEO portfolios. AFMC works
      collaboratively with AFSPC/A1, SMC and AFNIC on space and cyberspace professional
      development and acquisition career management issues.
24                                                            AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


     5.1.2.2. AFMC fulfills its mission of equipping the AF with weapon systems through
     AFRL and Centers, which are responsible for “cradle-to-grave” oversight for aircraft,
     electronic systems, missiles and munitions. Most AF weapon systems are developed and
     acquired through three AFMC product centers, Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-
     Patterson AFB; Air Armament Center at Eglin AFB; and ESC at Hanscom AFB. The
     systems are then tested at AFMC’s two test centers, the AF Flight Test Center, Edwards
     AFB and the Arnold Engineering Development Center, Arnold AFB.
     5.1.2.3. ESC acquires the bulk of the cyberspace and C2 systems needed by AFSPC;
     however, AFSPC also interacts with HQ AFMC for development planning, acquisition
     and weapons system sustainment support; with AFRL for science and technology (S&T)
     requirements; and with ESC for ground-based systems. Developmental testing is the
     responsibility of the acquirer, with independent operational test and evaluation provided
     by AFOTEC with support and interaction from the USAFWC (space and cyberspace
     components). Space and cyberspace developmental testing is performed by SMC and
     ESC in close collaboration with the SIDC Test Integration Office (STIO), ESC,
     AFOTEC, USAFWC, AFNIC and 688 IOW to ensure synchronization of developmental
     test and operational test activities.
  5.1.3. Air Education and Training Command (AETC): AETC provides basic military
  training, initial qualification training, professional continuing education and academic
  education for all MAJCOMs. While AFSPC is supported by AETC for this training and
  professional military and developmental education, the two MAJCOMs share training and
  education responsibilities.
     5.1.3.1. Second Air Force (2 AF) conducts basic military and technical training for AF
     non-flying enlisted members and officers, to include space and cyberspace operations and
     space and cyberspace maintenance personnel. Commissioned officers and enlisted
     personnel attend space and cyberspace qualification training courses provided by AETC.
     5.1.3.2. Air University (AU) provides developmental education, professional military
     education and professional continuing education to prepare graduates to develop, employ,
     command, research and champion air, space and cyberspace power at all levels. AU’s
     mission is to provide the full spectrum of AF education for officers, enlisted and civilian
     personnel. The University’s Professional Military Education (PME) programs educate
     Airmen on the capabilities of air, space, and cyberspace power and their role in national
     security. Specialized professional continuing education programs at the Eaker Center for
     Professional Development provide scientific, technological, managerial and other
     professional expertise to meet the needs of the AF.
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                 25


Figure 5.1. NSSI/ASOpS Organization




          5.1.3.2.1. The National Security Space Institute (NSSI) is part of the Eaker Center
          for Professional Development and conducts continuing education required to prepare
          space warfighters for joint military operations.       NSSI education programs
          complement ASOpS training programs to provide a broad spectrum of space courses
          both for space professionals and non-space personnel. Figure 5.1 shows the
          organization of the NSSI and the relationship with ASOpS.
          5.1.3.2.2. The NSSI prepares and teaches a comprehensive DoD space capabilities
          curriculum preparing warfighters to integrate space capabilities into joint military
          operations. As the lead agent for the execution of the education portion of the AF
          Space Professional Development Program (SPDP), the NSSI provides courses that
          emphasize the understanding of space capabilities, limitations and vulnerabilities.
          NSSI courses are prerequisites to space professional certification milestones.
      5.1.3.3. The Air Force Cyberspace Technical Center of Excellence (AFCyTCoE) at the
      Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) conducts continuing education for cyberspace
      professionals. The AFCyTCoE prepares and teaches a comprehensive cyberspace
      capabilities curriculum to prepare warfighters to integrate cyberspace capabilities into
      joint military operations.
      5.1.3.4. For its part, AFSPC establishes space and cyberspace professional standards,
      states training and education requirements to AETC, provides instructors as needed,
      advocates for training support and monitors and holds AETC accountable for meeting
      COMAFSPC training and education requirements.                AFSPC conducts mission
      qualification training (MQT), recurring/specified training and advanced weapon system
      training (ASOPS) in support of its operational missions. AFSPC/A3 provides oversight
      and guidance for space and cyberspace operational standardization, training and support
      activities.
5.2. Centers, Agencies, and Other Key Stakeholder Relationships:
   5.2.1. Electronic Systems Center (ESC): ESC designs, develops, acquires and sustains
   cyberspace, C2 and related systems and programs needed by AFSPC.
26                                                           AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


     5.2.1.1. As with the SMC/CC, the ESC/CC has two separate (but closely related) chains
     of authority, responsibility and reporting: 1) as the AFPEO- C2/CS reporting to the DAE
     and SAE; and 2) as a product center commander reporting to AFMC.
     5.2.1.2. In the acquisition chain, the AFPEO-C2/CS (ESC/CC) executes C2 and
     cyberspace programs under the direction of the SAE in accordance with statutory and
     regulatory requirements and DoD and AF policy. In some cases, the ESC/CC executes
     programs that are under the acquisition supervision of the AFPEO/Space. The AFPEO-
     C2/CS is accountable for all programs assigned that are executed by the ESC Systems
     organizations. Program execution roles and responsibilities include formulating
     programs and system solutions derived from COMAFSPC capability needs and
     requirements, as well as defining, budgeting and managing resources provided by AFSPC
     for successful program execution.          The AFPEO-C2/CS establishes contractual
     relationships with industry to execute programs and manages/monitors contract
     execution. In the AF product center chain, the ESC/CC works for and reports to
     AFMC/CC, but also reports functionally to and receives requirements from COMAFSPC
     which have been refined, validated and programmed in concert with the HAF. ESC
     implements critical processes, standards and best practices in systems engineering,
     program management, financial management, contracting, mission assurance,
     specifications and standards, and develops and manages capabilities and competencies
     for life cycle management.
     5.2.1.3. The ESC/CC is responsible and accountable to COMAFSPC for delivering
     cyberspace and C2 capabilities to perform AFSPC missions. This includes establishing
     and maintaining Development Plans and Systems Roadmaps as well as establishing
     overall space and cyberspace system sustainment and industrial base viability strategies
     in coordination with AFMC.
     5.2.1.4. ESC plays an important role in translating AFSPC operational requirements and
     concepts into systems/technical requirements and executable programs that meet cost,
     schedule, and performance and risk objectives. ESC proposes and defines systems and
     programs that provide the capabilities to meet established requirements. As the
     COMAFFOR to USSTRATCOM, COMAFSPC ensures that supported CCDR
     requirements and integrated priorities are met (with appropriate interface with the AF and
     Joint processes) while staying in concert with CSAF and SECAF direction and AF and
     AFSPC priorities.
     5.2.1.5. Once acquisition programs begin, any needed operational requirements, schedule
     and budget/funding trades are proposed by AFPEO-C2/CS and ESC, synchronized and
     orchestrated under the leadership of AFSPC and approved by COMAFSPC for HAF and
     Joint Staff consideration. This process prevents introduction of new requirements into
     approved program baselines (“requirements creep”) without specific approval from
     COMAFSPC. ESC/CC keeps COMAFSPC informed of program progress via periodic,
     formal program reviews including metrics developed by AFSPC/A5.
     5.2.1.6. ESC is the single focal point for life cycle management of cyberspace systems
     logistics and sustainment functions for AFPEO-C2/CS delivered systems. Sustainment is
     the planning, programming and executing of a support strategy for a system, subsystem
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                   27


      or major end item to maintain operational capabilities from system fielding through
      disposal.
      5.2.1.7. For cyberspace and C2 systems, ESC is responsible for coordinating sustainment
      activities for all AFSPC and USAF cyberspace systems. ESC consolidates, coordinates,
      and provides a single focal point for logistics/sustainment activities including cross
      system integration, acquisition logistics, logistics readiness, sustaining engineering and
      program support of assigned SSMs.
   5.2.2. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC): AFPC integrates and executes personnel
   operations to develop AF personnel and meet field commanders' requirements. AFPC
   supervises and directs the overall management and distribution of military officers
   (Lieutenant Colonel and below); enlisted members (Senior Master Sergeant and below); and
   civilian personnel (GS-15/equivalent and below). While the bulk of AFSPC’s interaction
   with AFPC is led by AFSPC/A1, to ensure space and cyberspace operational needs drive
   career field management practices, the AFSPC/A3 chairs the USAF 13S and 17D
   Development Team. The chair of the 17X (cyberspace) Development Team will be
   determined at a later date.
   5.2.3. Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA):
   AFISRA’s mission is to organize, train, equip and present assigned forces and capabilities to
   conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for combatant commanders and the
   nation. The 70 ISRW, 480 ISRW, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), and
   AF Technical Applications Center are aligned under AFISRA. The Commander, AFISRA, is
   currently dual-hatted as the SCC/CC, with final determination of any changes in authority to
   be determined at a later date. In that role, the SCC/CC provides oversight of service
   cryptologic activities for operational elements of 24 AF (AFCYBER).

  5.2.4. USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC): The USAFWC’s mission, directed in a CSAF-
  signed strategic charter, is to shape the way the AF fights through advanced training,
  operational testing and tactics development in air, space and cyberspace at the operational
  and tactical levels. The USAFWC reports administratively to the Commander, ACC
  (COMACC); however, per CSAF direction the USAFWC/CC works for and supports the
  USAF’s MAJCOM commanders and air, space, and cyberspace component commanders (C-
  NAF and NAF commanders who are dual-hatted as joint commanders) to supported unified
  commands. The USAFWC organization and relationships with AFSPC are shown in Figure
  5.2.
     5.2.4.1. The USAFWC is the AF’s single focal point for integrated combat training
     support for OT&E and advanced TTP development.
     5.2.4.2. COMAFSPC supports the CSAF-directed USAFWC mission and is a
     demanding customer of the USAFWC’s advanced training, operational testing, and
     tactics development missions. In that regard, HQ AFSPC works (primarily through the
     SIDC) with USAFWC to normalize USAFWC processes in support of the following
     initiatives:
     5.2.4.3. The normalization of an aggressor force expert on the adversary threats that will
     face our space and cyberspace tactical units, able to teach the threat to space and
     cyberspace tactical units, and able to replicate these threats to our tactical units in
     advanced training. The HQ AFSPC staff works with the USAFWC to identify shortfalls
     in its ability to meet the above requirements.
     5.2.4.4. The integration of tactical-level space and cyberspace capabilities and operators
     as a full-training audience into advanced training venues such as Red Flag, or other
     events as required to meet space and cyberspace advanced training requirements.
     5.2.4.5. The integration of operational-level space and cyberspace capabilities and
     operators as a full-training audience into advanced training focused on the 614 AOC and
     24 OC. The purpose of this training is to mirror equivalent USAFWC training in support
     of other AOCs in the CAF. It also includes advanced training in Virtual Flag or Blue
     Flags exercises focused on the operators and staff in our space and cyberspace operations
     centers (614 AOC and 624 OC). These training events are directed by the AFSPC
     Exercise Program.
     5.2.4.6. The integration of the required air, space and cyberspace capabilities into AF
     and Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive test and training venues.
     5.2.4.7. The normalization of air, space and cyberspace tactics development processes
     and organizations. In particular, develop COAs to ensure space and cyberspace test and
     evaluation units have the expertise and resources to also develop mission design series
     (MDS) TTPs during the OT&E process.
     5.2.4.8. The execution and coordination of a weapons systems certification process for
     space and cyberspace systems testing in support of space and cyberspace component
     commanders and HQ AFSPC.
  5.2.5. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO): The NRO develops, acquires and operates
  space-based intelligence capabilities for both the DoD and Intelligence Community. The
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                       29


   USAF has historically contributed to the NRO a substantial number of people from many
   specialties, has collaborated on critical mission operations capabilities (e.g. launch, satellite
   network support, space surveillance), has provided S&T support and continues to do so
   today. In 2006 the CSAF and Director, NRO (DNRO) established their intent regarding the
   AF-NRO relationship and proposals to enhance relations, space capabilities, and mission
   performance. Figure 5.3 shows the resulting relationship between AFSPC and the NRO.
      5.2.5.1. The AF has assigned a two-star general officer to serve as the Deputy Director,
      NRO (DDNRO). Primary duties include: senior military advisor to the DNRO; DDNRO
      acquisition responsibilities; Commander, NRO AFSPC Element (AFSPC ELEM/CC) for
      all USAF personnel assigned to the NRO with administrative reporting responsibilities to
      COMAFSPC; and NRO’s representative to COMAFSPC for AF space professional
      development actions.

Figure 5.3. Relationship of AFSPC and NRO




      5.2.5.2. All USAF personnel assigned to the NRO are under the operational control of
      the DNRO who has authoritative direction over all aspects of NRO operations and
      activities. The fact that an ADCON relationship exists between the NRO AFSPC ELEM
      and COMAFSPC does not alter this guiding tenet of the NRO.
      5.2.5.3. The NRO has assigned a senior NRO leader (one-star equivalent) to HQ AFSPC
      as the Deputy, AFSPC/A3. Primary duties include: senior NRO Advisor to
      COMAFSPC; and permanent deputy to the Director, AFSPC/A3.
   5.2.5.4. AF personnel assigned to the NRO are under the ADCON of COMAFSPC, are
   managed within existing USAF personnel management processes (e.g., AFPC assignment
   teams; “Green Door” assignment policies; assignment designations; Command Selection
   Boards, etc.) and, for USAF space professionals, are managed under guidance issued by
   COMAFSPC acting in his Space Professional Functional Authority (SPFA) role.
      5.2.5.5. NRO and AFSPC have established a Space Assignment Advisory Board to
      oversee assignments of all (O-5 and below) space professionals to include those assigned
      to the NRO. This board meets annually, is comprised of AFSPC and NRO O6s
30                                                           AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


     representing the primary career fields (acquisition, operations, communications, and
     intelligence), is co-chaired by AFSPC/CV and the DDNRO and is responsible to the
     SPFA. The objective of this Board is to strengthen the oversight and career development
     of all Space Professionals and, ultimately, to enhance mission success in AFSPC and the
     NRO.
     5.2.5.6. The NRO Office of Space Launch (OSL), SMC and 14 AF (AFSTRAT) have a
     long history of cooperation and interdependence for launch mission success. In addition,
     SMC and 14 AF (AFSTRAT) execute launch operations in collaboration with and in
     support of NRO mission requirements.
     5.2.5.7. NRO assets are operated in a support relationship between the NRO and its
     mission partners and capabilities are provided to CCDRs via established national
     intelligence tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination (TPED) processes and
     procedures.
  5.2.6. Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC): AFOTEC is
  responsible for testing and evaluating new weapon systems in realistic operational
  environments in order to provide COMAFSPC and other AFSPC decision makers a range of
  accurate, balanced and timely assessments of system effectiveness, suitability and mission
  capability. AFOTEC, with support and cooperation from AFSPC, is moving forward with
  efforts to plan and execute integrated developmental test/operations test (IDT/OT) across all
  acquisition programs, as well as making a concerted effort to maximize use of IDT/OT
  events and the sharing of relevant data. Therefore, AFOTEC will be involved and execute
  operational test design earlier than in the past in order to provide OT&E plans to program
  offices as soon as possible.
     5.2.6.1. AFOTEC, USAFWC and AFSPC share test responsibilities. As the AF
     Operational Test Agency, AFOTEC is responsible for operational test activities for
     Acquisition Category (ACAT) I, IA and II programs, and programs on the Office of the
     Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)
     Oversight List. AFSPC oversees DT&E responsibilities (through AFPEO-Space/SMC
     organizations) and leads MAJCOM OT&E responsibilities, including Tactics
     Development Evaluations (TDE), Force Development Evaluations (FDE) and
     Operational Utility Evaluations (OUE) for systems in sustainment and new acquisition
     programs for which AFSPC is the lead operational test (OT) organization.
     5.2.6.2. AFOTEC and SIDC, along with SMC, ESC and the USAFWC, work in concert
     through the STIO and Integrated Test Teams (ITT) to synchronize efforts in the
     execution of assigned OT&E of space and missile systems.
  5.2.7. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL): The AFRL mission is to lead the discovery,
  development and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for our air, space and
  cyberspace force. AFRL delivers technology options for current and next-generation air,
  space and cyberspace programs, discovering advanced technologies with potential for future
  space applications and providing quick-turn solutions for near-term operational shortfalls.
  As the Technology Executive Officer (TEO), AFRL/CC coordinates with PEOs and
  AFSPC/A5 on S&T initiatives. AFSPC provides prioritized S&T needs to the AFRL/CC, for
  incorporation into the S&T portion of the AFRL POM.
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                  31


  5.2.8. Missile Defense Agency (MDA): MDA, following SECDEF direction, initiated the
  urgent development and deployment of the integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)
  System and implemented a capabilities-based system engineering process to achieve early
  capability and ongoing evolution. AFSPC manages its role in the BMD program following
  CJCSI and AF instructions for JCIDS and capabilities-based requirements development.
  AFSPC and MDA have a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) specifying AFSPC roles in
  developing, testing, fielding, operating and sustaining the Global Ballistic Missile Defense
  System. Documents referenced in the MOA and previously signed MOAs/Memorandum of
  Understandings (MOUs) further outline roles, responsibilities, relationships and partnerships
  of the MDA, AFSPC, SMC, AFPEO/SP and AFMC.
  5.2.9. Air Force Cost Analysis Agency (AFCAA): AFCAA is a Field Operating Agency to
  SAF/FMC. They provide non-advocate cost analyses to support AF acquisition decisions.
  AFCAA works closely with AFSPC, SMC and ESC.
 32                                                             AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                                         PROCESSES

6.1. Processes: The HQ AFSPC A-Staff, with support from the NAFs and Centers, will use the
following processes to ensure effective interaction and coordination across AFSPC and with
external organizations. These processes serve as a mechanism for coordination and do not take
the place of normal staffing activities or remove accountability from the A-staff Directors.
   6.1.1. Requirements Definition Process (A5):
       6.1.1.1. . HQ AFSPC works with users and warfighters to determine requirements
       needed to fulfill operational mission capabilities identified from higher-level guidance to
       include National Security Strategy, Integrated Priority Lists, Joint Operating Concepts,
       COMAFSPC Vision, etc. The AFSPC requirements definition process is a collaborative
       activity led by AFSPC/A5, and closely supported and informed by AFSPC’s Integrated
       Planning Process, SMC, ESC and AFNIC. Using the Capability Team, the Command
       Lead oversees requirements development products IAW AFSPCI 10-103, Capabilities-
       Based Operational Requirements Guidance, in formulating and documenting
       requirements for space and cyberspace systems. After determining capability needs,
       AFSPC/A5 works with SMC/XR and other program offices/organizations to conduct
       AoAs, trade studies, etc., to determine the best way to address mission capability gaps,
       including consideration of resources and technology maturity. HQ AFSPC uses this
       information to develop capability documents (ICD, CCD, CPD), which, SMC and ESC
       use to develop technical requirements which form the basis of contracts with industry to
       develop hardware and software systems solutions.
   6.1.2. The JCIDS is closely integrated with the acquisition process and exists to identify,
   develop, and validate defense-related requirements. JCIDS implements a capabilities-based
   approach that leverages the expertise of DoD and non-DoD agencies and industry to identify,
   assess, and prioritize joint force capabilities. The process validates warfighting capability
   needs while considering the full range of materiel and non-materiel solutions. Within DoD,
   there is a distinct separation between the requirements authority and acquisition authority,
   which requires early and continual collaboration between both communities in order for the
   processes to work effectively together. AFSPC/A5 leads the JCIDS process in AFSPC, with
   involvement from all directorates as well as SMC/ESC, and other pertinent centers and
   agencies. For further information regarding the how AFSPC implements the JCIDS process,
   refer to AFSPCI 10-103, Capabilities-Based Operational Requirements Guidance.
6.2. Resource Allocation Process (A8/9): The AFSPC Corporate Process provides a
deliberative means to facilitate and coordinate development of resource allocation priorities and
decision recommendations. The process forms the basis of AFSPC positions and interaction
with HHQ resource allocation activities. The process enables responsive action while ensuring
senior leadership receives advice from relevant staff elements and subordinate commanders.
6.3. Corporate Structure and Process: The HQ AFSPC Corporate Process, described in
AFSPCHOI 16-10, is managed by AFSPC/A8/9 and provides a deliberative means to generate
programmatic courses of action for COMAFSPC. The Corporate Process is also used for other
decision forums, such as requirements.
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                     33


6.4. POM Development: AFSPC/A8/9 is responsible for developing the Command’s annual
POM, Change Proposals (CP) and President’s Budget (PB) submission and for reviewing,
revising and approving all documents relating to AFSPC’s Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).
COMAFSPC prioritizes POM submissions and submits the MAJCOM position to HAF through
the appropriate panels (Space, Cyber, Installation Support, etc.). The POM is the programming
process used to implement DoD and AF guidance for the FYDP, including manpower, force
levels, procurement, facilities and research and development. SMC, ESC and AFNIC are
supporting organizations to AFSPC/A8/9 and all submissions to the POM are submitted through
the AFSPC Corporate Process. HQ AFSPC Command Leads are involved throughout the POM
process for their respective programs. The AFSPC Corporate Process includes cost analyses
developed by AFCAA. These analyses prepare the AFSPC Group and Board to fund to the best-
known estimates and provide analytical rigor for alternatives that diverge from known estimates.
   6.4.1. The Pre-POM process begins with training conducted by AFSPC/A8PE to the
   Command Leads, Capability Teams, and PEMs in the Sep/Oct timeframe. The PEMs in
   coordination with their respective Centers (SMC, ESC, and AFNIC), produce Resource
   Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and supporting
   documentation as identified by AFSPC/A8P describing known initiatives, disconnects and/or
   offsets throughout the FYDP. The PEMs in coordination and approval with their respective
   Directorates and Command Leads forward information to AFSPC/A8P for inclusion in the
   AFSPC Corporate POM Process.
6.5. Integrated Planning Process (IPP) (A8/9): The AFSPC IPP provides coordination and
synchronization to identify and articulate AFSPC mission responsibilities, identify gaps in
mission capabilities, identify potential solutions to capability gaps, create capability roadmaps,
and analyze and propose integrated investment alternatives. The output of the IPP is a master
plan that provides guidance for AFSPC’s resource decisions and requirements development.
   6.5.1. AFSPC/A8/9 leads the AFSPC IPP to develop the AMP and corresponding
   Investment Strategy. The IPP provides direction to create, manage and validate information
   for development of AF strategic guidance documents in support of effective resource
   allocation. The IPP is AFSPC’s response to HAF direction to develop capabilities-based
   planning processes and guidance in the Air Force Strategic Planning System (AFSPS) that
   establishes reporting criteria to meet the needs of the Nation now and into the future.
6.6. Space and Cyberspace Superiority Core Function Master Plans (CFMP): The CFMPs
provide top-down strategic guidance to the AF and define the capabilities necessary to win
today's and tomorrow's conflicts. The CFMPs encompass a long-term view of AF capabilities
starting with the FYDP and ending 30 years out--defining strategies, dollars and total inventory
needed to deliver an optimized force for the CCDRs. The AF derives prioritizations and force
development data for space and cyberspace from the command's IPP, but constrained to CSAF
fiscal guidance.
6.7. Science and Technology (S&T): COMAFSPC provides S&T guidance and prioritization
to shape the space and cyberspace S&T portion of the AFRL portfolio IAW AFPD 61-1 to
provide requirements, recommended program guidance and direction to the Commander, AFRL.
The IPP provides priorities and shortfall analysis necessary to develop this guidance.
COMAFSPC requests the AFRL/CC review this guidance and provide the AFSPC S&T Council
an assessment of AFRL’s POM submission to address AFSPC’s prioritized technology needs.
 34                                                               AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   6.7.1. AFSPC/A5 leads the AFSPC S&T written guidance development process and serves
   as the AFSPC focal point for all S&T activities. Other AFSPC/A5 S&T responsibilities
   include Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations, identifying and understanding policy
   and capability implications from emergent space and cyberspace S&T; reviewing space and
   cyberspace-related S&T portfolios and innovation activities to ensure alignment with S&T
   needs; collecting space and cyberspace technology requirements from other MAJCOMs and
   CCDRs and participating in S&T reviews to verify S&T alignment with AFSPC’s IPP.
   6.7.2. A key review is the Space/Cyberspace PEO/TEO review led by respective product
   center(s) in conjunction with AFRL and AFSPC/A5. The PEO/TEO review ensures
   identification, documentation, prioritization and development of required technologies to
   meet program and development planning needs. Technology needs vetted through PEO/TEO
   reviews form the foundation for the HQ AFSPC S&T guidance document. Product center(s)
   also leverage other S&T development efforts to meet their technology needs, including:
   cooperating with AFRL in the Independent Research and Development (IR&D) program;
   conducting the AF Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) and serving as a voting
   member at the DoD SERB and developing and managing technology transition programs for
   maturing technologies.
6.8. Development Planning (DP): DP is the process used to develop potential materiel
solutions to satisfy a need. It bridges the gap between capabilities planning and program
initiation in the acquisition lifecycle model. It is responsible for supporting the definition of
future capability needs by capturing required system-performance characteristics; investigating
future threats; evaluating alternative concepts; assessing technology maturity and risk factors;
defining sustainment and life-cycle cost issues; and forming executable acquisition strategies.
   6.8.1. DP includes early system engineering, life-cycle analyses, studies and cost estimates
   in pursuit of new capabilities, from identification of a need for a potential materiel solution to
   initiation of an acquisition program. For space programs, AFSPC coordinates efforts with
   AFMC to ensure overall DP is standardized and identified across the AF. AFSPC/A5 is the
   entry point for space DP requests, and AFMC/A2/5 is the entry point for all non-space DP
   requests.
   6.8.2. SMC performs development planning for space systems in accordance with
   SAF/AQ’s Early Systems Engineering Guide to explore and develop potential space materiel
   solution concepts. Capability needs across near-, mid- and far-term horizons are provided in
   JCIDS-derived ICD and outputs from AFSPC’s IPP. SMC/XR decomposes these capability
   needs along with additional warfighter constraints, issues and goals into a bounded
   tradespace for subsequent evaluation of potential solution concepts. Each concept is
   evaluated to determine the architecture, infrastructure, enabling technologies and associated
   costs and risks to produce a candidate solution set. Using the solution sets, SMC/XR then
   generates courses of action that include first-order acquisition strategies, schedules and
   implementation plans in support of Pre-Milestone A acquisition functions. This work is
   documented in the form of Concept Characterization Technical Descriptions (CCTD) for
   potential solutions to identified gaps and shortfalls. SMC's responsibilities include providing
   baseline technical requirements for current and future space systems; developing CCTDs for
   future space programs as needed; monitoring progress of conceptual programs and providing
   data to maintain currency for DP working group/board and council consideration.
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                     35


   6.8.3. ESC performs development planning for cyberspace and C2 materiel solutions.
   AFSPC/A5 is responsible for coordination and oversight of AFSPC DP efforts and requests
   ESC support through AFMC/A2/5. AFSPC/A5 works with the appropriate Command Lead
   and AFNIC to compile information and support needed for submission to AFMC/A2/5. ESC
   maintains a close working relationship with AFSPC/A5 for AFSPC-led cyberspace
   programs.
6.9. Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E): DT&E demonstrates systems feasibility,
confirms engineering design and development are complete, minimizes design risks, and ensures
systems perform as required in their intended environments. DT&E results support weapon
system life cycle decisions and certification of the system as ready for dedicated AF Initial
Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).
   6.9.1. SMC has acquisition responsibility that includes directing DT&E and facilitating
   integrated testing. DT&E is conducted throughout the acquisition and sustainment processes
   to assist in engineering design and development, and to verify that Critical Technical
   Parameters (CTP) have been achieved.
   6.9.2. Similarly, ESC develops and acquires major weapon systems for AFSPC. Their
   respective PEOs have acquisition responsibility to include directing DT&E and facilitating
   integrated testing.
   6.9.3. DT&E supports the acquisition of materiel or operational capabilities before Full-Rate
   Production (FRP) or fielding decisions. After FRP or fielding, DT&E supports the
   sustainment of systems to extend their useful life, performance, and capabilities. DT&E
   activities should be conducted in environments that are as operationally relevant as practical
   without compromising engineering integrity, safety, or security.
   6.9.4. Collaboration and early tester involvement are the cornerstones to achieving
   “Capabilities Based T&E” for Space Systems. AFI 99-103 defines the ITT as the mechanism
   to achieve collaboration and seamless verification of system performance. Additionally, even
   before an ITT is formed, testers must be involved early on in all acquisition and sustainment
   programs to infuse testability and operational realism into requirements development while
   ensuring test assets are available to test the potential capability.
6.10. Architecture Development: Architectures provide a holistic view of a set of capabilities
to better enable system-wide design and development. Architectures are used for understanding
space and cyberspace as an enterprise; identification of operational requirements; rationalization
of IT investment decisions; and improvements to interoperability among various systems.
AFSPC’s approach is organized around integrated architecture models that provide standardized
viewpoints with traceable architecture elements usable by DoD organizations, including AFSPC,
to support mission requirements. AFSPC is responsible for architectures within the space and
cyberspace domains. HQ AFSPC Command Leads assume the responsibility for their mission
area architecture and associated DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) viewpoints.
   6.10.1. Command Leads develop architecture viewpoints for each mission area delineated by
   the AFSPC Capability Teams. The intent of the mission area architecture is to support all
   other MAJCOM processes to optimize systems and families of systems to provide maximum
   capability to the warfighter within the context of the overall mission area and fiscal
   constraints. These products specifically serve production of operational requirements and
 36                                                            AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   functional, enabling and operating concepts that yield compatible, effective combinations of
   military mission systems and capabilities traced to mission needs.
   6.10.2. Command Leads are responsible for creating system-specific operational architecture
   viewpoints. These viewpoints add system requirements detail to the overall MAJCOM
   mission area architecture.
   6.10.3. Acquisition agents are responsible for system and technical architectures.
   Acquisition agents ensure fully traceable architecture elements demonstrate successful
   accomplishment of the mission area architecture. SMC is the acquisition agent for AF space
   systems; ESC is the acquisition agent for command and control, combat support systems and
   cyberspace systems. These organizations are responsible for describing and maintaining the
   current as well as future system architecture baselines for their respective portfolios within
   the mission area architectures.
   6.10.4. AFSPC/A6 is responsible for establishing policies, procedures, guidelines and a
   governance structure to oversee HQ AFSPC and lower-level architecture activities.
   AFSPC/A6 also reviews and recommends certification of architectures developed by
   assigned/responsible organizations, such as SMC, ESC, AFNIC or that fall within the
   purview of their assigned portions of the AF Enterprise Architecture (i.e., cyberspace
   infrastructure). In addition, AFSPC/A6 shall ensure an Architect is appointed to oversee
   AFSPC architecture development activities, ensure architecture compliance and serve as lead
   for AFSPC architecture governance bodies. HQ AFSPC, SMC, ESC and AFNIC shall
   develop and maintain architectures for designated portions of the AF Enterprise Architecture
   and use the architectures as an authoritative source to support AFSPC execution of AF
   processes. HQ AFSPC ensures that the architectures are consistent with the AF Enterprise
   Architecture, including AF activities, IT standards and profiles. For their respective
   portfolios, SMC, ESC and AFNIC shall publish certified and under-development AFSPC
   architecture metadata and contact information to the Air Force Federal Acquisition
   Regulation Supplement (AFFARS). This ensures full life cycle visibility of architectures and
   their components from initial development, through certification, and subsequent evolution.
   6.10.5. In support of cyberspace activities, AFSPC/A6 established the AF Cyberspace
   Architecture Collaboration Forum to provide collaboration and coordination of cyberspace
   architecture development. AFSPC/A6, as the AFSPC CIO, has responsibilities for
   developing architecture governance and identifying supporting processes for cyberspace
   architectures. It also establishes a virtual repository for all AF cyberspace architecture
   products and tools and help integrate cyberspace architecting into the existing HQ AFSPC
   Enterprise Architect and corporate processes. In conjunction with the cyberspace
   architecture community, including AFNIC, AFSPC/A6 develops and maintains the
   cyberspace mission and domain architectures.
6.11. Concept Development: Concept development provides the cornerstone for planning and
acquisition of space capabilities. Per AFSPCI 10-102, Concept Development, AFSPC will not
pursue acquisition programs without thought out and approved concepts. Concepts describe the
ways that we employ military means to accomplish desired ends. As ideas mature into
requirements and funded programs, concepts mature in detail and lead the requirements and
acquisition processes. Success is measured by how well concepts are developed, prototyped and
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                    37


integrated into the joint force. AFSPC concepts are developed IAW AFSPCI 10-102 and
consistent with existing higher-level guidance as applicable.
   6.11.1. AFSPC develops concepts IAW AFSPCI 10-102 to support strategic planning and
   capability development. AFSPC/A8/9 leads functional concept development to support the
   IPP and maintain linkage to capabilities listed in AF-level operating concepts and AF CFMP.
   These AF-level concepts link capability efforts to joint warfighter needs expressed in the
   Family of Joint Operating Concepts. Command Leads follow AFSPCI 10-102 to develop
   enabling and operating concepts to ensure requirements activities have an operationally
   focused expression of specific ends, ways and means that can achieve effects desired by the
   warfighter. Additionally, HQ AFSPC works closely with USSTRATCOM, 14 AF
   (AFSTRAT), 24 AF (AFCYBER) and other operational elements in the development of
   warfighter CONOPS. The concept development process ensures we have sound, joint-
   warfighting operational context to drive subsequent planning, requirements and acquisition
   efforts.
6.12. Rapid Capability Development and Fielding: Urgent needs are addressed through
innovative employment, modification of existing systems, rapid prototyping and tactical
exploitation of emerging technologies, or the rapid development and deployment of small,
responsive systems through the AF TENCAP. System concepts are collected through various
means such as consulting previously generated concepts, requesting industry responses and
consulting with other DoD, government and non-profit organizations. Both materiel and non-
materiel solutions are solicited. The Director AFSPC/A3 will approve the AF TENCAP
investment strategy to better align the activities to the broader operational needs of AFSPC and
the AF. The Director AFSPC/A3 will integrate planning, programming, development, testing and
implementation between AF TENCAP projects, AFSPC development activities, and core Major
Force Programs.
   6.12.1. Operational Responsive Space (ORS): The 2007 National Defense Authorization
   Act and USSTRATCOM CONOPS for ORS created a set of capabilities to meet urgent
   CCDR needs.
       6.12.1.1. AFSPC/A5 works with the ORS Office and USSTRATCOM to formulate
       system requirements in response to urgent ORS needs and plans to meet future needs for
       rapid augmentation and reconstitution.
       6.12.1.2. SMC/XR provides long-range plans supporting operationally responsive space
       system concepts in response to CCDR urgent needs.
       6.12.1.3. SMC’s Space Development and Test Directorate is the executing organization
       for AFSPC ORS solutions.
   6.12.2. Rapid Cyber Acquisition: The rapid cyber acquisition process is a joint AFSPC and
   AFMC effort to ensure delivery of cyberspace capabilities at the speed of need.
       6.12.2.1. A three-tiered construct, across the entire life cycle, provides the
       responsiveness to meet cyberspace timelines. From providing real-time, operator-run,
       quick reaction capability, to rapid acquisition (weeks to months) of urgent capability and
       finally the foundational, JCIDS/DoD 5000 process for major AF-wide systems.
 38                                                             AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


   6.12.3. Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Process (WRAP): The AF WRAP is part of a larger
   effort to make the acquisition system more responsive to changing needs of the warfighter
   and rapid technological advances. AFSPC/A5 is the OPR for the WRAP. AFSPC/A5 does
   an annual call for submittals, validates and prioritizes proposals for nomination for funding.
   The proposals are approved by AFSPC/CV or his designee. AF WRAP accomplishes the
   following objectives: accelerates the development and fielding of operational initiatives
   resulting from innovation; speeds the initiation decision and funding allocation for a small
   number of competitively selected projects that either increase capability or significantly
   reduce cost; transition funding is allocated in the execution year to support selected projects
   for up to two years.
   6.12.4. Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON): The JUON process is a time sensitive
   means to support a CCDR involved in a combat-related (ongoing) operation. It provides a
   method of rapidly validating, resourcing and fielding urgent operational solutions, which are
   outside the Services normal processes. JUON assets should prevent combat loss of life or a
   combat mission failure. AFSPC/A5 is the OPR for the JUON process. AFSPC/A5 works
   with the Command Leads and stakeholders as needed to develop a response IAW AFI 10-601
   guidance.
   6.12.5. JUON assets should not involve technology development; however, the acceleration
   of an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) or minor modification to an existing
   COTS/GOTS system, which allows it to be used for a new mission, is permissible. This
   process is documented in CJCSI 3470.01, Rapid Validation and Resourcing of Joint Urgent
   Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of Execution.
6.13. Space Systems Sustainment: COMAFSPC has overall authority/responsibility for space
sustainment activities. AFSPC manages the Logistics Requirements Determination Process
(LRDP) used to plan, budget and execute Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM);
Sustaining Engineering; Technical Orders and Contract Logistics Support (CLS) requirements.
AFSPC/A4/7 is responsible for LRDP and conducts the AFSPC Logistics Panel to prioritize
requirements. In addition, AFSPC/A4/7 is responsible for developing and coordinating life cycle
logistics and maintenance policy and guidance governing all space systems and the network
portion of AFSPC-unique enterprise systems. AFSPC/A4/7, in collaboration with AFNIC as
applicable, serves as the primary interface with AFMC/A4 for sustainment and maintenance
management issues to include, but not limited to, Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM)
policy, Depot Source of Repair (DSOR), Centralized Asset Management (CAM), maintenance,
supply chain management, technical orders and support equipment. AFSPC/A4/7, in
collaboration with SMC and ESC, shall establish overall space system sustainment and industrial
base strategies and coordinate with HQ AFMC.
   6.13.1. SMC’s Space Logistics Group (SLG) is responsible to the AFPEO/SP as the single
   focal point for all space logistics/sustainment activities to include, but not limited to, cross
   system integration, logistics readiness, sustaining engineering and program support of
   assigned System Sustainment Managers (SSMs). The SLG will collaborate with SMC/PI on
   acquisition logistics activities for systems in development.
   6.13.2. SMC and ESC program offices work directly with the AFSPC Command Leads and
   Capability Teams and are responsible for budgeting for and conducting space system
   sustainment, executing configuration management responsibilities for assigned systems,
AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011                                                                     39


   providing technical expertise to resolve sustainment issues and maintaining operational
   safety, suitability and effectiveness . System Program Managers (SPMs) retain system
   management responsibility throughout the life cycle. A SSM, who reports directly to the
   SPM, performs sustainment management activities as assigned by the SPM per AFI 63101.
6.14. Cyberspace Sustainment: COMAFSPC has overall authority and responsibility for
sustainment of the AFNET, excluding end user devices.
   6.14.1. AFSPC/A4/7, in collaboration with AFSPC/A6, 24 AF (AFCYBER) and AFNIC,
   establishes overall cyberspace system sustainment strategies (fixed and deployed) and
   coordinates with ESC. AFSPC/A4/7, in concert with AFSPC/A6 and AFNIC, provides
   sustainment support for AFSPC cyberspace systems. AFSPC/A4/7 and AFNIC, in
   coordination with ESC and the 689 CCW, are responsible for expeditionary communications
   sustainment as well as developing and coordinating life cycle logistics and maintenance
   policy and guidance governing expeditionary communications systems. Additionally,
   AFSPC/A4/7 develops, implements and sustains support policies and plans.
   6.14.2. AFSPC/A4/7 and AFNIC, in coordination with ESC, are responsible for
   expeditionary communications sustainment as well as developing and coordinating life cycle
   logistics requirements, developing and implementing plans, and MAJCOM maintenance
   policy and guidance governing expeditionary communications systems cyberspace systems.
   AFSPC/A4/7 develops, implements and sustains support policies and plans.
   6.14.3. AFSPC/A4/7, in collaboration with AFSPC/A6, 24 AF (AFCYBER) and AFNIC,
   supports development of fixed AFNET infrastructure life cycle logistics.
6.15. Controlling Operational Baselines: The Operational Baseline for mission critical
systems is the approved configuration baseline (specifications, drawings and software listings) at
system turnover from the acquiring organization to the operational unit. The SPM establishes
the operational baseline during development and updates and maintains it as changes (threat,
operational usage, aging, maintenance, etc.) and improvements are made to the system or end
item. The SPM is the decision authority for changes to system configurations and baselines per
AFI 63-1201. Changes to the operational baseline require approval through the Configuration
Control Board (CCB) process. Key participants include the Command Leads/Capability Teams,
program offices, operational units and the Space Logistics Group or ESC SSMs.
6.16. Space Industrial Base Assessment: SMC monitors industrial base risks through
interfacing and collaborating with our space suppliers, other space agencies, industry forums and
Working Groups (WGs). In addition, SMC identifies potential technology and economic risks
by collaborating with the Space Industrial Base Council (SIBC); the Critical Technologies
Working Group (CTWG); the Parts, Material and Process (PMP) WG; and the Space Parts and
Space Power WGs. SMC advocates for funding for identified industrial base risks from various
sources, including S&T and Productization and Qualification (P&Q) funding from multiple
agencies and programs to mitigate risks.
6.17. Acquisition Support to Other Organizations: Several programs executed by
AFPEO/SP fall outside AFSPC mission area responsibility. Non-space programs executed
within the AFPEO/SP portfolio follows non-space program reporting chains, guidance and
regulations. DP and other A-Staff functions (i.e., requirements, planning and programming) are
 40                                                      AFSPCI 90-102 16 JUNE 2011


the responsibility (oversight and funding) of the owning MAJCOM. Investment funding will
continue to flow through AFSPC as a materiel command, and SMC organizations executing
those programs will utilize SMC functional support.

Terms
Administrative Control (ADCON)—Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or
other organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service
forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and
unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included
in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
Capability Development Document (CDD)—The CDD contains the information needed to
develop a system that will provide the capabilities required by the warfighter. It will result in an
affordable capability that can be effectively acquired, supported, and deployed
Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH)—That authority granted by a commander (any level)
to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within or
outside of the granting command. Direct liaison authorized is more applicable to planning than
operations and always carries with it the requirement of keeping the commander granting direct
liaison authorized informed. Direct liaison authorized is a coordination relationship, not an
authority through which command may be exercised.
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—The ICD establishes the need for a materiel solution to
address a capability gap identified during the JCIDS analysis. It is supported by the FAA, FNA,
and FSA.
Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)—The individual designated to approve entry of an
acquisition program into the next phase.
Milestones—Major decision points that separate the phases of an acquisition program.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command. Operational control may be delegated and is the authority to
perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and
employing commands and forces, assigning task, designating objectives, and giving authoritative
direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish
missions assigned to the command.
