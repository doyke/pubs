     facilities of AEDC. These requirements, requests, or inquiries are coordinated with the
     cognizant squadrons of the 704 TG: 716 TS, 717 TS, 718 TS, as well as the Technology
     Division (AEDC/XRS) of the Capabilities Integration Directorate (AEDC/XR). Upon
     determination that a test contract will be required (see the AEDC Testing Matrix at

  contracts will fully participate in these conferences as necessary.
  2.6. The appropriate Directors/Commanders of the 716 TS, 717 TS, 718 TS, or AEDC/XRS
  are responsible for:
     2.6.1. Ensuring that customers comply with AEDC Safety, Health, and Environmental
     Standards A4, System Safety, and A6, User and Subcontractor Safety, and others as
     applicable.    An assessment and quantification of the risk of property damage to the
     AEDC test facilities, and customer test article as a result of the proposed testing. This
     amount will be included in the test contract as the amount of property damage liability
     insurance required of the user.
     2.6.2. A Statement of Work or Project Plan for incorporation into the contract; and
     2.6.3. If a non-Federal customer, a validated copy of the customer’s certification that no
     other commercial facilities exist or are not capable of supporting their requirements, or
     2.6.4. If a DoD customer, a copy of the contract for which their testing supports a
     Department of Defense program, containing specific language providing for testing or
     work at AEDC (this copy is required in order to provide testing for industry at the DoD
     customer rate).
  2.7. With full coordination of the cognizant project manager, AEDC/PKP will negotiate an
  AEDC Test Contract. AEDC Form 849, AEDC Test Contracts, will be used as the cover
  page for the contract. The test contract will incorporate a Statement of Work or Project Plan,
  the current contract clauses developed by AEDC/PKP, and any other provisions
  deemed necessary to protect the Government’s interest.
  2.8. The 716 TS, 717 TS, 718 TS, or AEDC/XRS will ensure that the document issued to the
  Operating Contractor reflects the requirements of the test contract. The Contracting Officer
  will be notified immediately of any changes required in the test contract as a result of a
  requirement for additional effort, an overrun or under run of funding, and/or incidents
  regarding the contractor or the contractor’s test article. A copy of the Operating Contractor’s
  final completion notice shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer by the appropriate
  manager.

     status reports.
     2.8.3. The financial representative responsible to their organization will verify final
     costs after receipt of a final completion notice and advise the Contracting Officer of
     the final contract costs. The Contracting Officer will amend the contracts as
     required to reflect these final costs. Receipt of the test contract modification will
     constitute the authority to refund any remaining funds to the contractor.
