                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Objectives. The Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program is the commander’s tool
to validate mission readiness and the effectiveness of unit flying, to include documentation of
individual aircrew member qualifications and capabilities. For the purposes of this instruction,
the National Guard Bureau (NGB) is considered a Major Command (MAJCOM).
1.2. General. This instruction establishes requirements for all C-32B aircrew flight evaluations
and outlines aircrew standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) grading criteria. Conduct all
evaluations In Accordance With (IAW) the provisions of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-202V2,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program and applicable supplements.
1.3. Key words and definitions.
     1.3.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. “Should” is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.3.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. “Note” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.4. Applicability. This AFI applies to all 150 SOS assigned and attached aircrew members.
1.5. Distribution. This instruction is distributed to C-32B units through Air Force publication
distribution channels. The OPR upon specific request and justification makes distribution
outside Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).
1.6. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send to
150 SOS/DOV, on an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. 150
SOS/DOV will coordinate all changes through AFSOC/A3VS and NGB/A3T.
1.7. Waivers. Waiver authority for changes to this publication is as specified in AFI 11-202,
Vol 2. Unless otherwise specified, waiver authority for a specific individual aircrew member
requirement is the MAJCOM /A3. Submit requests for waivers to this instruction through
stan/eval channels to NGB/A3T or AFSOC/A3VS as appropriate. Post all waivers to this
instruction in the individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) behind Tab 2.
1.8. Supplements: Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard
evaluation profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. Coordinate
supplements for approval IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2. Any unit developed supplements to this
AFSOCI will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/A3VS for publication approval.
1.9. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an
instructor or flight examiner. Document certification on the AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
Certifications, and file in the individual’s FEF behind Tab 1. The squadron commander,
Stan/Eval assigned personnel, or the instructor completing the training will sign the AF Form
4348. Refer to AFI 11-2C-32BV1, C-32B Aircrew Training for a current listing of instructor

AFI11-2C-32BV2 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                 5


1.10. Evaluation procedures. Flight examiners will use the evaluation criteria in this volume
to conduct all flight and Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and
objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
criteria. The flight examiner should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations to
ensure the most comprehensive evaluation. However, if conditions warrant, the flight examiner
may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation.
   1.10.1. Prior to the flight, the flight examiner will explain the purpose of the evaluation and
   how it will be conducted. Any unique evaluator inputs to the panned profile should be
   communicated to the examinee no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled mission brief. The
   examinee will accomplish all mission planning. The flight examiners will be furnished a
   copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they deem
   necessary.
   1.10.2. The flight examiner will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During
   the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
   deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and any required additional
   training.
   1.10.3. The flight examiner will use the standards and performance parameters are contained
   in this instruction.
   1.10.4. The flight examiner will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of
   smooth air and a stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances;
   provided the examinee apply prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize
   flying safety. The evaluator will consider cumulative deviations when determining the
   overall grade.
   1.10.5. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Stan/Eval
   Program (as supplemented). Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in
   arriving at the overall grade.
1.11. Flight Evaluation Worksheets. Locally generated evaluation worksheets will be used
during the evaluation. The AFSOC Form 48, Qualification Evaluation, will be the template for
production of the C-32B worksheets. Only worksheets approved by Headquarters (HQ)
AFSOC/A3VS are to be used.

                                             Chapter 2

                                      GRADING SYSTEMS

2.1. Overall Qualification Levels:
     2.1.1. Refer to the tables in Chapter 4 of this AFI for basic qualification, mission
     qualification, and instructor qualification (all area and sub-areas) used to determine an
     overall rating of “qualified” for aircrew members at their respective crew positions.
     2.1.2. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1, Qualified). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
     performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances. This
     will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies
     are noted if:
        2.1.2.1. The discrepancies resulted in no more than a “Q-“grade being given in any
        area(s)/sub area(s).
        2.1.2.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude the
        awarding of an overall Q-1.
        2.1.2.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief for
        that evaluation.
     2.1.3. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2, Qualified). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability
     to perform duties safely, but:
        2.1.3.1. There were one or more area(s)/sub area(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        2.1.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
        performance in one or several areas/sub areas.
     2.1.4. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3, Unqualified). The aircrew member demonstrated an
     unacceptable level of safety, judgment, performance or knowledge.
        2.1.4.1. An overall “Q-3” can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there
        is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. NOTE: Safety
        consciousness, boldface emergency procedures and judgment areas/sub areas are
        considered critical for all crewmembers. If one of these sub areas is graded U, then the
        overall grade for the evaluation will be Q-3.
2.2. Area/Sub area Grades: Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
     2.2.1. Q (Qualified). A “Q” is the desired level of performance. The examinee
     demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties
     within the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
     2.2.2. Q- (Qualified). A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
     area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
     Minor deviations from established standards that did not jeopardize mission accomplishment
     or flight safety.
AFI11-2C-32BV2 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             7


  2.2.3. U (Unqualified). U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside
  allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
  affect mission accomplishment or compromise flight safety. An examinee receiving an
  area/sub area grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the
  flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance,
  it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.

   4.3.1. Instructor candidates will be qualified in all sub areas they will instruct and are
   expected to meet the standards outlined in Tables 4.5, 4.10 and 4.14 Instructor candidates
   will be evaluated on instructor performance during a representative sample of maneuvers
   and/or tasks. The examinee will demonstrate the ability to instruct in a safe and effective
   manner. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW applicable technical
   orders, instructions, and directives.
   4.3.2. The flight examiner should not normally act as a student. The flight examiner may act
   as a student during maneuvers/tasks where there are significant safety concerns. Accomplish
   initial instructor evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible. When
   students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition requirements prevent
   inclusion of students, the flight examiner may serve as the student for the purpose of
   evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability. Aircrew members designated as instructors
   will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all recurring evaluations.
   4.3.3. Instructor pilot candidates will demonstrate each type of landing applicable to the
   aircraft from the instructor position. Evaluate instructor pilot candidate’s instructional ability
   during a representative sample of emergency and instrument procedures, mission maneuvers,
   and all special qualifications they will instruct. Pilots will be aircraft commander qualified in
   a special qualification prior to an instructor qualification/certification in that qualification.
   4.3.4. For CEAs, accomplish the initial instructor evaluation on a mission that permits
   accomplishment of all required instructor sub areas (if possible).
   4.3.5. A re-qualification instructor evaluation is required if a previously qualified instructor
   has been administratively downgraded or has not performed flying duties in the specific
   Mission Design Series for more than 6 months. If required, the re-qualification instructor
   evaluation may be combined with the basic re-qualification evaluation.
4.4. Flight Examiners: The evaluator crew position is a certification, not a qualification. Refer
to MAJCOM supplements to AFI 11-202V2 for specific guidance.
   4.4.1. Evaluators will meet the same criteria as instructors. Additionally, they will have an
   expert knowledge of all applicable instructions and set exemplary standards during
   evaluations.

   4.4.2. Evaluators are certified IAW AFI 11-202V2 (as supplemented), and AFI 11-2C-
   32BV2. Evaluators will be instructor qualified in a given event prior to acting as an
   evaluator in that event. Certified evaluators who subsequently add special qualification
   instructor or other instructor qualifications (e.g., AAR) are automatically certified to evaluate
   these new qualifications.
4.5. Verbal Evaluation of Sub Areas. Applicable evaluation forms show the sub areas that
need to be evaluated for specific evaluations. Make every effort to evaluate all sub areas through
actual performance. When this is not possible, evaluate the sub areas verbally. The unit chief of
Stan/Eval and the flight examiner decide if the evaluation is complete. For pilot evaluations, do
not verbally evaluate takeoff, approaches, landings or air-to-air refueling.
4.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations. For EPE contents, refer to applicable crewmember
grading criteria in the tables in section four of this regulation. All aircrew members are
responsible for understanding and applying proper emergency action procedures applicable to
their crew position. EPE may be performed in-flight or verbally. The flight examiner will assign
an overall EPE grade of 1 or 3 in the qualification ground phase block of the AF Form 8,
regardless of whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed in-flight. NOTE: The
following tables identify criteria for an evaluation to be considered Q-1.
