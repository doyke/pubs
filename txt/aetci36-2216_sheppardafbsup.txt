This instruction implements and extends the guidance in AFPD 36-22, Air Force Military
Training. It establishes procedures and responsibilities for training in military standards and
discipline for non-prior service (NPS) enlisted and officer students in initial skills resident
training courses. This instruction applies to training locations aligned under Second Air Force (2
AF), Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF), and technical training courses located at Air University and
the 59th Medical Wing (59 MDW). It applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) members attending technical and flying training. Throughout this
instruction, aircrew member students are defined as students attending any 1AXXX 3 skill-level
awarding course. Basic military training (BMT), officer and prior service enlisted aircrew
training, the Inter-American Air Forces Academy, and the Defense Language Institute at

also ensure students meet all Air Force requirements for standards and discipline. Wing
commanders may temporarily exempt students from Transition Period requirements when
conditions are deemed unsafe (such as temporary hazards and any extreme weather conditions or
warnings). The responsible commander may also exempt any student participating in simulators,
flights, or hot training from duty hour, PT, meal, and transportation provisions of this instruction
for those days where crew rest instructions take precedence.

Commanders responsible for implementing this instruction may supplement it to establish
specific implementing procedures including clock hour adjustments for different shifts. Any
training and/or operations group, geographically separated unit (GSU), operating location (OL),
or detachment (Det) may request a waiver of any portion of this instruction on a case-by-case
basis. A waiver must be submitted when commanders want to modify (add or restrict) Airmen’s
privileges. NOTE: A waiver remains in effect until the approving official cancels it in writing
or revises the publication. When the publication is revised, the requester must renew the waiver.
Send suggested changes to this instruction (via Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication), proposed supplements, and waiver requests to HQ AETC/A3PV, 1 F

Section A—Introduction

1. Standards and Discipline. Training and/or operations group commanders will ensure all
graduates meet Air Force requirements of standards and discipline. Note: Items permitting
training/operations group commanders latitude to determine requirements, in writing, will be
determined by 59 TRS/CC for the 59 MDW and 82 TRW/CC, through 82 TRW/TO for the 82
TRW. Programs will be designed to reinforce training initiated during BMT and officer training
and to continually emphasize core values, equal opportunity and treatment, and environmental
awareness. Failure to observe prohibitions and mandatory provisions of this publication in
paragraphs 7 through 11 by NPS Airmen is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ).
2. Purpose and Objectives. Military training adapts non-prior service (NPS) Airmen and
officer students to military life and provides the Air Force with highly trained, motivated, self-
disciplined, and physically fit Airmen with exceptional military bearing. Each training and/or
operations group will implement a core program that includes the following elements:

18. Airman Leader Program Requirements and Procedures:
   18.1. The purpose of an Airman leader is to assist MTLs, improve Airman morale, and
   enhance personal leadership skills. Airman leaders supervise or monitor personnel assigned
   to their squadron or placed under their charge. Airmen leaders have the authority to pull an
   AETC Form 341 from any NPS Airman and turn it into their squadron MTL. Note: Airmen
   First Class will be considered first to perform Airman leader duties before looking at other
   ranks. If the Airman leader requirement exceeds the number of assigned A1Cs, or if an A1C
   is ineligible, then Airman leaders may be selected from the ranks of Airman and,
   subsequently, Airman Basic until the requirement can be filled with qualified A1Cs.
   Ineligibility for A1Cs will be documented on AETC Form 77, Airman Leader
   Application/Certification.
   18.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Airman Leader Program Binder and AETC Form 77, Airman
   Leader Application/Certification, will be standardized. Table of Contents and a sample of
   AETC Form 77 will be provided by 82 TRW/TOM.
   18.2. Airman Leader training must not interfere with an Airman’s progress in academic
   training. Airman Leaders will have a minimum 80 percent grade average or, if member has
   no grade average, be progressing satisfactorily. The assistant flight chief or higher will
   approve candidates to become Airman Leaders after a CTF review and personal interview.
   The following review criteria should be considered: disciplinary infractions, BMT report
   card, instructor recommendations, and past leadership experience.
   18.3. Airmen may become Airman Leaders prior to receiving a grade average. However,
   they must meet academic requirements and maintain a minimum 80 percent grade average
   once they begin their academic training.
   18.3. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Grade averages will be tracked monthly and kept on file in
   the Airmen Leader book for 30 days on all Airman Leaders. Note: Dets and GSU that
   operate on a GO/NO-GO system will ensure the Airmen Leaders meet the current “GO”
   status monthly.
   18.4. Grade averages and satisfactory progress will be verified prior to receiving the yellow
   or red rope.
   18.5. The Airman Leader program consists of three phases: Phase I is receiving and
   reviewing the Airman Leader guide (ALG); Phase II is attending the Airman Leader course
   (ALC) conducted by the MTSF, and Phase III is continuation training in the squadron. A
AETCI36-2216_SHEPPARDAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                      27


   GSU assistant flight chief or higher may authorize one-on-one training due to the limited
   number of Airmen. There is no time limit for the material presented in the ALC.
   18.6. Candidates will be issued the ALG (HO ALG 1) prior to class start. The ALG may be
   adjusted to meet local conditions. Note:             The ALG may be found at
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-ED-AE-51.
   Airman leader candidates must familiarize themselves with the contents of the guide before
   attending class.
   18.6. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Airman Leader candidates must receive the Airman Leader
   Guide three days prior to class start date in order to familiarize themselves with the contents
   of the guide before attending class.
   18.7. MTSF and GSU MTLs will evaluate candidates on drill according to AETC Form 77,
   Airman Leader Application/Certification, or designate a squadron MTL to do so. Airman
   leaders will be evaluated on open ranks prior to assuming yellow rope.
   18.7. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Airman Leaders must be evaluated on road guard procedures
   prior to assuming green rope (to include Dets if applicable).
   18.8. Airmen must attend and successfully pass ALC prior to receiving Airman Leader
   status. Airman leader status will be determined by the assistant flight chief or higher when
   reclassified or in continuation technical training. Airmen who continue in Airman Leader
   status will be briefed on local conditions.
   18.8. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Submit AETC Forms and/or a roster of Airmen scheduled to
   attend the ALC. Forms must be signed and/or stamped by the appropriate personnel. Roster
   and forms are due to 82 TRW/TOM no later than 1200 on the Wednesday prior to the
   scheduled class date.
   18.9. If locations have a written exam, questions will be compiled from the ALG.
   18.10. The Assistant Flight Chief or higher will remove Airman Leader status from Airmen
   who abuse their authority or fail to perform assigned duties. As a minimum, removal of
   Airman Leader status will be documented on AETC Form 341 or AETC Form 77.
   18.11. If an Airman Leader’s grade average falls below 80 percent or he or she fails to
   satisfactorily progress, he or she may continue in Airman Leader status until the next block
   test or retest. Results from the block test or retest will determine continued Airman Leader
   status.
   18.12. Only an assistant flight chief or higher may reinstate Airman Leader status.
   18.13. Green ropes (bay chiefs and element leaders) are typically responsible for all Airmen
   assigned to a dormitory bay and/or element, Yellow ropes (floor ropes and flight leaders) are
   typically responsible for all Airmen assigned to a dormitory floor and/or flight. Red ropes
   (shift leaders) are responsible for all Airmen assigned to a shift or squadron. Airman Leaders
   must progress through each rope color before assuming the next higher position.
19. Authorized Aiguillettes for NPS Airmen:

                    DIETARY SUPPLEMENT HAZARD FACT SHEET

DD/MM/YY
MEMORANDUM FOR STUDENTS
FROM: XX TRG/CC
SUBJECT: Dietary Supplement Hazards
1. Due to the possibility of heat injuries associated with dietary supplement use in conjunction
with the physically demanding training environment, it is highly recommended that as a student
in training you refrain from using any dietary supplement (DS) that could cause or increase the
risk of suffering a medical condition (i.e., dehydration, increased blood pressure, seizures, etc.)
associated with such supplements.
2. Dietary supplements can be marketed and sold without scientific proof of safety,
effectiveness, ingredient purity, precise supplement composition, and lack of contaminants.
Many DS have side effect profiles similar to those of controlled, prescription medications.
Further, recent research on DS has shown that most have little or no health benefit, while being
able to produce serious side effects in some users. Due the risks that DS pose to training
capability and mission readiness, it is highly recommended that you do not use any DS. This
recommendation applies to all products and/or ingredients specifically marketed to induce
weight loss, gain muscle mass, boost energy and enhance performance. As an Airman in
training, it is recommended that you only use DS that have been prescribed or administered by a
military medical professional, multi-vitamins, or protein only supplements (in which the only
active ingredient is soy, whey, or casein protein).
3. If you decide to take a DS other than the ones listed above, you are required to notify your
MTL prior to taking the DS. The reason for this requirement is so your academic instructors or
MTL can notify medical professionals if you suffer from a medical condition and cannot inform
a medical professional due to unconsciousness or delirium. If you fail to disclose the use of DS,
you will be in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Failure to Obey
Order or Regulation. Unauthorized DS use may result in discipline action under the UCMJ
and/or administration action, including discharge from the United States Air Force.
