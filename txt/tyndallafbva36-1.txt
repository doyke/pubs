                   Promoting mutual respect and cooperation among all persons to
                           enhance mission effectiveness and readiness.

          The EO staff supports Team Tyndallâ€™s mission effectiveness by
          promoting Equal Employment Opportunity, through Human
          Relations Education (HRE), an environment free from personal,
          social, or institutional barriers that can prevent USAF members
          from rising to the highest level of responsibility possible based on
          their individual merit, fitness, and capability.
