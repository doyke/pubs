The instruction implements DOD Directive 2060.1, Implementation of, and Compliance with,
Arms Control Agreements, CJCSI 2030.01C, CWC Compliance Policy Guidance, and AFPD 16-
6, Arms Control Agreements. The publication codifies United States Air Force (USAF)
implementation of, and compliance with, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (also referred
to as the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC). This publication supersedes the Air Force
CWC Implementation and Compliance Plan 1997 and incorporates the Base Assistance Team
(BAT) Concept of Operation (CONOPs). It applies to all USAF personnel at USAF-controlled
facilities, geographically separated units, and Government Owned-Contractor Operated (GOCO)
facilities where USAF equities are present. This guidance applies to personnel involved in the
operation of USAF aircraft, whether or not they are at a USAF installation or GOCO facility
where other USAF equities are present. This publication applies to Air Force Active as well as
the Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units. It also applies
to all USAF research and development laboratories involved in research and development
programs, including those involving any non-lethal agents that may be interpreted to be Riot
Control Agents (RCA) as defined by the CWC.

The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a
Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated
with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the

appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered
compliance items. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate chain of command.

maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 16-603 by (1) adding the Waiver Authority Statement and Tier
waiver guidance from AFI 33-360 in the opening paragraph and (2) adding tier waiver authority
markings for each requirement mandated for compliance at the Wing level in accordance with
AFI 33-360. It also revises guidance for Base preparations for CWC challenge inspections and
development of inspection site support plans, stating that compliance with these requirements is
“based on level of risk a base is willing to accept in light of its potential vulnerability to be
inspected.”

                                            Chapter 1

                                        BACKGROUND

1.1. The is a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and is obligated to
comply with its provisions. The CWC prohibits a wide range of chemical weapons-related
activities and requires States Parties to destroy their Chemical Weapons (CW) and former CW
production facilities. The CWC was ratified by the United States on 25 April 1997. The Treaty
entered into force (EIF) 29 April 1997. Currently, 190 nations are State Parties to this
convention. The CWC has an intrusive verification regime which includes systematic
inspections, on-site short-notice challenge inspections and investigations of alleged use of
chemical weapons or riot control agents (RCAs) as a method of warfare.
1.2. The United States Air Force (USAF) is responsible for proper implementation of and
compliance with the CWC, as mandated by the U. S. Congress, the President, and the
Department of Defense (DOD). This plan addresses USAF responsibilities for implementing
and complying with the CWC.
1.3. The USAF does not possess any CW or any declared facilities under the CWC and
does not participate in the CW demilitarization process. Because of this, the USAF is
excluded from the need to comply with systematic inspections to verify the destruction of U.S.
CW. However, all USAF facilities and equities worldwide remain subject to the CWC’s
challenge inspection provisions and investigations of alleged use of CW. The CWC prohibits the
use of RCAs as a “method of warfare,” but does not define the term. This could lead to
situations where RCAs stored or used by USAF entities, even in total compliance with U.S.
Government directives, arouse CWC compliance concerns and/or trigger a challenge inspection
or investigation of alleged CW use.
1.4. CWC challenge inspections and investigations of alleged use are among the most
intrusive types of verification mechanisms in any arms control regime. The Organization for
the Prohibition for Chemical Weapons (OPCW), based in The Hague, Netherlands, is staffed by
personnel who are citizens of States Parties. The OPCW may conduct a challenge inspection or
investigate the alleged use of CW at any location worldwide in response to allegations from
other States Parties to the CWC. An OPCW inspection team (IT) is empowered to receive the
greatest degree of access possible within the constitutional rights of the inspected State Party on
site and strict treaty provisions ensure relatively prompt access to the inspection site.
1.5. Despite the intrusive and rigorous nature of the treaty obligations associated with a
challenge inspection or investigation of alleged use of CW, the CWC allows an inspected State
Party to protect sensitive equipment, information, and areas not related to CW through the use of
a variety of techniques generally known as “managed access.” Therefore, inspection site
personnel need to have full understanding of these techniques to fully exercise U.S. rights to
manage access to sensitive USAF equities during challenge inspections or alleged use
investigations.
1.6. Properly prepared site personnel are a vital component in demonstrating compliance
with the CWC and in effectively managing a CWC challenge inspection. The USAF
response effort, intended to both demonstrate U.S. compliance and to protect national security
equities, combines base-level planning and preparation with a timely infusion of subject matter

expertise and training to enable any USAF inspection site to successfully respond to a challenge
inspection. The USAF employs a Base Assistance Team (BAT) to provide on-site treaty
expertise and support for challenge inspection activities, and a Response Cell at HQ USAF to
provide assistance to the site prior to the BAT arrival at the inspection site.

                            COORDINATING INSTRUCTIONS

3.1. Implementation:
   3.1.1. AF/A5XP is authorized to coordinate directly with OSD, JS, HQ USAF, MAJCOMs,
   and other DOD agencies and organizations (e.g., DTRA) in the execution of CWC
   implementation and compliance actions. Coordination with other agencies/offices outside the
   DOD will be through the JCS J-5.
   3.1.2. MAJCOMs will assist AF/A5XP in the execution of a CWC inspection support
   mission and ensure that MAJCOM supplements or theater-specific AF Component
   Command CWC Compliance plans are consistent with this Air Force Instruction.
3.2. Compliance:
   3.2.1. Notifications:
      3.2.1.1. MAJCOMs and units execute inspection notification responsibilities as
      specified.
      3.2.1.2. All USAF organizations are required to report recovery of “old” or “abandoned”
      CW as noted in Chapter 7. “Old” or “abandoned” CW are described in the CWC and may
      be discovered during remediation or excavations, and possibly even by presentation by
      non-DOD entities such as civilian law enforcement or hazardous material response teams.
      Suspected recovered CW should be handled and stored in accordance with DOD Manual
      6055.09-M. Depending on the circumstances, these discoveries may need to be reported
      to the U.S. CWC National Authority and to the international community through the
      OPCW. In all cases of discovery of old or abandoned CW, regardless of source, affected
      units will notify MAJCOM TCOs. MAJCOM TCOs will notify AF/A5XP and AFOG.
      HQ USAF will coordinate with the Department of the Army and within DOD to ensure
      these discoveries are reported in a timely manner.
   3.2.2. Certifications:
      3.2.2.1. HQ USAF will recertify compliance with the CWC to the CRG annually. The
      reporting date is typically in April of each year.
      3.2.2.2. All USAF organizations are required to report activities for defensive or
      “protective” purposes that are permitted by the CWC to the CRG as required. Specific
      reporting guidance is typically disseminated annually by AF/A5XP. (T-1)
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                       15


                                           Chapter 4

                                CHALLENGE INSPECTIONS

4.1. Purpose of a Challenge Inspection
   4.1.1. The purpose of a CWC challenge inspection is to collect factual information regarding
   a CWC non-compliance allegation made against a State Party by another State Party.
   4.1.2. Allegations against the United States will be investigated by the Inspection Division
   of the TS for the OPCW based in The Hague, Netherlands. It is important for U.S. personnel
   participating in a challenge inspection to understand that OPCW inspectors do not initiate a
   challenge inspection, but rather are the mechanism to collect facts and investigate the
   requesting State Party’s allegation(s) of non-compliance. As such, it is essential to ensure
   that inspectors have maximum possible access to information at an inspection site that
   confirms U.S. CWC compliance.
4.2. Challenge Inspection Notification
   4.2.1. Once the Director-General of the OPCW authorizes a challenge inspection, the OPCW
   will send a notification to the U.S. government. The Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC)
   at the U.S. Department of State will receive the notification and transmit it to the DTRA
   Operations Center. DTRA watch officers will relay the notification to the Air Force
   Operations Group (AFOG) at the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and other
   affected Services and Defense Agencies.
   4.2.2. The AFOG will forward the notification through the chain of command, notifying
   AF/A5XP, MAJCOMs, and other pertinent organizations.
   4.2.3. AF/A5XP will activate the HQ USAF CWC Response Cell (RC), which will begin
   support operations. Phone: (703) 693-6333.
4.3. Challenge Inspection Participants 4.3.1 OPCW Inspectors
       4.3.1.1. The IT will consist of inspectors and inspection assistants from the OPCW. The
       OPCW determines inspection team composition and size based on the size of the site and
       the anticipated complexity of the inspection. For planning purposes, the OPCW TS
       anticipates teams of up to 50 personnel to conduct CWC challenge inspections. The
       CWC prohibits inspectors from either the requesting State Party or the inspected State
       Party from being on the IT.
       4.3.1.2. IT members are granted privileges and immunities accorded to diplomatic agents
       pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961.
       Immunities generally relate to the privacy of IT notes and discussions, and to the integrity
       of their persons and personal effects. Inspection site personnel should consult national
       escorts from DTRA whenever immunity issues arise.
   4.3.2. Requesting State Party Observer
       4.3.2.1. The State Party requesting a challenge inspection has the right to send an
       observer to monitor inspection activities. This observer is called the requesting State
       Party Observer (RSO) and his/her function is to represent the requesting State Party and
16                                                            AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


     to monitor the conduct of the inspection. The RSO is not a member of the IT, but is
     accorded generally the same diplomatic privileges and immunities as the inspection team
     members themselves.
     4.3.2.2. The RSO has the right to consult with and make recommendations to the
     Inspection Team Leader (ITL) and communicate via telephone with his/her country’s
     embassy or, if there is no embassy, with his/her home country.
  4.3.3. Department of Defense
     4.3.3.1. Working within existing command structures to ensure successful completion of
     the inspection, the DOD will form a “Host Team” (HT) for the purpose of representing
     the U.S. Government, negotiating with an IT, and making major inspection management
     decisions during a challenge inspection. The HT will meet the IT when the IT arrives at
     the POE and will stay in contact with the IT until completion of an inspection. The Joint
     Chiefs of Staff, Strategic Plans and Policy (JS-J5) or OSD will assign a Host Team
     Leader (HTL) to be the principal spokesperson during negotiations. HQ USAF will
     provide a senior official as the Air Force Member of the HT. Additionally, once the HT
     and IT arrive at the inspection site, the Installation’s Commanding Officer or a designated
     representative will join the HT as a full Member.
     4.3.3.2. DTRA will provide and lead a team of National Escorts who will accompany the
     OPCW inspectors and the RSO throughout their stay in-country, including POE
     activities, transport to and from the inspection site, and during the conduct of the
     inspection.
     4.3.3.3. Air Force units may be tasked to provide airlift for the HT, IT, DTRA, and the
     U.S. Army Mobile Treaty Lab.
  4.3.4. Headquarters U. S. Air Force
     4.3.4.1. AF/A5XP will deploy the BAT to the inspection site. The BAT’s primary
     function is to integrate with and provide technical subject matter expertise to advise and
     assist the Inspection Control Group (ICG). BAT members are sourced from HQ USAF,
     MAJCOMs, and select Unit staffs. The BAT will deploy to the inspection site as soon as
     possible, but NLT 12 hours after notification, when directed by the BAT Chief.
     4.3.4.2. AF/A5XP will also activate the HQ USAF Response Cell (RC) to assist all
     command echelons during a CWC challenge inspection. The response cell will respond
     to questions related to the challenge inspection process and provide guidance to the
     inspection site prior to arrival of the BAT. The RC will also serve as a conduit for
     information, requests, and queries between the inspection site, the DOD Host Team prior
     to deployment to the inspection site, and the Air Staff.
  4.3.5. Inspection Site
     4.3.5.1. The Installation Commander of the host USAF unit, or a similar organization
     designated as “owning” the inspection site, will form the ICG as described in the Air
     Force CWC ISM to manage the day-to-day activities associated with a CWC challenge
     inspection. At some installations (e.g., Joint or overseas bases), an Air Force Wing or
     other unit may be a tenant or “mission partner” that does not manage the installation. In
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                       17


       such cases, the Air Force Wing or other unit will remain prepared to support the ICG or
       ICG-equivalent established by the organization that “owns” the site.
       4.3.5.2. The Installation Commander will be responsible for ensuring that a TCO plans,
       coordinates, and oversees base preparations. The TCO will serve as the Commander’s
       principal advisor for the duration of the challenge inspection process.
       (MAJCOMs/Components will develop plans and policies to support GSUs without
       identified TCOs).
4.4. Challenge Inspection Activities
   4.4.1. General Guidelines
       4.4.1.1. A challenge inspection follows a defined timeline and sequence of events
       dictated by the CWC. The OPCW Director General will issue a challenge inspection
       mandate to the IT that outlines the basis for the non-compliance allegation(s) (i.e., the
       reason(s) for the inspection). The mandate may explicitly state how the OPCW
       inspectors will conduct their inspection activities to investigate concerns about
       compliance or it may provide only general guidance and direction to the IT.
       4.4.1.2. The inspection activity primarily occurs within and adjacent to a specified and
       limited geographic area known as a perimeter. The perimeter is initially specified by the
       Requesting State Party (RSP) and later negotiated between the HT and the IT. As part of
       this process, the RSP initially draws and submits to the OPCW a requested perimeter
       (RP) that defines the area where the RSP believes evidence exists that the United States
       has violated the CWC. This RP can be altered if it does not meet requirements described
       in the CWC Verification Annex. If an RP is not acceptable to the Inspected State Party
       (ISP), the ISP may propose an alternative perimeter (AP), which must meet additional
       requirements. Negotiation between the HT and IT will produce a Final Perimeter (FP),
       which is the boundary where inspection activities occur.
       4.4.1.3. The ISP has the right to take measures to protect sensitive equipment and
       prevent disclosure of sensitive information and data not related to chemical weapons.
       The CWC refers to this practice as “managed access.”
       4.4.1.4. If the ISP uses managed access measures that provide less than full access to any
       object, building, structure, container or vehicle, the ISP will make every reasonable effort
       to demonstrate to the IT that the object, building, structure, container or vehicle is not
       used for purposes related to the possible non-compliance concerns raised in the
       inspection request.
       4.4.1.5. Conflicts concerning IT-requested access that cannot be resolved on site during a
       challenge inspection will be expeditiously referred through the chain of command and the
       HT to the CRG for resolution.
       4.4.1.6. Medical, public safety or critical operational emergencies will be afforded
       priority over ongoing inspection activities until the emergency is over.
          4.4.1.6.1. In the event of a medical, public safety, or critical operational emergency
          at the inspection site prior to the arrival of the IT, the site shall notify the affected
          MAJCOM and the HQ USAF CWC RC, Phone: (703) 693-6333. Notification should
          include all pertinent information, including:
18                                                            AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


            4.4.1.6.1.1. Specific nature of the emergency
            4.4.1.6.1.2. Expected duration of the emergency
            4.4.1.6.1.3. Impact of the emergency on the site’s ability to support an inspection
            4.4.1.6.1.4. Measures being taken to mitigate or resolve the emergency.
         4.4.1.6.2. In the event of a medical, public safety, or critical operational emergency
         at the inspection site, the DOD HTL will notify the ITL of the situation and provide
         an explanation on the nature of the situation based on ensuring the safety and security
         of the IT, or on the requirement for non-interference in national internal affairs or
         operational activities.
         4.4.1.6.3. The HTL will also notify the DOD CRG of the emergency situation and its
         impact on the inspection.
  4.4.2. Inspection Team Activities
     4.4.2.1. The inspection site should anticipate that an IT will arrive no later than 36 hours
     after it arrives at the POE (and no later than 48 hours after notification of the challenge
     inspection) and will remain in the vicinity of the inspection site for up to 180 hours after
     arrival.
     4.4.2.2. After arrival at the vicinity of the inspection site, inspectors will begin work by
     monitoring the perimeter and exiting vehicular traffic. After a period of time to prepare
     the inspection site, and no later than 108 hours after IT arrival at the POE, the IT will
     have to be granted access inside the FP in order to conduct inspection activities. It is
     incumbent on the Inspection Site Member of the HT to determine when the site is ready
     for inspection and inform the HT of the site’s readiness to accept inspectors.
     Commanders and the HT may use their discretion to allow inspection activities to begin
     before POE arrival +108 hours, but in no case will preparations delay IT access beyond
     this treaty-mandated deadline. The inspection period within the FP will normally not
     exceed 84 hours, unless extended by mutual agreement among the HT, the OPCW IT,
     and possibly the U.S. National Authority. Inspection sites should anticipate that activities
     will be conducted around the clock during the active inspection period and possibly also
     during perimeter activities prior to IT access within the FP.
     4.4.2.3. While conducting a challenge inspection, the IT has multiple rights, which
     should be exercised in accordance with approved protocols and as negotiated between the
     HT and IT. These rights include:
         4.4.2.3.1. Access to the inspection site, equipment and buildings/areas
         4.4.2.3.2. Request that certain operations or actions be performed by site personnel
         4.4.2.3.3. Review of relevant documents and records
         4.4.2.3.4. Request photographs to be taken
         4.4.2.3.5. Interview inspection site personnel
         4.4.2.3.6. Communicate with the OPCW headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands
         and among inspectors on sub-teams
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                    19


        4.4.2.3.7. Request air, soil, and water samples
        4.4.2.3.8. Use treaty-permitted and U.S.-approved inspection equipment
     4.4.2.4. The inspection site should provide a cooperative atmosphere while
     simultaneously ensuring the protection of national security and proprietary information.
     4.4.2.5. Prior to accommodating any request, site personnel escorting inspectors will
     consult accompanying National Escorts (from DTRA) and the ICG for guidance. The
     ICG will in turn consult with the HT for guidance and clarification if needed.
     4.4.2.6. Before provision of any documents or records to the IT, all documents or records
     must be reviewed by inspection site personnel to determine if IT access to them will
     affect national security or other sensitivities of the inspection site, DOD, or the USG.
     Documents requested by the IT will only be shown to them under U.S. control. Any IT
     requests for copies of documents or records should be passed to the HT for consideration.
     4.4.2.7. The U.S. Army will deploy its OPCW certified Mobile Analytical Laboratory to
     collect and analyze IT-requested samples at the inspection site, and provide the results of
     those analyses related to the inspection mandate. The HT will closely oversee collection,
     analysis, and sample residue management to ensure compliance with U.S. law.
  4.4.3. Site Support Actions
     4.4.3.1. Following notification, the inspection site will immediately implement several
     actions to meet CWC treaty deadlines and to prepare the site for inspection. The site
     TCO will utilize the Inspection Support Manual (ISM) throughout the inspection period
     and conduct the following actions prior to the arrival of the BAT.
        4.4.3.1.1. Prepare a situation briefing as explained in the ISM and assist the
        Commander in selecting the ICG leadership team.
        4.4.3.1.2. Activate the ICG.
     4.4.3.2. ICG Actions include the following:
        4.4.3.2.1. Establish contact with the MAJCOM TCO, AF/A5XP, and the HQ USAF
        RC and obtain copies of the IT Mandate, the RP, and other pertinent documents,
        phone: (703) 693-6333.
        4.4.3.2.2. Identify sensitive equities and interests which may be involved at the
        designated inspection site.
        4.4.3.2.3. Review operations planned for the duration of the inspection (potentially
        up to 10 days following notification) that may require termination or curtailment.
        The unit commander is not required to cease operational activity but should work
        closely with HQ USAF and the parent MAJCOM to reschedule or redirect missions
        that might have a detrimental impact on the successful completion of the challenge
        inspection. Depending upon the circumstances involved in the challenge inspection
        request, MAJCOM should work through the appropriate chain of command, to
        include COCOM Commanders and HQ USAF, to balance operational imperatives
        against challenge inspection requirements.
20                                                        AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


     4.4.3.2.4. For inspections at USAF installations outside the United States, obtain
     from the HQ USAF RC a copy of any pre-negotiated CWC-unique HCA, either
     finalized or in draft form. This agreement, along with an existing Status of Forces
     Agreement (SOFA) will be used by the HT and the inspection site to coordinate
     activities with the Host Nation. If no HCA is available, the HT and Host Nation
     representatives will need to establish procedures and guidelines for working together
     to respond to the challenge inspection.
     4.4.3.2.5. Develop a list of areas, facilities, and activities which may be sensitive to
     U.S. interests but not covered by the CWC or the OPCW challenge inspection
     mandate, and provide this list to the HT and/or HQ USAF as requested.
     4.4.3.2.6. Shortly after the arrival of the IT at the POE, or when documents or other
     necessary information become available, the inspection site ICG shall initiate the
     following actions:
        4.4.3.2.6.1. Review the RP of the inspection site as described in the ISM and
        provide comments and concerns to the HT along with any recommendations to
        correct the perimeter if it violates CWC requirements. As soon as the RP is
        known, forward a map of the inspection site with the RP and all identified vehicle
        exits from the RP shown to the HT at the POE as soon as possible. If appropriate,
        recommend an AP to the HT.
        4.4.3.2.6.2. Prepare a site briefing for the Host Team as described in the ISM and
        forward it electronically no later than 4 hours prior to IT arrival at the POE.
        Copies of the site briefing should also be sent to the HQ USAF Response Cell in
        the Pentagon.
        4.4.3.2.6.3. Review the inspection mandate and conduct a mandate analysis, as
        described in the ISM, in order to assess how the inspection may impact facilities
        or equities within the RP, within 50 meters outside the RP, or any AP
        recommended by the inspection site.
        4.4.3.2.6.4. Implement self-monitoring of all vehicle exits from the RP as
        described in the ISM no later than 10 hours after IT arrival at the POE.
        4.4.3.2.6.5. Develop a pre-inspection briefing which includes a description of the
        site and its activities, administrative arrangements and procedures, transportation
        and communication for the IT, and safety requirements. This briefing may also
        introduce the inspection site’s recommended inspection plan.
        4.4.3.2.6.6. Provide sufficient personnel, communication support, and
        transportation resources to support the HT, national and local escorts, and each IT
        member and the RSO unless directed otherwise.
     4.4.3.2.7. Assemble any applicable records and reports requested by the IT through
     the HT. Conduct an internal base-level review and provide these records to the HT
     along with the results of the internal review and any recommendations for restriction
     of IT viewing or redaction based upon classification or other national security or
     proprietary concerns.
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                      21


     4.4.3.3. Managed Access. The inspection site has a right to protect national security
     information, equipment, or areas not related to the OPCW challenge inspection mandate
     through the use of managed access techniques. For example:
         4.4.3.3.1. Maintain a current list of sensitive base and tenant programs
         4.4.3.3.2. Develop managed access plans for all facilities that are inside the RP and
         may be scheduled for inspection in the agreed inspection plan. As stipulated in the
         CWC Verification Annex, Part X, Paragraph 48 (a-g), managed access techniques
         may include, but are not limited to the following: (T-1)
            4.4.3.3.2.1. Remove sensitive papers or items from inspectable areas
            4.4.3.3.2.2. Shroud sensitive displays, storage areas and equipment
            4.4.3.3.2.3. Shroud sensitive pieces of equipment, such as computer or electronic
            items.
            4.4.3.3.2.4. Log off computer systems and turn off data displays
            4.4.3.3.2.5. In exceptional cases, giving only individual inspectors access to
            certain parts of the inspection site.
  4.4.4. USAF Support Requirements. Air Force will provide support to the IT, HT,
  National Escorts and RSO as required or requested by the U.S. National Authority or DTRA
  national escorts, to include:
     4.4.4.1. Provide a Base Assistance Team to support on-site activities. Specific activities,
     responsibilities and training requirements for the BAT are outlined in Chapter 5 of this
     instruction.
     4.4.4.2. Provide a HQ USAF challenge inspection Response Cell to support site
     activities, relay information to HQ USAF Host Team Member, and to monitor
     deployment of the BAT.
     4.4.4.3. Transportation to and from the site for the HT, IT, RSO, and National Escorts.
     4.4.4.4. On-site physical security for the IT and RSO.
     4.4.4.5. Emergency medical support.
     4.4.4.6. Appropriate communication means for the HT, IT, RSO, and National Escorts.
     4.4.4.7. Lodging for up to 150 personnel for up to 8 days. IT and RSO lodging costs are
     borne by the DTRA National Escort team; lodging expenses for others will be borne by
     individuals as official travel expenses. Inspection sites should work closely with the
     DTRA advance team and seek to lodge the HT on base, but seek to initially lodge the IT
     off-base outside the RP.
     4.4.4.8. Office space and support for the HT, IT and RSO. IT and RSO office spaces
     should initially be located outside the RP but may be provided on base once the
     inspection begins inside the FP. Pre-inspection office space and support may be located
     inside the RP if it is to the benefit of the USAF and/or the DOD. HT office space may be
     provided in close proximity to that of the IT/RSO.

      4.4.4.9. Meals on a 24-hour basis during the inspection activities. HT and national
      escorts and other USG personnel will pay for all costs individually. IT and RSO costs are
      borne by the DTRA National Escort team.
4.5. Challenge Inspection Completion
   4.5.1. Within 24 hours after the completion of the inspection, the IT will meet with U.S.
   representatives to review the preliminary findings of the inspection. The IT may provide
   preliminary findings in a report, to include a list of written information, data and materials
   collected during the inspection. The HT and IT will agree as to what documentation can be
   taken off site. The inspection site will work closely with the HT to document any
   disagreements with the IT concerning events during the course of the inspection, to include
   data to refute any ambiguities and/or allegations of lack of cooperation by the United States.
   4.5.2. The inspectors and RSO will be expected to depart the site 24 hours after the end of
   the inspection.
   4.5.3. Upon departure of the IT, the BAT and inspection site will draft an after-action report
   to document inspection management activities and any lessons learned. The report must be
   provided through the MAJCOM to HQ USAF no later than 10 days after the completion of
   the inspection.
   4.5.4. The IT will draft a preliminary report within 72 hours after their return to The Hague.
   The IT will assign an overall classification to the report based on OPCW classification
   guidelines and ISP recommendations. The report will be classified using one of the
   following OPCW categories: Highly Protected, Protected, or Restricted. Although these
   classifications closely parallel those of Secret, Confidential and For Official Use Only
   (FOUO) respectively, U.S. personnel will only use applicable U.S. classifications or other
   restrictions to govern their distribution or release.
   4.5.5. A copy of the preliminary inspection report will be provided to the United States for
   review. The inspection report must be finalized and submitted to the OPCW Executive
   Council no later than 20 days after the IT returns to The Hague.

                                             Chapter 5

                    BASE ASSISTANCE TEAM (BAT) OPERATIONS

5.1. Purpose: This chapter addresses the BAT’s composition, specific roles and
responsibilities, and operations. AF/A5XP established the BAT and this Air Force Instruction
(AFI 16-609) authorizes its operations and addresses its general roles and responsibilities.
5.2. Background
   5.2.1. The CWC EIF occurred on 29 April 1997. Since the United States is a State Party to
   the Convention, USAF facilities, equities, and assets are subject to short-notice, intrusive
   challenge inspections worldwide.
   5.2.2. The primary tool to support challenge inspection management involving Air Force
   equities is the USAF CWC ISM, which is published by AF/A5XP.
   5.2.3. CJCSI 2030.01C requires that the Services provide Service Assistance Teams (SATs)
   capable of preparing Service installations, public vessels, State aircraft, and geographically
   separate units to receive CWC challenge inspections. AF/A5XP meets this requirement
   through the establishment of the BAT. The BAT provides expertise in utilizing the ISM and
   preparing required briefings, implementing checklists, and presenting educational materials
   to the inspection site. The BAT also will integrate with and advise the inspection site’s
   Inspection Control Group (ICG)—the organization responsible for challenge inspection
   management—on preparation of deliverables and responses to taskings.
5.3. BAT Composition
   5.3.1. For a challenge inspection where the USAF is the Lead Service, the BAT includes
   members from the following organizations:
   5.3.2. HQ USAF:
       5.3.2.1. Strategic Plans and Policy Division (AF/A5XP); a representative leads the BAT
       and designates a BAT member to serve as the Deputy BAT Chief.
       5.3.2.2. Directorate of Security & Special Program Oversight (SAF/AAZ)
       5.3.2.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Office of Special Projects
       (AFOSI/PJ)
       5.3.2.4. HQ USAF-sponsored civilian contractors
   5.3.3. USAF components:
       5.3.3.1. Major Command (MAJCOM/Component) TCOs; and
       5.3.3.2. BAT Augmentees (as defined in Section 5.5.6.)
   5.3.4. DTRA liaison
   5.3.5. Other organizations as required.
5.4. USAF Tenant/Geographically Separated Unit Inspections: For an inspection site where
the USAF is not the lead service and for AF GSUs, the BAT Chief will determine the
composition of the BAT necessary to fulfill assistance obligations.
 24                                                              AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


5.5. Roles and Responsibilities: BAT members advise and assist the inspection site on CWC-
related matters. However, directing and implementing inspection preparation and support
activities is the responsibility of the inspection site. The BAT advisory role includes—but is not
limited to—providing CWC implementation and compliance expertise and knowledge to the
ICG and inspection site commander in areas such as inspection management, local escort and
facility manager requirements, site pre-inspection preparation actions, transportation, and
logistics. MAJCOM BAT members may be assigned specific areas of challenge inspection
expertise (e.g., Perimeter, Self Monitoring, etc) by AF/A5XP; however, all BAT members must
be knowledgeable in all ISM functional areas. Due to time and distance considerations and the
phasing of expertise, BAT members will perform the most time-critical tasks as identified in
Paragraph 5.6.1 as soon as they arrive at the inspection site.
   5.5.1. HQ USAF A5XP Member
       5.5.1.1. Serves as the BAT Chief and is responsible for overall team management
       (including the designation of the BAT member from the impacted MAJCOM to serve as

      5.5.6.4. Coordinate escort duties between the inspection site’s local escorts and National
      Escorts, including training assistance; and
      5.5.6.5. Provide training to site personnel on building preparation, route planning, and
      managed access procedures, as requested.
5.6. BAT Operations
   5.6.1. Initial Operations. Because BAT members will arrive at the inspection site at
   various times, the first BAT member to arrive will assume BAT Chief responsibilities, until
   relieved, and present the BAT Introduction Briefing to the ICG and Commander. This
   briefing may also be provided by the HQ USAF Response Cell if there is a significant delay
   in the arrival of the first BAT member. Due to time-sensitive requirements, arriving BAT
   members need to fulfill, in order, the functions listed below:
      5.6.1.1. Perimeter Team responsibilities, specifically focusing on definition and analysis
      of the requested perimeter;
 26                                                           AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012

                                           Chapter 6

      INVESTIGATIONS OF ALLEGED USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR RIOT
               CONTROL AGENTS AS A METHOD OF WARFARE

6.1. Purpose of Investigations
   6.1.1. To investigate alleged use of CW or RCAs as a method of warfare.
   6.1.2. The USAF could either be subjected to use of CW or RCAs, or be accused of using
   them against another State or non-State actor.
6.2. Notification
   6.2.1. If the United States requests an investigation of alleged use, it must provide certain
   information to the OPCW. Air Force units that receive or witness CW use or witness RCAs
   being used as methods of warfare should collect the following data and forward it through
   the chain of command to AF/A5XP as soon as possible:
       6.2.1.1. The State Party on whose territory the use of CW or RCAs is alleged to have
       taken place
       6.2.1.2. Extent and nature of alleged use
       6.2.1.3. GPS or map coordinates where CW or RCAs are alleged to have been used
       6.2.1.4. CW or RCA characteristics, if known, and their effects on humans, animals, and
       vegetation
       6.2.1.5. Date and time (local or Zulu) when CW or RCA is alleged to have been used
       6.2.1.6. Any suggested safe routes of access into the area of alleged use
   6.2.2. Any USAF-initiated requests for investigations will be elevated through the chain of
   command, either through the COCOM Commander for the theater or through the Joint Staff
   to OSD. The OSD will contact the National Authority and request that organization to
   initiate an investigation. The National Authority will provide the U.S. request to the OPCW.
   6.2.3. If a U.S. Air Force base or equity is accused of employing CW (or of using RCAs as a
   method of warfare), AF/A5XP will cooperate with the appropriate USG agencies in
   gathering information concerning allegations of non-compliance.
6.3. Conduct of Investigations
   6.3.1. Regardless of whether the United States is accused of or is the victim of an alleged use
   of CW or of RCAs as a method of warfare, the OPCW will dispatch an IT as soon as
   practical to the scene or to any other relevant locations to conduct its fact-finding
   investigation.
   6.3.2. Should the OPCW decide it needs to investigate on U.S. territory the IT will have the
   right to be briefed by the United States upon arrival at the U.S. POE. The IT may request
   additional briefings and or information as its investigations progress. USAF commands will
   support those government agencies gathering data to provide these briefings as requested.
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                       29


  6.3.3. The IT shall have the right of access to any and all areas which could be affected by
  the alleged use of CW or RCAs. For such access, the IT shall consult with the investigated
  State Party.
  6.3.4. Samples.
     6.3.4.1. The IT will collect samples of types and in quantities it considers necessary to
     conduct its investigation. If requested, the investigated State Party shall assist in the
     collection of samples under the supervision of inspectors or inspection assistants. The
     investigated State Party shall also permit and cooperate in the collection of appropriate
     control samples within the boundary of the investigated State Party as requested by the
     IT.
     6.3.4.2. Samples of importance in the investigation of alleged use include toxic
     chemicals, munitions and devices, remnants of munitions and devices, environmental
     samples (air, soil, vegetation, water, snow, etc.), and biomedical samples from human or
     animal sources (blood, urine, excreta, tissue, etc.).
     6.3.4.3. If duplicate samples cannot be taken, and if the IT requests analysis be
     performed at off-site laboratories, the U.S. will negotiate a sample analysis process that
     will ensure samples are managed appropriately within the terms of the U.S. CWC
     Implementation Act of 1998.
  6.3.5. Investigation Duration. The CWC does not specify the duration of an investigation
  of alleged use. However, the OPCW will direct its IT to travel as expeditiously as possible
  and conduct as thorough an investigation as needed to collect evidence. An assumption is
  that an IT could arrive in a specified area within 48 to 72 hours of an allegation, but the exact
  timing and duration of an investigation, once begun, can only be determined on a case-by-
  case basis. If the IT deems that safe access to a specific area relevant to the investigation is
  not possible, the RSP shall be informed immediately. If necessary, the investigation will be
  suspended until safe access can be provided and the IT is able to resume its activities and
  conclude its investigation.
  6.3.6. Interviews. The IT will have the right to conduct interviews and take biomedical
  samples from human or animal sources that may have been affected by the alleged use of
  CW or RCAs. It will also have the right to interview eyewitnesses, medical personnel, and
  other persons who have treated or have come into contact with persons who may have been
  affected by the alleged use of CW or RCAs. The IT may be provided access to medical
  histories, if available, and permitted to participate in autopsies, as appropriate, of persons
  who may have been affected by the alleged use of CW or RCAs.
  6.3.7. Reports. Throughout the investigation, the IT will send periodic progress reports to
  the OPCW Executive Council. The investigated State Party, or any other State Party, will
  not be provided access to these preliminary reports. No later than 30 days after returning to
  The Hague, Netherlands, the IT will provide its final report to the OPCW Executive Council
  and all State Parties.
 30                                                              AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


6.4. USAF Support Requirements
   6.4.1. Depending upon circumstances at the investigation site, USAF commands will
   provide support to the IT as required or requested by appropriate command authorities, to
   include:
      6.4.1.1. Transportation to and from the site of the alleged use
      6.4.1.2. Physical security for the IT at the investigation site if USAF Security Forces are
      best-positioned to provide such security
      6.4.1.3. Logistical support
      6.4.1.4. Access to victims of the alleged chemical use
      6.4.1.5. Access to witnesses to the alleged chemical use
      6.4.1.6. Additional information related to the alleged chemical use
      6.4.1.7. Emergency medical support
   6.4.2. If the alleged use investigation takes place involving a USAF equity/interest located
   on the territory of another State Party to the CWC, the Air Force will provide support as
   directed by competent command authority in accordance with any applicable HCAs, SOFAs,
   or as requested by the U.S. National Authority through the appropriate command channels.
   6.4.3. If the alleged use investigation takes place involving a USAF equity/interest located
   on the territory of a state not a Party to the CWC, the Air Force will make every effort to
   provide requested support as directed by appropriate command authority and in accordance
   with SOFAs.
AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012                                                                     31


                                          Chapter 7

                          RECOVERED CHEMICAL WEAPONS

7.1. Background
   7.1.1. Prior to CWC entry into force, burial in landfills was an accepted and widely used
   method for “eliminating” unwanted or outdated chemical weapons, bulk agents, and
   munitions. In addition to burial on land, dumping at sea was an acceptable practice as
   recently as 1970, when the practice was halted. Recent information indicates that in some
   instances, dumping at sea may not have occurred as far offshore as suggested at the time. In
   many cases, record keeping for such activities was either not required, the locations were not
   well-documented, or records have been lost.
   7.1.2. In most instances, USG policy is to avoid deliberate actions to disturb or unearth
   known or suspected burial sites, whether on land or at sea. However, from time to time,
   because these locations and contents of these sites are not well-documented, there are
   inadvertent recoveries that may involve USAF installations. Additionally, an Air Force base
   may be requested to take custody of suspected old chemical munitions that are inadvertently
   recovered by the general public.
7.2. DOD Policy and Procedures
   7.2.1. Per DODD 2060.1; CJCSI 2030.01C; and Planning Assumptions for Nuclear and
   Chemical and Biological (NCB) Treaties and Agreements for Fiscal Year 2013-2019, the
   U.S. Army is DOD’s Executive Agent for the elimination of all U.S. CW.
   7.2.2. When a munition with an unknown liquid fill, or CWM is encountered on a DOD
   installation (e.g., during a munitions response) or in the public domain, the EOD unit
   responding to a request for support of an explosives or munitions emergency will take those
   actions needed to ensure the protection of human health and the environment (see 2.2.d (5)).
      7.2.2.1. The responding EOD unit will (a) ensure such munitions are properly secured in
      place, if armed, or over packed and secured, either at the location of discovery or at the
      closest military installation; and (b) request support from the U.S. Army Forces
      Command’s 20th Support Command’s (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and
      High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE)) Operations Center at (410) 436-6200.
      7.2.2.2. The 20th Support Command (CBRNE) will dispatch a team from its CBRNE
      Analytical Remediation Activity (CARA) on behalf of the Chemical Materials Agency
      (CMA) to assess the munition (or material of interest) non-intrusively. (Note: 20th
      Support Command response is funded by U.S. Army Material Command’s (USAMC)
      CMA as part of its overall mission in support of the Army’s Recovered Chemical
      Warfare Material Response Program.)
      7.2.2.3. CARA will provide the assessment results through CMA to the Army’s Material
      Assessments Review Board (MARB) for determination of the most likely fill.
          7.2.2.3.1. For munitions determined to be RCWM, the Army will schedule
          demilitarization, normally at the storage location, using Army assets (e.g., Army’s
          Explosives Destruction System).
 32                                                           AFI16-609 27 JANUARY 2012


          7.2.2.3.2. Munitions determined not to be RCWM will be released for local
          disposition.
   7.2.3. USAMC’s CMA, as the National Inventory Control Point (NICP) for CWM, will
   establish and maintain accountability for any liquid-filled munition and any liquid in other
   than a munitions configuration that the MARB determines most likely contains a chemical
   agent fill. CMA will establish and maintain this accountability regardless of the
   circumstance (i.e., an explosives or munitions emergency; a planned CWM response; other
   activities, such as range clearance activities) under which recovered.
7.3. Air Force Procedure
   7.3.1. Actions to be taken upon recovery of suspected chemical munitions on a base, or upon
   delivery of suspected chemical munitions from a non-DOD source to a base are covered in
   EOD joint service technical orders (AEODPS) and AFI 32-3001, AF EOD Program. All
   responses to suspected chemical munitions are Level 1 explosives and munitions emergency
   responses and conducted per the DOD Policy to implement the EPA Military Munitions
   Rule.
      7.3.1.1. In all cases of suspected CW or BW items, the safety of USAF personnel and the
      local population will be a primary concern.
      7.3.1.2. Due to potential CWC treaty implications associated with recovery of CW,
      installation command post personnel will notify their MAJCOM Treaty Compliance
      Office within 8 hours of their notification. MAJCOM TCOs will notify AF/A5XP within
      24 hours of receipt of information concerning discovery, recovery, or delivery of any CW
      or BW munitions or related equipment (i.e. spray tanks, bulk storage containers, etc.).
      7.3.1.3. Installation command posts will send situation reports in accordance with Air
      Force Instruction 10-206 Operational Reporting, Chapter 4, 6 September 2011.
      7.3.1.4. AF/A5XP shall report identified and destroyed chemical munitions to the OSD
      CWC Treaty Manager for appropriate reporting to the National Authority and the OPCW.

territory of another State without consent of the latter. (CWC, Art. II, para. 6)
Alternative (Inspection) Perimeter (AP).—A perimeter specified by the ISP to a challenge
inspection after reviewing the RP. An AP must include all of the area within the RP (i.e. an AP
may not be smaller than a requested perimeter), as well as meet several other requirements
specified in Part X of the CWC Verification Annex. An AP is subject to negotiation between the
Host Team and the Inspection Team before the determination of a FP. (See also Requested
Perimeter, Final Perimeter.)
Base Assistance Team (BAT).—A team deployed by AF/A5XP and the MAJCOMs to assist an
Air Force installation in preparing for and managing a challenge inspection.
Challenge Inspection. A short—notice inspection of a specific facility or location on the
territory of or under the jurisdiction and control of a State Party that is requested by another State
Party. A challenge inspection is conducted by the OPCW TS. States Parties may request
challenge inspections within other States Parties to clarify and resolve any questions concerning
possible non-compliance with CWC provisions. Challenge inspection procedures are covered
under Article IX of the CWC and Part X of the CWC Verification Annex.
Chemical Weapons (CW).—CW means the following, together or separately:
(a)    Toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for purposes not prohibited
under the Convention, as long as the types and quantities involved are consistent with such
purposes;
(b)     Munitions and devices specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the
toxic properties of those toxic chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released
as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices;
(c)    Any equipment specifically designed for use directly, meaning “solely”, in connection
with the employment of munitions or devices specified in subparagraph (b).


Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Working Group (CWIWG). A DOD
forum for: coordinating DOD planning and preparations; coordinating and defending DOD
implementation programs, budget and resource creation and allocation; and fielding and
coordinating resolution of issues impacting implementation.

Compliance. Compliance assures that existing and future Air Force programs and
activities legally and technically comply with the terms of the CWC. Compliance includes
executing responsibilities described in this Instruction; destroying the CW stockpile and
former CW production facilities; changing doctrine as required; reporting information for
inclusion in CWC—required data declarations; and making CWC-required notifications.
Compliance also includes not doing what the CWC forbids, including using CW, developing or
producing CW, stockpiling CW, and training for the employment of CW.
Compliance Review Group (CRG). A DOD—wide working group, chaired by Chief, CW
Treaty Management within OATSD (NCB), that monitors DOD compliance with the CWC,
resolves compliance issues within DOD, and makes CWC compliance determinations for DOD.
Declared Facility. An installation, factory, or plant that was declared by the USG IAW the
requirements of the CWC. Declared facilities must comply with specific verification
activities, like systematic inspections, and may include on—site continuous monitoring.
Requirements will be defined in a facility agreement. Facilities are declared based on a range of
criteria, including production, storage, or a history of CW or precursor chemical research,
development, or testing. The USAF has no declared facilities.
DOD Components.—Collectively refers to OSD, the Military Departments, the Chairman of the
