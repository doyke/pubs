SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Removed X-Band;
replaced AFSATCOM with MILSTAR and added flight data recorder/CSMU and AIT radios.
Changed qualifying notes on WUCs 24, 44A, 44D, 51, 51A, 63A, 68A, 72H, 73A, 73B and 76G
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit

wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
    1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
    degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
    1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
    Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
    A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
    be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
    1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
    Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
    MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
    unit's requirements, and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
    1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
    code (WUC) against the FSL and all applicable BSLs across the page. Each unit's Design
    Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The
    aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to
    compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's assigned
    aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report
    status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF
    (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG
    columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
    only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is
    reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.

1. Aircraft signature will be assessed using the B-2 LO Combat Readiness (LOCR) model and
operational assessment. Aircraft modeled LOCR “Green” will be reported FMC. Aircraft
with a degraded LO system (modeled LOCR “Yellow” or “Red”) will be evaluated by
Signature Diagnostics/Survivability Flight for operational condition and status will reflect
results (FMC, PMC or NMC). For LO discrepancies not modeled by LOCR, applicable
technical orders and/or guidance provided by appropriate engineering authority will be
followed.
2. Right APU Required.

required DOC generation timing requirements. For example, installation of instrumented
Crew Entry Door/Periodic Radar Surveillance Mission DMS Door for range/test sorties, etc.
