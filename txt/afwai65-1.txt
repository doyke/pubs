4. Financial Concepts.
   4.1. The financial program of each unit must at all times, reflect its requirements and related
   resources to provide the basis for management actions and future planning. No matter how
   well any financial program is conceived and administered, it is subject to revision to reflect
   mission changes, operational adjustments, and level of resource availability.
   4.2. Annual/quarterly fund authorizations must be distributed as accurately as possible to the
   applicable Element of Expense Investment Codes (EEICs), Responsibility Center/Cost
   Centers (RC/CCs), and Program Element Codes (PECs) where expenditures are
   programmed. This headquarters monitors status reports affecting the distribution of the
   annual/quarterly programs, as well as actual obligations/expenses incurred to date. Failure to
   properly distribute annual/quarterly authorizations and to properly record expenditures may
   provide misleading information concerning the financial status of the unit.
   4.3. All AFWA funding points are given flexibility to reprogram overhead funds throughout
   the fiscal year. All reprogramming actions involving centrally managed programs require
   AFWA/CC approval. In order to eliminate "expense chasing," reprogramming actions should
   only be accomplished after a close review of obligation/expense rates, program changes, and
   forecasted requirements.
   4.4. Funds allocated to an organization do not always satisfy total requirements. It is the
   responsibility of directors/commanders to ensure that mission critical requirements are
   funded. The priority list of unfunded requirements is the mechanism available to
   directors/commanders to identify unfunded requirements to the FWG. The unfunded list
   should be composed of those items that cannot be funded because higher priority
   requirements exist and must be funded. The unfunded list is not static; items on the list shift
   as the priority of the unfunded requirements change. Since these lists and unfunded
   requirement narratives are used for AFWA justification to the Air Staff for additional
   operations and maintenance funds, it is imperative that they be realistic. Submit Unfunded
   Requirements narratives in the format prescribed in AFWAI 65-3, through AFWA
   SharePoint.
   4.5. Financial management positions. Each AFWA funding point includes Directors,
   Squadron, and GSU Commanders who function as Responsibility Center Managers (RCM),
   RAs, and Cost Center Manager (CCM). Since financial responsibilities at the RCM and
   CCM go hand-in-hand with supervisory responsibilities, only primary/alternate RA positions
   are considered to be additional duties.
