AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                       9


       1.4.7.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are
       qualified and current.
1.5. Aircrew Training. Training programs are designed to progress aircrew members from
Initial Qualification Training (IQT), then to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally
to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.5.1. Formal Schools. The primary method for accomplishing IQT and MQT is to attend
   and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the Education Training Course
   Announcement (ETCA).         Note: The ETCA serves as a reference for the Air Force, other
   military services, Department of Defense (DoD) government agencies, and security
   assistance programs. The current syllabus of instruction (SOI) must be referenced to
   determine course prerequisite requirements. Current formal schools SOIs can be found at the
   AETC          Flying       Training       Special        Publications       Web        site:
   https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx
   1.5.2. Initial Qualification Training. IQT provides the training necessary to initially
   qualify or re-qualify aircrew in basic positions and flying duties without regard to a unit's
   mission. Upon completion of IQT, aircrew members attain Basic Aircraft Qualification
   (BAQ) status. For pilots and loadmasters, BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. See Chapter 2
   for additional guidance on IQT.
       1.5.2.1. Except for General Officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term
       qualification status.
       1.5.2.2. Aircrew (other than General Officers) who remain in BAQ status for more than
       six months will be restricted to flying in supervised status until completion of MQT or
       waivered to remain BAQ.
       1.5.2.3. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for any aircrew member (other than
       General Officers above the wing level) to remain in a long-term BAQ status.
   1.5.3. Mission Qualification Training. MQT provides the training necessary to initially
   qualify or re-qualify aircrew members in assigned positions to perform the command or unit
   mission. Aircrew members maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of
   MQT is a pre-requisite for certification as BMC or CMR. See Chapter 3 for additional
   guidance on MQT and mission certification.
   1.5.4. Specialized Training. Specialized training is any training in specialized tactics,
   mission events, or flight responsibilities necessary to carry out the unit's assigned mission
   and not required by all crewmembers or all crew positions. Specialized training consists of
   upgrade training, special mission qualifications, and aircrew certifications, as well as any
   continuation training required to maintain these capabilities. See Chapter 5.
   1.5.5. Continuation Training (CT). CT is training required to maintain the assigned level
   of currency and proficiency for qualified aircrew. There are two aspects of CT. The first
   consists of training in the basic skills required to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. The
   second consists of training in specific mission-related skills required to accomplish the unit's
   assigned mission(s). CT will be conducted IAW Chapter 4 and the RTM.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is a CT program designed to provide realistic
training to meet all designed operational capability (DOC) tasked requirements as well as
 10                                                     AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


specific Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) requirements. It provides the minimum required mix of
periodic events and sorties an aircrew must accomplish to sustain mission readiness.
MAJCOM/A3 will determine RAP training requirements for subordinate units. RAP training
requirements will be implemented via MAJCOM RTM. Following completion of MQT, aircrew
will have received training in the basic mission of the HC-130J. Aircrew will then be certified
BMC or CMR, as required.
   1.6.1. CMR Status.
       1.6.1.1. CC-Coded Units (Combat Coded)
          1.6.1.1.1. All active duty Aircrew Position Indicator (API)-1/2/A positions, flying
          SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions.
          1.6.1.2.1. OG/CCs may designate other API-6/B positions not assigned to the flying
          squadron as CMR.
       1.6.1.3. CMR aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all
       RAP designated training which affect CMR status. Failure to accomplish this training
       results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate
       authority.
   1.6.2. BMC Status.
       1.6.2.1. CC-Coded Units.
          1.6.2.1.1. All active duty wing aircrew positions not designated CMR positions, are
          BMC positions.
          1.6.2.1.2. BMC status is assigned to aircrew members who have a primary job
          performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support flying operations.
          These aircrew members are required to provide additional sortie generation
          capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying
          squadrons. BMC aircrew members maintain qualification in all unit core mission
          events and may be certified/qualified in specialized training events.
       1.6.2.2. Designated Training (TF-Coded)/ Test (CB-Coded) Aircraft Unit
       Requirements. All assigned and attached Formal Training Unit (FTU) and test unit
       aircrew will maintain BMC status. Chapter 4 details CT requirements to include
       specific guidance for FTU and test units. Note: FTU and test aircrew will complete
       supported MAJCOM CMR requirements just-in-time when tasked to augment
       operational deployments.
       1.6.2.3. BMC aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all
       RAP designated training which affects BMC status. Failure to accomplish this training
       results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status unless waived by appropriate
       authority. Exception: AETC will determine regression requirements for FTU aircrew.
       See Chapter 4.
       1.6.2.4. BMC aircrew may participate in any mission for which they are current and
       qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.
   1.6.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will
   complete required remediation IAW Chapter 4.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                 11


   1.6.4. RAP Policy and Management. RAP is executed IAW this instruction and the
   current MAJCOM RAP Tasking Memorandum. The RTM may contain updated training
   requirements and events not yet incorporated into this instruction.
      1.6.4.1. Training Cycle. The continuation training cycle is defined by the RTM.
      1.6.4.2. The RAP Tasking Memorandum. Each RAP training level (BMC, CMR) is
      defined by a total number of RAP requirements, broken down into sortie types and
      associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and based on whether the aircrew
      member is designated experienced or non-experienced. The RTM will specify the
      following for each training level: Exception: AETC developed RTMs may be tailored
      as required, incorporating the applicable elements below, to define CT requirements
      specific to FTU operations.
          1.6.4.2.1. Total RAP sortie requirements for the training cycle.
          1.6.4.2.2. Total RAP events requirements for the training cycle. Note: Total RAP
          sorties and events as defined by the RTM are minimums and may not be reduced
          except by proration, waiver or situations as stipulated by this instruction. The
          breakout of sortie types, as defined by the RTM, is provided as a guideline to be
          followed as closely as possible but variances are authorized. SQ/CCs may use
          variations in sortie types as a basis for end-of-cycle regression.
          1.6.4.2.3. 1- and 3-month RAP sortie Lookback requirements.
          1.6.4.2.4. Additional training requirements as directed by the MAJCOM.
   1.6.5. RAP Training Reports. Reports. Submit periodic RAP training reports IAW
   MAJCOM RTM guidance.
   1.6.6. RAP Training Sortie Development. Design training missions to achieve combat
   capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission
   accomplishment and safety. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a
   tactical mission profile or a building block type sortie. RAP training missions should
   emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based
   on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of
   procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g., appropriate use of
   code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical
   deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing). Tactical training
   should include the use of threat simulators and countermeasures, and include participation
   with other rescue weapon systems and support aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
1.7. Sortie Allocation Guidance.
   1.7.1. For CC-coded units. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated
   aircrew to CMR. Inexperienced API-1/2/A aircrew members should receive sortie allocation
   priority over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
   CMR/API-1/2/A, CMR API-6/B, BMC (API-All).
   1.7.2. Units should provide attached API 6/8/B/D flyers adequate resources to maintain
   minimum training requirements. However, API-6/8/B/D flyer support will not come at the
   expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. If units cannot meet attached flyer
   requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring
 12                                                       AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


   flying hour adjustments for attached API-8/D and applicable API-6/B flyers must request
   program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
1.8. Aircrew Utilization/Management. See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
1.9. In-Unit Training Time Limitations (N/A Formal Training Units). Training conducted
in unit will comply with the time limitations annotated in Table 1.1

Table 1.1. In-Unit Training Time Limitations.

 Upgrade
 Aircraft Commander Certification                            45 days
   1.9.1. Training time starts when the first syllabus of instruction (SOI)-directed training event
   is begun; or 45-days after being attached or assigned to the unit upon completion of the
   formal school, whichever occurs first. Training time ends with the formal evaluation or
   certification, as applicable.
   1.9.2. Individuals unable to complete training within time limits specified in Table 1.2 may
   continue training; however, units will notify MAJCOM/A3T and provide a description of the
   factors contributing to delayed training along with an expected completion date.
1.10. Formal Training Conducted in Unit (Secondary Method Training). When attendance
at a formal school course is not practical or no quotas exist, units may request a waiver to
conduct training in-unit using formal school syllabus and courseware. This is called secondary
method training (SMT). Any aircrew member who has previously failed to complete a formal
course for substandard performance will not be issued a secondary method training waiver for
the same course.
   1.10.1. Waiver Approval Authority. MAJCOM/A3T is the approval authority to conduct
   formal qualification training in unit.
       1.10.1.1. SOI mission objectives and tasks are the minimum required for formal course
       qualification training. When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the
       training is incompatible with local training conditions (i.e., no simulators).
       MAJCOM/A3T is the waiver authority to deviate from the formal requirements of
       qualification training conducted locally.
       1.10.1.2. Maintain in-unit waiver approval in the individual's AF Form 4022, Aircrew
       Training Folder.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                 13


   1.10.2. Formal School Courseware Requests. For secondary method training, the waiver
   authority will include the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence
   and will request that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew
   member‘s unit of assignment. Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus
   of instruction (SOI), briefings, computer based training (CBT) modules, instructor guides,
   training guides and student grade sheets. This information may be web-based or available
   through other digital mediums. The unit training office will verify currency of the
   courseware obtained.
      1.10.2.1. Use formal school courseware received for training only the individual
      referenced in the waiver.
      1.10.2.2. If the course includes an end of course exam, substitute a locally developed
      exam. Passing score is 85 percent.
   1.10.3. When a formal school course is authorized to be conducted in unit, the gaining
   MAJCOM assumes responsibility for providing this training locally. In addition to the
   guidance found in Chapters 2, 3 and 5, the following applies to SMT:
      1.10.3.1. Training will be completed within the time limits specified by paragraph 1.9
      1.10.3.2. Ground Training Requirements. Training sequence and event prerequisites will
      be IAW the formal course SOI.
      1.10.3.3. Flying Training Requirements. Mission sequence and event prerequisites will
      be IAW the formal course SOI.
1.11. Active Duty Service Commitments. Formal training conducted may incur an active duty
service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).
   1.11.1. Units will ensure crewmembers who are directed to attend an education or formal
   training course, whether via Permanent Change of Station (PCS), TDY or Permanent Change
   of Assignment (PCA), process through the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) for ADSC
   counseling and completion of the AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC)
   Acknowledgement Statement or other required ADSC acknowledgment before entering an
   ADSC-incurring event.
   1.11.2. For SMT, units will coordinate with the servicing MPF to ensure individuals
   acknowledge any ADSC required and that the ADSC is properly processed once training is
   completed.
1.12. Training Docummentation, Records and Reports.
   1.12.1. Units will maintain individual training records IAW Chapter 6 and the following:

  1.12.2. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA) Training Documentation. All enlisted aircrew
  qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When AF Form 8,
  Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then
  that crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification
  regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are also
  separate and distinct from on-the-job (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected
  in the AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew
  standardization and evaluation flight examiner). IAW Career Field Education and Training
  Plans (CFETP), personnel in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1AXXX are exempt from
  maintaining the AF Form 623, On-the-job Training Record.
  1.12.3. Permanent Training Folders (PTF). Units will maintain a permanent training
  folder for each crewmember. Units will ensure folders are forwarded to gaining units when
  individuals PCS. Gaining unit commanders may elect to keep records of past training
  programs. Training folder minimum requirements are as follows:
     1.12.3.1. Section I: Letters of Appointment/Upgrade endorsed by unit CC/DO.
     Individual training waivers will also be filed in this section.
     1.12.3.2. Section II: Aircrew Certifications. Unit certification document (Letter of X‘s)

                                            Chapter 3

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for MQT
and mission certification (assignment of BMC or CMR status). The primary method of mission
qualification training is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the
ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies all MQT requirements. When
attendance is not practical or no quotas exist, units may request waivers to conduct in-unit MQT
using formal school courseware IAW paragraph 1.10
3.2. Formal Training Course Prerequisites. Complete formal training prerequisites in
accordance with the formal course syllabus of instruction.
   3.2.1. All pilots will go through the same training during initial mission qualification. After
   MQT they will enter into one of two tracks. If the flying time prerequisites in Table 3.1 are
   met the pilot may begin AC certification. If the flying time minimums are not met enter the
   pilot into the Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) program.
   3.2.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). The MPD program is a stair step approach to
   developing a pilot into an aircraft commander. MPD pilots may fly sorties from either seat
   and perform all events from each seat Exception: Maximum effort landings will only be
   conducted from the left seat.
   3.2.3. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP). Pilots cross flowing from first assignment instructor
   pilot (FAIP) duty, operational support aircraft (OSA) or other MDS, may enter AC
   certification after MQT IAW Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. PQP MQT Flying Time Prerequisites.
             Total Flying Time                          Qualification Seat AF Form 8

             > 800 (FAIP/OSA)               MP (eligible for AC certification)
                  > 1,000                   MP (eligible for AC certification)
Note: At unit commanders‘ discretion, an MP meeting the minimum requirements may be entered into
                     the MPD program instead of receiving an AC certification.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements IAW the formal
course syllabus of instruction.
3.4. Flying Training requirements. Complete flying training requirements in accordance with
the formal course syllabus of instruction and the following:
   3.4.1. High winds or non-availability of parachutists may cause loadmasters to complete the
   FTU mission qualification course without conducting actual personnel airdrops. In these
   cases, use standard airdrop training bundles (SATB) during flight training. If actual
   personnel airdrops were not accomplished during formal training, the FTU will issue a
   restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 11-2HC-130JV2.
   Accomplish final certification for personnel airdrop in-unit under the supervision of an
   instructor or flight examiner loadmaster on an actual static line personnel airdrop.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                19


   Loadmasters will not be certified CMR until final certification for personnel airdrops is
   completed.
   3.4.2. Units North of the 60 Parallel. When MQT is conducted in unit, crewmembers in
   units north of the 60 N parallel who are scheduled to complete MQT during the summer
   months (May through August), have until 31 October to complete the required night/NVG
   training events. The mission qualification evaluation for these crewmembers may be
   administered before completing night training events.
   3.4.3. Conduct flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-HC-130JV2.
3.5. Mission Ready Certification. Mission qualification is a prerequsite for mission
certification or recertification, as required. The SQ/CC will certify crewmembers as BMC or
CMR upon completion of all required training.
   3.5.1. Basic Mission Capable Certification. Mission qualified aircrew will complete the
   following requirements prior to BMC certification.
       3.5.1.1. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all applicable ground training IAW
       Tables 4.2 through Table 4.4 and the RTM. Training missions may be flown before
       completing all items listed, provided all grounding events are accomplished.
       3.5.1.2. Flying Training Requirements. Complete all applicable flying training affecting
       BMC status IAW Tables 4.6, through Tables 4.10 and the RTM. After completing all
       required flying training requirements and prior to completing all ground training events,
       SQ/CCs may allow crewmembers to fly unsupervised on missions provided the
       remaining ground training items do not mandate instructor supervision and do not affect
       mission accomplishment.
   3.5.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Certification. Certification as CMR requires the
   following:
       3.5.3.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate. See RTM.
       3.5.3.2. Qualification and/or certification in any specialized training required for CMR
       status. See Chapter 5.
       3.5.3.3. Completion of all CMR-related ground training IAW Table 4.2 through Table
       4.4 Individual must be current for all events which affect CMR status.
       3.5.3.4. Completion of all CMR-related flying training IAW Table 4.6 and Table 4.10
       Individual must be current for all events which affect CMR status.
3.6. Transition Training. Transition training is a shortened version of qualification training
that gives aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft credit for acquired
aviation proficiency. Transition of mission qualified C-130J pilots and loadmasters and legacy
HC-130P/N and MC-130E/H/P CSOs (mission qualified or previously mission qualified but out
of the cockpit less than 36 months) may be accomplished using a MAJCOM approved training
syllabus.

  counted as hours when determining experience level.
4.3. Local Unit Indoctrination/Local Orientation. Each newly assigned aircrew member will
complete a local unit indoctrination/local orientation program prior to performing unsupervised
primary aircrew duties.
   4.3.1. This training will prepare aircrew members for local unit operations. Each unit will
   publish guidance outlining specific ground and flight requirements. This training will
   familiarize aircrew with the local flying area and available mission support facilities,
   introduce any area-unique procedures, and include a minimum of one day and one night local
   sortie.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                  21


   4.3.2. This training is optional for HQ MAJCOM and NAF personnel conducting inspections
   and evaluations when accompanied by unit assigned and locally indoctrinated personnel.
   4.3.3. MP Qualified PQPs Awaiting AC Certification. Enter MP qualified PQPs awaiting
   AC certification into a unit training program designed to provide rescue mission experience
   and prepare them to fly as aircraft commanders on a crew aircraft. Use the local unit
   indoctrination/ local orientation program to ensure PQPs are adequately trained in right seat
   systems and responsibilities.
4.4. Crediting Training Requirements.
   4.4.1. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events trained
   to a 3/3C RPL during formal training will use the date of the checkride as the initial
   accomplishment date.
   4.4.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.4.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements for events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.4.4. Training events accomplished on an evaluation or an instructor certification (that
   event) may be credited toward the individual‘s volume requirements. Exception: Pilots will
   not log a Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) on QUAL/INSTM evaluations.
   4.4.5. Crediting Events Conducted in Aircrew Training Devices (ATD) is authorized for a
   weapon system trainer (WST) that is certified for the event being accomplished. Any type C-
   130J WST may be used to log certified events.
   4.4.6. Aircrew members who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight
   evaluation will not log continuation training requirements for those events graded Q-3 until
   re-qualified.
   4.4.7. Instructor Combat Systems Operator (CSO) and loadmasters may log 50 percent of
   their events while actively instructing students.
4.5. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW Tables 4.2 through 4.5 and
the RTM. These tables reference training governed by other directives. Where discrepancies
exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Waiver authority for ground training events is
specified IAW the governing directive.
   4.5.1. Ground training tables in this instruction do not include ancillary training required by
   AFI 36-2201, Training Development, Delivery, and Evaluation. This includes Total Force
   Awareness Training and Expeditionary Skills Training which will be tracked at unit level.
   4.5.2. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.         Failure to accomplish these
   requirements may affect BMC/CMR status and require additional training. See paragraph
   4.11 Overdue training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following
   applies when crewmembers exceed due dates for ground training events:
 22                                                     AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


       4.5.2.1. Grounding Events. Failure to maintain currency for events listed in Table 4.2
       will result in crewmembers being placed in grounded status. Crewmembers will not
       perform flight duties until the grounding item is satisfied.
       4.5.2.2. Training Status Events. Failure to maintain currency for events listed in Table
       4.3 will result in crewmembers being placed in supervised status. Crewmembers will not
       fly without instructor supervision until the supervised status item is satisfied.
       4.5.2.3. Mission Status Events. Failure to maintain currency for events listed in Table
       4.4 will affect BMC/CMR status as annotated. Note: FTU aircrew will maintain
       applicable events in this table as determined by AETC. Test unit aircrew will maintain
       applicable events in this table as determined by the SQ/CC.
       4.5.2.4. Miscellaneous and Awareness Events. The Table 4.5 lists ground training
       events which do not affect BMC/CMR status or result in training/grounding status due to

  4.5.3. Ground Training Events. The following paragraphs provide definitions and criteria
  for ground training events governed or amplified by this instruction.
      4.5.3.1. Tactics Continuation Training [GA59]. Units will establish a tactics academic
      program to accomplish initial and CT requirements. Tactics Continuation Training will
      normally be conducted in conjunction with Intelligence Training [IE15].
         4.5.3.1.1. Training will be administered using lessons/courseware developed by the
         unit tactics office and designed to prepare crewmembers to operate more effectively
         in the combat rescue environment. Training will be based on tactical employment
         information found in AFTTP 3-1.HC-130, AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 and AFI 11-2HC-
         130JV3, as well as any other tactics documents pertaining to the execution of the
         unit‘s mission.       Academics should be tailored to theater-specific mission
         requirements and unit METLs.
         4.5.3.1.2. To complete training, aircrew must pass an examination with a minimum
         score of 85 percent.
      4.5.3.2. Aircraft Anti-Hijacking Training [GA03]. Units will establish a program to
      provide crewmembers with training on US Air Force policy and guidance on preventing
      and resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking). The training will consist of a review of AFI 13-
      207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), applicable FAA guidance, and
      local procedures.
      4.5.3.3. Communications Procedures [AG06]. Units will establish local training
      programs and conduct initial and annual training. Training will include a review of
      equipment operation, procedures, and requirements applicable to peacetime and wartime
      communications operations including the proper use, protection, disposition, and
      accountability of COMSEC material. Minimum requirements by applicable crew
      position are as follows:
         4.5.3.3.1. Pilots/CSO: Be familiar with authentication procedures, Identification,
         Friend or Foe/ Selective Identification Feature IFF/SIF procedures, crypto modules,
         loading procedures, HAVEQUICK, Secure communications/loading, AFKAI-1,

         voice/data, and COMSEC user requirements.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                27


     4.5.3.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Refresher [GA06]. CRM refresher
     training will be conducted IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
     Training Program and applicable supplements. When possible, it should be tailored to
     the unit mission and build on the principles of crew coordination, communications skills,
     decision making and leadership, learned during initial CRM training courses.
     Additionally, principles will be considered during upgrade and continuation training
     flight briefings and debriefings under the crew coordination category. Application of
     CRM principles relating to recent like-MDS aircraft mishaps will be briefed and
     discussed during flight safety meetings. Wings or groups are responsible for monitoring
     their unit-level CRM programs. CRM courses taught as part of a simulator refresher
     course satisfy this requirement.
     4.5.3.5. Fire Extinguisher Training [GA08]. Training is required upon arriving PCS to
     a new flying unit. This training will familiarize crewmembers in the use of the type of
     fire extinguishers onboard their assigned aircraft and should be hands-on whenever
     possible.
     4.5.3.6. Hot Refueling/Forward Air Refueling Point (FARP) Refresher
     [GS69]. Required academic continuation training for Hot Refueling and/or FARP
     certified crewmembers. MAJCOM/A3T will establish training program to satisfy
     requirements of AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations, AFI 11-2HC-

     4.5.3.7. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) [GS05]. All pilots and CSOs will
     complete the IRC IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFMAN 11-210 Instrument Refresher Course
     (IRC) Program.
     4.5.3.8. Intelligence Training [IE15]. The aircrew intelligence training program is an
     integral part of individual and unit tactics academic training. Tacticians will coordinate
     with intelligence personnel to support this training requirement. Due to the related
     content, Aircrew Intelligence Training will normally be conducted in conjunction with
     Tactics Continuation Training [GA59]. The content of this training will be determined
     by the unit tactics office but should include threat briefings, country studies and related
     topics. It will also include the following minimum items:
        4.5.3.8.1. Collection and Reporting (C&R). C&R training will enable crewmembers
        to initiate aircrew-originated reports (In-flight Report, Communication Instructions
        Reporting Vital Intelligence Sighting, etc.) and will familiarize them with the
        information requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report and
        Intelligence Report.
        4.5.3.8.2. Current Intelligence.    Current Intelligence will cover significant
        military/political developments (including threat updates) in the unit's areas of
        interest.

28                                                   AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


     4.5.3.10. NVG Refresher Training [GA19]. NVG qualified crewmembers will
     accomplish NVG refresher training IAW MAJCOM-developed courseware. When such
     products are not available, units may develop an NVG refresher training program based
     on a review of initial NVG academic courseware. At least some portion of the training
     must be completed through a guided lecture/discussion. See AFI 11-202V1 for
     additional guidance on course content and instructor requirements.
     4.5.3.11. Simulator Refresher [SQ20/21/22]. Curriculum will be IAW MAJCOM
     approved syllabus of instruction. If HC-130J WST is not available, C-130J system
     refresher is a suitable substitute for Pilots and Loadmasters.
        4.5.3.11.1. Simulator training is not required for aircrew members who will not be
        flying the HC-130J aircraft beyond 4 months after their due date.
        4.5.3.11.2. Satisfactory completion of a formal MQT or requalification course will
        establish currency for periodic simulator refresher training. Mission pilot upgrade
        and instructor upgrade courses which include simulator instruction, satisfy the
        periodic training requirement. Mission pilots may accomplish emergency procedures
        simulator scenarios from either seat at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
        4.5.3.11.3. Mission Oriented Simulator Training (MOST). This training is designed
        to train crew coordination, communications, decision-making, leadership, and
        management skills through the planned use of full mission simulation. Aircrew
        members will fly a structured tactical scenario in a realistic mission environment.
        MOST training should be accomplished during simulator refresher training.
        Satisfactory completion of formal school qualification, requalification, or upgrade
        course which includes simulator instruction satisfies the MOST requirements.
        OG/CCs may waive this requirement if a mission simulator is unavailable.
     4.5.3.12. Systems Refresher [GS67]. Complete training IAW published SOI. If HC-
     130J WST is not available, C-130J system refresher is a suitable substitute for
     loadmasters.
        4.5.3.12.1. Loadmaster Systems Refresher Training. This periodic ground-training
        course is designed to improve standardization and provide increased knowledge of
        LM specific duties and responsibilities. Complete training IAW published SOI.
     4.5.3.13. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT) [GS03].
        4.5.3.13.1. This unit-developed training is not an evaluation, but a review of
        abnormal/emergency procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during
        realistic scenarios. One aircrew member should present a situation while others
        discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical
        conclusion. Critical action/Boldface procedures (if applicable) and special interest
        items should be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT
        training programs:
            4.5.3.13.1.1. SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
            4.5.3.13.1.2. SEPT scenarios developed using C-130 mishaps/incidents as
            baseline cases.
            4.5.3.13.1.3. Discussion of one EP during SEPT sessions covering various phases
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                    29


            of flight.
        4.5.3.13.2. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month and prior to the
        aircrew members first flight of the month.
        4.5.3.13.3. Completion of an Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) satisfies the
        monthly SEPT requirement.
     4.5.3.14. Theater Indoctrination (TI) Training [GA33]. Units will develop a program
     to ensure personnel are trained for theater-specific flight operations prior to a contingency
     deployment. As a minimum, this training will include a thorough review of theater-
     unique instrument requirements and procedures, the use of non-DoD instrument approach
     procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches, geography, terrain,
     climatology, command and control procedures, Aviation Unit Prep Messages, theater
     resources and their disposition, rules of engagement, local area procedures (e.g. Special
     Instructions (SPINS), reporting instructions, etc), host nation agreements, current force
     protection environment, and current intelligence/threat assessment. TI training should be
     completed no earlier than 60 days prior to deployment.
     4.5.3.15. Verification Planning Exercise (VPE) [GS52]. Initial and refresher VPEs
     provides training to update crewmembers on their squadron‘s wartime mission and allow
     them the opportunity to apply the tactical knowledge they have gained. It consists of an
     in-depth combat rescue mission planning scenario, normally completed with a full crew
     complement. Initial Verification Training is required prior to CMR certification. BMC
     pilots will participate in verification training as determined by the SQ/CC.
        4.5.3.15.1. VPEs should provide crews the opportunity to exercise local mission
        planning support processes such as intelligence, weather, rules of engagement and
        legal (Judge Advocate) mission considerations. Tailor VPEs to prepare aircrew to
        support a specific OPLAN/CONPLAN/AEF or other rotational tasking. Refer to the
        Verification Planning Exercise Guide in Attachment 2 for specific guidelines on
        developing a verification planning exercise.
        4.5.3.15.2. Crewmembers who participate in a unit contingency deployment, exercise
        mission, or complete theater indoctrination training may receive credit for
        continuation verification training at SQ/CC discretion.
     4.5.3.16. Visual Threat Recognition and Avoidance Trainer (VTRAT) Training
     [GS68]. VTRAT training is designed to introduce or refresh crewmembers in the basics
     of aircraft threat engagement recognition and avoidance. The VTRAT simulation
     displays realistic visual characteristics of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) such as missile fly-
     out and AAA rate-of-fire, as seen from the scanner‘s viewpoint in the aircraft. Training
     should be provided by an Aircrew Training System (ATS) contractor and is normally
     accomplished during simulator refresher training.
        4.5.3.16.1. Training will include:
        4.5.3.16.2. Group/individual academics on threat recognition, calls and avoidance
        maneuvers IAW AFTTP 3-1.HC-130 and AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
        4.5.3.16.3. Following academics, individuals will receive ~30mins of individual
        simulator time on the VTRAT.

4.6. Flying Training. Aircrew will accomplish flying training requirements IAW Table 4.6
through Table 4.10 and as specified by the RTM. BAQ-only aircrew will maintain currency in
events noted as BAQ in applicable flying training tables.
   4.6.1. Attachment 3 contains definitions and criteria for continuation flying training events.
   4.6.2. Failure to accomplish flying training requirements may affect BMC/CMR status and
   require additional training as mandated by this chapter.
   4.6.3. Designated Test Unit Flying Requirements. Aircrew assigned/attached to
   designated test units will accomplish the applicable BMC flying training requirements with
   the following exceptions:
      4.6.3.1. Approved test plan missions apply to the total RAP sortie requirements for the
      training cycle. Log these events as Commanders Option sorties.
      4.6.3.2. RTM-defined RAP sortie lookback rates should be adhered to within the
      constraints of resource availability; however, lookback regression will not be applied.
      4.6.3.3. SQ/CCs will direct additional sorties if spin-up and test missions provide
      insufficient pilot continuation and/or proficiency training.
      4.6.3.4. SQ/CCs may direct additional ground training necessary to accomplish special
      unit requirements, such as test preparation.
   4.6.4. MAJCOM/NAF API-8/D Aircrews. HHQ flying personnel maintaining BMC status
   are exempt from specialized training programs within authorized mission areas and are not
   required to meet monthly lookback sortie requirements IAW the RTM.
   4.6.5. Pilot Seat Assignment. The following defines the allowed cockpit seat assignment
   depending on training and pilot qualification. AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 further defines takeoff
   and landing policy for HC-130J pilots.
      4.6.5.1. Pilots may accomplish pilot flying/pilot monitoring events from either seat with
      an aircraft commander in the other seat who has a minimum of 100 hours since
      certification. Aircraft commanders with less than 100 hours since certification must fly
      in the left seat unless with an instructor or AC with at least 100 hours since certification.
      4.6.5.2. For mission events other than maximum effort events, pilots may fly from either
      seat. Exception: Instructors may fly Max Effort landings from the right seat (AC
      identified for Instructor school may also attempt right seat Max Efforts under direct IP
      supervision).
      4.6.5.3. IPs may fly and supervise any student in either seat for any pilot flying/pilot
      monitoring events for which they are qualified/certified and current.

 Note 13 – When circumstances preclude in-flight execution of this event and with approval of
 the SQ/DO the event may be accomplished via tabletop discussion or in a stationary aircraft
 providing all other event criteria are met.

 Note 14 – Due to limited availability of equipment for training, MAJCOMs will determine
 training criteria and requirements for this event. This responsibility may be further delegated
 to the unit level and restrict to just-in-time, deployment spin-up.

 Note 15 - Air refueling requirements:
 a. Time between events will not exceed 90/180 days. Failure to accomplish this event, within
 the 90/180-day time period, results in loss of that event currency only. The crewmember
 remains fully qualified for all other qualifications.
 b. Failure to complete the required number of events, within the specified currency period,
 results in loss of currency for this event only. The crewmember remains fully qualified for all
 other qualifications.
 c. Pilots, who are non-current for air refueling contact, are precluded from conducting air
 refueling contacts only. Other air refueling duties, including pre-contact are allowed.

4.7. Recurrency Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew member does not meet a
currency requirement of this instruction or the RAP Tasking Memorandum (RTM).
   4.7.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to maintain currency IAW Tables 4.5 through Table 4.8,
   or as outlined in RTM, results in a loss of currency for that event.
       4.7.1.1. Unless specifically noted otherwise, crewmembers are non-current the day after
       event currency expires.
       4.7.1.2. Place individuals delinquent in one or more flying training currency events in
       supervised training status for the event. Loss of currency prohibits an individual from
       accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s). Exception:
       Loss of currency in BAQ events, noted in the flying training tables, result in the loss of
       aircraft currency. Individual will fly in supervised status until recurrent.
       4.7.1.3. To regain currency, delinquent events must be demonstrated to the satisfaction
       of an instructor. The SQ/CC may direct additional training as required.
   4.7.2. Loss of currency in flying training events annotated as affecting BMC/CMR may
   require regression to N-BMC/N-CMR IAW paragraph 4.11
 36                                                      AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


   4.7.3. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months.
       4.7.3.1. Loss of currency for designated BAQ events in excess of six months results in
       the loss of BAQ.
       4.7.3.2. Loss of currency for designated mission events in excess of six months results in
       loss of mission qualification.
   4.7.4. Currency for Training North of the 60 Degree Parallel. Aircrew members
   assigned to units north of the 60-degree parallel handle night/NVG currency as follows:
       4.7.4.1. Only day sortie/event currencies from 1 April to 30 September need be
       maintained. Consider all experienced crew members current for night sorties/ events on 1
       October providing day currencies have been maintained. Inexperienced aircrew members
       regain night currency by demonstrating proficiency in delinquent sorties/events to an
       instructor.
       4.7.4.2. NVG Currency does not need to be maintained from 1 April through 30
       September, however to remain BMC/CMR currency must be regained by 31 October. To
       regain currency, the most appropriate instructors, as selected by the SQ/CC will fly an
       NVG route. Other non-current crew members will regain currency by demonstrating
       proficiency to an instructor.
4.8. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
training IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2HC-130JV2 and this instruction.
4.9. Multiple Series C-130 Certifications.
   4.9.1. MC-130J qualified aircrew may fly RAP events in HC-130J aircraft without additional
   waiver or additional currencies provided differences training is accomplished IAW Chapter
   2.
   4.9.2. MAJCOMs will define authorized RAP events/sorties that may be accomplished on C-
   130J aircraft/WST. Differences training will be conducted IAW Chapter 2.
4.10. Other Training Categories.
   4.10.1. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. AFI 11-202V1 establishes
   flight surgeon continuation flying requirements.
   4.10.2. Flight Test Engineers (FTE). The flight test engineer is an authorized aircrew
   composition for all ACC aircraft IAW AFI 65-503, Table 36-1, Authorized Aircrew
   Composition-Active Forces.          Any ACC, AFMC or ARC flight test engineer
   assigned/attached to a dedicated test organization, on Aeronautical Orders and authorized to
   fly on HC-130 aircraft (documented on AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC / Active Flying
   Justification) is permitted to fly on any HC-130 aircraft during designated flight test sorties
   and any spin up and familiarization flights required for test plan development.
       4.10.2.1. For operational units supporting testing requirements, the OG/CC will approve
       FTE to fly on unit aircraft and designate the Host Aviation Resource Management
       (HARM) office to track currency requirements. Duration of approval is at the discretion
       of the OG/CC and based on testing support requirements. Approval should be
       documented as a memorandum for record maintained by the HARM office.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                                    37


       4.10.2.2. The FTE will accomplish and maintain ground currencies IAW the Table 4.9
       4.10.2.3. There are no flight currency requirements for FTEs.

4.11. N-BMC/N-CMR Regression. Aircrew may be regressed to N-BMC or N-CMR for one
or more of the reasons listed in the following paragraphs. Exception: AETC will determine
regression policy and guidance for FTU aircrew.
   4.11.1. While N-BMC/N-CMR, the SQ/CC will determine missions the aircrew may
   perform and supervision required.
   4.11.2. Units will track regression of all aircrew using unit certification document or
   approved unit developed product.
   4.11.3. Regression for loss of currency. Currency status for the purpose of tracking and
   reporting regression will be determined by units on the first duty day of each month.
38                                                    AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


     4.11.3.1. Aircrew delinquent for a ground training event affecting BMC/CMR status will
     be regressed to N-BMC/N-CMR. Crewmembers will accomplish the required ground
     training IAW governing directive prior to recertification.
     4.11.3.2. Loss of Flying Training Currency. Loss of currency in a flight training
     sortie/event affecting BMC/CMR status will result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR.
     Crewmembers will regain currency in delinquent sortie/event prior to being recertified as
     CMR.       Note: N-BMC/N-CMR crewmembers may fly unsupervised on CONUS and
     OCONUS missions if delinquent events are not flown, are not required for mission
     accomplishment, and do not result in loss in aircraft currency or qualification. OG/CC
     approval is required for other than local, routine or non-contingency missions.
  4.11.4. Regression for Failure to Meet RAP Lookback. 1-month and 3-month RAP
  lookback sortie requirements (rates) will be defined in the RTM. Both 1-month and 3-month
  sortie totals will be calculated on the first duty day of each month for both BMC and CMR
  aircrew. Only designated RAP sorties and contingency operations sorties may be used to
  determine lookback.
     4.11.4.1. Failure to Meet 1-Month Lookback. If a BMC/CMR aircrew member does
     not meet their 1-month RAP lookback requirements, a review will be made of their 3-
     month RAP lookback requirements. If the 3-month lookback has been met, aircrew may,
     at SQ/CC discretion, remain in CMR status.
     4.11.4.2. Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback. If an aircrew member fails to meet the
     3-month lookback requirement, SQ/CCs may either place the crewmember in probation
     status for one month or regress the crewmember to N-CMR/N-BMC.
         4.11.4.2.1. Probation. Place aircrew in probation status for one month (30 days). If
         SQ/CC chooses probation, the aircrew member will reestablish a 1-month lookback at
         the end of the probation period to remain BMC/CMR. Failure to establish a 1-month
         lookback at the end of the probation period will result in regression to N-BMC/N-
         CMR. Probation status will be documented in the individual‘s training folder.
         4.11.4.2.2. CMR/BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC must complete a
         SQ/CC-approved recertification program. At a minimum this program will consist of
         RAP sorties equaling 1/2 of the required monthly RAP sortie rate. Upon completion
         of the program, crewmembers must then meet a 1-month lookback prior to
         recertification as CMR/BMC. Missions and events accomplished during the
         recertification program apply toward monthly and training-cycle RAP requirements.
     4.11.4.3. For aircrew members who do not meet lookback requirements throughout the
     training cycle, the SQ/CC may elect to initiate actions to:
         4.11.4.3.1. Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position, or
         4.11.4.3.2. Remove the aircrew member from active flying status.
     4.11.4.4. Lookback computations for new aircrew members begin following completion
     of MQT. New aircrew members who have been mission certified for less than 3 months
     will meet 1-month lookback to maintain status until a 3-month lookback is established.
     SQ/CCs may apply probation rules if a new aircrew member fails to meet 1-month
     lookback while establishing 3-month lookback.
AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012                                                            39


Figure 4.3. Lookback Regression Flow Chart.




   4.11.5. Regression for failure of a Periodic Evaluation. Aircrew members who fail a
   periodic evaluation will be regress to N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable. Requalification is
   required prior to recertification as BMC or CMR.
   4.11.6. Regression for Failure to Meet End-of-Training-Cycle Requirements. Aircrew
   who fail to complete RTM-defined, end-of-cycle sortie and/or event requirements may
   require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. In all
   cases, report training shortfalls IAW RTM guidance.
      4.11.6.1. Refer to paragraph 4.12 to determine if proration can be applied.
      4.11.6.2. End-of-Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew member‘s
      experience level on the last day of the current training cycle.
      4.11.6.3. Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle Total RAP Sortie Requirements.
 40                                                      AFI11-2HC-130JV1 7 MARCH 2012


          4.11.6.3.1. Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle total RAP sortie requirements may
          continue at CMR/BMC if both 1- and 3-month RAP lookback requirements are met
          and sortie deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
          4.11.6.3.2. If the SQ/CC determines the sortie deficiency is significant or lookback is
          not met, the crew member will be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC. To regain
          CMR/BMC status, aircrew must complete a SQ/CC approved recertification program.
          Note: Sortie type breakout, as defined by the RTM, is provided as a guideline. This
          should normally be followed as closely as possible, but variances are authorized.
          SQ/CCs may use variations in sortie types as a basis for end-of-cycle regression. If
          the SQ/CC determines sortie type deficiency is significant, aircrew may be regressed
          to N-CMR/N-BMC. Prior to CMR/BMC recertification, aircrew will complete all
          deficient sortie types and any additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. These
          sorties may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle.
       4.11.6.4. Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle RAP Event Requirements. Aircrew failing to
       meet end-of-cycle RAP event requirements will be regressed to N-BMC/N-CMR. Prior
       to CMR/BMC recertification, aircrew must complete all deficient events and any
       additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. Remedial events may count towards
       total requirements for the new training cycle.
4.12. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate training requirements for DNIF status, emergency leaves, non-flying
TDY/exercises, and combat/contingency deployments. Normal annual leave will not be
considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather that precludes the unit from flying for
more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. The following guidelines
apply:
   4.12.1. Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.12.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the
   training cycle. Use Table 4.10 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on
   cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
   4.12.3. If IQT or MQT is completed after the start of the training cycle, prorate training
   requirements for availability following completion of formal training.
   4.12.4. Proration Formula. Use the following formula to determine prorated training
   requirements: number of months available times the sortie/event volume divided by the
   number of months in the training period. Round prorated fractions of less than 0.5 to the
   next lower whole number. Do not prorate below one.

  4.12.5. Contingency Operations.
     4.12.5.1. CMR aircrew TDY/deployed in support of actual flying contingency operations
     may be reported as CMR throughout the TDY/deployment.
     4.12.5.2. All sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as contingency
     operations sorties. Normally, these sorties and the events logged on them do not count
     toward total RAP requirements for the training cycle, but may be used for lookback and
     to update currencies. Upon returning from contingency operations, units will prorate
     training requirements based on the period of non-availability. Proration is authorized for
     the deployment preparation and recovery time where home station flying is reduced by
     the MAJCOM.
     4.12.5.3. Deployed commanders may authorize contingency sorties that provided valid
     training to be logged toward total RAP requirements for the training cycle.
        4.12.5.3.1. Events accomplished on these sorties will count toward total RAP event
        requirements for the training cycle.
        4.12.5.3.2. Upon return from contingency operations, calculate the sorties/events to
        be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtract the authorized number of
        contingency RAP sorties/events. The difference is the allowable sortie/event
        proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. The home station SQ/CC is the final
        approval authority for authorizing deployed accomplishments to be logged toward
        total RAP requirements for the training cycle.

6.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-out Report, and aircrew training guides.
AETC units will follow HQ AETC Guidance (AETCI 36-2205 series publications).
   6.1.1. Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022 (or MAJCOM equivalent), for formal training
   (either at formal school or in-unit), mission qualification, special mission qualification or
   certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification,
   qualification or re-qualification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any
   corrective action or additional training (unless otherwise noted in this instruction).
      6.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
      corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
      examiner who evaluated the aircrew member's performance will enter comments
      pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023. Use the existing training folder for
      end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
      6.1.1.2. At the unit commander's discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing
      more than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into
      one AF Form 4022; e.g., a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to AC may have his
      or her mission upgrade combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
   6.1.2. Access to Training Records. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their
   personnel in a location readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The
   trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
   6.1.3. Instructor Procedures. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to
   include AF Forms 4023 and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those
   areas not previously accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional
   training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
   6.1.4. Training Folder Review. Operations officers will review active training folders
   quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly
   review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be annotated on AF Form 4023 or in the training
   guide.
   6.1.5. Completion of Training. Upon completion of training, an AF Form 4025 will be
   generated. The original will be placed in the completed AF Form 4022 and a facsimile will
   be placed in Section V of the student‘s permanent training folder.
      6.1.5.1. Disposition of Training Records. All squadron training offices will retain all AF
      Forms 4022 contents until one year after training close out and then return them to the
      crewmember. No unit will insert AF Forms 4022, 4023, 4024, 4025 or training guides
      into FEFs. Refer to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

   and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level the
   crewmember will achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a knowledge
   standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The standards
   for specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and evaluation
   standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this instruction. For
   those weapons systems that do not have any RPL listing, all events will have an RPL of "3"
   for performance and "C" for knowledge (if knowledge standards are used in addition to
   performance standards). Exception: One-time events required for familiarization and not
   listed in the MTL and ESD or specific weapon system instruction will not have performance
   and knowledge standard assigned. Performance and knowledge standards are listed in Table
   6.1
       6.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only
       subsequent grade allowed for that event is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when a
       maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
       ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an explanation in the student‘s training folder (AF Form 4023).
       The overall grade is at the instructor‘s discretion. For regression, the student will re-
       obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in order to be recommended
       for a checkride (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).
       6.4.11.2. Proficiency Advance. In order to recommend a crewmember for a checkride
       (when applicable) or certification (associated with completion of training), the final grade
       for each event will meet the Required Proficiency Level (RPL) and the total number
       accomplished will normally meet or exceed the Total Number Required. EXCEPTION:
       Highly proficient crewmembers may be ―proficiency advanced‖ and the total number
       accomplished may be less than the Total Number Required.

               FLYING TRAINING SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A3.1. Sortie Definitions:
   A3.1.1. Basic Sortie [SX23]. Sortie must be flown on an HC-130J aircraft. Log basic
   sorties on local or operational missions that include appropriate pre-mission planning;
   preflight according to flight publications; preparation of performance, take-off and landing
   data; weather and crew/passenger briefings, flight plan filing, and post-mission procedures.
   Additional requirements by crew position are as follows:
       A3.1.1.1. Pilots will complete a takeoff and landing.
       A3.1.1.2. CSO will monitor a departure and approach. If more than one qualified CSO is
       on a flight, each may obtain sortie credit on the same flight provided each one occupies
       the CSO position, maintains a log, performs CSO duties, and        meets             the
       requirements of the Basic Sortie criteria.
       A3.1.1.3. Loadmasters may credit any type of mission actually flown. Two crew
       members may log a sortie on the same mission if the applicable requirements of the Basic
       Sortie criteria are met.
       A3.1.1.4. All. Log only one Basic Sortie per mission.
   A3.1.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [SX10]. A local training mission for BAQ,
   transition and emergency procedures. Fly maneuvers under the direct supervision of an IP.
   IPs are not required to fly with another IP to credit this event and need not accomplish all
   events on a single sortie. Complete all maneuvers to an acceptable level of proficiency as
   determined by the IP. Aircraft commanders should emphasize left-seat flying duties;
   however, pilots may fly in the either seat for proficiency. Complete all maneuvers to an
   acceptable level of proficiency as determined by the IP to log the LPS. Should the LPS be
   incomplete for weather or aircraft malfunction, the instructor will determine whether the
   entire LPS will be re-accomplished or just the incomplete events. Credit the LPS upon
   completion of the last event. A minimum of one hour actual flying time is required to log the
   LPS. As the absolute minimum, conduct the following maneuvers:                  Note: Unit
   commanders may add to the following minimum LPS sortie criteria. See AFI 11-2HC-
   130JV3 for additional information training policy and restrictions.
       A3.1.2.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures.
       A3.1.2.2. Two instrument approaches (one precision, one non-precision). At least one
