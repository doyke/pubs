This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, by providing
guidance and procedures supervisors need to schedule civilian employees (except non-US citizen
employees employed outside the United States and the District of Columbia) for work and
holiday observances. It tells how to establish work schedules, rest and lunch periods, make
ready and clean-up time. It describes work subject to premium pay and shows how to get
approval for holiday work.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) as paragraph 2.3, (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2), and
authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA)
programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders
(para 3.3). Organization and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for
beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of
duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative workplace
arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations (para
3.2). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 which had previously
been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample AWA
agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.

1. Scope of Applicability. This instruction applies Air Force-wide, to appropriated fund
civilian employees, including US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard Title 5,
United States Code.
2. Terms and Definitions.              The following terms and definitions are used in this instruction.
     2.1. Administrative Workweek. The Air Force administrative workweek begins at 0001
     Sunday and ends at 2400 on the next following Saturday. The calendar day on which a shift
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                            3


  begins is considered the day of duty for that day even though the day of duty extends into the
  next calendar day or into the following administrative workweek.
  2.2. Alternative Work Schedules (AWS).             Work schedules made up of flexible or
  compressed schedules.
  2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA).             Working under a flexiplace
  arrangement, either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center
  (See Attachment 2 for a sample agreement).
  2.3. (MAXWELLAFB) See Attachments 4 and 5 for guidance on Telework.
  2.4. Basic Workweek. The days and hours of an administrative workweek which make up a
  full-time employee’s regularly scheduled 40-hour workweek.
  2.5. Compressed Schedule. Compressed schedule means for a full-time employee, an 80-
  hour biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the
  case of a part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours
  which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays.
  2.6. First 40-Hours. The first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than
  six days of the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is
  impractical to prescribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday.
  2.7. Flexible Schedule. Flexible schedule is that portion of the work day during which the
  employee has the option to select and vary starting and stopping times within established
  limits set by installation level approving officials for AWS.
  2.8. Holiday Work. Work performed on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday.
  2.9. Observed Day. Observed day is a holiday in which employees are given time off on a
  day other than the date which the holiday actually falls on.
  2.10. Part Time. In some circumstances it is not possible to obtain or use an employee’s
  services for the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when
  service on a regular, repetitive basis is required at least one day during each administrative
  workweek, however, additional service may be required during the remainder of the
  administrative workweek.
  2.11. Regular Tour of Duty. The regular tour of duty for Air Force employees is five 8-hour
  days, Monday through Friday.
  2.12. Special Tour of Duty for Educational Purposes. A special tour of duty of no less than
  40 hours in an administrative workweek which may be established by supervisors to permit
  employees to take courses at nearby educational institutions.
  2.13. Standby. Certain types of work require employees to remain at their duty stations for
  long periods of duty, a substantial part of which is standby time. For example, the tour of
  duty for firefighters generally is a 72-hour workweek of three 24-hour days. The tour is
  scheduled so that the employee is on duty three alternate 24-hour shifts during each
  administrative workweek, and deviations from this tour are kept to a minimum. The basic
  weekly tour of duty for fire chiefs, assistant fire chiefs, fire prevention inspectors, and similar
  fire protection personnel is 40-hour workweek of five 8-hour days unless the duties of the
  position require substantial amounts of standby time.
 4                                       AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


     2.14. Uncommon Tour of Duty. Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include
     Saturday and or Sunday, for four workdays or less but not more than six days of the
     administrative workweek. An uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary
     for efficient operations or when the cost of operations can thus be reduced without imposing
     undue hardship on employees.
3. Basic Authority:
     3.1. Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders establish the hours for opening and
     closing the installation.
     3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish
     by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of
     duty including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and
     location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods
     for their respective organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated
     representative should set work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance
     mission requirements, efficiency and economy of operations, and employee needs. These
     determinations are subject to approval by the installation commander or his or her designated
     representative who has authority for operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant
     commanders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs
     approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to installation
     commanders as provided in 3.3.
        3.2.1. Organization and tenant commanders may also establish regularly scheduled tours
        of duty of more than 40 hours within the administrative workweek when such action is
        essential to mission accomplishment, and when other administrative action such as
        changes in authorized staffing or detail of personnel is neither feasible or desirable.
        Except under extraordinary circumstances, a tour of duty which includes regular overtime
        should not extend beyond 48 hours in an administrative workweek. Organization and
        tenant commanders may extend the regularly scheduled administrative workweek to any
        length exceeding 40 hours when emergency conditions exist and it is necessary for
        mission accomplishment. The extension of the tour of duty will be subject to the
        requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
     3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major
     Commands (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU)
     are authorized to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may
     delegate this authority to installation commanders
     3.4. Supervisors. Supervisors will generally schedule employee’s work on the same hours
     each day, and breaks in excess of one hour during a day will not be permitted. Supervisors
     must give a minimum of one week’s notice to employees when they are to be assigned to a
     different tour of duty or to different hours of duty except as provided under AWS or for
     educational purposes.
        3.4.1. Commanders may grant an exception to this requirement when circumstances
        preclude compliance, for example, when a change in shifts by a contractor requires
        immediate corresponding change in the tour of inspectors, or when normal operations are
        interrupted by events beyond the control of management, such as, fire, flood, breakdown
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                        5


      of equipment. Commanders assure that changes in established work schedules are kept to
      a minimum and made only when necessary to resolve operational problems.
4. Tours of Duty:
   4.1. Tours of Duty for Educational Purposes. Supervisors may establish special tours of
   duty for educational purposes.
      4.1.1. Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes cannot be
      paid premium pay solely because the rescheduling of his or her tour of duty causes him or
      her to work on a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise
      be required.
      4.1.2. Supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly
      scheduled shift requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs
      are incurred. Supervisors must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is
      assigned to or changed from a special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of
      premium pay. Supervisors must maintain a record of these tours of duty for the purpose
      of responding to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) inquiries.
   4.2. Posting Work Schedules. Supervisors must post copies of work schedules for all tours
   of duty, except regular Monday through Friday tours, which include the names of assigned
   employees in the work area. Supervisors must maintain a copy of employee’s work
   schedules in their operating office. Supervisors:
      4.2.1. Post a written statement of actual work requirements for standby tours of duty.
      4.2.2. Give employees with regularly scheduled 60 or 72 hour standby tours of duty 30
      calendar days notice of any reduction in the percentage of premium pay resulting from a
      change in work requirements.
      4.2.3. Give employees with regularly scheduled 40-hour tours of duty plus scheduled
      standby time as much notice as possible when changing their duty schedule.
      4.2.4. Review work requirements periodically for changes which may affect the payment
      of premium compensation and revise work schedules where necessary.
   4.3. Scheduling Rest Periods. Supervisors may schedule short rest periods, not exceeding 15
   minutes during each four hours of continuous work, when the supervisor believes the rest
   periods will be of benefit to the service. (NOTE: Supervisors must adhere to applicable
   labor management agreements if they contain provisions for the granting of rest periods.)
      4.3.1. Criteria to be followed by supervisors in determining the justification for granting
      rest periods are:
          4.3.1.1. Protection of employee’s health by relieving them from hazardous work or
          very physical work.
          4.3.1.2. Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential.
          4.3.1.3. Relieve those who work in confined spaces.
          4.3.1.4. Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production.

     4.4. Scheduling Lunch Periods. When supervisors schedule lunch (or other meal) periods,
     during which the employee is entirely free of the duties of his or her position, the period is
     not considered as duty time for which compensation is paid.
        4.4.1. Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty
        when one or two shifts are in operation.
        4.4.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an
        overlapping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible, supervisors may
        authorize an on-the-job lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch periods
        require that:
            4.4.2.1. Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations. Under
            these conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is
            compensable.
            4.4.2.2. Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work
            will not receive compensation for that time.
     4.5. Scheduling Make Ready and Clean-Up Time. Incidental duties that are directly
     connected with the performance of a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or
     materials, undergoing inspections, and similar tasks are considered part of the job
     requirements within the employee’s established tour of duty. Supervisors must arrange work
     shifts so that time required for incidental duties will be part of the 8-hour day.
        4.5.1. When incidental duties cannot be part of the regularly scheduled workday, the
        extra time for which overtime may be paid to an employee, will not exceed 30 minutes a
        day.
5. Holiday Observances:
     5.1. Holiday Duty. Supervisors must not require employees to work on holidays or days
     designated as observed days, unless the work is justified by unusual circumstances or if the
     maintenance of usual essential services is involved.
        5.1.1. Supervisors will order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing
        by an official designated to authorize holiday work. Supervisors must obtain this
        approval before work is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it
        constitutes authority for expenditure of funds and certification that funds are available to
        pay the employee. Supervisors ordering work on a holiday or employees required to
        remain on duty during an emergency will not require advance approval for the work.
        Supervisors must record the reasons for the holiday and the hours worked by the
        employees no later than the following workday. This requirement does not apply to tours
        of duty regularly scheduled on a holiday or observed day for employees engaged in
        essential services such as firefighters, police, hospital employees, or other service
        personnel. The supervisor will record holiday work on an AF Form 428, Request for
        Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time.
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                       7


  5.2. Observed Day. When a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, observe that
  day as the holiday. If a holiday falls on Sunday and the employee has a regularly scheduled
  40-hour basic workweek of Monday through Friday, the employee will observe the following
  Monday as the holiday. When the holiday falls on Saturday, the employee will observe the
  holiday on the proceeding Friday.
     5.2.1. When a holiday falls on a Sunday and that Sunday is a nonworkday for employees
     with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek of other than Monday through
     Friday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday.
         5.2.1.1. When a holiday falls on the nonworkday designated as the day in-lieu-of
         Sunday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. When a holiday
         or a designated observed day falls on an employee’s nonworkday (Monday through
         Saturday), the workday immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday.
     5.2.2. Deleted
  5.3. Deleted
  5.4. When full-time employees on a compressed work schedule are relieved or prevented
  from working on a day designated as a holiday, they are entitled to basic pay for the number
  of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
  5.5. Holiday observances for employees who work a flexible schedule are the same as those
  for full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek.
  5.6. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee’s regularly scheduled workday, the
  employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to
  work on the actual day of the holiday.
     5.6.1. If full-time employees observe an "in-lieu-of" day instead of the actual holiday and
     that "in-lieu-of" day falls within a part-time employee’s work schedule, the part-time
     employee will not get that day off with pay.
     5.6.2. When a holiday is observed by full-time employees on a day within the part-time
     employee’s regularly scheduled workweek and the part-time employee is prevented from
     working that day, the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours
     he or she is scheduled to work on that day.
     5.6.3. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee’s nonworkday and is observed by
     full-time employees that day, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.
     5.6.4. When a part-time employee is on a flexible schedule and is relieved or prevented
     from working on a day designated as a holiday by a Federal statute or Executive Order
     (E.O.), the employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the
     employee would have worked on that holiday up to eight hours.
     5.6.5. When a holiday falls on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu
     of" day for that holiday.
     5.6.6. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and is relieved or
     prevented from working on a day within the employee’s scheduled tour of duty that is
     designated as a holiday by Federal statute or E.O., the employee is entitled to basic pay
     for the number of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
8                                        AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       5.6.7. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls
       on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday.
    5.7. Duration of Holiday. The full 24-hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the
    duration of a holiday. However, when an employee’s regular workday begins on a holiday
    and extends into the next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine
    the employee’s entitlement to holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday.
    If an employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty includes two shifts beginning on a holiday,
    the first shift is considered as a holiday to determine holiday benefits.

               ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS (AWA)

A2.1. REASONS FOR AWA. Employers offer alternative workplace arrangements for many
reasons. Such arrangements may:
   A2.1.1. Improve the quality of work life and job performance and increases productivity,
   e.g., reduce office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading,
   analyzing and writing;
   A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance
   work and family demands;
   A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;
   A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
   A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees
   who have partially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site
   location;
   A2.1.6. Accommodate employees who have temporary or continuing health problems or
   who might otherwise have to retire on disability;
   A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic
   recruitment pool; and
   A2.1.8. Decrease traffic and parking congestion, energy consumption and air pollution.
A2.2. Organizations planning to use AWA should address issues such as the following: work
assignment/performance requirements, time and attendance, work schedule and tour of duty,
duty station, leave, equipment/supplies, labor relations issues, and other related work
arrangement requirements.
A2.3. Sample Agreement Between Organization, Supervisor, And Employee Approved For
An Alternative Workplace Arrangement On A Continuing Basis: The supervisor and
employee should each keep a copy of the agreement for reference.
Organization_______________________         Employee____________________________

Voluntary Participation. (Name)____________________________, the employee, voluntarily
agrees to work at the approved alternative workplace indicated below and to follow all applicable
work-related policies and procedures. The employee recognizes that the flexiplace arrangement
is not an employee benefit or entitlement, but an additional method the organization may

Trial Period. The employee and organization agree to try out the arrangement for at least
(specify number) months unless unforeseeable difficulties require earlier cancellation.

Salary and Benefits. Unless there is a change in the actual number of hours worked, a
flexiplace arrangement in itself is not a basis for changing the employee’s salary or benefits.
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                         11

                                      TEXT OF IC 99-1

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) as paragraph 2.3, (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2.),
and authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation
commanders (para 3.3). Organization and tenant commanders establish by written order the
daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty, including
uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative
workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective
organizations (para 3.2). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a
sample AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is
indicated by a bar (|). The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.
2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement,
either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2
for a sample agreement).
3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by
written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty
including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for
alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective
organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set
work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency
and economy of operations, and employee needs. These determinations are subject to approval
by the installation commander or his or her designated representative who has authority for
operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant commanders set the hours and locations
for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they
delegate this authority to installation commanders as provided in 3.3
3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major
Commands (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are
authorized to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this
authority to installation commanders.

                                         TELEWORK

A4.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Applicability. This Telework Policy applies to all
appropriated fund civilian employees serviced by the Maxwell AFB Civilian Personnel Section
and includes definitions, approval authorities, procedures and useful web links. This policy is
intended to provide guidance in administering the Telework Program, pursuant to the Telework
Enhancement Act of 2010, Public Law No. 111-292, and other applicable telework guidance.
A4.2. (MAXWELLAFB)Definitions:
   A4.2.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Ad hoc telework: Also referred to as “situational
   telework”; telework that occurs on an occasional non-routine or ad-hoc basis. Telework that
   occurs to complete short-term special assignment or to accommodate special circumstances
   is also considered situational/ad hoc even though the telework may occur continuously for a
   specific period.
   A4.2.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Alternate work site: A place away from the traditional
   work site that has been approved for the performance of officially assigned duties. It may be
   an employee’s home, a telework center or other approved work site.
   A4.2.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Emergency telework: Performed in an employee’s
   home or alternate work site during a crisis situation or emergency event by those employees
   who perform duties in support of mission requirements during crisis situations or
   contingencies.
   A4.2.4. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Official work site: Location of the traditional work site
   for the employee’s position, as long as the employee is scheduled to physically report at least
   twice each biweekly pay period on a regular and recurring basis to the traditional work site.
   A4.2.5. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Regular/recurring telework:               An approved work
   schedule where eligible employees regularly work at an alternate work site on a regular,
   recurring and ongoing basis at least twice each biweekly pay period.
   A4.2.6. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Telework: Any arrangement in which an employee
   performs officially assigned duties at an alternate work site on a regular/recurring or on an ad
   hoc basis (not including while on official travel).
   A4.2.7. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Telework Agreement:                  A written agreement that
   outlines the terms and conditions of the telework arrangement, must be completed and signed
   by an employee and appropriate official(s) in his/her mission area/agency/staff office and
   coordinated with the Civilian Personnel Section. Use of DD Form 2946, Department of
   Defense Telework Agreement, is mandatory.
   A4.2.8. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Traditional work site: The location where an employee
   would work absent a telework arrangement.
A4.3. (Added) (MAXWELLAFB) Approval Authorities.
   A4.3.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Positions Eligible for Telework. The management
   authority for approval of positions eligible to participate in regular/recurring telework will be
   the commander or his/her designee(s).
 20                                     AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   A4.3.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Employee Participation in Telework.                      Once the
   determination has been made as to which positions are eligible to participate in telework, the
   authority to approve employees’ participation in telework will be the commander or his/her
   designee(s).
A4.4. (MAXWELLAFB) Eligibility. (Added) Management must determine both position
eligibility and employee eligibility. To assist in making these determinations, refer to
Attachment 5, Determining Eligibility for Telework.
   A4.4.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) All appropriated fund civilian positions are presumed
   eligible for telework with the exception of those requiring direct handling of classified
   materials on a daily basis; those that require daily on-site activity or face-to-face personal
   contacts that cannot be handled remotely (e.g., hands-on contact with machinery, equipment
   or vehicles; direct patient care). A position is eligible for telework if only a portion of the
   work can be done from an alternate work site. A telework schedule may not cause office
   coverage problems or telephone answering coverage issues in offices that take and transfer
   calls to other offices or superiors.
   A4.4.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Although the use of telework is allowed, employees do
   not have the right to participate in telework. Commanders should allow maximum flexibility
   for employees to telework to the extent that mission readiness or accomplishment is not
   compromised. Employees who are approved to telework at home agree to permit access to
   the home work site by agency representatives during normal working hours to ensure
   compliance with the terms of the telework agreement.
   A4.4.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) There are two categories of employees who would be
   ineligible to participate:
      A4.4.3.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Any employee who has been officially
      disciplined for absences without permission for more than five (5) calendar days in any
      calendar year; and
      A4.4.3.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Any employee who has been officially
      disciplined for violations of subpart G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Employees
      of the Executive Branch for reviewing, downloading or exchange of pornography,
      including child pornography, on a federal government computer or while performing
      official federal government duties.
   A4.4.4. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) To be eligible for participation in the Telework
   Program, an employee must have an acceptable or equivalent performance rating and
   maintain it for continued participation.
   A4.4.5. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Probationary status employees generally are not
   eligible for telework because probationary periods are established to allow supervisors an
   opportunity to personally observe and evaluate employee performance.
   A4.4.6. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Any employee who is newly appointed to a trainee or
   entry level position or whose performance or conduct warrants more close supervisory
   direction than telework may provide would typically not be eligible to telework.
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                       21


   A4.4.7. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Teleworkers may be required to return to the traditional
   work site on scheduled telework days based on operational requirements. In situations where
   the employee is called to return to the office outside normal work hours, the recall shall be
   handled IAW established policy and/or Collective Bargaining Agreement, if applicable.
A4.5. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Equipment. Government-furnished                     and      maintained
computer equipment and software, with appropriate security measures, may be provided to the
teleworker by the teleworker’s organization. Excess property should be the first source of supply
before considering the purchase of new equipment. Organizations are encouraged to maintain a
working pool of computers available for telework employees.
   A4.5.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Organizations must ensure adequate property
   management procedures for their accountable property (e.g., computers), whether owned or
   leased, to ensure an immediately retrievable inventory and physical location identification of
   automated data processing equipment (ADPE) and software.
   A4.5.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Government-furnished equipment must only be used
   for official duties--family members and friends of teleworkers are not authorized to use any
   government-furnished equipment. The employee must return all government-furnished
   equipment and materials to the agency at the conclusion of teleworking arrangements or at
   the organization’s request. The employee agrees to permit access to the home work site by
   agency representative as required during normal working hours to repair or maintain
   government-furnished equipment.
   A4.5.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) The government assumes no responsibility for any
   operating costs associated with an employee using his/her residence as an alternate work site.
   This includes home maintenance, insurance and utilities. In addition, any costs associated
   with computer connectivity at the telework location will be the sole responsibility of the
   employee.
   A4.5.4. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) This supplement does not provide any authority with
   respect to use of classified materials or information. Classified material, regardless of the
   form, may not be present at any current employee’s teleworking offices.
   A4.5.5. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) All teleworking practices must be consistent with DoD
   security and information technology policies.
   A4.5.6. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) All government-furnished computer equipment is an
   individual unit responsibility and is subject to all AF network policies whether used at
   telework site or traditional office. All government-furnished computer equipment used for
   telework must be physically connected to the base network once every seven days for a
   continuous eight hour period to allow for updates. Any "working pool of computers" must
   remain connected to the network when not issued.
A4.6. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Safety. Employees who are directly engaged in performing
the duties of their jobs are covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA),
regardless of whether the work is performed on the agency’s premises or at an alternative work
site.

   A4.6.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) The employee must notify the supervisor immediately
   of any accident or injury at the alternative work site, provide details of the accident or injury,
   and complete the AETC Form 435, Mishap Data Worksheet, and the Department of Labor
   (DOL) Form CA-1, Federal Notice of Traumatic Injury and Claim for Continuation of
   Pay/Compensation.
   A4.6.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) For work-at-home arrangements, the employee is
   required to designate one area in the home as the official work station. The government's
   potential exposure to liability is restricted to this official work station for the purposes of
   telework. Each employee with an approved Telework Agreement for work-at-home telework
   must sign a safety checklist that proclaims the home safe. Employees are responsible for
   ensuring that their homes comply with safety requirements.
   A4.6.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) The Government is not liable for damages to an
   employee’s personal or real property while the employee is working at the approved
   alternative work site, except to the extent the government is held liable by the Federal Tort
   Claims Act or the Military and Civilian Employees Claims Act. Occupational Safety and
   Health Administration rules govern Federal employee work place safety.
A4.7. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Security: Employees must protect sensitive unclassified
data, including Privacy Act or For Official Use Only data, consistent with the guidance set forth
in Section 552a of Title 5, U.S. C. (also known as the Privacy Act of 1974) (Reference (m)),
DoDD 5400.11 (Reference (j)), and DoD 5400.7-R Reference, (n))as well as DoD Component
policy.
   A4.7.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Teleworking employees who access Personally
   Identifiable Information (PII) may only do so on encrypted government furnished equipment
   (GFE) requiring 2 factor authentication for access, in accordance with OMB Memorandum
   07-16 (Reference (o)).
   A4.7.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Extraction of PII from DoD systems onto GFE used for
   teleworking is prohibited unless approved by a manager and logged and erased in accordance
   with the requirements of OMB Memorandum 06-16 (Reference (p)).
   A4.7.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) The use of personal e-mail accounts for PII
   transmission is strictly prohibited. PII may only be e-mailed between government email
   accounts and must be encrypted and digitally signed.
A4.8. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Procedures. Management will not establish arbitrary
guidelines regarding the number of offsite days per pay period included in telework plans. The
number of days will be based on requirements of the individual job and the organization (i.e.,
need for customer interaction, team meetings, use of onsite tools, etc.) In some circumstances,
regular/recurring telework may include full-time telework.
   A4.8.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Each February, the Civilian Personnel Section will
   remind commanders, directors and supervisors of the requirement to conduct annual reviews
   of all positions in their organization to determine those suitable for regular/recurring telework
   and provide that information to the Civilian Personnel Section. Eligible positions will consist
   of all appropriated fund civilian positions based on the nature of the position. Positions shall
   not be excluded from eligibility solely on the basis of occupational series or grade, with the
   exception of positions described in paragraph A4.4.3.1 and A4.4.3.2.
AFI36-807_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                         23


   A4.8.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) A Telework Agreement (DD Form 2946) is required
   for each employee prior to the commencement of his/her teleworking. The Telework
   Agreement must be coordinated with the Civilian Personnel Section to ensure compliance
   with Telework Program guidance.
   A4.8.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Management reserves the right to require employees to
   report to the traditional work site on scheduled telework days based on operational
   requirements.
   A4.8.4. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) A telework arrangement does not alter the terms and
   conditions of appointment, including an employee’s official duty station, salary, benefits,
   individual rights or obligations. All pay, leave and travel entitlements shall be based on the
   official duty station. The telework arrangement shall not affect other conditions of
   employment, (e.g., hours of work), unless otherwise specified in the telework agreement.
   A4.8.5. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Although telework may give some employees more
   time for their family responsibilities, they may not use duty time for providing dependent
   care or any purpose other than official duties. The Telework Program is not intended to
   reduce dependent care costs or serve as a substitute for child care, day care, elder care or any
   other type of dependent care.
   A4.8.6. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) The telework arrangement may be terminated by either
   the employee or the supervisor by giving advance written notice. The advance notice period
   will be one two-week pay period unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
A4.9. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Training. Online telework training modules (Telework 101)
for            employees             and              supervisors          are           at
http://www.telework.gov/Tools_and_Resources/Training/index.aspx. Prior to participating
in telework, both the employee participating in telework and the employee’s supervisor must
complete the online training; training certificates are maintained by the supervisor in the
employee’s AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, file.
A4.10. (MAXWELLAFB)Summary. Telework can assist managers in attracting, recruiting
and retaining the best possible work force, and by decreasing employee commute times and other
work/life stressors, telework can help make employees more effective in their jobs. Telework
gives employees more flexibility in meeting personal and professional responsibilities and can
also provide an employee a work area free from distractions where they can focus and be more
productive. This stated, the opportunity to participate in a telework arrangement is offered with
the understanding that it is the responsibility of the supervisor and the telework employee to
adhere to all Telework Program policies, procedures and documents.

                            Attachment 5 (Added-MAXWELLAFB)
                    DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR TELEWORK

A5.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Determining Eligibility for Jobs/Functions that can be
Performed at an Alternate Work Site. Many jobs have duties and responsibilities that can be
considered appropriate for telework on a regular basis. A final decision on this issue must be
based on an assessment of the full scope of elements, to include the major duties of positions; the
need for face-to-face contact with supervisors, other employees, clients, and the general public;
need for access to materials which cannot be moved from the main office; special facilities or
equipment necessary that could be cost-prohibitive or impossible to duplicate; the portability of
supplies and equipment; and the ability to perform the work away from the main work site.
Although a portion of jobs do not lend themselves to regular telework arrangements, this does
not preclude the assignment of duties on an episodic, periodic, or even a one-time basis that can
be performed at an alternate work site. Table A5.1 is a guide for supervisors and managers in
deciding whether jobs/duties are suitable for telework arrangements. Supervisors over positions
involving the latter types of duties and functions should look at work functions as broadly as
possible to determine whether employees occupying these positions can perform certain duties at
an alternate work site. Care must be exercised, however, to ensure that employees are not
routinely given duties outside the parameters of their officially assigned duties and
responsibilities that could affect the classification of their positions, when such duties are
assigned as a means to participate in telework.
