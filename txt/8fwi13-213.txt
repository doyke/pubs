                                            SCOPE

1.1. Airfield Driving Program (ADP) Responsibilities. This instruction establishes
responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle operations on the Kunsan AB Airfield.
Airfield driving is for official use only with maximum attention paid to safety and accident
prevention. Drivers will not deviate from procedures or principles set forth in this instruction
except in the interest of safety. Airfield safety is paramount. Conscientious and safe driving can
prevent most accidents. The requirements of this instruction must be included in the unit’s self-
inspection program if personnel perform airfield driving duties. A unit self-inspection checklist
is included as Attachment 4.
1.2. ADP Goals. The goal of the Airfield Driving Program is to maintain a safe flying
operations environment. Motor vehicles on the airfield present a clear and definite danger, both
to aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste and disregard for established safety
standards are the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle incidents.
1.3. ADP Standards. The standards set forth in this instruction apply to all motor vehicles on
the airfield as well as unit-owned/operated bicycles. Only properly trained and certified
personnel will drive on the Kunsan AB Airfield. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield
must be knowledgeable of and comply with this instruction. In addition, they must be trained on
local driving procedures and possess a valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency. All
personnel requiring access to the runway, to include the area within 100 feet from the edge of the
runway, must have “CMA Access” annotated by Airfield Management on their AF IMT 483 to
delineate who has specialized runway access training. The 8th Operations Support Squadron,
Airfield Management Operations (8 OSS/OSAM [AMOPS]) must endorse the AF IMT 483 in
order for it to be valid. This requirement applies to military and civilian employees assigned to,
visiting, contracted or on temporary duty to this base, regardless of the type of vehicle operated
(i.e., military, commercial and privately owned).
1.4. ADP Questions. This instruction does not address every possible airfield driving scenario.
Contact AMOPS to resolve any questions or for any required clarification.

   6.1.5. 25 mph (40 km/h) on Taxiway Papa (15 mph when driving within 200 feet of parking
   ramps IAW AFI 91-203 and on the runway).
   6.1.6. Emergency response vehicles responding to emergencies may exceed the normal
   speed limits, but will not use excessive speed. Speeds exceeding 35 mph (58 km/h) will only
   be driven in the most extreme cases of emergency response. Vehicle operators will proceed
   at a safe speed consistent with traffic and the weather conditions. Vehicles will have
   headlights, emergency flashers and beacons operating (if equipped). Emergency response in
   itself is not sole justification for speeding. Critical need to arrive at a destination in a short
   period of time must be required.
   6.1.7. Vehicles responding to “Red Ball” exercises and precautionary landings are not
   authorized to exceed speed limits.
6.2. Road Rules.
   6.2.1. All vehicles, except responding emergency and alert vehicles, will stop before
   entering the airfield, regardless of entry point, and conduct a FOD check IAW paragraph
   7.16 of this instruction.
   6.2.2. Vehicles will yield right of way to all taxiing and towed aircraft. Never cut-off or
   attempt to out-run an aircraft.
   6.2.3. Vehicles will never be driven directly in front of or behind a taxiing aircraft or into the
   path of taxiing or towed aircraft. Only “FOLLOW ME” vehicles may drive directly in front
   of an aircraft. Vehicles will not drive between an aircraft and a “FOLLOW ME” vehicle.
   Also, vehicles will never be driven between an aircraft and a marshaler.
   6.2.4. Obey the speed limits and technical order requirements for the type of vehicle being
   driven.
   6.2.5. Yield the right of way to all emergency response vehicles. Do not follow these

  6.2.6. It is the vehicle operator’s responsibility to maintain required distances between the
  vehicle and aircraft. Required distances are found in paragraph 6.4. of this instruction.
     6.2.6.1. It is the vehicle operator’s responsibility to ensure a spotter is present while
     backing towards an aircraft or other objects on the airfield.
  6.2.7. When encountering a taxiing fighter aircraft or helicopters, proceed to the far edge of
  the pavement surface, stop the vehicle and wait for the aircraft to pass.
  6.2.8. When encountering taxiing cargo or heavy aircraft, exit the pavement surface at the
  nearest intersection. If there are no pavement surfaces to exit on, quickly evacuate the
  pavement in a suitable grass or unpaved area. All vehicles evacuating the airfield to a grass
  or unimproved surface must complete a FOD check per paragraph 7.11. before re-entering an
  airfield pavement surface.
  6.2.9. Drive on the right side of taxiway surfaces. If possible, stay to the right side of the
  taxiway lights. AMOPS, 8 FW/SE and the FOD manager are the only vehicles authorized to
  drive along centerlines.
  6.2.10. Driving lanes in the Loops are located between the white line and pavement edge.
  When an aircraft approaches, turn into an unoccupied HAS location if possible; otherwise,
  stop the vehicle as close to the pavement edge as possible until aircraft passes. The driving
  lanes do not provide sufficient wing tip clearance (25 feet) so it may be necessary to exit into
  the grass; perform a FOD check upon returning to the paved surface.
  6.2.11. Do not park and leave a vehicle unattended in the Loop driving lanes.
  6.2.12. Do not leave a vehicle unattended on any taxiway, apron, runway or area within
  critical clearance distances to those areas. See paragraph 6.4. of this instruction for critical
  clearance distances.
  6.2.13. Vehicles crossing Taxiway Charlie and Foxtrot via Avenue “B” will stop, conduct a
  roll over FOD check, (See paragraph 7.16 for procedures) vehicle body debris check and
  then check for aircraft or vehicles on the taxiway before proceeding across. Do not proceed
  if the light is a steady red and/or the bell is sounding. In all cases, yield the right of way to
  aircraft and vehicles on those taxiways. If you approach the light and the bell or light is not
  working, notify AMOPS.
  6.2.14. Vehicles on Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot will use caution when crossing Avenue
  “B”, paying particular attention to cross vehicle traffic.
  6.2.15. Vehicles will yield the right of way to snow removal equipment. Their path and high
  speeds are required for effective snow removal operations. No vehicles will drive in their
  path, between them, or stop within 25 feet of their operational path.
  6.2.16. Vehicles traveling in convoy fashion will maintain a single file behind one lead
  vehicle to the far right of the shoulder or pavement edge. All vehicles will maintain a safe
  following distance and will not pass unless required for mission accomplishment.
  6.2.17. Use alternate access or travel routes whenever possible. These include perimeter
  road, infield access roads from perimeter road, Avenue “A” and Avenue “B.” Limit vehicle
  traffic crossing the runway to an absolute minimum. When crossing a runway is required
  during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                           29


6.3. Vehicle Rules.
   6.3.1. Vehicle movement will be held to the absolute minimum consistent with mission
   requirements. Use all non-airfield access routes and the perimeter road to the maximum
   extent possible. Airfield routes are not authorized for convenience or shortcuts.
   6.3.2. Vehicle operators will drive with the driver’s side toward the aircraft at all times.
   6.3.3. No vehicle will be left unattended in any movement area, taxiway, entrance to HAS or
   parking apron unless absolutely necessary for aircraft servicing or mission accomplishment.
   The driver will remain in the immediate area should the vehicle need to be moved on short
   notice.
   6.3.4. Unless required for maintenance, vehicles are prohibited from driving or parking
   immediately to the rear of aircraft. Vehicles performing maintenance at the rear of the
   aircraft may be parked provided the vehicle does not interfere with taxiing or engine running
   of aircraft.
   6.3.5. All vehicle operators must approach parked aircraft with the operator’s side of the
   vehicle toward the aircraft. Do not point vehicles directly toward an aircraft when parked on
   the airfield. Vehicles shall be oriented so they cannot roll forward or backwards into an
   aircraft. Vehicles parked at the side of the aircraft will be located clear of the wing tips and
   will be clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
   6.3.6. Vehicles will not be driven without a spotter within 25 feet of any part of an aircraft.
   Vehicles will never pass under any part of an aircraft or helicopter blade.
       6.3.6.1. If an official task requires driving under an aircraft, follow procedures prescribed
       by technical orders for that task. Guides or spotters will be posted to ensure minimum
       clearance is maintained.
   6.3.7. Vehicles will not be backed towards an aircraft except as authorized in certain towing,
   loading, servicing, or refueling operations. These operations will be conducted utilizing a
   spotter; the spotter is responsible for pre-positioning wheel chocks between vehicle and
   aircraft.
   6.3.8. Vehicle operators performing On-the-Job-Training (OJT) will not operate a vehicle
   within 50 feet of an aircraft.      This restriction does not apply to fire fighting
   vehicles/equipment, OJT operators towing aircraft, loading or unloading vans or vehicles
   servicing aircraft.
       6.3.8.1. Drivers in OJT status must be accompanied by a qualified instructor.
   6.3.9. Motorized vehicles will not be permitted to operate inside aircraft hangars when
   aircraft are present. Exception: Aircraft tow vehicles can operate in hangars for entry or
   removal of aircraft and as mission required, technical order authorized and according to
   established commander policy and procedures. Refueling trucks are exempt from this rule
   during wartime contingencies.
   6.3.10. Cellular/mobile phones will not be used at any time while driving on the airfield.
6.4. Critical Clearance Distances. Vehicle operators are solely responsible for maintaining
proper clearances.
30                                                                 8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


  6.4.1. Distances between aircraft and vehicles. All vehicle operators will maintain the
  following distances from aircraft with engines running, whether parked, stopped or in
  motion. These distances also apply to equipment and materials. Failure to abide by these
  requirements may result in revocation of airfield driving authorization.
     6.4.1.1. No vehicle will be driven 25 feet in front or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft
     with engines either operating or being started. This is to provide a safe distance to avoid
     jet blast from aircraft. Engine operation may expose personnel to dangers such as burns,
     high noise levels, jet blast from the exhaust and suction from intakes.
     6.4.1.2. Special equipment or cargo loading vehicles may be driven closer to aircraft
     when necessary to load/off-load if safety spotter and chocks are in place within 10 feet of
     an aircraft. Refuelers performing hot-pit refueling, maintenance vehicles removing AGE
     from the vicinity of aircraft, maintenance vehicles responding to aircraft requiring
     immediate attention to prevent launch delays, and the SOF vehicle during visual
     inspection of an aircraft are exempted.
  6.4.2. There are specific areas on the airfield considered NAVAID critical areas. No objects
  (vehicles, equipment, material, etc.) may be left in these areas. Objects in the critical areas
  can interrupt electronic signals between aircraft and NAVAIDS. Interruption of electronic
  signals can result in aircraft mishaps. This applies to permanent or temporary objects. Any
  person, agency or unit requiring objects or work in these areas need to contact the AFM prior
  to proceeding.
     6.4.2.1. The critical areas at Kunsan AB are as follows:
     6.4.2.2. Within 750 feet of the VORTAC. Objects in this area may interfere with the
     navigational signals, causing a flight safety issue.
     6.4.2.3. The Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Precision Approach Radar (PAR)
     critical area when the ceiling is 800 feet or less and/or visibility is two miles or less. The
     ILS/PAR critical area is the area on the runway side of instrument hold signs and
     markings. (See Attachment 6 for location of critical areas.) Objects in these areas can
     interfere with aircraft navigational equipment causing a severe flight safety hazard. If
     you are unsure, contact the ATCT via radio prior to entering an ILS/PAR critical area.
     The PAR touchdown area is protected by traffic lights on the perimeter road. When the
     traffic lights on perimeter road are steady red, hold position and wait to proceed until
     flashing yellow.
         6.4.2.3.1. The instrument hold signs and markings at Kunsan AB are located at the
         south end of Taxiway Papa, the north end of Taxiway Papa, Taxiway Bravo, Taxiway
         Delta and the Hot Cargo Pad. (See Attachment 10 for location of instrument hold
         locations.)
         6.4.2.3.2. The Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) is an 800 foot wide by 200 foot
         long rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending
         outward from the threshold, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches
         from ground vehicles and other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 feet, or
         visibility is less than ¾ statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet).
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                          31


   6.4.3. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles on the Airfield. No vehicle or
   equipment may be positioned as to pose an obstruction or hazard to any aircraft.
      6.4.3.1. Taxiways. Do not park vehicles less than 200 feet from taxiway centerlines. Do
      not park on Taxiway Papa in front of EOR shacks. Exception: Vehicles and aircraft
      support equipment are authorized to be parked in the immediate vicinity of HASs, flows
      and pads provided they do not interfere with aircraft operations. Extreme caution shall be
      exercised when parking in the vicinity of Taxiway Papa due to operations being
      conducted by aircraft with large wing spans.
      6.4.3.2. Runways. Do not park vehicles less than 1,000 feet from runway centerline.
      6.4.3.3. Aprons. Distance requirement varies upon aircraft size. Non-essential vehicles
      shall not park on or less than 125 feet from apron edge and essential vehicles shall park at
      least 25 feet outside the wing tip clearance zone of the largest aircraft operating on that
      apron.
6.5. Vehicle Malfunctions/Breakdowns. When experiencing a vehicle malfunction preventing
operation under its own power, take the following action:
   6.5.1. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, contact the ATCT on Tower Net or
   AMOPS via the Ramp Net and make the following transmission: “All parties BREAK,
   BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield Management, Tower, and
   Maintenance Operations Center.” State the nature of the problem and report your position
   on the airfield. State your callsign and location of vehicle.
   6.5.2. Leave the vehicle parking lights and emergency flashers on.
   6.5.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. AMOPS, security forces, civil
   engineer, transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off
   of the airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runway.
   6.5.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
   6.5.5. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify ATCT and AMOPS by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of the
   disabled vehicle from the CMA.
      6.5.5.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in the
      CMA.
      6.5.5.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
      safest way possible.
   6.5.5.3. If the radio is not keyed to either Tower or the Ramp Net, contact your control
   center or duty section and have them contact AMOPS immediately.
   6.5.6. If you do not have a radio, stay with the vehicle and attempt to flag other drivers for
   assistance.
   6.5.7. Activate the vehicle’s four way flashers and raise the hood.
   6.5.8. If an aircraft is taxiing toward you, flash your headlights to warn the pilot.
 32                                                                8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


   6.5.9. A vehicle cannot remain on a taxiway, apron or within either wing tip or clearance
   zones indefinitely. If a tow vehicle cannot be dispatched immediately, push the vehicle to a
   safe location preventing a violation of wing tip clearance criteria.
6.6. Parking on Airfield Areas. Operators will comply with vehicle and equipment parking
requirements regardless of location on the airfield. Vehicles will never be parked and/or
unattended within critical areas listed in paragraph 6.4.2. of this instruction.
   6.6.1. All vehicle operators must approach parked aircraft with the operator’s side of the
   vehicle toward the aircraft. Do not point vehicles directly toward an aircraft when parked on
   the airfield. Vehicles shall be oriented so they cannot roll forward or backwards into an
   aircraft. For maximum safety, do not park closer than 25 feet in front or 200 feet to the rear
   of any aircraft when engines are operating or are about to be started. Vehicles parked at the
   side of the aircraft will be located clear of the wing tips and will be clearly visible to
   personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
   6.6.2. All vehicles will be parked so they will not interfere with taxiing or towed aircraft or
   potential paths of taxiing or towed aircraft.
   6.6.3. Turn ignition off, leave keys in the ignition and position gear lever in ‘Reverse’ for
   manual transmissions and ‘Park’ position for automatic transmissions.
   6.6.4. Set the emergency or other internal wheel lock brake. If the emergency brake is
   inoperable, position chocks in front of and behind the driver’s side rear wheels. One chock
   will be placed between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. Only vehicles
   actively responding to alerts and emergencies are exempt from this requirement.
   6.6.5. Emergency vehicles remaining in operation at the scene of an emergency may park
   with the engine running but must adhere to parking procedures when the driver’s seat is
   unoccupied.
   6.6.6. Apply brakes on all wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment. Chock equipment if
   not equipped with brakes.
   6.6.7. Place AGE-towing vehicles in neutral and leave running while the driver completes
   hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE-towing vehicle by hand to align

   6.15.5. Operators will conduct a FOD check (IAW paragraph 7.16.) of the equipment prior
   to entering the airfield, after operations cease and before traversing a taxiway pavement to
   exit the airfield. Use access roads to the perimeter road for airfield entry and exit to the
   maximum extent possible. When airfield pavements must be used, the shortest and most
   direct route will be utilized.
6.16. Perimeter Road. The perimeter road is not part of the CMA, but traffic may be controlled
at selected intersections. Whenever the perimeter road is blocked, drivers will obey the
instructions of the guard posted.
   6.16.1. The north and south end of perimeter road adjacent to the overruns may be blocked

   operators will proceed at a safe speed consistent with traffic and the weather conditions.
   Vehicles will have headlights, emergency flashers and beacons operating (if equipped).
   Emergency response in itself is not the sole justification for speeding. Critical need to arrive
   at a destination in a short period of time must be required. All drivers must remain safety
   conscious and alert for other vehicles and aircraft.
   6.17.2. Emergency vehicle operators will utilize rotating beacons and headlights during
   response.
   6.17.3. Emergency vehicle operators may not exceed speed limits after an emergency is
   terminated unless proceeding directly to another emergency.

   ATCT.
   6.17.5. Multiple responding vehicles need to have a lead vehicle contact ATCT for
   authorization. The lead will pass the number of responding vehicles. The lead will also
   report to the ATCT when the corresponding vehicles are off the runway. Use the following
   phraseology as an example to ask for permission to proceed on the runway with additional
   vehicles: “Chief1 plus (two, three, etc.) located on Taxiway Alpha, request permission to
   proceed onto Runway 18/36.”
   6.17.6. Access to the runway is only granted for the duration of emergency response.
   6.17.7. Responding vehicles not part of the original response must request additional
   approval from the ATCT for runway access. They must also report themselves off the
   runway.
   6.17.8. Emergency vehicle operators that respond to an emergency from an unapproved
   surface must report the fact to AMOPS as soon as practical. A FOD check will be required
   when the emergency is terminated.
6.18. Aircraft Support Equipment Rules. This includes all AGE, ground support equipment
and fire bottles. Equipment inside HASs or flows is exempt from these requirements.
   6.18.1. Equipment must be placed IAW the distance criteria stated in paragraph 6.4.3 of this
   instruction.

6.21. Night Vision Devices.
   6.21.1. Vehicle operations on the CMA should be kept to a minimum during NVD
   operations. To the maximum extent possible, unit ADPMs will be notified in advance of
   take-off and landing NVD operations in a reduced airfield lighting configuration via the
   ADIF. This is to prevent aircraft mission delays and reduce the possibility of runway
   incursions during reduced airfield lighting configurations.
   6.21.2. Any operational requests not listed in this operating instruction will be published in a
   LOP with the requested unit.
   6.21.3. If vehicle operations are required, vehicles will use parking lights while in transit and
   turn off all lights when stopped.

                                            Chapter 7

                                 OPERATIONAL HAZARDS

7.1. Runway. The runway is the most critical of all airfield pavements. Vehicle operators will
exercise extreme caution when operating on or near the runway.
   7.1.1. The ATCT is the approving authority for all movement on the runway, including
   aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians. All operators will contact the ATCT via the Tower Net to
   gain authorization to enter the runway, overruns, grass or any area within 100 feet of the
   runway. Also, vehicles are required to gain authorization from ATCT during inclement
   weather to enter NAVAID critical areas.                 Unconditional instructions (Blanket
   Authorizations) are not authorized for runway or any controlled movement area.
       7.1.1.1. Operators will notify ATCT when they exit the runway and when they request
       additional authorization to re-enter the runway after exiting. This applies to all operators
       of all types of vehicles or equipment to include emergency responders.
   7.1.2. Any vehicle operator instructed by the ATCT or AMOPS to exit the runway, will
   comply immediately by safely expediting their exit off the runway and then report their
   position to the ATCT. Operators forced to exit the runway may contact the ATCT to re-enter
   the runway after pending operations are completed.
   7.1.3. Any operator told to hold short of the runway (remain behind the VFR Hold Line or
   INST Hold Line when applicable) will do so regardless of their perceived need to enter the
   runway.
   7.1.4. Vehicle traffic control devices are located along perimeter road. These lights are
   designed to alert drivers of the activation of a NAVAID Critical Area to prevent interference
   with electronic aircraft navigation signals based on weather. When observing a steady red
   light, do not proceed into area until lights have returned to flashing yellow.
   7.1.5. Runway edge lights are white and located within 10 feet of the runway edge to
   provide a visual reference of the useable surface to pilots during reduced visibility
   operations.
7.2. Taxiway Papa
   7.2.1. Taxiway Papa is a high traffic surface.
   7.2.2. There is sufficient clearance for fighter and small cargo aircraft to pass vehicles if the
   vehicles are positioned on the shoulder edge. Vehicles will engage the brake and leave
   wheels aimed directly forward when aircraft are taxiing past their position.
   7.2.3. There is insufficient clearance for vehicles to remain on the shoulder for any large or
   wide-body aircraft (B-737, C-17, C-5, etc.). In these instances, vehicles will find the nearest
   paved exit. If a safe exit appears impractical, follow the rules and principles in paragraph
   7.12., Avoiding Aircraft.
7.3. Taxiways. Taxiways generally have a high volume of aircraft traffic.
   7.3.1. VFR Hold Lines (Attachment 10) are positioned where taxiways intersect with the
   runway. Vehicles may never enter the runway or proceed within 100 feet of the runway edge
 40                                                                  8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


   without prior approval from the ATCT. Always remain behind VFR Hold Lines unless prior
   approval is given by ATCT.
   7.3.2. Operators will remain out of the intended path of aircraft entering or exiting the
   runway, including the arming and disarming areas on Taxiways Alpha and Echo.
   7.3.3. Taxiway lights are blue and are located within 10 feet of taxiway edges to provide a
   visual reference to pilots during reduced visibility operations.
7.4. Loops. The Loops contain revetments, Flow-Through Shelters (FTS) and HASs. Whether
taxied or towed, aircraft may exit from any of these facilities at any time. Vehicle operators
must exercise caution in these areas. There are two main segments: North and South Loop.
   7.4.1. All vehicles will drive to the right side of the taxiway, within the driving lane and as
   close to the outer edge as possible without driving off the pavement.
   7.4.2. Vehicles will travel directly adjacent to their destination, stop to ensure the way is
   clear of aircraft and vehicles and perform a 90-degree turn to exit the driving lanes toward
   their destination.
   7.4.3. The Loop taxiways are very narrow and do not allow proper wing tip clearance
   between F-16s and vehicles in the driving lanes. Vehicles in the driving lanes will turn into
   an unoccupied HAS when possible if approached by an aircraft. All vehicles will come to a
   full stop and engage the parking brake. Vehicles will remain stopped until all aircraft have
   passed and path of intended travel is clear.
7.5. “PANTON,” “JUVAT” and “WOLF PACK” Flows. Flow aprons are also used for hot
pit refueling. Fuel and fire trucks may be parked near or within the aircraft parking area.
Vehicles should not park near these trucks unless required for mission accomplishment.
   7.5.1. When driving to the rear of flow aprons, maintain a safe distance and do not park
   directly behind any aircraft. Jet blast may occur.
   7.5.2. When driving in front of flow aprons, pay particular attention to aircraft taxiing out.
   These areas are mainly in use when TDY aircraft are stationed at Kunsan AB.
7.6. Aprons. Aprons are used to park, load, unload and to service aircraft.
   7.6.1. Reduce speeds when driving near parked aircraft. All vehicles will remain out of the
   loading and unloading zones of aircraft, except for vehicles and equipment used in such
   operations.
   7.6.2. Remain watchful for equipment and personnel operating in these areas.
   7.6.3. Watch for aircraft entering and exiting the apron areas.
7.7. Avenue “B”. Avenue “B” traverses Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot.
   7.7.1. Avenue “B” intersection of Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot is controlled by warning
   signs, lights and bells. When aircraft are not present on either Taxiways Charlie or Foxtrot
   the red light status is ‘flashing’.
   7.7.2. All vehicle operators shall stop prior to crossing the taxiway and perform a tire FOD
   check; prior to proceeding across the taxiway, perform a visual inspection for aircraft/vehicle
   ops.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                         41


   7.7.3. All aircraft and vehicles traveling on Taxiway Charlie and Foxtrot have the right of
   way over Avenue “B” traffic.
   7.7.4. The speed limit across the taxiways, including the paved road between the taxiways, is
   15 mph and 5 mph when ice or snow is present.
   7.7.5. When the bell is sounding or there is a steady red light, no traffic may cross either
   taxiway whether or not they see aircraft or vehicles. If a failure of either system is observed,
   immediately contact AMOPS.
   7.7.6. The absence of either the bell or steady red light does not eliminate the need to stop
   and ensure the way is clear and safe.
   7.7.7. The Fire Department (8 CES/CEF) utilizes Avenue “B” and Taxiway Foxtrot to
   respond to emergencies. All vehicles will remain alert for fire response trucks. When
   response vehicles are observed, pull to the side of the road and yield right of way.
   7.7.8. During snowfall, stop and yield for snow removal equipment. They travel at high
   speeds to clear snow and have priority over other vehicle traffic.
7.8. Avenue “A”. Avenue “A” leads to perimeter road by crossing Taxiway Papa at the north
end.
   7.8.1. All vehicles will stop and perform a FOD check prior to crossing at this intersection.
   7.8.2. Vehicles will yield to all aircraft before proceeding.
   7.8.3. Vehicles will not travel toward the KAL gate unless they have official business in that
   area.
   7.8.4. Vehicles traveling at night on Avenue “A” adjacent to Taxiway Papa will not use high
   beam headlights nor aim their headlights toward aircraft.
   7.8.5. Vehicle traffic control devices have been installed around the airfield to protect
   NAVAID Critical Areas. When aircraft are about to land in inclement weather, the lights are
   turned on to prevent vehicle interference with electronic aircraft navigation signals. They
   can also act as wing tip clearance lights along Avenue “A” when aircraft taxi on Taxiway
   Papa. When the lights turn red and/or the bell is ringing, all vehicles are required to stop and
   shall not proceed until the light changes back to flashing yellow.
7.9. End of Runway (EOR) Areas. End of runway crews must comply with wing tip clearance
criteria and remain aware of vehicles and equipment located on Taxiways Alpha and Echo in the
EOR areas.
   7.9.1. EOR crew vehicles will not be left unattended on the taxiway or shoulder.
   7.9.2. EOR equipment will be promptly removed from active areas when flying operations
   terminate. Staging of equipment may occur three hours before planned use and left no longer
   than three hours after use. Equipment shall be stored away from the airfield area over-night
   or during non-operations periods.
7.10. Control Tower or Vehicle Radio Problems and Visual Blind Spots.
   7.10.1. Some drivers may experience radio problems on the airfield, such as reduced
   transmit or receive capabilities. This could be due to radio blind spots. Maneuver the vehicle
 42                                                                8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


   to another location and retry the transmission. ATCT will use a light gun (See 8.4) as a
   backup system for communicating with aircraft or ground vehicles if their radio stops
   working. When a vehicle operator experiences a radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they
   must vacate the runway or taxiway as quickly and safely as possible and contact the ATCT or
   AMOPS by other means, such as a cellular telephone to advise of the situation. If this is not
   practical, the driver will immediately vacate the runway, then turn the vehicle toward the
   tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the controller to signal with the
   light gun. If a partial transmission is received from the ATCT, ask for the instructions again.
   Do not proceed on the runway if the ATCT transmissions are incomplete or unreadable.
       7.10.1.1. The known radio blind spots are Taxiway Echo, the north portion of the
       Transient Pad and the Gunsan City Airport terminal area.
       7.10.1.2. If transmissions are broken, too weak or otherwise unclear, the ATCT will not
       allow any vehicles into the CMA. If these problems are experienced, obtain a different
       radio and perform a radio check with AMOPS or the ATCT.
   7.10.2. There are also areas on the airfield where the ATCT is unable to see aircraft and
   vehicle traffic, these are commonly known as visual blind spots.
       7.10.2.1. The known visual blind spots are the Tree Area, ROKAF alert apron, Transient
       Pad, Wolf Pack Flows, C-Pad, the North and South Loops, the “JUVAT” Pad and
       Taxiway Hotel.
       7.10.2.2. The ATCT does not normally provide aircraft position advisories to ground
       vehicles in these areas. They may make a general announcement by vehicle type,
       location and direction if they observe a dangerous situation. All personnel should remain
       alert to the Ramp Net frequency and react appropriately to general calls.
7.11. Traveling From an Unimproved to Airfield Pavement Surface. Any vehicle leaving a
paved surface must adhere to the following rules before re-entering a paved surface. This
includes the runway, taxiways, arresting system, perimeter road and airfield lighting access
roads.
   7.11.1. Vehicles will proceed from the unimproved surface and stop as soon as all four
   wheels are on the pavement area.
   7.11.2. Once returning the vehicle to a hard surface, complete a roll over FOD check by
   visually checking the tires, body, frame and undercarriage for debris. Remove all debris
   from these surfaces and secure the FOD within a designated container. Reference 7.16.1. for
   roll over FOD check procedures.
7.12. Avoiding Aircraft. Vehicle operators will follow this guidance in order to prevent
interfering with aircraft operations and causing an incident or mishap. It is the operator’s
responsibility to maintain sufficient clearance and to prevent operational interference with
aircraft.
   7.12.1. When an aircraft is approaching and there is not sufficient clearance, locate the
   nearest paved exit, proceed directly toward it and wait for the aircraft to pass. If you cannot
   locate a paved area, quickly identify a safe non-paved area for exit. Remain away from
   ditches and marshy areas.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                         43


7.13. Spotter Requirements.
   7.13.1. The tow vehicle operator is responsible to tow an aircraft within 25 feet of any
   obstacle or obstruction, including but not limited to vehicles and equipment. Vehicles and
   equipment are hereafter referred to as vehicle.
   7.13.2. When vehicle operators find themselves in a location where they will be within 25
   feet of a taxiing aircraft and they cannot safely exit the vehicle from the area, they must post
   themselves between the vehicle and aircraft to act as a spotter in a location the pilot can
   easily observe from the cockpit.
   7.13.3. The vehicle operator will carefully watch the clearance between the far outer edge of
   the wing tip and the vehicle to ensure the wing will not strike the vehicle.
   7.13.4. If sufficient clearance exists, the vehicle operator will waive the pilot through the
   area, observing clearance until the aircraft is completely past the vehicle.
   7.13.5. Aircraft should not taxi closer than 10 feet to any vehicle. If less than 10 feet, the
   vehicle operator must use the emergency stop hand signal IAW AFI 11-218, and as depicted
   in figure 7.1, to stop the pilot from taxiing through. In this case, the vehicle operator must
   find a way to remove the vehicle from the area before the aircraft may proceed.

Figure 7.1. Emergency Stop Hand Signal




7.14. Airfield Facilities Protection.
   7.14.1. The vehicle operators must pay attention to their position relative to all airfield
   lights. Lights are designed to break when hit, thus limiting damage to aircraft. Airfield lights
   damaged by vehicles must be reported to AMOPS immediately. Check the vehicle tires and
   pick up any loose debris before departing the area.
   7.14.2. During the winter season (November to March) fiberglass orange and white “snow
   poles” are placed on light housings. The poles are anchored to the light housing with the
   rubber tip removed to prevent it from being a FOD hazard. If the poles are damaged or run-
   over, pick up the debris and report it to AMOPS as soon as possible.
   7.14.3. Vehicles that hit equipment or buildings on the airfield must remain in place and
   contact AMOPS immediately. AMOPS and 8 SFS personnel will respond to the location.
 44                                                                8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


   7.14.4. Any operator witnessing damage to pavement or coming across damaged pavement,
   large amounts of hydraulic fluid, oil or corrosive agent spills on pavement areas should
   report the location to AMOPS as soon as possible.
7.15. Combat and Exercise CONOPS.
   7.15.1. Personnel required to drive on the airfield in MOPP4 must be trained on proper
   procedures and have an AF IMT 483 with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)
   MOPP4 certification.
   7.15.2. Drivers will reduce speed and use extreme caution when driving in MOPP4.
   7.15.3. When feasible, two people will be present in the vehicle to aid with situational
   awareness.
   7.15.4. Drivers will use caution when driving in MOPP4.
   7.15.5. When practical two people will be in the vehicle to aid alertness during MOPP4
   driving.
   7.15.6. Personnel required to drive in MOPP4 must receive additional training to include a
   practical driving orientation in MOPP4.
   7.15.7. The orientation training must occur during periods of zero or low aircraft traffic.
   Training must be conducted by UADPM and or section Emergency Evaluation Team (EET)
   Leader. A certified trainer must be in the passenger seat at all times.
   7.15.8. After the trainee is deemed competent to drive in MOPP4, the UADPM will make
   MOPP4 annotations on the back of the trainee’s AF Form 483.
7.16. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control/Prevention. Vehicles are major sources of
foreign objects on the airfield. All personnel have a responsibility to control/remove FOD from
the airfield.
   7.16.1. Prior to entering the airfield and at all FOD checkpoints, complete a rollover FOD
   check by visually checking the tires, body, frame and undercarriage for debris. To properly
   complete a roll over FOD check, stop, place in park (automatic); or set emergency/parking
   brake and place in neutral (manual); and accomplish check. IAW AFMAN 24-306 Manual
   for Wheeled Operators, pg 25-3, para 3: When the driver’s seat is vacated, turn off the
   ignition, set the brakes, and place the gear lever in reverse gear. Use park if the vehicle has
   automatic transmission. Return to vehicle, roll forward as to allow the uninspected tread to be
   visible for inspection and repeat procedure. EXCEPTION: C-300 and R-11 Refuelers,
   constant shut- down and restart will cause engine damage.
   7.16.2. Ensure onboard equipment is properly stowed and secured. Check for loose items on
   the vehicle floorboards, seats or dash for items that can easily fall out if the door is open
   while on the airfield.
   7.16.3. Obey FOD checkpoint signs at designated airfield access points (Attachment 11).
   7.16.4. During winter, ice and snow chunks must be removed from the wheel wells, bumpers
   and vehicle body before entering the airfield.
   7.16.5. Operate vehicle on hard/paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If operating
   on unpaved surface, check and remove FOD immediately upon returning to paved surfaces.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                      45


   7.16.6. The airfield is a designated no hat area. Exception: Cold weather gear is authorized
   by AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
   7.16.7. Operators will perform a FOD check after utilizing an airfield access road before the
   vehicle is again driven on any taxiway, apron or runway.
   7.16.8. Operators will perform a FOD check after driving in any airfield median or in-field
   area. All personnel will notify AMOPS prior to driving in any in-field area.
7.17. Airfield Vehicle Restrictions. At times, vehicle restrictions may be imposed due to
construction, operations, emergencies or other mission need.
   7.17.1. All personnel will abide by airfield vehicle restrictions. Alternate routes will be
   identified to support restrictions.
   7.17.2. AMOPS notifies airfield users of restrictions via email and by publishing local
   Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). All personnel may check Kunsan Local NOTAMs at
   https://www.notams.jcs.mil . Insert “RKJK” in the retrieval box and click ‘View
   NOTAMs’. When the report appears, ‘L’ and a number will precede all Local NOTAM’s.
   7.17.3. A “ramp freeze” is initiated when a portion of the airfield must be sterilized or to
   stop all vehicle traffic for safety and/or emergency purposes. When a “ramp freeze” is in
   effect, operators may have to exit the primary effected area, remain a set distance from the
   primary effected area as directed by AMOPS or designated agency, exit critical airfield areas
   or temporarily stop their vehicles and remain at their current location until the freeze is
   terminated.
   7.17.4. “Ramp freezes” may be coordinated through the Secondary Crash Net, telephone or
   email.
   7.17.5. “Ramp freezes” do not apply to emergency response vehicles or other vehicles
   directly supporting the cause of a “ramp freeze.” Vehicles not directly involved in response
   will abide by any established cordons.
7.18. Alternate Landing Surface (ALS).
   7.18.1. Taxiway Charlie is designated as an ALS. The ALS serves as a contingency runway
   for launch and recovery of aircraft. The ALS is activated when deemed necessary by wing
   leadership.
   7.18.2. The ALS is protected via a system of vehicle traffic lights located at taxiway/access
   roads adjoining Taxiway Charlie; exceptions are pedestrian sidewalks and the access road
   leading to the east hammerhead of Taxiway Charlie. Supplemental control measures are
   provided via members of the 8 SFS or augmentees. ALS vehicle traffic lights appear as a
   “steady” red light when the ALS is activated; when inactive, lights are “flashing” yellow.
   7.18.3. Taxiway Charlie is designated a CMA when the ALS is activated. Access to the
   ALS is granted via the ATCT or through posted members of the 8 SFS when granted
   authority to do so by the ATCT.
 46                                                                8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 8

                  RUNWAY AND CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA

8.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA consists of the runway, overruns and any
area within 100 feet of the runway and overruns (excluding perimeter road). This also includes
NAVAID critical areas identified by Instrument Hold Lines and protection lighting on perimeter
road during instrument procedures. All ground traffic (vehicles and pedestrians) within 100 feet
of the runway and overruns or within the ILS critical areas to include access roads must initiate
and maintain direct two-way radio contact with the ATCT. Contact the ATCT on the Tower or
Crash Nets. When the Alternate Landing Surface (ALS) is activated, Taxiway Charlie becomes
a CMA.
   8.1.1. In the event of a radio failure, exit the CMA immediately via the shortest route that
   does not enter/cross the runway. Watch for light gun signals from the ATCT while exiting.
   Notify the ATCT via landline immediately after you exit the CMA. Refer to paragraph 8.4.
   of this instruction, for more information regarding light gun signals.
   8.1.2. All vehicles operating within any CMA must have a designated call sign IAW AFI 13-
   213 and 8 FWI 33-102, Assignment of Local Call Signs, and Support of Non-Radio and
   Communications Out Procedures (NRP/COP). Refer to attachment 14 for call signs. This
   list serves to prevent duplicate call signs and provides a reference for airfield support and
   control agencies.
   8.1.3. Vehicles will stop at the VFR Hold Line markings and contact ATCT for permission
   to enter the CMA. VFR Hold Line markings are at least 100 feet from the runway edges.
   8.1.4. When approaching the runway in the grassy areas, stop at least 100 or more feet from
   the runway edge and contact the ATCT and obtain approval before proceeding. Once
   approved to proceed, perform a FOD check before entering the runway surface.
   8.1.5. Turn on headlights and beacon/strobe lights. Exception: Emergency flashers for
   secondary vehicles. See 6.10.6.
   8.1.6. Vehicles will not enter the CMA unless absolutely necessary. Contact ATCT for
   authorization. The overruns may be used to exit the CMA, but the operator must call the
   ATCT when off the overruns.
   8.1.7. POVs, golf carts and bicycles are prohibited from operating within the CMA.
   8.1.8. Tow-vehicles are authorized to recover disabled aircraft within the CMA after gaining
   approval from ATCT.
   8.1.9. The only runway crossing point for Runway 18/36 is Taxiway Alpha.
8.2. Airfield Signs and Markings.
   8.2.1. There are two types of airfield signs, mandatory and informational.
       8.2.1.1. Mandatory signs, such as an Instrument or VFR Hold Line, must be followed.
       These signs are recognizable by their white inscription on a red background (Attachment
       9).
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                    47


      8.2.1.2. Informational signs indicate a specific location or destination, and/or provide
      useful information, such as taxiway or ramp designations. Informational signs have black
      inscription on a yellow background or the inverse of this color scheme (Attachment 9).
   8.2.2. There are two airfield markings that complement mandatory signs.
      8.2.2.1. VFR Hold Line. This marking consists of two solid six-inch wide yellow lines
      and two dashed six-inch wide yellow lines running across each taxiway at least 100 feet
      from the runway edge (Attachment 8). The dashed lines are on the runway side of the
      taxiway.
      8.2.2.2. Instrument Hold Line. This marking is comprised of two solid yellow parallel
      lines with double vertical yellow stripes spaced two feet apart with INST painted on the
      runway side of the line. These markings prevent aircraft and vehicles from interfering
      with signals transmitted to inbound aircraft from the Instrument Landing System (ILS)
      during periods of poor weather (Attachment 8).
          8.2.2.2.1. During inclement weather, i.e., thunderstorms, fog, snow showers, etc.,
          vehicles must STOP behind the Instrument Hold Line and request permission to enter
          the ILS critical area. The Instrument Hold Lines are in effect at Kunsan AB when the
          ceiling is 800 feet or visibility is less than two miles. See Attachment 10 for
          locations of Instrument Hold Lines. If unsure of weather conditions or instrument
          hold procedures, contact the ATCT before proceeding into these areas.
8.3. Radio Phraseology. Using proper radio phraseology mitigates misunderstandings between
vehicle operators and the ATCT.
   8.3.1. Vehicle operators are required to READ BACK ALL ATCT instructions verbatim
   when operating in or requesting to operate within or near the CMA. Reading back
   instructions indicates to the ATCT that you understood their instructions and will comply
   with them. When in doubt, ask the ATCT to repeat their instructions.
   8.3.2. Never use the words “clear” or “cleared” when in radio communication with the
   ATCT. These words are reserved for communications between the ATCT and aircraft.
   8.3.3. Example of Airfield 3 requesting permission to enter the CMA or runway from
   Taxiway Alpha:
      8.3.3.1. Airfield 3: “Kunsan Ground, Airfield 3, request permission to enter Runway 36
      from Taxiway Alpha.”
      8.3.3.2. ATCT: “Airfield 3, Kunsan Ground, proceed on Runway 36 from Taxiway
      Alpha, report when off.”
      8.3.3.3. Airfield 3: “Kunsan Ground, Airfield 3 proceeding on Runway 36 from
      Taxiway Alpha, will report when off.”
      8.3.3.4. Advising the ATCT when you are no longer on the runway after exiting on
      Taxiway Echo:
   8.3.4. 1 Airfield 3: “Kunsan Ground, Airfield 3 is off Runway 36 at Taxiway Echo.”
 48                                                                  8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


8.4. Control Tower Light Gun Signals. The ATCT controls all traffic (personnel, aircraft and
vehicles) operating in the CMA. In addition to, or in place of radio instructions, ATCT may use
light gun signals. As in radio instructions, obey all light gun signals immediately.
   8.4.1. The following light signals are designed to control airfield vehicle traffic.
       8.4.1.1. Steady Green Light: “Cleared to cross”, “Proceed”, “Go”.
       8.4.1.2. Steady Red Light: STOP! Vehicle will not be moved.
       8.4.1.3. Flashing Red Light: “Clear active taxiway/runway”.
       8.4.1.4. Flashing White Light: “Return to starting point”.
       8.4.1.5. Red and Green Light: “General warning. Exercise extreme caution.” During
       alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to their work
       control center until the emergency is terminated. AMOPS will notify contractors within
       the emergency cordon area to withdraw to work centers or Base Operations until the
       emergency is terminated.
   8.4.2. The ATCT may raise and lower the intensity of the runway lights as an emergency
   exit signal. The ATCT may turn the taxiway lights on and off to remove vehicles from the
   taxiways when vehicles fail to acknowledge them by radio or response to light gun signals.
   8.4.3. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will have AFVA 11-240, AIRPORT SIGNS
   AND MARKINGS signal decal (available for order at e-publishing website). The decal may
   be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver on the dashboard or clipped to the inside
   of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready
   reference.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                           49


                                            Chapter 9

                   REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS

9.1. Authority. Unit commanders, the Airfield Operations Flight Commander, unit ADPMs and
AMOPS personnel have authority to revoke airfield driving privileges. Individuals who violate
the requirements in this instruction may lose their airfield driving privileges and may be subject
to administrative or disciplinary action.
9.2. Violations and Reporting. All violations must be reported to AMOPS. They will in-turn
notify the DAFM and the AOF/CC. Once notified, the violation will be reported to 8th Fighter
Wing Safety (8 FW/SE). The DAFM will notify the violator’s ADPM and unit commander.
Violations shall be briefed during the corresponding AOB. Unit Commander, Unit ADPM and
AMOPS must be notified immediately of any CMAV event. AMOPS will notify MAJCOM
OPR for AO within 24 hours of a CMAV/HATR incident.
   9.2.1. When notified of a airfield driving violation, AMOPS will respond and escort the
   violator to Airfield Management Operations located in building 2858.
   9.2.2. 8 SFS will respond and provide escort, as requested.
   9.2.3. If the violation is reported after the fact, the violator will report with their supervisor
   to building 2858 as soon as requested.
   9.2.4. A CMA/Runway Incursion Violation report will be completed by AMOPS and the
   violator.
   9.2.5. The violator will be released to their ADPM, duty supervisor, first sergeant, unit
   commander or construction management (for contractors).
   9.2.6. The AOF/CC, Wing Safety, and Wing ADPM will work as a team to assign an
   operational category to all runway incursion incidents. The appropriate category –
   operational error, pilot deviation, or vehicle/pedestrian – will be included on an AF Form 457
   along with the description of the incident.
9.3. Runway Incursions and Controlled Movement Violation (CMAV) Events. A CMAV
event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the CMA
without specific ATCT approval. A CMAV includes runway incursions.
   9.3.1. A runway incursion is a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an
   aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
   take-off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
   CMA. CMAV events are further classified into three operational categories: operational
   error, pilot deviation, or vehicle/pedestrian deviation. AOF/CC will work with FW/SE to
   assign all runway incursions an operational category and document on the AF IMT 457.
   Additionally, runway incursions that had an adverse impact on flight operations require
   completion of AF IMT 651. AOF/CC will complete the AF IMT 651 and forward the
   completed copy to 8 FW/SE. For all runway incursion, the individual’s AF IMT 483 must be
   surrendered to AMOPS personnel and airfield driving privileges must be revoked until an
   investigation and retraining/certification is complete.
 50                                                                 8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


   9.3.2. CMAV events must be briefed at the AOB.
   9.3.3. Provide a brief description of each incident including (What, When, Where, How,
   type vehicle/aircraft involved and action taken to prevent a reoccurrence).
   9.3.4. Highlight any trends (e.g. annual/biannual chart showing upward or downward rate as
   applicable).
9.4. Consequences.
   9.4.1. Consequences for airfield driving violations may vary based on the nature or
   circumstances of the violation. The DAFM or AFM has final authority to determine actions
   other than those mandated below. The AFM or designated representatives are responsible for
   taking immediate actions to correct the problem or applying interim control measures.
   9.4.2. If found at fault, the individual’s driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
   30 days. After the 30-day period, they must be retrained by their unit ADPM. Retraining
   will include all requirements listed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. A letter of reinstatement
   from the unit commander must accompany the training paperwork to AMOPS.
   9.4.3. Runway incursions and other violations that did not impact aircraft operations require
   completion of an AF IMT 457.
      9.4.3.1. ATCT or any other individual or agency who witnessed the violation will
      complete and submit the AF IMT 457 to AMOPS for corrective action.
      9.4.3.2. Violators will have their AF IMT 483 and POV pass (if applicable) revoked for
      up to 30 days, at the discretion of the DAFM or AFM. As a minimum, AF IMT 483 and
      POV pass will be revoked for a period of 10 days. (See paragraph 9.5., Revocation
      Periods).
      9.4.3.3. Regardless of the revocation period, the violator must be retrained by their unit
      ADPM. Retraining will include all requirements listed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. A
      letter of reinstatement from the unit commander must accompany the training paperwork
      to AMOPS.
      9.4.3.4. Host wing commanders may reinstate airfield driving privileges before
      suspension period ends to perform mission essential duties following
      suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Authority may not be delegated.
      9.4.3.5. The Wing ADPM and Wing Safety must inspect the unit ADP of personnel that
      commit a runway incursion as part of the investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how
      the unit trained the individual and their compliance with the ADI. The results will be
      reported to the unit commander.
      9.4.3.6. UADM requesting to reinstate personnel and or airfield driving programs that
      have been suspended, see Attachment 15, Airfield Driver/Airfield Driving Program
      Reinstatement MFR.
   9.4.4. AMOPS must be notified when 8 SFS personnel apprehend an airfield driver who
   inadvertently crosses into any restricted areas.
8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013                                                                   51


9.5. Revocation Periods. The actual revocation period will be determined by AM after
considering the severity and circumstances surrounding the violation. In conjunction with the
member losing their AF Form 483 the member will also forfeit their POV pass (if applicable).
Standard violation periods:
   9.5.1. First violation: 10 to 30-day suspension of privileges.
   9.5.2. Second violation: Six-month suspension of privileges.
   9.5.3. Third violation: Permanent suspension of privileges.
   9.5.4. If an individual commits a violation while using a POV Pass, the individual’s POV
   pass will be confiscated at the discretion of the Airfield Manager or according to the
   timeframes outlined in 9.4.2.2, AF Form 483 suspension periods.
   9.5.5. Individuals must re-accomplish all training for reissuance of an AF IMT 483 after a

CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in retro-

off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission was
not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.

         TAXIWAY GUIDANCE SIGNS (MANDATORY AND INFORMATIVE)

A9.1. Mandatory signs are provided when an instruction must be followed. A mandatory sign
has white inscription on a red background.

Figure A9.1. Runway Hold Sign




A9.2. A runway sign informs operators they are at an intersection with a runway. It also tells
which direction to turn to get to the approach end of each runway. Here, Runway 36 is to your
left and Runway 18 is to your right. It is mandatory to stop and receive approval from ATCT
before crossing the hold line associated with this sign and request authority from the tower to
enter the runway.

Figure A9.2. Instrument Hold Sign




A9.3. An instrument hold sign informs operators they are at an intersection with a navigational
aid critical area. Operators must have permission from the tower to cross into that area when
instrument hold procedures are in effect. Instrument hold procedures are in effect when the
reported ceiling (cloud height) is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility is less than 2 miles. This
sign is associated with an Instrument Hold Line, and is mandatory. Failure to abide by
instrument hold procedures can affect the navigational integrity of aircraft on approach to the
runway, and causes a flight safety hazard.
A9.4. All non-mandatory signs are classified as informative signs. They are used as necessary
to indicate a specific location, or destination on an aircraft movement area, or to provide other
useful information. The sign has either black inscription on a yellow background or vice versa.
 74                                                               8 FWI13-213 10 MAY 2013


Figure A9.3. Informative Signs (Optional)




A9.5. A directional sign informs operators of the direction for other pavements or facilities.
This sign indicates traveling the direction of the arrow will take you to Taxiway Echo. These
signs can reference any area of the airfield, including aircraft parking aprons. These signs are
designed to aid operators to know where they are and/or where they are going.
A9.6. A location sign is placed at intersections of a taxiway and runway. This sign reminds
operators what taxiway they are traveling when exiting the runway. The sign in Figure A9.1 is
telling operators they are currently on Taxiway Papa and that Taxiway Echo is to the right. This
assists in knowing where you are for travel and in communicating with the ATCT.

                  PHRASEOLOGY TRAINING/RADIO TECHNIQUES

A12.1. Responsibility. It is up to every individual talking on the radio to ensure transmissions
are accomplished in a professional manner. Slang, CB jargon and incorrect radio procedures can
compromise safety. One of the most important items in radio communications is for you to speak
in a manner that ensures others understand what you have said.
A12.2. Radio Operations. Before depressing the transmission button to talk, first think of what
you will say. Radio transmissions should be clear and concise. Ensure someone else is not
already talking on the frequency or waiting for a response.
A12.3. Phonetic Alphabet. The phonetic alphabet was developed to avoid misunderstanding of
communications. Because letters such as “B,” “C,” “D,” and “E” all have similar sounds, they
can easily be mistaken for one another, especially during radio transmissions. The following is

A12.4. Radio Phraseology. Certain phrases are used in command and control and airfield
operations. Ensure you know the following to better understand what tower is telling you. These
phrases will also be used when communicating with the ATCT.

Table A12.2. Radio Phraseology
                      Say again = Repeat
                      Speak Slower = Slow down rate of speech
                      Standby = Wait
                      Words Twice = Repeat every word again (twice)
                      Affirmative = Yes, or it’s true
                      Correction = Made a mistake and will repeat the correct information
                      Go Ahead = Proceed with message
                      How Do You Hear Me? = Readability
                      Negative = No
                      Out = Transmission has ended, response not necessary
                      Over = Transmission has ended, response is expected
                      Roger = Acknowledged
                      Wilco = Understood message and will comply with instructions

A12.5. Examples of Use.
   A12.5.1. When requesting approval from the ATCT, ensure you state the name of the
   agency you are calling, followed by your call sign. State your location and your request.
   Wait until the called agency acknowledges your transmission before proceeding. Always
   repeat the called agency’s instruction verbatim, to ensure they were received properly.
   A12.5.2. If you receive instructions from the ATCT and do not understand it, ask the
   individual to “say again” and wait for the repeated message to make sure you understand.
   A12.5.3. If you are having a difficult time because the individual is talking too fast, ask the
   individual to “speak slower” and the individual will repeat the previous transmission more
   slowly.
   A12.5.4. The use of the word “over” indicates your transmission is complete and you expect
   a response. On subsequent contact, the called agency name and word “over” may be omitted
   if the message requires an obvious reply and there is no danger of misunderstanding.
   A12.5.5. When the ATCT issues time-critical instructions such as “Exit runway
   immediately”, you may acknowledge by saying “Wilco”, “Affirmative”, or “Roger” as
   appropriate, preceded by your call sign. You will respond immediately to time-critical
   requests, which may include the word “expedite”.
A12.6. Radio Techniques.
   A12.6.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   A12.6.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   A12.6.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the
   ―microphone button, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is
   transmitted clearly. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   A12.6.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again.
   The controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency,
   or scanning the runway to enable your request.
   A12.6.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike, and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   A12.6.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   A12.6.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle
   at the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
