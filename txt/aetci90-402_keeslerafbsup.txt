SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
2.10.2. The 81 TRW/IG is the central POC for all legislative inquiries affecting the Wing.
2.10.3.1. (Added) All 81 TRW units will immediately notify 81 TRW/IG of all incoming

organizations (e.g., HQ AETC Staff, USAF/DPFM, etc.) that are responding to a Congressional
or high-level inquiry regarding an 81 TRW issue.
2.10.3.2. (Added) Upon receipt, 81 TRW/IG will coordinate with 81 TRW/CC, CV, and JA (if
