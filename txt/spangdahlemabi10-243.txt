This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness, and AFPAM
10-243, Augmentation Duty, 1 August 2002. It establishes procedures and defines responsibilities
for the Augmentation Program supporting Spangdahlem Air Base (AB) and applies to all 52d
Fighter Wing (52 FW) personnel, attached and tenant units of Spangdahlem AB. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidelines which clarify requirements for the First Term
Airman Center (FTAC), it corrects the time period and ―Total Personnel Needed‖ from each
specified Group for the augmentation of the FTAC Leader. Below is an updated version of
Table 1.1. from SABI10-143, 10 February 2009, Augmentation Duty Program. A margin bar
indicates newly revised material.

1. General.
1.1. Policy. The Augmentation Duty Program will provide personnel to support details listed in
this instruction or as directed by the 52 FW Vice Commander (52 FW/CV). The requirements
for each detail will vary and each unit tasked to support will acquire the necessary certifications,
     2                                              SPANGDAHLEMABI10-243           10 FEBRUARY 2009


     licenses and training from the appropriate agencies. Augmentees will be trained and equipped to
     quickly respond in support of the program requirements.
     1.2. Wing Augmentation Working Group (AWG). 52 FW/CV or a designated representative
     will chair an AWG consisting of one voting member from each group and the 52 FW Command
     Chief Master Sergeant. The AWG will meet as directed by the 52 FW/CV, to revalidate details
     and group tasking levels in Table 1 with an emphasis on minimizing mission impacts by
     eliminating and or streamlining unnecessary details and exemptions.
     1.3. 52d Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (52 MSG/CD) is the Wing Augmentation
     Duty Program Officer. 52 MSG/CD implements all new augmentee requirements approved by
     the 52 FW/CV, augmentee call-ups and any amendments to augmentation procedures.
     1.4. 52d MSG Superintendent (52 MSG/CEM) is the Wing Augmentation Duty Program
     Manager and will handle overall administration of the Wing Augmentation Duty Program. The
     program manager will provide status of the Augmentation Duty Program as requested by 52
     FW/CV or as the need arises. The program manager will maintain liaison with other group
     superintendents to ensure the augmentation program's requirements are being met and to address
     any issues or concerns that arise for resolution at the lowest level possible.

Notes:
1. Contractor Escort: 52 CES Construction Management receives all the known construction escort taskings for the
upcoming month and assigns the personnel requirement based on the E-5 and below enlisted population in each
group/squadron. The 52 MSG/CEM will relieve 52 LRS from providing personnel for the wing’s contractor escort
program while the mobility machine is running. Other squadrons within the 52 MSG will fulfill that group’s tasking
requirements. See Attachment 3. When escort(s) are not required for certain periods of the day they will be directed
to report back to their workcenter and their supervisor will be notified.
2. 52 SFS Augmentation: Security and protection of the base and personnel is a wing-wide responsibility. When
activated by the 52 FW/CV, 52 MSG/CEM will work with fellow wing group superintendents in ensuring all tasking
requirements are filled. Training: While this duty is not exclusively reserved for first-term Airmen (NCOs should
also be considered for training), the majority of personnel identified for 52 SFS augmentation duties will be done so
on the first day of each FTAC class by the 52 SFS Augmentee Coordinator. Except in rare circumstances augmentee
training will be conducted on the duty day first-term Airmen complete their Eifel Pride detail requirement and prior
to arrival to his/her duty section. Trainees will be required to bring the following the augmentation class: Load-
bearing equipment/vest, cold/wet weather gear, gas mask, gloves. Once augmentation training is complete, Airmen
will report to their unit. When required, Airmen will be scheduled and be required to attend weapons qualification at
a later date. Weapons qualification requirements/training will be scheduled through the appropriate unit
deployment/training manager.
3. Mobility Machine: Internally supported by 52 LRS. The biggest requirement for the Mobility Machine is during
Phase 1 Exercises, major flying unit and 606 Air Control Squadron deployments and presidential support. Wing
Impact: Expect a slow down to real-world response times during Mobility Machine activation -- supply, deliveries,
fuels, transportation, etc. The wing needs to establish true limitations and expectations on our Mobility Machine
whether real-world or exercise requirements. Exercises should be limited to evaluate sole 52 LRS expectations, not
base-wide tasking expectations. Group CEM will relieve 52 LRS from providing personnel for the wing’s contractor
escort program while the mobility machine is running.

4. Supply Truck Escort (52 LRS): Filled internally by 52 LRS Receiving personnel.
5. Readiness Support Team (RST): Internally supported by 52 CES. The main requirement for the RST is during
Wing Phase 2 Exercises. These Exercises should be tailored to quality of training-vs.-quantity on this tailored team.
Expectations should be limited to the RST unit core positions not base-wide expectations. Wing Impact: Man Days
will increase 133% from the present augmentee workload to approximately 10,200 man days throughout the calendar
year. Initial and repetitive weekly or monthly training is required for these team members due to the nature of the
work involved. When activated, anticipate routine job orders will not be completed in a timely manner, as well as
some forms of engineering support (drafting, surveying and maps).           Deferred maintenance on facilities and
infrastructure may accumulate compounding the lack of sustainment funds to keep our facilities in good condition.
6. Search and Recovery Operations: 52 FSS will internalize the 11 core positions mandated by AFI 34-242,
Mortuary Affairs Program. When required, Exercises should be limited to testing these core positions. For real
world events; the wing may be tasked accordingly as required to support these 11 core position. Wing impact:
Expect some FSS closures during real-world requirements and more intense training requirements for these core
positions.
7. Saber Pride: FTAC Airmen are assigned to the Saber Pride program for two weeks upon graduation from the
course. Average number of members is 14 personnel. When a FTAC class is not conducted, the breakdown of
personnel for each group or squadron is shown (attachment 3).
8. Snow Removal: Internally supported by 52 CES. Internalizing snow removal will enhance training and
implementation. However, clear Wing guidelines must be set and supported on 52 CES expectations during a ―snow
event‖. Wing Impact: Mandays will increase 133% from the present augmentee workload to approximately 10,200
mandays throughout the calendar year. Initial and repetitive weekly or monthly training is required for these team
members due to the nature of the work involved. When activated, anticipate routine job orders will not be completed
in a timely manner, as well as some forms of engineering support (drafting, surveying and maps). Deferred
maintenance on facilities and infrastructure may accumulate compounding the lack of sustainment funds to keep our
facilities in good condition.
9. Postal Augmentation: Internally supported by 52 CS. This duty is date specific to support the holiday mail each
year (15 November – 15 January). Volunteers and over hires are encouraged to support this program and lessen the
impact to the unit and the wing. Wing Impact: Customer service functions and Project Workflow, Requirements &
Resources processes continue to operate—impacts will be responses to new or unprogrammed requests. Slower
response timelines for new plans, designs, installations, and modifications for Telephone, Cable, Radio and Network
Infrastructure systems customer requirements
10. Urinalysis Observer: Each group will provide a female and two male observers for their assigned month.
Members must be Staff Sergeant (SSgt) or higher in rank, 6-months left on station, and no history of disciplinary
actions for dishonesty or drug use. 52 FW and 52 OG will share the monthly tasking (52 FW will only provide the
female observer); 52 MDG, and 726 AMS will also share the monthly tasking within their group/squadron (726 AMS
will provide only one male observer). Observers may not have an Unfavorable Information File (UIF), any action
under the UCMJ, or an adverse administrative action is pending against them. Nor can they be an observer if they
have ever been convicted by court martial or civilian court, received non-judicial punishment under Article 15,
UCMJ, or received a letter of reprimand or similar administrative action for misconduct involving dishonesty (such
as a false official statement), fraud, or drug abuse (including possession or distribution).
11. SSgt rank requirement. Limited and emergency leaves only during this period. No Temporary Duties (TDY).
Members must have passing fitness score (75 or greater).
12. 52 MXG fulfills the PMEL CCP support internally. As a result 52 MSG picks up a slight larger ratio in regards
to the contractor escort program (see Atch 3, Table 1).
Special Note: As 52 MSG internalizes and minimizes the 52 FW augmentation process; realistic numbers and
outputs should be highlighted. Wing leadership should support and ―vocalize‖ realistic expectations and limitations
       SPANGDAHLEMABI10-243         10 FEBRUARY 2009                                                     5


to the base populace during activation and recovery periods -- constantly weighing necessity versus convenience.
Unacceptable delays or complaints should also be weighed against a wing-wide Augmentation plan option.



     2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Unit Augmentation Coordinators (UAC) will be appointed by every unit that uses or
     provides augmentees (see Attachment 2 for appointment letter format). Although not mandatory,
     the squadron senior enlisted manager or first sergeant should be appointed as squadron UAC.
     UACs will notify personnel of their assignment to a particular detail (see Attachment 2 for
     appointment letter format). UACs will be responsible for replacing augmentees not later than
     (NLT) 60 days prior to permanent change of station (PCS) or separation.
     2.2. Augmented Unit Requirements. The unit requesting augmentation will accomplish, at a
     minimum, the following: (1) maintain a list of assigned personnel, (2) schedule and track team
     training, (3) ensure requests for augmentee replacement to individual units are timely, (4)
     forecast any increase/decrease in personnel needed for this detail through the 52 MSG/CD and
     (5) be responsible for providing any special gear/equipment needed to accomplish this detail.
     Forecasting/budgeting for the cost of required equipment is the responsibility of the augmented
     unit.
     3. Processes and procedures
     3.1. 52 FW/CV is the approval authority for all new augmentee requirements. Units will submit
     new augmentee requirements via official memorandum through the group or staff agency and
     forward it for approval by 52 FW/CV. The request should cite the specific authority, including
     paragraph number, for the request. The requesting official will be the unit commander or staff
     agency chief. With the exception of Contractor Escort, Urinalysis Observer, and 52 SFS
     augmentation; wing augmentation is used for temporary, short-term workload surges during
     wartime, contingency, natural disaster and exercise situations. Sustained use of augmentees
     should not be used to offset normal manpower shortfalls.
     3.1.1. 52 FW scheduling and gate keeping are critical to the success of the augmentation
     program. Other than winter weather, local exercises are the biggest drain to augmented units.
     When possible, wing exercises should not be scheduled between Nov – Feb, which is the main
     timeframe for Snow Removal and Postal Augmentee. Also when possible, exercises should try
     to deconflict with Air and Space Expeditionary Force changeover timeframes.
     3.1.2. Exercise criteria should measure realistic squadron requirements and not wing-wide
     augmentation requirements.
     3.2. Tasking Augmentees
     3.2.1. The targeted personnel for performing most details are E-5 and below; however, the
     commander will decide if a higher rank or grade performs the detail. Each group has various
     personnel who may be exempt from various augmentation duties. Group and squadron
     commanders will determine who will perform augmentation duty based on the various
     squadrons' missions. Some squadron personnel may not be able to support extended
     augmentation duties, but shorter duration taskings like the Urinalysis Observer may be feasible
     based on their mission.

3.2.2. Units with approved augmentation requirements will forward their request to implement
to 52 MSG/Command Section electronic mailbox for coordination by the 52 MSG/CD. The
request needs to have an electronic Staff Summary Sheet listing 52 MSG/CEM and 52 MSG/CD
for coordination and 52 FW, Director of Staff (52 FW/DS) for release. The request will have a
sample appointment letter attached and any other supporting documentation needed by the tasked
units to fill the tasking. Once the 52 MSG/CD validates the request, it will be forwarded
electronically to the 52 FW/DS for wing leadership concurrence and tasking to the appropriate
groups or squadrons. Requesting units will establish timely and reasonable suspenses for
obtaining detail personnel names to allow sufficient time for identifying, equipping and training
augmentees.
3.3. Appointing Augmentees
3.3.1. UACs will ensure personnel appointed have a minimum of 1 year of time left on station
for all details except Urinalysis Observer, Saber Pride and Contractor Escort (See Attachment 3
for Contractor Escort special requirements).
3.3.2. Once appointed, personnel will remain on their augmentation team until they PCS,
separate or are replaced by a qualified candidate by the UAC.
3.3.3. UACs will coordinate augmentee replacement 60 days prior to a current augmentee
leaving the position to allow proper training while maintaining mission capability.
3.4. Training and Equipping Augmentees
3.4.1. Augmented units will establish training requirements and conduct training (not on wing
mandated training days) needed for task certification, providing UACs with reasonable prior
notification of training dates. If an augmentation duty has recurring training requirements, the
augmented unit will provide this information to the UACs, detail members, and the wing
Scheduling Center of Excellence to ensure the training does not conflict with other wing
activities.
3.4.2. Squadrons providing augmentees will ensure personnel assigned to augmentation duties
have appropriate personal protective gear with serviceability verified by their immediate
supervisor. Cold weather gear and foul weather gear should be made available to members
performing predominately outdoor activities. Gortex jackets, Gortex pants, steel-toed boots,
gloves, etc. should be issued to personnel assigned to details like snow removal, 52 SFS
augmentation, and outdoor activities of the Mobility Machine.
3.5. Activation of Augmentees
3.5.1. The 52 FW/CV through the 52 MSG/CD or designated detail manager will activate the
appropriate augmentation duty program.
3.5.2. The augmented units and squadron UACs will be notified of the activation order by the
52 MSG/CD or 52 MSG/CEM and the appropriate rules of engagement will be issued. At this
time, the augmented unit will activate recall procedures for their augmentation duty program, as
necessary. After 52 MSG/CD notification, the 52 FW/DS will release the activation order and
reporting instructions to the group commanders and staff agencies. Other pertinent factors such
as: duration of the activation, manpower requirements, circumstances surrounding the
activation, and individual member requirements will be briefed to wing leadership as soon as
 SPANGDAHLEMABI10-243         10 FEBRUARY 2009                                                 7


possible. Proper utilization of the base paper, wing staff meetings, Battle Staff Directives and
commander's call will be maximized to get pertinent information to the appropriate audience.
3.5.3. When squadrons fail to provide personnel for wing approved details according to tasking
or when personnel report late, the requesting agency will contact the appropriate first sergeant,
squadron section commander, unit commander, or chief of staff agency for assistance. If the
squadron fails to provide the required detail personnel in a timely manner, the requesting agency
should notify the 52 MSG/CEM or 52 MSG/CD telephonically, followed up with a
memorandum of record, outlining the circumstances involved.

  portion of Table 1 will reflect the following 30-day recurring detail:

  Table A4.1. 30-day recurring detail
  Table 1. Recurring Details.
  Contractor Escort (30-day detail)   Ratio:   2/100             Fighter Wing Staff

  Contractor Escort (30-day detail)   Ratio:   7/100             Medical Group


  2. The assignment of Contractor Escorts will be according to the ratios listed in the above
  table, based on 52 FW enlisted manning numbers. The following table is a representative
  display of escort assignment according to the above ratio:
  Table A4.2. Ratio Table

  NOTE: An example requirement (20) is highlighted in bold and italics.
  3. Contractor escorts will be detailed in the given ratios until the total escort requirement for
  a given month is filled. Construction is a seasonal activity; groups should expect total
  requirements to change from month to month.
  4. Group POCs will submit the name, phone number, and supervisor's name of each
  Contractor Escort to the 52 FW/Construction Escort Program e-mail box by the 23rd of every
  month. Escorts are required to report to duty with both a government driver’s license and a
  line badge, as much of our 52 FW construction occurs on the flight line. While detailed,
  Contractor Escort duties take precedence over primary work center requirements; members
  are expected to be available for duty at all times. Contractor Escort details will continue
  through exercises.
