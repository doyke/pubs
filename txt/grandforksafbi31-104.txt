This instruction establishes curfew hours for the dependent children of military and civilian residents or
visitors on Grand Forks AFB. It applies to parents, guardians (a family member who is at least 18 years of
age), and those who have legal care of, or who employ, dependents who are under the age of 18.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
All references to the SPTG changed to MSG. Grammatical corrections to paragraphs 1.2. and 1.4. A
bar ( | ) indicates a change since the last edition.


1. Responsibilities: Curfew hours are from 2200 to 0600 Sunday – Thursday and 2400 – 0600 Friday-
Saturday.
   1.1. Dependents, 17 (YOA) or younger, will not be outside of their quarters during curfew unless:
       1.1.1. They are accompanied by a parent or guardian 18 (YOA) or older.
       1.1.2. They are participating in an approved, on–base sponsored event (i.e., MWR trip, Youth
       Center dance, etc.) or are babysitting. In such cases, parents or guardians may contact SFCC at
       7-5351 when dependents are returning home. This will preclude unwarranted detainment.
       1.1.3. They enter the main gate after curfew hours and proceed to their quarters using the most
       direct route available.
   1.2. Security forces will strictly enforce curfew hours. Violators will be detained and transported to
   the SFCC, Bldg #103, where parents/guardians will be contacted and directed to respond. If the viola-
   tor does not meet the exemptions listed in 1.1. through 1.3., an incident report will be accomplished.
   1.3. The 319 MSG Commander will be notified in writing no later than 3 days prior to any event
   involving minors which extends through curfew hours. The MSG Commander will approve or disap-
   prove events and notify the Chief, Security Forces (CSF) in case of approvals. The CSF will ensure
   the Security Forces Installation Security Section is briefed.

    1.4. Sponsors who fail to supervise their dependents may be subject to disciplinary action.
