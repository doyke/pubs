This instruction applies to all the 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) units, tenant units, and staff agencies. It
provides guidance, both directive and nondirective, for the development, assignment, training and status
reporting of augmentation duty teams and team members. It is designed to be used with AFPAM 10-243,
Augmentation Duty. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in AFMAN 37-123 (to
be replaced by AFMAN 33-363) are maintained in accordance with this manual, and are disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. Major revisions include: All
references to fair share distribution are removed. Distribution among groups will be determined by Aug-
mentee Review Board (Vice Commander and Group Commanders/Director of Staff) consensus. Refer-
ences to E1-E5 as augmentees are removed. There is no distinction on grade. Security forces are provided
more authority to accept or decline those that are selected for augmentee duty. Individuals assigned as
Security Forces augmentees are required to complete pre-requisite training on their own before attending
augmentee training. Group commanders are directed to assign group alternate group program monitors as
well as primaries. All discussion of alternate augmentees is removed from the instruction. Group and
squadron monitors are instructed to ensure enough augmentees are trained so that they will be able to
meet any tasking for augmentee activation. Each group monitor will track the utilization of each group’s
augmentees and present findings quarterly to the program manager to consolidate and present at the quar-
terly Augmentation Duty Review Board. Added Attachment 2-6. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the
previous edition.

                      SECURITY FORCES AUGMENTATION PROGRAM

A1.1. Program Mission:
   A1.1.1. 366 SFS Augmentation Program is designed to offset critical manning shortages during
   increased Force Protection Conditions, AEF deployments when manning drops below acceptable lev-
   els, contingency operations, and base exercises. Competent authority will release augmentees back to
   their assigned unit when their services are no longer required.

A1.2. Training:

   folders on all assigned augmentees. Training folders will contain the following items:
      A1.2.1.1. Proof of appointment containing the following information on the appointee: Name,
      rank, SSN, unit/office symbol, duty phone, home phone, DOS, and home address.
      A1.2.1.2. Job description/duty title.
      A1.2.1.3. Usage history/Job performance record.

      A1.2.2.1. 366 SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief will conduct a training review once per month

      duties. Scheduling of classes will occur when five or more augmentees require training.
      A1.2.2.2. 366 SFS Team Chief must make every attempt to schedule training dates for augment-
      ees 30 days in advance, and will coordinate with group monitors when this is not possible.
      A1.2.2.3. Classes are held in Bldg 923, unless otherwise posted, and will last 3 full duty days.
      A1.2.2.4. Upon approval of the Augmentation Program Manager, 366 SFS Augmentation Duty

       A1.2.2.5. All training will be conducted from the unknown to known level and based on the GO/
       NO GO grading system. Individuals receiving a NO GO in any block of instruction will receive
       remedial one-on-one training until they can perform the task to the GO level. Training will be con-
       ducted by using approved lesson plans and squadron-approved task performance checklists. Each
       individual must perform required pre-requisites before attending training. Squadron monitors will
       ensure each individual completes the pre-requisites before attending class.
       A1.2.2.6. Each individual will receive a certificate of training upon successful completion of all
       required blocks of training. The individual will receive the original and the SFS Augmentation

       Augmentation Duty Team Chief will brief the 366 SFS/CC on the status of manpower. 366 SFS/
       CC will make recommendations for force utilization of SFS augmentees to 366 FW/CC who will
       make the final decision to use or not use SFS augmentees.
       A1.3.1.2. 366 SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief, or designated representative, will perform
       the following upon recall or activation:
           A1.3.1.2.1. Refresher training on critical tasks, e.g., arming, use of force, clearing barrel pro-
           cedures, etc.
           A1.3.1.2.2. Inspection of all equipment for serviceability and employment capability.
           A1.3.1.2.3. Brief all augmentees on the concept of operation, flight assignment, and duty
           schedule.
       A1.3.1.3. In the event of a scheduled AEF which allows 366 SFS Operations Branch time to plan
       for manning shortages, SFO will provide 366 SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief sufficient data
       to develop a request for activation letter.
       A1.3.1.4. 366 SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief will complete the required request letter with
       detailed information concerning activation date, period of activation, and estimated de-activation
       date and route it through the following individuals:

           A1.3.1.4.4. 366 FW/CC
       A1.3.1.5. Upon deactivation orders, all augmentees will return their SF equipment to Bldg 910 for
       temporary storage. Storing equipment at a central location will alleviate the probability of individ-
       uals departing Mountain Home AFB without returning their equipment to the SFS supply section.

A1.4. Leave/TDY/PCS:
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI10-243 12 JUNE 2006                                                                   9


   A1.4.1. Both group and squadron monitors must strictly monitor leave, TDY, and PCS status of all
   assigned SF augmentees. To alleviate possible shortfalls during necessary activations/recalls, squad-
   ron monitors will ensure sufficient trained personnel are always available to meet full activation
   requirements.
      A1.4.1.1. Group monitors must immediately notify the SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief of
      the permanent removal of a SFS augmentee, and in turn find an acceptable replacement for them.
      A1.4.1.2. The squadron monitor will coordinate a replacement through the appropriate
      chain-of-command and send the information to 366 SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief via
      e-mail.
          A1.4.1.2.1. Each squadron monitor responsible for augmentee manning for 366 SFS Augmen-
          tation Program will identify and request training for assigned augmentees. Squadron monitors
          must ensure enough augmentees are assigned to ensure sufficient trained personnel are always
          available to meet full activation requirements.
          A1.4.1.2.2. SFS Augmentation Duty Team Chief will provide a training status to the Augmen-
          tation Duty Program Manager monthly, or as needed. Group and squadron monitors will pro-
          vide a response to shortfall issues within 1-duty day.

   assigned CDF/PDF/DCC augmentees.

       affecting a primary CDF/PDF augmentee, and in turn, find an acceptable replacement for them.
       A2.4.1.2. Squadron monitor will coordinate a replacement through the appropriate chain-of-com-
       mand, and send the information to IDO or designated representative via e-mail. Squadron monitor
       will draft a replacement letter and route it through the appropriate chain-of-command to arrive
       through the group monitor, and to IDO or designated representative within 7 duty days of identi-
       fying augmentee replacement needs.
       A2.4.1.3. Each squadron monitor responsible for augmentee manning for CDF/PDF Augmenta-
       tion Program will identify and request training for alternates.
       A2.4.1.4. In the event a primary CDF/PDF augmentee takes leave or is tasked with a TDY, the
       squadron monitor will assign an alternate to fill the position during the primary’s leave or TDY.

        priate chain of command including the group monitor to arrive with IDO or designated represen-
        tative within 7 duty days of identifying replacement needs.
