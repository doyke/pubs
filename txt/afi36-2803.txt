A2.1. General Considerations before Submitting a Decoration Recommendation: In accordance
with Section 6249 of Title 10 U.S.C., “No medal, cross, or bar, or associated emblem or insignia
may be awarded or presented to any USAF member or their representative, if the member’s
entire service subsequent to the time of the distinguished act, achievement, or service has not
been honorable.” Section 8744 of title 10 U.S.C. also stipulate that the Medal of Honor (MOH),
the AFC, and the DSM can only be considered and approved for members whose character of
service is exemplary and this requirement will not be waived. Supervisors and commanders, at
all levels, are responsible to ensure that only deserving personnel are submitted for decorations.
Submit recommendations as soon as possible following the act, achievement, or service. Enter
each recommendation (except the PH) into official channels within 3 years and award within 5
years of the act, achievement, or service performed. This will be strictly enforced. Note: A
recommendation is placed in official channels when the recommending official signs the
recommendation (DECOR6 and justification) and a higher official in the nominee’s chain of
command endorses it. Refer to paragraph 1.14 for who may recommend an award.

    AIR FORCE AWARDS AND DECORATIONS PROGRAM INTRODUCTION,
   OBJECTIVE, GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Awards and Decorations Program Introduction. The Air Force Awards and Decorations
Program is primarily a commander’s program that uses individual decorations, service awards
and medals, achievement awards, and unit awards to recognize meritorious or outstanding
service, as well as recognizing excellence above and beyond the actions of others. All individual
decorations and unit awards must be properly processed using a 3-step process: proper
recommendation and submittal into official channels, approval of the recommendation, and
presentation of the approved decoration or award. Service and achievement awards typically do
not enter the 3-step process, as they are considered awards of entitlement, which are
automatically awarded based upon meeting the established criteria for the particular service or
achievement award.
1.2. Awards and Decorations Program Objective. The objective of the Air Force Awards and
Decorations Program is to foster morale, provide incentive, and esprit de corps. Individuals or
units considered for awards and decorations under this program must clearly demonstrate
sustained and superior performance. Air Force members make many personal and professional
sacrifices to ensure the Air Force accomplishes its missions. Acts of valor, heroism, courage,
exceptional or meritorious service, and outstanding achievement deserve special recognition; this
instruction provides a means for commanders and supervisors to recognize these acts. The Air
Force Awards and Decorations Program, AFI 36-2803, is limited to recognizing units,
organizations, or individuals. There is no authorized award or decoration to be used to recognize
military service animals, such as K-9 dogs, horses, etc.

       decorations, or citations, the Services shall conduct a security and privacy review and
       obtain concurrence to release from appropriate Air Force Intelligence/Security officials,
       as well as their Privacy Office. In those situations there could be a risk or a compromise
       to national security, the information will be sanitized by removing or rewording the
       identifying particulars or the release may be denied. This applies to all requests for

   and higher command requirements.
   1.13.2. ANG personnel on active duty, or while participating in authorized periods of

insignia may be awarded or presented to any USAF member or their representative, if the
member’s entire service subsequent to the time of the distinguished act, achievement, or service
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  19


has not been honorable.” Section 8744 of title 10 U.S.C. also stipulate that the Medal of Honor
(MOH), the AFC, and the DSM can only be considered and approved for members whose
character of service is exemplary and this requirement will not be waived. Supervisors and
commanders, at all levels, are responsible to ensure that only deserving personnel are submitted
for decorations. Submit recommendations as soon as possible following the act, achievement, or
service. Enter each recommendation (except the PH) into official channels within 2 years and
award within 3 years of the act, achievement, or service performed. This will be strictly
enforced. Note: A recommendation is placed in official channels when the recommending
official signs the recommendation (DECOR6 and justification) and a higher official in the
nominee’s chain of command endorses it. Refer to paragraph 1.14. for who may recommend an
award.
   1.15.1. Do not submit decoration recommendations in a token effort to “do something for
   your people”.
   1.15.2. Restrict decoration recommendations to recognizing acts of valor, heroism, courage,
   exceptional service, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement that clearly place
   members above their peers.
   1.15.3. Base decoration recommendations on specific projects, plans, programs, or actions
   that are or will be beneficial to the Air Force.
   1.15.4. Recognition by inspection agencies for superior duty performance, attainment of
   honors based solely on academic achievement (such as graduating with honors from a
   noncommissioned officer academy or other courses of instruction), or receipt of other forms
   of recognition (for example, selection as Airman of the Month, Quarter, Year; recipient of a
   special trophy or award, or identification as a superior performer by the Inspector General)
   do not, in themselves, justify a recommendation for a military decoration and is discouraged.
   1.15.5. Each decoration prescribes standards which define the degree and magnitude of an
   act, achievement, or service considered worthy for awarding that particular decoration. Do
   not base award of a specific decoration upon a member’s grade, but on the member’s level of
   responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, and manner of performance.
   1.15.6. No member is automatically entitled to a decoration upon PCS, permanent change of
   assignment (PCA), retirement, separation, completion of a TDY, or reaching/achieving other
   points at which a decoration may be recommended. Supervisors must decide at these points
   if a decoration is appropriate.
   1.15.7. A member’s immediate supervisor determines the propriety of a decoration
   recommendation. Do not establish preconditions for a decoration. Do not use military
   decorations for incentives or as prizes in contests.
   1.15.8. Immediate supervisors and commanders evaluate all related facts regarding the
   service of a member before recommending or awarding a decoration.
   1.15.9. The reassignment (PCA/PCS), retirement, separation, or death of a commander or
   supervisor is not a basis for recommending a subordinate(s) for a decoration.
   1.15.10. Approval of multiple decorations for the same act, achievement, or period of
   service is considered dual recognition which is prohibited (see definition at Attachment 1).
   Personnel awarded two or more decorations for the same act or service must identify this
 20                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   discrepancy to their servicing MPS. Approve only one decoration for the same act,
   achievement, or period of service. Additionally USAF decorations may not be awarded to
   any US service member for an act, achievement, or period of service for which a DoD or
   another Services decoration has been awarded. For example, justification in an approved
   award for outstanding achievement (“While deployed in support of Operation FROZEN
   CHEEKS, Airman Johnson served 125,000 meals-ready-to-eat to deployed personnel in
   Antarctica…”) cannot be utilized in a recommendation for meritorious service (“During this
   period, Airman Johnson prepared over 325,000 hot meals for service members of the 12th
   Mission Support Squadron, and 125,000 meals-ready-to-eat during a recent deployment as a
   Food Preparation Specialist.”). You can mention in the recommendation for meritorious
   service the member deployed, but not the time period, action, or achievements that occurred
   during the inclusive period of the deployment.
   1.15.11. Do not award, approve, or present a decoration to any person whose entire service
   during or after the time of the distinguished act, achievement, or service has not been
   honorable; with “honorable” being defined as the characterization of one’s conduct to be
   that of honest and faithful service according the standards of conduct, courage, and duty
   required by law and customs of the service of a member of the grade to whom the standard is
   applied.
   1.15.12. Inclusive Dates: The dates to be used for inclusive dates are as follows:
      1.15.12.1. PCS: Start date is the date the member arrived to the station/unit; stop date is
      the date of final outprocessing.
      1.15.12.2. PCA: Start date is the date the member arrived to the unit; stop date is the day
      prior to the effective date of the unit change.
      1.15.12.3. Separation/Retirement: Start date is the date the member arrived to the
      station/unit; stop date is the day prior to the separation/retirement effective date.
      1.15.12.4. Posthumous: Start date is the date arrived to the station/unit; stop date is the
      date of the member's death.
      1.15.12.5. Achievement: Start date is the date member inprocessed (TDY) or the date the
      special project or duty started; stop date is the final outprocessing day (TDY) or the date
      of when the special project or duty ended.
      1.15.12.6. Extended Tour: Start date is the date the member arrived to the station/unit;
      stop date is the day prior to the 3- or 4-year point (see paragraph 1.16.1.6).
      1.15.12.7. Unless under extenuating circumstances, requests to change either start or stop
      dates (i.e.: to facilitate promotion eligibility) once a decoration has been finalized and
      presented should not be approved.
1.16. Basis for Decorations. Base decoration recommendations on meritorious service,
outstanding achievement, or on an act of courage or heroism. See Table 1.1 for guidance.
   1.16.1. Meritorious Service: Recommendations based on meritorious service are the most
   common and recognize accomplishments, services, and achievements upon a completed
   period of service. A completed period of service has definite beginning and ending dates
   (inclusive dates) of service to, or assignment at, an organization or base and is typically
   marked by one of the following conditions:
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  21


     1.16.1.1. PCS/365-day TDY Deployment. The PCS decoration beginning (start) date is
     the member’s date arrived station. Note: If a previous PCS, PCA or Extended Tour
     decoration was approved and the inclusive period extends into the new recommended
     decoration’s inclusive period, then it would be the first day after the ending date of the
     previous decoration. The ending date is the projected departure date (usually the
     scheduled outprocessing date from the MPS) as reflected on the Recommendation for
     Decoration Printout (DECOR6 RIP).
        1.16.1.1.1. Should a member receive notice for a 365-day TDY deployment and be
        eligible for PCS decoration consideration, please follow the procedures outlined in
        paragraph 1.16.2.3.
        1.16.1.1.2. Only on very rare and unusual occasions (such as base closure, unit
        deactivation, A-76 conversion, etc.) in which for some reason a member was not
        recommended for a decoration, combining service in two (or more)
        assignments/commands to justify a decoration is authorized. When this is warranted,
        the losing commander of the member being recommended for a decoration must
        provide written input for the service period at that assignment/command to the current
        supervisor.
     1.16.1.2. PCA is a permanent reassignment from one unit to another on the same base.
     The new assignment must be markedly different from the previous duty to meet the intent
     of the completed period of service requirements. The member’s supervisor or
     commander may forgo a PCA decoration recommendation to qualify the member later for
     an Extended Tour decoration (see paragraph 1.16.1.6). The PCA decoration beginning
     date is the date arrived station or date arrived to the organization (unless a previous PCA
     or Extended Tour decoration was approved; then, it would be the first day after the
     ending date of previous decoration) and ending date is the date projected to depart from
     the PCA organization.
     1.16.1.3. Retirement: The retirement decoration typical beginning date is the date
     arrived station or date arrived to the most recent assignment/organization (unless a
     previous PCA or Extended Tour decoration was approved; then, it would be the first day
     after the ending date of a previous decoration) and ending date is the last day of the
     month prior to the projected retirement effective date reflected on the DECOR6 RIP. For
     example, if the projected retirement effective date is 1 July, the ending date of a
     retirement decoration is 30 June. If the retirement decoration is due to a disability, the
     beginning date is based on the same criteria as the length of service. The ending date is
     the actual date of retirement, which could be any day in the month.
     1.16.1.4. Separation: The Separation decoration typical beginning date is the date
     arrived station or date arrived to the most recent assignment/organization (unless a
     previous PCA or Extended Tour decoration was approved; then, it would be the first day
     after the ending date of the previous decoration) and ending date is the actual projected
     separation effective date reflected on the DECOR6 RIP.
     1.16.1.5. Posthumous (Death of an Airman): The Posthumous decoration typical
     beginning date is the date arrived station or date arrived to the most recent
     assignment/organization (unless a previous PCA or Extended Tour decoration was
22                                                        AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


     approved; then it would be the first day after the ending date of the previous decoration)
     and ending date is the date of the member’s death.
     1.16.1.6. Extended Tour. A member may be considered for a decoration for clearly
     outstanding and unmistakably exceptional service or meritorious service for an extended
     period of at least 3 years or more at an organization or base for award of the Bronze Star
     Medal and lesser medals, or at least 4 years for award of the LOM. Approval authorities
     establish policy and determine the propriety of this provision for situations or assignment
     locations in which a projected action (PCS, Retirement, Separation, etc.) is forthcoming.
     After approval of an Extended Tour decoration, supervisors may consider a decoration
     for a subsequent completed period of service, regardless of the time period elapsed since
     the Extended Tour decoration. The Extended Tour decoration typical beginning date is
     the date arrived station or date arrived to the most recent assignment/organization (unless
     a previous PCA or Extended Tour decoration was approved; then, it would be the first
     day after the ending date of the previous decoration) and the ending date is a date 3 years
     or more after the established beginning date; however, this inclusive period is determined
     by the approval authority for propriety.
     1.16.1.7. A member may be recommended for a decoration based on exceptional service
     or meritorious service, even if during the period of exceptional service or meritorious
     service the member received a decoration based on outstanding achievement; however,
     do not include previously recognized outstanding achievement acts or achievements in
     the justification for the decoration based on exceptional service or meritorious service.
  1.16.2. Outstanding Achievement: Recommendations based on outstanding achievement
  typically recognize a single, specific act or accomplishment, separate and distinct from
  regularly assigned duties, such as successfully completing an important project(s), reaching
  major milestones of a long-term project or negotiations, or accomplishments achieved during
  a temporary duty (TDY) status. Significant projects are usually not considered regularly
  assigned duties and may meet the criteria of the outstanding achievement basis, even if the
  project is related to the member’s area of responsibility. Supervisors and commanders are
  responsible to make the determination of qualification.
     1.16.2.1. An outstanding achievement decoration usually covers a short period of time
     with definite beginning and ending dates. To afford prompt recognition, submit
     outstanding achievement decorations within 10 duty days, if practical, after the specific
     act or accomplishment.
     1.16.2.2. Submit an outstanding achievement decoration recommendation only when you
     have no other way to recognize the specific act or achievement and waiting would
     diminish the significance of the accomplishment. Do not use the basis of outstanding
     achievement to justify decorations when the conditions for a completed period of service
     have not been met.
     1.16.2.3. Criteria for 365-day TDY Deployment Medal. Consideration for this
     decoration is reserved for USAF members selected to deploy from home station for a
     365-day period. Members selected for this TDY could receive a follow-on assignment to
     another installation upon completion of their TDY; however some USAF members will
     return to home station. Should a member be selected for a follow-on assignment to
     another installation and the member is considered for a decoration based on this criteria,
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     23


       the inclusive period start date is the date arrived station at the deployed location and the
       closeout date is the date of departure from the deployment location. If applicable, the
       inclusive period for the PCS decoration should be the date arrived on station unless a
       previous decoration closed out after this date (i.e., PCS, PCA or Extended Tour), and the
       close date should be the final out processing date or DEROS.
           1.16.2.3.1. Processing a Medal Prior to a 365-day TDY Deployment. The processing
           of this decoration would follow the same processing procedures for other decorations
           at home station. The recommending official should confirm the member’s projected
           365-day TDY inclusive period to ensure the member’s entire period of service on the
           installation is properly captured in the submission. Should the member not receive a
           decoration from the deployed location, this will prevent the member from having a
           break of dates at home station and the member’s accomplishments could then be
           captured in the recommendation. Deployed locations who submit a member for a
           decoration for a 365-day period will process this submission as an achievement
           (Condition 4) decoration in accordance to paragraph 1.16.2. Upon approval, the
           deployed location is responsible for forwarding a copy of the approved decoration to
           the member’s home station and, if applicable, to the member’s gaining base/MPS for
           inclusion in their records under paragraph 1.10.4.
           1.16.2.3.2. Presentation of a Medal Prior to a 365-day TDY Deployment.
           Presentation of the 365-day TDY Deployment decoration should take place at home
           station prior to the member’s departure on their 365-day TDY. If a member is
           required to return to home station for out-processing purposes, the decoration
           ceremony could take place upon the member’s return. The recommending official is
           responsible to coordinate with the member and the MPS to ensure adequate
           presentation.

member of a military force who: at the time of the events for which the decoration is to be
awarded, was serving in a geographic area in which hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay
(HFP/IDP) was authorized in accordance with section 310, or hazardous duty pay in accordance
with paragraph (1) or (3) of Title 37 U.S.C. Section 351 (a); or receives HFP/IDP in accordance
with section 310 or, hazardous duty pay in accordance with paragraph (1) or (3) of section 351(a)
of title 37 U.S.C. as a result of those events.
3. Awarded for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    25


of duty. Award the Air Force design of the MOH on or after 1 November 1965.
Recommendations are processed through chain of command to SAFPC.
4. Awarded for extraordinary heroism, not justifying award of the MOH. Recommendations are
processed through chain of command to SAFPC and approved by SECAF.
5. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious service to the US in a duty or position of great
responsibility. This is the highest peacetime Air Force decoration awarded. It is awarded
primarily to general officers. Recommendations are processed through chain of command to
SAFPC.
6. Awarded for gallantry in action that does not warrant the MOH or AFC. Gallantry in action
means heroism of high degrees including risk of life. Recommendations are processed through
chain of command to SAFPC.
7. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service to
the US. The LOM (Degree of Legionnaire) is the only LOM awarded to Armed Forces of the
United States personnel. Do not award the LOM (Degree of Chief Commander, Degree of
Commander, or Degree of Officer) to Armed Forces of the United States personnel. LOM
recommendations are processed through chain of command to SAFPC. Other command levels
may have approval authority; refer to Table 2.1. In peacetime, awards to US military personnel
are limited to:
7.1. Service in an extremely difficult duty that is performed in a clearly exceptional manner, if
such service is of marked national or international significance to the Air Force or the DoD; or
7.2. Service that has aided the US in furthering its national policies; or
7.3. Service which has furthered the interest or the security of the US; or
7.4. Service that has furthered the interests or the security of the US, or any nation allied or
associated with the US during a period of national emergency declared by the President or
Congress. Superior performance of normal duties will not alone justify award of this decoration.
8. There are four degrees of the LOM awarded to foreign military personnel. Refer to Table 3.5
for the degrees. All LOM recommendations for foreign military members are processed through
the chain of command to SAFPC, for appropriate action. A second or succeeding award to the
same person will be in the same degree or in a higher degree than the previous award. A medal
will be presented for each award. Refer to Chapter 9, Air Force Decorations to Foreign
Nationals and United States Civilians, for more information or the AFPC Awards and
Decorations website, at: http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/awards/index.asp.
9. While participating in aerial flight. Heroism or achievement must be entirely distinctive,
involving operations that are not routine. The medal is not awarded for sustained operational
activities and flights. Recommendations are processed through the chain of command to SAFPC
and approved by SECAF, unless approval authority is delegated or authorized by this instruction.
Award the “V” device for heroism.
10. Involving voluntary risk of life under conditions other than those of conflict with an armed
enemy of the US. The saving of a life or the success of the voluntary heroic act is not essential.
Do not award for normal performance of duties. Recommendations are processed through the
chain of command to SAFPC Decorations Board for approval. Along with all required
documentation, one or more of the following is required to support the recommendation: fire
reports, police reports, newspaper articles, safety reports, and/or witness statements.
11. Not involving participation in aerial flight. Refer to Table 2.1 for approval authorities.
Award the “V” device for heroism.
12. See Table 3.10 for specific information on the PH criteria.
 26                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


13. USAF civilian employees may qualify for the Defense of Freedom Medal (DFM) awarded
for death or injuries. Refer to AFI 36-1004, Air Force Civilian Recognition Program, for
criteria.
14. Awarded for outstanding noncombat meritorious achievement or service to the US. Level of
achievement or service is less than that required for the LOM. Recommendations are processed
through chain of command and approved by authorities in Table 2.1.
15. Do not award to foreign military personnel in the rank of brigadier general or higher.
Recommendations by other eligible grades are processed through chain of command for review
and approval by the AF MAJCOM.
16. Awarded for single acts of heroism or meritorious achievement while participating in aerial
flight. Required achievement is less than that required for the DFC, but must be accomplished
with distinction above and beyond that expected of professional Airmen. Recommendations are

unified commander or higher authority. Award of the “V” device is based solely on the acts of
members who meet the basic criteria of the AFCM/AFAM, and who are exposed to personal
hazards due to direct hostile action during a contingency deployment operation. For a single
event, Air Force Component Commanders may authorize the “V” device when a single event,
such as a terrorist act, isolated combat-type incident, etc., warrants the “V” device distinction.
The “V” device will not be awarded for normal peacetime acts or services. Award of the “V”
device is authorized only for events or situations which occurred on or after 11 January 1996.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     27


1.17. Display of Awards and Decorations. Public display of Air Force awards and
decorations, medals, ribbons, and devices is authorized by AFPC/DPSIDR. MAJCOM, FOA, or
DRU commanders may authorize their subordinate organizations to display awards and
decorations as described below. Public institutions such as museums, libraries, historical,
numismatics, military societies, other public institutions, DoD military departments, and US
government agencies that provide an opportunity for the public to view Air Force awards and
decorations, under circumstances beneficial to the Air Force, may be loaned samples of Air
Force awards and decorations. The loan of sample Air Force awards and decorations may be on
a short or long term basis. At the discretion of the Superintendent, AFPC/DPSIDR, sample Air
Force awards and decorations may be provided free of cost or include a charge for each award or
decoration, and for packing, mailing, transporting, engraving, and other costs. Samples are not
loaned or provided at cost to private individuals, associations, or organizations.
   1.17.1. Public institutions request Air Force awards and decorations for display in writing on
   the institution’s letterhead. The request must describe the institution, the intended use of the
   awards and decorations, a statement that the awards and decorations will be available for
   public viewing and display free of charge, a description of how the awards and decorations
   will be secured and safeguarded from theft or vandalism, a statement agreeing to report
   awards and decorations that are lost, stolen, or accidentally destroyed to AFPC and local
   police department, a statement that the awards and decorations will be returned to AFPC
   when no longer needed, removed from the facility or the facility changes in anyway
   detrimental to the display, and include the full name, telephone number, and email address of
   a point of contact within the institution. Requests should be submitted to Headquarters, Air
   Force Personnel Center, Attention: AFPC/DPSIDR, 550 C Street, Randolph Air Force Base,
   TX 78150-4714.
   1.17.2. US government agencies and DoD military departments request Air Force awards
   and decorations for display in writing on the agency’s letterhead. The request should include
   similar requirements outlined in paragraph 1.17.1, above. Samples of these decorations
   may be furnished, without charge, for one display in the office of the chief of the government
   agency where opportunity for the public to view the display is assured.
   1.17.3. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders or vice commanders can authorize their
   subordinate organizations to display awards and decorations, ensuring the display is justified
   in terms of benefits to be derived by the Air Force. Display of awards and decorations solely
   for the purpose of decorating an office or building are not encouraged; however, public
   displays highlighting awards and decorations or honoring individuals are acceptable. The
   request from the subordinate command should include similar requirements as above, along
   with any other MAJCOM/FOA/DRU specific requirements. The requesting subordinate
   organization acquires the authorized awards and decorations and bears all associated costs;
   the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU only authorizes the display.
   1.17.4. Display sets of the Medal of Honor must be: open to the public under circumstances
   beneficial to the Air Force, available for public viewing free of charge, protected by a 24-
   hour guard or alarm system, and displayed in a locked showcase or cabinet that cannot be
   moved. Bulletproof or shatterproof glass is preferred.
   1.17.5. Display of Air Force awards and decorations visual aids is authorized and is subject
   to the discretion of organization/unit leadership or office chief. The visual aid may be an
 28                                                            AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   official Air Force or a commercially procured item.           There is no requirement in this
   instruction for authorization to display visual aids.
1.18. Requisition Procedures. Requisition decorations, service medals, ribbons, devices, and
streamers through appropriate supply channels. Do not locally procure the items. Companies
may not manufacture or sell these items unless authorized by the SECAF.
   1.18.1. Requisitions for streamers must indicate the authority for the award and the
   appropriate inscription to be embroidered on the streamer. Units may not requisition
   AFOUA streamers without embroidery. Organizations requiring blank AFOUA streamers
   for use in award ceremonies prior to receiving embroidered streamers may obtain required
   blank streamers on a loan basis from Air Force Clothing and Textiles. Units may requisition
   the AFOEA streamer with or without embroidery.
   1.18.2. Armed Forces of the United States miniature devices and ribbons, and the individual
   medals, ribbons, and emblems awarded by foreign governments are neither sold nor issued
   by the Department of the Air Force. The DoD does not issue items by the foreign
   governments concerned; they may be available commercially at the individual’s expense.
1.19. Replacing Decorations. A person, or the representative of a person, awarded a decoration
may receive a one-time replacement decoration, without charge, if the previously issued
decoration is lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use, without fault or neglect on the part of the
recipient or their representative. All other replacement decorations will be provided at cost. The
AFPC will accomplish this for Air Force veterans.
1.20. Replacing Decoration Certificates. Any service member or former service member, or
their next of kin, may have lost or destroyed decoration certificates replaced by the approval
authority only if the requestor certifies, in writing, that the certificate was lost or destroyed. For
commands no longer in existence, AFPC/DPSIDR will accomplish this. When replacing a
certificate, enter the current date on the certificate below the printed statement, “given under my
hand.” Also, enter the words “replacement certificate” after the order number, for example
“SPECIAL ORDER #: G-174 (Replacement Certificate)”. This annotation will indicate that the
certificate is a replacement.
1.21. Engraving Medals. Do not engrave military decorations for living recipients, except
MOH. For posthumous awards engrave military individual achievement decorations only as
follows:
   1.21.1. Engrave, in capital letters as follows: Engrave the awardee's rank (abbreviated), first
   name, middle initial, last name.
   1.21.2. For Medal of Honor include the organization (to which the member was assigned
   when performing the service that garnered the recipient the MOH) in line if possible
   (example: MSG JOHN D. DOE, 52 SPECIAL OPERATIONS SQUADRON). If rank, first
   name, middle initial, last name, and organization can't fit on one line, use rank, initial of first
   name, middle initial, last name, and organization (example: MSG J. D. DOE, 52 SPECIAL
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                         29


   OPERATIONS SQUADRON). The rank, names, and organization may be split if necessary,
   but centered on each line - for example:
                                          MSG
                                       JOHN D. DOE
                            52 SPECIAL OPERATIONS SQUADRON

Use standard font block letters; do not use fancy fonts.
   1.21.3. Engrave, in capital letters, medals accompanying military decorations awarded to
   foreign nationals with the awardee's first name, middle initial, and last name, in line if
   possible (example FREDERICK J. HORST). The name may be split if necessary - for
   example:
                                           FREDERICK J.
                                              HORST

If first name, middle initial, and last name can't fit on the medal, use initial of first name, middle
initial, and last name only (example: F. J. HORST). Use standard font block letters; do not use
fancy fonts.
1.22. Verifying Prior Awards: Make every effort to verify entitlement to prior awards before
initiating a request to other headquarters or centers. This verification effort will include
reviewing all available official records; requesting the member to search personal files for copies
of orders or related documents, reviewing instructions for unit awards and campaign and assault
landing credit; and reviewing entries on member’s copy of separation certificates or statements
of service for previous periods of service. If records are not available to verify the awards
earned, refer to the following:

a citation (or a combined certificate/citation), the special orders announcing the award (may also
be included on decoration certificate), and a folder for encasing the citation and certificate.
1.24. Commemorative Medals. Various commercial vendors offer commemorative medals
which recognize historical events, campaigns, or service, such as the D-Day Invasion, the Battle
of the Bulge, overseas tours, or combat service. These medals are not issued by DoD, individual
branches of the Armed Services, or other government agencies. As such, and in accordance with
AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel, these medals and corresponding

                                            Chapter 2

      SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND THE
                        APPROVAL AUTHORITIES

2.1. Chain of Command. The process of awarding a decoration involves the chain of
command. Typically, the supervisor prepares the recommendation for a decoration, the first
sergeant reviews it (if enlisted), the squadron commander endorses it, the approval authority
prepares the elements of the decoration, the Military Personnel Section (MPS) files, updates and
distributes the decoration elements, and then it is presented to the recipient. A variation of this
process is authorized; however, the individual chains of command of members are primarily
responsible to follow guidance in this instruction. Submission requests for US Air Force
veterans can be found in Chapter 10, Veteran Application for Awards and Decorations.
   2.1.1. Vigilance should be taken to protect Privacy Act (PA) and Personal Identifying
   Information (PII) when submitting or sending nominations, applications or other documents
   to DoD agencies whether through government internet systems (e-mail), postal methods,
   faxing or scanning. As a minimum review the following references and take appropriate
   actions to protect your PA/PII that contains sensitive or For Official Use Only (FOUO)
   information before sending: AFI 33-332, Chapter 2 and 6, DoD 5400.11-R, Department of
   Defense Privacy Program; AFI 33-119, and AFI 33-129.
2.2. Immediate Supervisor. Since the immediate supervisor is typically very aware of and
familiar with the acts, achievements, and services performed by a member, the immediate
supervisor submits a decoration recommendation. Under some unusual circumstances, an
individual other than the immediate supervisor with firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement,
or service, may recommend or contribute to a decoration recommendation by providing evidence
or statements through the supervisor and chain of command of the member being recommended.
(T-3).
   2.2.1. Acquire and comply with respective unit/local or higher command decoration
   recommendation preparation and processing requirements and directives. (T-3).
   2.2.2. Submit decoration recommendations in a timely manner. Should the member be non-
   recommended for a decoration, the DECOR6 should be signed and returned to the
   commander no later than 10 duty days prior to MPS or other established suspense. Should
   the member be recommended for a decoration, complete a decoration recommendation as
   soon as possible following the act or achievement; or before the period of service. Due to
   statutory time limitations, each recommendation for a decoration (except for the PH) must be
   placed into official channels within 2 years of the date of the act or achievement, or last day
   of the period of service, and final action (approval/disapproval, upgrade/downgrade) must be
   done within 3 years of the act, achievement, or service performed. However, to meet the
   objective of prompt recognition (“Pin ‘Em Where You Win ‘Em” philosophy), supervisors
   must not delay in submitting a decoration to the point of 2 years from the act, achievement,
   or service, since this may impact other critical personnel matters. (T-3).
   2.2.3. Take action upon receipt of the Recommendation for Decoration Printout
   (RRDER6/DECOR6) RIP, or other similarly authorized document. The DECOR6 is usually
   automatically generated by MILPDS upon a projected action such as PCS, retirement, or
34                                                        AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


  separation; therefore, supervisors do not normally need to request a DECOR6 upon a
  projected action. Request a DECOR6, in accordance with local requirements, and only for
  reasons outside the projected actions, through the unit/organization awards and decorations
  manager, MPS, or other locally established methods. (T-3).
  2.2.4. Carefully review and complete the Recommendation for Decoration Printout
  (RRDER6/DECOR6) RIP or other similarly authorized document. The DECOR6 is the
  primary document required with each decoration recommendation or non-recommendation.
  It provides general, but critical, personnel information to, among other things, reach a
  decision to recommend or non-recommend a member for a decoration and serves as an
  official document for personnel decisions, evaluations, and actions. (T-3).
  2.2.5. Decide to recommend or non-recommend a decoration. If the decision is to non-
  recommend, circle “Do not” at item 8 of the DECOR6 RIP, sign and date it, obtain the
  squadron commander’s signature and date, and return it to the appropriate office prior to the
  suspense in the heading paragraph of the DECOR6. This ends the non-recommendation
  process; no further action is required. If the decision is to recommend, at a minimum,
  complete items 1. A, B, C, D, E, F (G and H and item 2 if applicable), circle “I recommend”
  at item 8 and sign and date the RIP. Obtain and follow local requirements to prepare the
  decoration justification, citation, certificate, or combined certificate/citation, endorsement
  letters, etc., and other documents that comprise a decoration recommendation, and submit
  recommendation prior to the suspense date. (T-3).
  2.2.6. Submit a DECOR6 RIP for each member being recommended, even if all are being
  recommended for the same decoration and/or for the same act, achievement, or service. (T-
  3).
  2.2.7. Process recommendation packages for decorations submitted on members, or on a
  group of individuals from various organizations, to recognize a single act, project,
  accomplishment, service, or outstanding achievement through the project or operational
  commander’s chain of command. Obtain concurrence from the member’s commander prior
  to submitting the recommendation to ensure no dual recognition. (T-3).
  2.2.8. Prepare a decoration recommendation for deployed members; deployed immediate
  supervisor submits a recommendation for decoration through the operational commander’s
  established channels. In the absence of established channels, a deployed immediate
  supervisor may recommend a member(s) through the member’s home station commander.
  (T-3).
  2.2.9. Prepare a decoration recommendation in chronological sequence to recognize the
  order in which the act, service, or achievement was performed. Supervisors must be
  especially careful to ensure the proper sequences of decorations are based on service
  performed. Note: Only during war, conflict, or intense operational conditions, which can
  often delay the processing of decorations, would the chronological sequence be out of order
  when finalizing decorations. (T-3).
  2.2.10. Reconsidered Decorations: For disapproved or downgraded recommendations,
  initiate a request within 1 year of the date the decoration was disapproved or downgraded for
  reconsideration through the same official channels that the original recommendation for
  decoration was processed. The justification for reconsideration must be in memorandum or
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  35


   letter format, not to exceed one page, or any other format determined by the authority that
   disapproved or downgraded the decoration. Include a copy of the documents used in the
   original recommendation for decoration, to include all endorsements and previous decisions.
   This process must be initiated by the recommending official of the original decoration
   submission. A one-time reconsideration by the approval authority is final. (T-3).
   2.2.11. Withdrawing Decoration Recommendations: Submit a memorandum or letter with
   justification through the chain of command to the approval authority requesting to withdraw
   recommendations already in official channels.         Intermediate endorsing officials or
   commanders must forward these recommendations and provide a recommendation to
   approve or disapprove request. (T-3).
   2.2.12. Do not include any classified, highly sensitive, or special category information
   requiring special handling procedures in recommendations for decorations. Declassify
   information prior to preparing decoration justification and/or related recommendation for
   decoration documents. (T-3).
   2.2.13. If no approval/disapproval decision has been made by the approval authority due to
   the recommendation being lost, not processed, or not acted on due to an administrative-type
   error, decide the appropriate decoration action within the prescribed time limits. Submit the
   recommendation for decoration through the original chain of command that existed during
   the act, achievement, or service. When original organizations/commands no longer exist,
   process the recommendation through the replacement organizations/commands or next level
   of command. (T-3).
   2.2.14. Consider a recommendation for decoration “for official use only” until the
   approval/disapproval authority announces its final decision. (T-3).
2.3. First Sergeant: As a principle advisor to the commander on enlisted issues, the first
sergeant can provide individual quality force indicators for sound decision-making. The first
sergeant is a formal part of the recommendation for decoration process. In the decoration
recommendation process, the first sergeant acts as an advisor (cannot officially recommend/non-
recommend, unless acting as an immediate supervisor) to the squadron commander to help
ensure appropriate recognition to truly deserving personnel. (T-3).
   2.3.1. Reviews recommendations for decorations on enlisted personnel only. The first
   sergeant, or in their absence, a senior noncommissioned officer designated either verbally or
   in writing by the squadron commander, reviews a recommendation for decoration and
   advises the commander on quality force indicators which warrant consideration before the
   commander’s decision to endorse recommendation or make a recommendation to approve,
   disapprove, upgrade, or downgrade. (T-3).
   2.3.2. Sign and date the DECOR6 at item 8. Once the first sergeant reviews the
   recommendation for decoration and advises the commander, they print or type “first sergeant
   reviewed”, the date reviewed, and signs the DECOR6 RIP at item 8 under the supervisor’s
   signature. (T-3).
   2.3.3. Consider a recommendation for decoration “for official use only” until the
   approval/disapproval authority announces its final decision. (T-3).

2.4. Squadron Commander: The squadron commander, or other immediate chain of command
official equivalent to a squadron commander, reviews the entire recommendation and decides to
recommend or non-recommend. If required, the leadership (commander) of a unit, squadron, or
other level of organization determines which member(s) is/are equivalent to a squadron
commander. (T-3).
   2.4.1. Decide to recommend or non-recommend a decoration. This is normally the
   recommending official for the unit/squadron. If the decision is to recommend, at a minimum,
   signs and dates at item 8 of the DECOR6 RIP before forwarding to the next level of
   command. Return decoration recommendations back to the immediate supervisor for
   administrative correction or for more supporting data if needed, prior to signing and dating
   the DECOR6 RIP. If desired, a memorandum to the next level of command or higher
   authority requesting approval, disapproval, upgrade, or downgrade may be provided. In the
   absence of a memorandum, the squadron commander’s signature indicates a recommendation
   to approve. If the decision is to concur with the immediate supervisor’s recommendation to
   non-recommend, sign and date the DECOR6 RIP and return it to the MPS; no further
   endorsements/actions are required. (T-3).
       2.4.1.1. The unit may still submit a member who has retired or separated from military
       service for a decoration recommendation, if initiated within 2-years of the effective
       retirement or separation date. This recommendation must be processed and submitted
       through the member’s chain of command to the appropriate MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for
       approval, disapproval or endorsement, to the SAFPC for decision. A letter of explanation
       signed by the recommending official (i.e., Wing commander (CC) or equivalent) and
       endorsed by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU CC must accompany the decoration
       recommendation explaining why the recommendation was not submitted in a timely
       manner. Approval and disapproval of decorations submitted within the 2-year time limit
       rests with the approval authorities listed in Table 2.1 (T-2).
       2.4.1.2. All other decoration recommendations for veterans retired or separated more
       than 2 years past their effective retirement or separation date must adhere to the
       guidelines outlined in Chapter 10, Veteran Applications for Awards and Decorations, and
       the decoration recommendation must be submitted to the Service Branch through a
       member of the US Congress. (T-3).
   2.4.2. The squadron commander, and if necessary, with higher level unit/organizational
   chain of command involvement, resolves any disagreements such as whether or not to
   recommend a decoration or the type of decoration to be recommended. (T-3).
   2.4.3. Sign and date the DECOR6 to endorse the recommendation. The recommendation for
   a decoration is considered placed in official channels when the recommending official
   (typically the immediate supervisor) signs and dates the DECOR6 and a higher official
   (squadron commander or other immediate chain of command official equivalent to a
   squadron commander) in the chain of command endorses and dates it. Once this is done, the
   recommendation is in official channels and must continue through the normal chain of
   command of the member being recommended (unless local, higher command or other
   commands direct otherwise) to the appropriate approval or disapproval authority for the level
   of decoration recommended. The commander, vice commander, or other intermediate
   endorsing official at each organizational level in the chain of command, before forwarding to
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   37


   the next level, must review the recommendation and provide a signed endorsement to the
   approval or disapproval authority recommending approval, disapproval, upgrade, or
   downgrade of the decoration. The approval or disapproval authority has to render a final
   decision on the decoration recommendation. (T-3).
   2.4.4. Reconsidered Decorations: Consider and evaluate requests, submitted within 1 year
   of date decoration disapproved or downgraded, for one-time reconsideration of the
   disapproval or downgrade by higher levels of command and provide a signed
   recommendation, to the next level of command or higher authority, to approve or disapprove
   the request. The 1-year requirement to request reconsideration is based on DoD and Air
   Force policies and is subject to the discretion by the approval authority. (T-3).
   2.4.5. Withdrawing Decoration Recommendations: Forward requests to withdraw a
   recommendation for a decoration already in official channels and provide a written
   recommendation to approve/disapprove the request. (T-3).
   2.4.6. Consider a recommendation for a decoration “for official use only” until the
   approval/disapproval authority announces its final decision. (T-3).
   2.4.7. Present approved decorations in a ceremony at the earliest possible date after
   receiving the decoration elements and support the Air Force “Pin ‘Em Where You Win ‘Em”
   concept/policy which highly recommends and expects timely approval and presentation of
   decorations to personnel prior to departing the organization. Commanders at other levels of
   command may elect to present decorations to personnel at appropriate and dignified
   ceremonies. The commander or other “host” or presentation officer should be senior in rank
   or position to the highest ranking member being decorated. For more guidance on
   presentation ceremonies, refer to the local Protocol office. Decoration ceremonies may range
   from formal reviews to commander’s calls to small informal office ceremonies. The most
   common venue for decoration presentation ceremonies is the commander’s call.
   Nonetheless, it is a responsibility of command to present decorations in a ceremony at the
   earliest possible date. If the decoration is a subsequent (OLC) decoration, present decoration
   elements in the Air Force binder, but retrieve the binder and provide the recipient a new and
   highly professional quality pocket folder. Use the binder to present all decorations to next-
   of-kin and do not retrieve the binder. (T-3).
2.5. Group Commander. Group Commander, Group Commander’s Deputy, Acting Group
Commander, Civilian leaders in Group Commander positions or other individuals with group
equivalent status/authority (if required, the next organizational level Commander of the
organization determines which individual(s) is/are equivalent to a group commander), review the
entire recommendation and, if authority exists, makes a decision to approve, disapprove,
downgrade, or upgrade a decoration. (T-3).
   2.5.1. Approved decorations: Comply with actions of approval authorities at paragraph 2.8
   (T-3).
   2.5.2. Disapproved decorations: Announce the decision in writing and inform the
   recommending officials (immediate supervisor and squadron commander). The immediate
   supervisor (original recommending official), through the squadron commander, may request
   a one-time reconsideration of a disapproved decoration by providing significant additional
 38                                                        AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   justification. The disapproval authority determines the type of additional justification and
   format. (T-3).
   2.5.3. Downgraded decorations: Comply with actions of approval authorities at paragraph
   2.8. The immediate supervisor (original recommending official), through the squadron
   commander, may request a one-time reconsideration of a downgraded decoration by
   providing significant additional justification. The downgrade authority determines the type
   of additional justification and format. (T-3).
   2.5.4. Upgraded decorations: Comply with actions of approval authorities at paragraph 2.8
   (T-3).
   2.5.5. Make recommendations to next level of command. If no authority to approve,
   disapprove, downgrade, or upgrade a decoration exists, provide a signed recommendation to
   the next level of command or higher authority, to approve, disapprove, downgrade, or
   upgrade the decoration. (T-3).
   2.5.6. Reconsidered Decorations: Evaluate and decide on requests submitted within 1 year
   of the date the decoration was disapproved or downgraded for a one-time reconsideration of
   decorations disapproved or downgraded at their level, or provide a signed recommendation to
   the next level of command or higher authority to approve or disapprove the request. The
   decision rendered at this point is final. The 1 year requirement to request reconsideration is
   based on DoD and Air Force policies and is subject to the discretion of the approval
   authority. (T-3).
   2.5.7. Return decoration recommendations, prior to decision, back to subordinate
   organizations for administrative correction or additional supporting data.              These
   recommendations have not been removed from official channels; therefore ensure return
   without delay for further or final action by the approval/disapproval authority. (T-3).
   2.5.8. Consider resubmitted recommendations for decorations that were placed into official
   channels within the prescribed time limits where no decision was made by the approval/
   disapproval authority because the recommendation was lost, was not processed, or was not
   acted on due to an administrative type error. Consideration by the approval or disapproval
   authority is contingent on the presentation, by the recommendation official(s), of credible
   evidence that the recommendation was officially placed in military channels or submitted but
   not acted on through loss or inadvertence. Credible evidence may be signed and dated copies
   of the DECOR6, decoration justification, chain of command endorsements, and any other
   related documents. (T-3).
   2.5.9. Withdrawing Decoration Recommendations: Decide to honor a request to withdraw a
   recommendation for decoration for which approval, disapproval, upgrade, or downgrade
   authority exists or forward the request for decorations already in official channels and
   provides a recommendation to approve or disapprove request. (T-3).
   2.5.10. Consider a recommendation for decoration “for official use only” until the
   approval/disapproval authority announces its final decision. (T-3).
2.6. Wing Commander: Wing Commander, Wing Commander’s Deputy, Acting Wing
Commander, Civilian leaders or other individuals with wing equivalent status/authority (if
required, the MAJCOM Commander of the organization determines which individual(s) is/are
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   39

   justification. The disapproval authority determines the type of additional justification and
   format. (T-3).
   2.6.3. Downgraded decorations: Comply with actions of approval authorities at paragraph
   2.8. The original recommending official (i.e., normally the squadron commander), may

   additional justification. The downgrade authority determines the type of additional
   justification and format. (T-3).
   2.6.4. Upgraded decorations: Comply with actions of approval authorities at paragraph 2.8
   (T-3).
   2.6.5. Provide a signed recommendation to the next level of command or higher authority to

   at this point is final. The 1 year requirement to request reconsideration is based on DoD and
   Air Force policies and is subject to the discretion of the approval authority. (T-3).
   2.6.7. Consider resubmitted recommendations for decorations that were placed into official
   channels within the prescribed time limits, but no approval/disapproval decision was made
   by the approval or disapproval authority because the recommendation was lost, not
   processed, or not acted on due to an administrative type error. Consideration by the approval
   or disapproval authority is contingent on the presentation, by the recommendation official(s),
   of credible evidence that the recommendation was officially placed in military channels or
   was submitted, but not acted on through loss or inadvertence. Credible evidence may be
   signed and dated copies of the DECOR6, decoration justification, chain of command

   2.6.10. Consider a recommendation for decoration “for official use only” until the
   approval/disapproval authority announces its final decision. (T-3).
2.7. Air Force Higher Commands (MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, Air Staff, etc. ): Approval
authorities at these levels of command review the entire recommendation and, if authority exists,

   approval authority.
   2.7.8. Consider resubmitted recommendations for decorations that were placed into official
   channels within the prescribed time limits, but no approval/disapproval decision was made
   by the approval or disapproval authority because the recommendation was lost, not
   processed, or not acted on due to an administrative type error. Consideration by the approval

2.8. Initiating a Recommendation. Submit recommendations as soon as possible following the
act, achievement, or service. Enter each recommendation (except the PH) into official channels
within 2 years and award within 3 years of the act, achievement, or service performed.
Note: A recommendation is placed in official channels when the recommending official signs
the recommendation (DECOR6 and justification) and a higher official in the decoration chain of
command endorses it. This policy will be strictly enforced. It is up to the member and
recommending official to ensure a decoration submission is placed into official channels.
   2.8.1. Decoration recommendations that were placed into official channels within the
   prescribed time limits, but no award was made due to the original recommendation being
   lost, not processed, or acted upon due to administrative error may be considered for
   resubmission through the original decoration channels. Reconsideration is contingent on the
   presentation of credible evidence the recommendation was officially placed in military
   channels or was submitted, but not acted on through loss or inadvertence. Process the
   recommendation following the original channels. Note: When organizations no longer
   exist, process the recommendation through the replacement organizations.
2.9. Preparing a Recommendation. All decoration recommendations should be considered
“for official use only” until the awarding authority announces its final decision. Do not include
any classified, highly sensitive, or special category information requiring special handling
procedures in regular decoration recommendations. Decoration recommendations submitted to
the approval authority must include the following items:
   2.9.1. Recommendation for Decoration Printout (RDP-DECOR6). A printout requested
   from MILPDS that provides the current decoration and duty history of the member being
   recommended for the decoration. The DECOR6 should produce automatically for decoration
   recommendations resulting in personnel actions such as PCS, Retirement and Separations.
   All other decoration recommendations result in the DECOR6 being requested through your
   personnel office. Each DECOR6 carries the suspense for decoration action and must be
   adhered to avoid late processing. For submission into official channels the DECOR6 must be
   signed by the recommending official and annotated that a recommendation will be submitted
   from the unit/organization and included with the decoration recommendation.
42                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


     2.9.1.1. A memorandum or letter format must be accomplished on decoration
     recommendations for foreign military, separated and retired veterans, or a member of
     another US Service Branch (i.e., manual DECOR6). Units/Organizations not having
     MILPDS access must contact their MAJCOM/Air Staff office for permission to utilize a
     manual DECOR6. The manual DECOR6 must contain all of the pertinent data as a
     MILPDS-processed DECOR6.
  2.9.2. Descriptive Justification. Fully justify all award recommendations to avoid the
  perception that decorations are automatic. Avoid generalities, broad or vague terminology,
  superlative adjectives or a recapitulation of duties performed. The justification must provide
  concrete examples of exactly what the person did, how well he/she performed the action,
  what impact/benefit did it result in, and how the person significantly exceeded duty
  performance. The following formats must be utilized:
     2.9.2.1. Prepare decorations for the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) and below on
     bond paper. The justification must be signed by the recommending official, utilizing the
     appropriate signature block.
     2.9.2.2. Copies of performance reports (i.e., EPRs/OPRs) covering the award period are
     mandatory to justify all decoration recommendations for the MSM and below.
     2.9.2.3. Prepare other USAF decoration justification as a narrative using a blocked,
     paragraphed, or talking paper format (bullet). Limit DSM justification to three pages. A
     narrative justification is optional for retirement conditions for all grades for General
     Officers. Limit LOM and lesser USAF decoration justification to one page. Justification
     must be signed, utilizing the appropriate signature block.
  2.9.3. Citations must be completed in accordance with Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.4, 3.5, and
  Figure 3.1.
     2.9.3.1. Stratification statements are not authorized or permitted within the text of any
     USAF citation. Example: While deployed to Camp Victory, Iraq, for a 365-day
     deployment, the Director of Personnel stated, “Major Garcia is the number one personnel
     officer at Camp Victory, Iraq.”
  2.9.4. Additional Attachments. A recommendation may include supporting documentation,
  if the person initiating the recommendation does not have firsthand knowledge of the act or
  service performed, or official supporting records.
     2.9.4.1. To be reasonably considered for valor awards, it is important that any available
     eyewitness statements attesting to the act(s), sworn affidavits, be included in the package.
     As a general rule, corroborating evidence is best provided by investigation files, former
     commanders, supervisors, and fellow comrades who had personal knowledge of the
     circumstances and events relative to the recommendation. Other forms of supporting
     documents may be extracts from official records; sketches; maps; diagrams; photographs;
     and so forth, which support and amplify stated facts for the heroism award.
     2.9.4.2. Attach a copy of the citation for outstanding achievement to the recommendation
     when a decoration based on outstanding achievement was awarded during the period for
     service being recognized by a meritorious service recommendation.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 43


2.10. Processing a Recommendation. Forward all recommendations through the normal chain
of command of the person being recommended. A decoration is not considered to be submitted
into official channels until the DECOR6 is signed by the recommending official, normally, the
unit commander. The commander/vice commander at each headquarters designed to review
recommendations must personally review and sign the forwarding endorsement for each. Each
intermediate commander must recommend approval or disapproval of the recommendation, or
recommend award of a higher/lesser decoration:
   2.10.1. Forward recommendations placed in official channels to the designated
   approval/disapproval authority for final action regardless of whether intermediate endorsing
   officials or commanders determine the award does not meet the criteria. Note: For
   decorations requiring SAFPC decision, the recommending official is considered to be the
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU CC. These nominations should be submitted no later than 60-days
   prior to the desired presentation date. Should this recommending official determine the
   decoration does not meet eligibility criteria, the decoration recommendation is not endorsed
   and the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU CC may disapprove the recommendation, or approve award of
   a lesser decoration.
   2.10.2. Process recommendations submitted on members or on a group of members from
   various organizations to recognize a single act or outstanding achievement through the
   project or operation commander’s chain of command. Obtain concurrence from each
   member’s home station commander prior to submitting the recommendation. For memberss
   of other US Service Branches (sister Services), obtain their Service’s concurrence prior to
   submitting the recommendation.
   2.10.3. Forward recommendations requiring SAFPC decision through the chain of command
   to AFPC/DPSIDR. If mailing, send the original and one copy of the DECOR6, narrative,
   endorsement correspondence, and original citation with six additional copies with the SSN.
   If the recommendation is classified, send the unclassified portion to AFPC/DPSIDR and have
   the classified portion forwarded under separate cover directly to SAFPC. Recommendations
   for USAF decorations from joint or unified commands must be forwarded to the Air Force
   District of Washington (AFDW/A1), unless administrative control (ADCON) responsibilities
   have been assigned. In this case, the ADCON unit will process the recommendation.
   2.10.4. Forward recommendations of USAF decorations for MAJCOM CCs to the Office of
   the USAF CSAF for endorsement, and signature of the DECOR6. This can be coordinated
   and routed between the MAJCOM/A1 and the CSAF’s office by e-SSS to Headquarters Air
   Force Executive Services (HAF/ES). Upon receipt of signature from the CSAF, forward the
   decoration recommendation to AFPC/DPSIDR for decoration processing and decision.
   2.10.5. Forward recommendations of USAF decorations for other US Service members to
   the USAF commander who exercises awarding authority as if the member were in the USAF.
   This is known as a sister service concurrence.
       2.10.5.1. If other US service members permanently assigned to an USAF
       unit/organization is recommended for an USAF decoration, the USAF decoration can be
       approved by the USAF approval authority without a sister service concurrence if the
       recommendation is for the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) and below (to include the
       PH). Decorations above the precedence of the MSM (excluding the PH), must still be
       routed through the member’s US Service Branch for concurrence. Should the US service
44                                                       AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


     member not be permanently assigned to the USAF unit/organization, written concurrence
     must be obtained from the member’s US Service Branch.
     2.10.5.2. USAF airmen permanently assigned to other US Service Branch
     units/organizations require no written concurrence from the USAF if the decoration is for
     the MSM or below; however, a copy of the final decoration elements are required to be
     sent to AFPC/DPSIDR for update to the USAF airman’s personnel record. Any US
     Service Branch decoration recommendation above the MSM (excluding the PH), must be
     forwarded to AFPC/DPSIDR for sister service concurrence. All USAF airmen not
     permanently assigned to another US Service Branch’s unit/organization and
     recommended for a Service decoration must obtain written concurrence from the USAF
     (i.e., Airman’s awarding authority at home station) prior to decoration approval.
  2.10.6. On 21 May 2003, the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) delegated approval
  authority to MAJCOM CCs and Air Force Component Commanders (i.e., USAFCENT) for
  the MSM, the Air Force Commendation Medal (AFCM), and the Air Force Achievement
  Medal (AFAM) to foreign military personnel in grades equivalent to O-6 and below.
  Approval of these decorations to foreign military members is delegated to MAJCOM CCs
  during wartime and peacetime, while delegation to Commander Air Force Forces
  (COMAFFOR) solely for actions during approved wartime situations in which an USAF
  component command will be stood up for operational control. Additionally, COMAFFOR
  has approval authority for the BSM for valorous acts and meritorious service in direct
  support of combat operations.
  2.10.7. Process decorations for centrally-managed Reservists (those assigned to the
  Chaplain, Medical, Legal, AFOSI, or Intelligence career fields) to approval/disapproval
  authority at the local level (the same as active duty personnel) using the award approving
  authority of the unit of attachment. Decoration recommendations for individual Reservists
  will be processed to the award authority for consideration as outlined in Table 2.2.
  2.10.8. Reviewing officials at any level may return recommendations for administrative
  correction or for more supporting data. Do not consider these recommendations as having
  been removed from official channels, but return them without delay to the reviewing or
  awarding authority.
  2.10.9. Withdrawal Procedures:        Recommending officials who wish to withdraw
  recommendations already in official channels must send a memorandum or letter through the
  chain of command to the awarding authority requesting disapproval, with reasons.
  Intermediate endorsing officials or commanders must forward these recommendations. Their
  endorsement must recommend approval/disapproval to the awarding authority.
  2.10.10. Reconsideration Procedures: Forward requests for reconsidering disapproved/
  downgraded recommendations through the same official channels as the original
  recommendation. The justification for reconsideration must be in memorandum or letter
  format, not to exceed one page signed by the original recommending official. Attach a copy
  of the original recommendation with all endorsements and new citation. Submit request into
  official channels within 1 year of the date of the awarding authority’s decision. A one-time
  reconsideration by the awarding authority is final.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      45


   2.10.11. Appeal Process for the DSM and LOM. There may be rare instances in which the
   submitting official believes the nomination warrants further review. In these cases, the
   senior USAF commander/civilian leader (CC/CL) in the chain of command forwards a
   written request to AFPC/DPSIDR, no later than 10 working days before the desired
   presentation date. Appeal packages must be placed in official channels no later than one year
   from the date the decoration was disapproved. The decision of the SAF/MR is final and not
   subject to further review. The appeal package must include: The original decoration
   submission with all attachments, revised decoration submission with all attachments, and a
   memorandum from nominating authority detailing specific justification as to why the appeal
   should be granted. The senior AF CC/CL in the chain of command is required to ensure
   packages contain the necessary documentation and forwarded via e-mail to AFPC/DPSIDR
   for SAF/MR decision. Final decision will be provided to the airman’s senior AF CC/CL. If
   approved, the AFPC/DPSIDR will issue the decoration elements.
2.11. Decoration Approval Authorities: Decoration approval authorities are commanders
(officers or CLs in assumed or appointed command positions) in levels of command/position
(group, wing, NAF, MAJCOM, FOAs/DRUs, Headquarters Air Force (HAF) offices, etc.,) that
have been authorized decoration approval authority by Table 2.1, or in writing by delegated
decoration approval authority from a higher command such as the SECAF, MAJCOM, NAF, or
other office in their chain of command. Approval authorities may not be further delegated unless
stipulated in Table 2.1, messages, or PSDMs. Air Force commanders abide by DoD policy
when authorized to approve DoD decorations and abide by Air Force policy when authorized to
approve Air Force decorations. Unless an approval authority level stipulates a rank, approval
authority exists if an officer, regardless of rank, assumes or is appointed to a position by written
orders. Decoration approval authority is not based on “senior rater” ID (the term only applies to
evaluations/promotions) or other status or factor, but on an officer or official filling a position
(and possessing a rank if identified in Table 2.1) with decoration approval authority. To
determine decoration approval authority for Reserve personnel, refer to Table 2.2. Decoration
approval authorities are responsible to comply with the responsibilities prescribed in this
Instruction.
   2.11.1. Decoration Approving Authorities of Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
   To ensure consistency of decorations arising from combat operations, the NAF and JTF/CTF
   Air Force component commanders shall forward, in a timely manner, all recommendations
   for decorations arising out of combat operations not within their authority to approve, to the
   MAJCOM/CC serving at the Air Component CC to the supported Combatant Command (or
   in the absence of such an officer, to a lieutenant general or general designated by CSAF for
   this purpose). To ensure timely recognition and accurate substantiation, nominating officials
   should submit award nominations within 45 days of the flight or event that supports the
   award. In the case of hostilities of limited duration, the NAF or JTF/CTF AF component
   commanders should have all recommendation submitted within 90 days after the cessation of
   hostilities. The MAJCOM commander or CSAF designee will consolidate decoration
   recommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force component commanders. To the
   extent feasible, they should be evaluated only after they have been aggregated, but the
   benefits of aggregation (and associated delays) should be balanced against the goal of timely
   recognizing the members’ accomplishments. If there is a singular, distinctive event, or other
   unusual factors that support expediting an award, that award should be processed without
 46                                                          AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   aggregation and the nomination package should include an explanation of the reason for
   expedited processing. After review, the MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will
   forward those recommendations that he or she finds meet the criteria for awards to be
   approved above the MAJCOM level, to the SAFPC Decorations Board.
       2.11.1.1. As long as submissions meet the timeliness requirements established by law or
       DoD guidance, proper and substantiated award recommendations will not be disapproved
       (or foregone) on the basis that they did not comply with the time goals discussed above.
   2.11.2. Refer to Table 2.1 to determine the level of decoration approval authority. The
   approval authority will approve or recommend approval of those awards he or she determines
   meet the award criteria and are fully substantiated.
       2.11.2.1. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures: Should the approval authority
       find a nomination package does not meet the award criteria, or does not adequately
       substantiate the proposed award, the approval authority will downgrade the
       recommendation; or return the package to the recommending official with a written
       explanation of the perceived deficiency. The approval authority may also suggest other
       awards (i.e., upgrade or downgrade) he or she finds appropriate.
       2.11.2.2. At any point in the reconsideration process, the proposing MAJCOM may
       agree to the approval of a different or lesser award within the approval authority of the
       Director, SAFPC, or request the nomination package be withdrawn.
   2.11.3. Any 0-6 in the chain of command may disapprove a recommendation provided the 0-
   6 has approval authority for a lesser award.
2.12. Decoration Approval Authority General Responsibilities: Develop, implement, and
publicize to subordinate organizations using supplements to higher headquarters instructions (to
include Interim Change process) to communicate their particular decoration recommendation
processing channels, requirements, and procedures to process decorations. Determine format by
narrative/bullet justification, citation justification, or EPRs/OPRs will be used to justify
decorations. Process recommendations for decorations to next level of command or higher
authority; evaluate a recommendation, if authority exists, to approve, disapprove, downgrade, or
upgrade a decoration; maintain and dispose of documentation (recommendation documents such
as the original DECOR6, endorsement letters, and copies of the special order (if applicable),
citation, certificate, combined citation/certificate, decisions, board meeting minutes, and other
documents) related to a decoration recommendation; prepare, provide, correct, amend, revoke,
replace, recreate, duplicate, distribute, dispose of approved decoration elements (special order (if
applicable), citation, certificate, or combined citation/certificate), and replace, recreate, amend,
or correct respective decoration elements that were lost, damaged, destroyed, or erroneously
prepared. Aggressively strive to achieve the goals of the Air Force “Pin ‘Em Where You Win
‘Em” concept/policy, which attempts timely approval and presentation of decorations to
personnel prior to departing the organization. Note: For DSM and LOM, each approval
authority will provide an annual report to the SAFPC no later than 31 January to cover the
preceding calendar year. The report will include DSM and LOM nominations considered,
including name, grade, duty title, period of service, award citation (i.e. PCS, Retirement) and
disposition (i.e. approved, disapproved, downgraded or submitted as an ETP).”
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    47


2.13. Approving Decorations and Decoration Elements: Upon approving a decoration, the
approval authority prepares or delegates preparation of the decoration elements (special order (if
applicable), citation, certificate, or combined citation/certificate), distributes copies of the
elements, distributes the original decoration elements, and retains and disposes of decoration
recommendation records. Refer to paragraph 2.14.2 for amendment, revocation, and rescinding
instructions.
2.14. Preparing Decoration Elements (Special Order, Citation, Certificate, or Combined
Citation/Certificate):
   2.14.1. Special Order Processing: Effective 28 September 2007, awarding authorities are no
   longer required to process a separate special order to authenticate USAF decorations they
   approve. When enacted, this process caused some problems for some decorations, namely
   decorations requiring a separate-page citation when approved (i.e., the DSM to include valor
   decorations (i.e., MOH, AFC, SS, AmnM, BSM, and DFC). To rectify this process, all
   decorations requiring a separate-page citation will require a separate-page special order
   adding the citation to the special order (see Figure 2.2).
       2.14.1.1. If applicable, decoration approval authorities at designated approval levels are
       authorized and responsible to properly publish, prepare, reproduce, distribute, maintain,
       and retire all orders they publish. To relieve the decoration approval authority from
       signing decoration special orders, the approval authority may (verbally or in writing)
       designate an officer, a noncommissioned officer in the grade of E-5 or above or GS-5 or
       above to publish orders in accordance with this instruction and AFI 33-328,
       Administrative Orders. Publish a “G” series special order to approve a decoration
       starting with “1” for each fiscal year (Example: G-0001, G-0002, G-0003, etc.). Refer to
       and understand AFI 33-328 for guidance on paper size, margins, numbering, multiple
       page orders, required wording on the first order of the fiscal year and use the guidance in
       this instruction to prepare decoration special orders. Decoration special orders are most
       often created in a composed form; simply meaning that an individual inputs required data
       onto the order. Some organizations, however, may have automated this process and can
       produce a computer-generated order. Decorations recognize a completed period of
       service, an act, or achievement marked by a time period, date of action, or service period.
       The effective date of decorations is the closing date (last day of period recognized, or
       date of action or act) of the time period, date of action, or service period recognized,
       regardless of the order date or date the combined citation/certificate or individual
       certificate was signed or dated by the approval authority.
       2.14.1.2. For High-Level Decorations: The decorations associated with this process are
       decorations approved for gallantry or heroism, and may be considered for an additional
       10% for retirement pay purposes for enlisted personnel upon approval by the approval
       authority. The decorations are the Medal of Honor, the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star,
       the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, and the Airman’s Medal. The special order
       created for a decoration approved for gallantry or heroism for enlisted personnel should
       also include the following statement in the heading of the order:
“The approved member(s) for the award of the (name of the decoration approved for heroism)
has been considered and approved/disapproved for an additional 10% for retirement purposes
not to exceed 75%, in accordance by the decoration approval authority, the Secretary of the Air
 48                                                           AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


Force Personnel Council, and AFI 36-2803, paragraph 1.6.1. This decoration is effective upon
the date of service indicated. PAS:  .”
           2.14.1.2.1. Special orders typically consist of three parts: the heading, the body, and
           the close. Refer to AFI 33-328 for more specific information; however, as the
           instruction for the Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, information in this
           instruction dictates program responsibilities and requirements.
           2.14.1.2.2. Order Heading: the order heading identifies the decoration approval
           authority and provides detailed organizational address information. In the example at
           figure 2.2, US Air Forces Central (USAFCENT) is the administrative element for
           personnel in support of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM
           (OEF/OIF), thus, its address is provided. Decoration approval authorities typically
           provide their own organizational and address information in the heading. This
           information is used by personnel technicians, for among other things, to update the
           decoration into MILPDS and, if necessary, to refer discrepancies back to the
           decoration approval authority.          Decoration special orders, include the title
           “DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE”; the complete unit designation, the
           MAJCOM (abbreviated and in parentheses) to which the unit is assigned; the unit’s
           complete mailing address, the type series and number of order; and date the order was
           published (see figure 2.2.). Do not postdate or antedate orders. Above the heading of
           the first order of the year, identify the last order published of the previous year. For
           example: “Last Order Published in 2002 was SO G-56, Dated 22 Sep 02”).
           2.14.1.2.3. Order Body: The order body identifies the decoration authority, approval
           authority, and individual data essential to personnel matters. Create a heading
           paragraph that identifies the decoration authority, approval authority, the decoration
           type, and effective date (see Table 2.3). If appropriate, identify if the decoration is
           approved posthumously or with valor. Write a separate paragraph for each decoration
           and number paragraphs when using more than one. Below the paragraph, create data
           columns and list the decoration recipient’s rank, last name, first name, middle initial,
           last four of member’s SSN (for multiple-person orders) or full SSN (for single-person
           orders), period of service recognized or date of act/action, oak leaf cluster of the
           decoration, condition code, the date the Recommendation for Decoration Printout
           (RDP; also known as the DECOR6) was computer generated (for enlisted only), and
           the personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code.
               2.14.1.2.3.1. Members of the other branches of the Armed Forces and Foreign
               military personnel: Identify members of other branches of the Armed Forces and
               foreign military personnel on special orders as follows:
Sister Service: CPT HESS, MARK R. (US ARMY)

Foreign Military: SQ LEADER FEARS, JAMES W. (ROYAL AIR FORCE)

Include the following information: Recipient’s grade, rank, last name, first name, middle initial,
branch of service or foreign service, last four or full SSN (if multiple-person or single-person
orders, respectively) or either a service number or other official identification number for foreign
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     49


military members, period of service or date of act/action recognized, oak leaf cluster of the
decoration (if applicable), condition code, and personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code.
           2.14.1.2.4. Order Close: The order close contains the decoration approval authority’s
           signature block and signature, or the orders publishing official (E-5 or above, officer,
           or GS-5 or above) signature block and signature or official stamp, the authority line,
           and orders distribution. Decoration approval authorities may choose to use their
           signature block and signature on orders (when this option is used, no authority line is
           required); however, to relieve the decoration approval authority from signing
           decoration special orders, the approval authority may designate in writing a
           noncommissioned officer (E-5 or above), an officer, or a GS-5 or above, to act as an
           order publishing official. The signature block and signature or official stamp of the
           orders publishing official is authorized in place of the decoration approval authority’s
           signature block and signature (when exercising this option, an authority line is
           required (refer to AFI 33-328, Table 2.3., for authorized authority lines). Distribution
           of orders is made as shown in example 2.14.4.; however, the decoration approval
           authority may add to the distribution shown by establishing other specific order
           distribution requirements.
           2.14.1.2.5. Computer-generated orders may be used, and vary in format from the
           example at Figure 2.2, as long as they conform to AFI 33-328 requirements and
           include all required data as shown in Figure 2.2. No seal or signature is needed on
           the computer-generated orders; instead, place the word “OFFICIAL” above the
           signature element. The decoration approval authority determines which special
           orders format is used. The decoration approval authority higher headquarters may
           dictate format requirements or assist the approval authority in determining if special
           orders comply with this instruction and AFI 33-328.
       2.14.1.3. For All Other Decorations: Effective 28 September 2007, decoration approval
       authorities do not use a separate special order to authenticate, reproduce, distribute,
       maintain, and retire all orders they publish. The following information is now required to
       be placed at the bottom of the decoration certificate for all other decorations not
       mentioned in paragraph 2.14.1.1 above: Special Order Number, Recommendation for
       Decoration Printout (RDP) DECOR6 Date, Decoration Condition, PAS Code, and Social
       Security Number (SSAN)—on the record copies only. Examples of these decorations
       can be found in Figure 2.3. of this AFI.
   2.14.2. Amendments, Revocations, and Rescissions: Amendments, revocations, and
   rescissions allow approval authorities the ability to affect a change to data on special orders
   or remove the order totally or in part and are distributed as the original order and filed with
   the original order. The two most common actions to decoration orders are the amendment
   and revocation, both of which are used to affect change to the “order body” individual data
   information. Corrections or changes to the order heading and order close parts of the order
   are done by publishing corrected copies of the order (See Order Correct Copies below), or
   decoration certificate annotating the corrected change(s). Decoration approval authorities
   who published an original order are the only ones authorized to amend, revoke, or rescind an
   order; however, in unique cases, approval authorities or commanders of other commands,
   installations, or units, may be authorized by AFPC to publish, amend, rescind, or revoke
   decoration orders published by other commands or approval authorities. To amend, approval
50                                                       AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


  authorities may use the AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for Change of
  Administrative Orders, paragraph form (see examples below), or for combined
  certificate/special order see paragraph 2.14.2.6 below. To revoke or rescind a decoration
  order, approval authorities may use the AF Form 973, or paragraph form (see examples
  below).
     2.14.2.1. Situations in which this may be required are those arising from base closures or
     command mergers, redesignations, deactivations; however, typically, when an order
     publishing organization no longer exists, the next higher level of command is responsible
     for resolving awards and decorations matters. To find who has assumed administrative
     responsibility for the closed organization, contact the closed organization’s major
     command (MAJCOM).
     2.14.2.2. Amendments: An amendment “corrects” selective data on the order. Publish an
     amendment to correct the following data: first name, middle initial, last name (or any
     other element on the order of the member’s name), social security number (SSN), period
     of service, oak leaf cluster, condition code, DECOR6 (for enlisted only), or personnel
     accounting symbol (PAS) code. Do not publish an amendment to delete a member on an
     order. Instead, revoke in part so much of the original order that pertains to that member.
     When using the AF Form 973 to effect an amendment, follow the instructions in AFI 33-
     328. As an option to using the AF Form 973, the following paragraphs, or a variation of
     them, may be added to a decoration order or used by themselves in an order:
     So much of S.O. GA-070, dated 20 July 2001, ACC, as it pertains to the
     AIR MEDAL (BASIC) to MAJ DOE, JOHN J., is amended to read (1OLC).

     S.O. GA-044, dated 4 May 1998, ACC as it pertains to the AIR MEDAL
     (3OLC) to CAPT BROWN, JAMES W., is amended to read (4OLC).

     S.O. GA-029, dated 23 February 2001, 374th MSS/DPMPE, pertaining to
     CAPT MOSS, DANIEL P., is amended to read DANIEL L.
     2.14.2.3. Revocations: A revocation “removes” an item from an official document (the
     order). When an item or order is revoked, it no longer exists as an official item or
     document. Publish a revocation to remove a decoration for someone when the basis
     (reasons) for which it was approved no longer exists or didn’t consummate. For example,
     if a decoration was approved for someone retiring, separating, or PCSing, but the
     personnel action was cancelled, the decoration is revoked. Commanders may have other
     options to keep the decoration using a different condition (reason). When using AF 973
     to affect a revocation, follow the instructions in AFI 33-328 and adjust the example at
     figure 2.3. accordingly. As an option to using AF Form 973, the following paragraphs, or
     a variation of them, may be added to a decoration order or used separately in an order:
     So much of S.O. GA-070, dated 20 July 2001, ACC, as it pertains to the
     AIR MEDAL (BASIC) to MAJ DOE, JOHN J., is revoked IN PART.

     S.O. GA-044, dated 4 May 1998, ACC, as it pertains to the AIR MEDAL
     (3OLC) to CAPT BROWN, JAMES W., is revoked IN FULL.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   51


     2.14.2.4. Rescissions: A rescission “rescinds” or “takes back” an item on an order, but
     the order is still considered an official document. This type of action isn’t commonly
     used with decoration orders. An example of utilizing a rescission would be a special
     order that listed multiple members for a decoration and one of the members should be
     omitted.
     2.14.2.5. Order Corrected Copies. To correct an error in the heading or closing parts of a
     decoration order, publish a “Corrected Copy” of the order. Make a copy of the order,
     then make corrections to the heading or closing part of the order; then type “Corrected
     Copy – Destroy All Others” at the top of the corrected copy. Distribute the corrected
     copies the same as the original order and file the corrected copy on top of the original
     order. File a copy with each name attached.
     2.14.2.6. If amending information at the bottom of the combined decoration
     certificate/special order, ensure the following is included: special order number,
     amendment order number, condition code, Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code,
     and RDP date (if applicable). If desired, the reason for the amendment can be listed in
     parenthesis should space permit (i.e., “Amends 3 OLC to 4 OLC; Amends 1 January
     2007 to 1 February 2007, etc.). Reference figure 2.4. for example.
  2.14.3. Correcting Decoration Elements: Approval authorities correct decoration elements
  when discrepancies are identified and/or when special order amendments change information
  on the elements. For example, if a special order amendment changes the inclusive dates of a
  decoration, the approval authority that approved the decoration in question, corrects the
  elements (citation/certificate) to match the changes.           Decorations are awarded in
  chronological sequence and follow the order in which the act, service, or achievement was
  performed. Sometimes, for example, when operational or combat conditions prevent
  chronological and timely processing of decorations, the order sequence of decorations may
  be affected. The servicing MPS of the member affected by this type of situation is
  responsible to request correction, made by the approval authority of each affected decoration,
  of the chronological sequence of decorations and not when the order was published.
  Correction to a decoration of an active duty member is necessary if a decoration is approved
  and chronologically precedes another decoration of the same type. In this situation, the
  approval authority(s) of decorations chronologically displaced correct their decorations by
  amending their special order and correcting the citation/certificate, as applicable. Correction
  to a decoration, solely to create chronological sequence of a veteran’s (discharged/retired
  member) decoration(s), is not necessary. However, the veteran’s Report of Separation must
  reflect the correct number of decorations awarded.
     2.14.3.1. Citation: Currently, decorations such as the Bronze Star, Airman’s Medal,
     Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit, Silver Star, and Air Force Cross, consist of
     a citation on plain bond paper. Refer to figure 3.4. for instructions on how to prepare a
     citation and required opening and closing sentences. In the closing sentence of Air Force
     decorations awarded to Sister Service personnel, identify the Service component. For
     example, “reflects credit upon himself and the United States Army” or “reflects credit
     upon herself and the United States Navy”. See example of a citation at Figure 9.3.
     2.14.3.2. Certificate: Prepare a certificate for the PH, Bronze Star, Airman’s Medal,

2.15. Distribution of Decoration Elements: Distribute decoration elements as identified
below:
   2.15.1. Personnel at Unit: Present the medal and original decoration elements in an AF
   binder to the recipient at their present unit/location. Forward copies of the decoration
   elements marked, “for MILPDS update and filing in member’s personnel record” to their
   servicing MPS. (T-3).
   2.15.2. Personnel who have PCS’d or PCA’d: If the recipient of the decoration has PCS’d or
   PCA’d, and has departed the organization without being presented the decoration, forward
   the decoration elements to the member’s present or gaining servicing MPS. (T-3).
   2.15.3. Personnel Retiring/Separating: If the recipient of the decoration has retired or
   separated and has departed the organization without being presented the decoration, forward
   the decoration elements to the servicing MPS for updating, if possible, into MILPDS and
   filing a copy of the elements in the recipient’s military personnel record. The MPS locates
   the veteran to determine their presentation desires. If no presentation is desired, the MPS
   forwards the medal (or cluster) and original elements in an Air Force binder to the veteran. If
   presentation is desired, the MPS forwards the original elements to the nearest (AF, Reserve,
   or ANG) MPS for presentation to the recipient. (T-3).
   2.15.4. Deceased Personnel: If the recipient of a decoration is deceased, the recipient’s
   squadron commander, or other designated Air Force representative, determines the wishes
   and decoration presentation desires of the primary next-of-kin. Decorations approved after
   the recipient’s death is considered posthumous; however, a decoration approved (certificate
   signed/dated) prior to death that recognizes an act, achievement, or service prior to a
   recipient’s death is not considered posthumous. Decorations approved posthumously,
   including decorations approved but not presented prior to the recipient’s death, usually are
   not presented until an appropriate period of time lapses after the recipient’s interment,
   depending on circumstances and the next-of-kin’s bereavement. Decoration presentation
   ceremony officials read the citation and present the medal and original decoration elements
   in an Air Force binder to next-of-kin at the gravesite, funeral service, at a formal parade and
   ceremony, at an office ceremony in the commander’s office or other appropriate room or
 54                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   office in the headquarters or installation, or at an informal ceremony at the next-of-kin’s
   residence. The decoration may be pinned to the next-of-kin’s clothing or may be presented
   in the open decoration case. Next-of-kin are entitled to receive all decorations earned by the
   Air Force member but not presented prior to their death. Present awards or decorations to the
   primary next-of-kin. The primary next-of-kin in order of precedence of married personnel
   are: spouse, eldest child, parents, eldest brother, or eldest sister. For single personnel, the
   primary next-of-kin in order of precedence are parents, eldest brother, or eldest sister.
   Whether or not a decoration is presented to the primary next-of-kin of married deceased Air
   Force personnel, a duplicate set (an original set) of decoration elements is provided cost free
   to the parents. These elements may be presented to the parents during the presentation
   ceremony held for the primary next-of-kin, if mutually convenient and agreeable to all
   concerned, or may be delivered or mailed to the parents at a later date. A separate
   presentation ceremony is not held for presenting duplicate elements to the parents of married
   deceased Air Force personnel. Forward a copy of the special order, citation, and certificate,
   or combined citation/certificate, marked “For MILPDS update and filing in personnel
   record/ARMS” to the servicing MPS. Should the MPS no longer have MILPDS access to the
   Airman’s record, contact AFPC/DPSIDR for assistance. (T-3).
2.16. Decoration Recommendation Record Management and Disposition: Include
decorations in office files plan and retain and dispose of decoration recommendation and
approval records in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records. Maintain the
original DECOR6, special order, citation, certificate (or combined citation/certificate),
endorsement letters, decisions, board meeting minutes, and other documents related to a
recommendation for decoration for one year in active files and two years in inactive files before
transferring in accordance with AFMAN 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures and
Responsibilities. Maintain a copy of the original DECOR6, the citation, certificate (or combined
citation/certificate), endorsement/recommendation letters, and other related documents
forwarded to higher approval authorities or higher commands for one year in active files and two
years in inactive files before destroying. (T-3).
2.17. Special Procedures for Processing Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
   2.17.1. To ensure timely recognition and accurate substantiation, nominating officials should
   submit award nominations within 45 days of event that supports the award. In the case of
   hostilities of limited duration, the NAF or JTF/CTF Air Force component commanders
   should have all recommendations submitted within 90 days after the cessation of hostilities.
   The MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will consolidate decoration
   recommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force component commanders. To the
   extent feasible, they should be evaluated only after they have been aggregated, but the
   benefits of aggregation (and associated delays) should be balanced against the goal of timely
   recognizing members’ accomplishments. If there is a singular, distinctive event, or other
   unusual factors that support expediting an award, that award should be processed without
   aggregation and the nomination package should include an explanation of the reason for
   expedited processing. After review, the MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will
   approve recommendations that he or she finds meet the criteria; or forward those
   recommendations with their endorsement to SAFPC for decision. (T-3).
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     55


       2.17.1.1. Refer to Table 2.1 to determine the level of decoration approval authority. The
       approval authority will approve or recommend approval of those awards he or she
       determines meet the award criteria and are fully substantiated. (T-3).
       2.17.1.2. The Director, SAFPC, will approve or recommend approval of those awards he
       or she determines meet the award criteria and are fully substantiated.
       2.17.1.3. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures.           Should a decoration
       recommendation warrant one-time reconsideration to the decoration approval authority,
       additional justification should accompany the reconsideration and be routed through the
       original chain for decision. If the original recommendation required SAFPC decision,
       refer to paragraph 2.11.2.1. for guidance. All one-time reconsiderations by the approval
       authority are considered final.
       2.17.1.4. At any point in the recommendation process, the proposing recommending
       official may agree to submit a different award (i.e., upgrade or downgrade), or request the
       nomination package be withdrawn.
       2.17.1.5. The MPS will implement, and publicize local instruction or policy, and
       procedures to process decorations arising from combat operations when required. (T-3).

   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND US AIR FORCE MILITARY DECORATIONS

3.1. Definition. A DoD or US Air Force decoration intends to promptly and publicly recognize
an member for acts of valor, exceptional service or achievement, and acts of heroism not
involving actual combat.
   3.1.1. This section provides DoD criteria for Defense decorations. The prescribing directive
   for these decorations is DoDM 1348.33, Manual of Military Decorations & Awards.
   3.1.2. This section also outlines governing laws and prescribes SECAF policy on US Air
   Force decorations. Members are normally recommended for decorations at the conclusion of
   a completed period of service marked by a PCS, PCA, retirement, or separation. Other times
   at which members may be recommended for decorations are: upon qualifying under the
   Extended Tour provision, upon injury or death, or upon performing acts of achievement,
   heroism, or courage.
   3.1.3. To preserve the integrity of each US Air Force decoration, they are approved only to
   recognize acts or services that are clearly and distinctly outstanding by nature and magnitude.
   These acts or services must place a member’s performance clearly above that of their peers
   and be of such importance that they cannot be appropriately recognized in any other way.
   Unless otherwise specified, the word “decoration” in this instruction refers to a US or US Air
   Force decoration.
3.2. Department of Defense Decorations. The prescribing directive for the Defense
decorations is DoD 1348.33-M.
3.3. U.S. Air Force Decorations:

Notes:
1. The Air Force design of the MOH will be presented to all recipients who are awarded this
decoration on or after 1 November 1965. Original design Medals of Honor awarded before 1
November 1965 will remain in effect. They will not be replaced by the Air Force-design medal.
Replacements for MOH lost or destroyed, which were awarded before 1 November 1965, will be
of the original MOH design. Because of federal statutes, an award of the present MOH should
not be officially called or referred to as the “Air Force Medal of Honor.” It may be generally
referred to as “Medal of Honor—Air Force design,” or “the (new) Air Force-designed Medal of
 68                                                        AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


Honor.”
2. All recommendations must be processed through the chain of command to AFPC/DPSIDR
for processing to SAFPC for further processing. To prevent premature disclosure, the policy of
the DAF is not to comment on any MOH recommendation under consideration. Accordingly the
processing shall be handled as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO) basis until the award is
announced officially or presented.
3. Information concerning the presentation of the MOH Flag and associated entitlements for
MOH recipients are listed in Chapter 1, Paragraph 1.26. of this AFI.
4. While the MOH criteria include a requirement for the service member to risk his or her life,
there is NO requirement for the member to be wounded or killed in order to meet the “risk of
life” portion of the MOH award criteria.
5. The MOH may not be awarded to foreign military personnel.

Notes:
1. General Officer-level awards are not automatic or necessary upon every PCS/PCA.
2. Normally pinned-on general officer's serving as wing commanders are prohibited from
receiving the DSM, with the exception of retirement or extraordinary performance.
3. US military personnel. Restricted to a minimum of 24 months (time in position) in a general
officer position and 36 months (time in grade) as a general officer (including frocked time, if
applicable). General officer time covered by a LOM awarded for wing commander duty will not
count toward the "36 months as a general officer" requirement for a subsequent DSM.
4. A limit of 4 DSMs per career (3 for exceptional service; 1 at retirement).
5. The appeal procedure for disapproved/downgraded DSM nominations is provided in
paragraph 2.10.11.

awarded, was serving in a geographic area in which hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay was
authorized in accordance with section 310, or hazardous duty pay in accordance with paragraph
(1) or (3) of section 351(a) of title 37 U.S.C.; or receives HFP/IDP in accordance with section

the Army for award of the BSM. A copy of the general order announcing the award of either
badge should be attached to the application letter, with a statement as to whether approval of the
BSM would duplicate any previous award for the same period of service. If general orders are
not available, the specific authority for the award of the badge must be included in the
application letter, or attached.

Notes:
1. While clearly an individual decoration, the PH differs from all other decorations in that a
member is not “recommended” for the decoration; rather the member is entitled to it upon
meeting specific criteria.
2. See definitions of Medical Officer, Wound, and Wounded in Action in Attachment 1.
3. This is in accordance with section 1129 of title 10 U.S.C., PH: Members Killed or Wounded
in Action by Friendly Fire.
4. Examples of enemy-related injuries which clearly justify the award of the PH include injuries
caused by: enemy bullet, shrapnel injuries that require wound closure or have retain foreign
bodies, fractures, perforated eardrum and/or permanent loss of hearing, inhalation injuries or
burns due to smoke, fumes or chemical agents introduced or caused by the enemy, second and
third degree burns, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or concussions with loss of consciousness of
any duration.
4.1. Medical documentation must contain evidence of residual cognitive deficits and disorders
and/or persistent signs, symptoms, or findings of functional impairment requiring medical
treatment or support by a medical officer.
4.2. For award of the PH for mild TBI (mTBI) or concussive injury that did not result in loss of
consciousness the injury must have required treatment, not merely examination, by a medical
officer.
4.3. Treatment of the mTBI or concussive injury shall be documented in the service member’s
medical and/or health record.
5. Examples of injuries or wounds which clearly do not justify award of the PH include:
frostbite or trench foot injuries; heat stroke; food poisoning not caused by enemy agents;
chemical, biological, or nuclear agents not released by the enemy; battle fatigue; disease not
directly caused by enemy agents; accidents, to include explosive, aircraft, vehicular, and other
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     83


accidental wounding not related to or caused by enemy action; self-inflicted wounds, except
when in the heat of battle and not involving gross negligence; post-traumatic stress disorders;
and/or jump injuries not caused by enemy action.
6. A wound for which the award is made must have required treatment, not merely examination,
by a medical officer at the time of wounding. Additionally, treatment of the wound shall be
documented in the Service member’s medical/health record. Award of the PH may be made for
wounds treated by a medical professional other than a medical officer provided a medical officer
includes a statement in the Service member’s medical record that the extent of the wounds were
such that they would have required treatment by a medical officer if one had been available to
treat them at the time of wounding.
7. All PH requests must exhibit that the wound or injury was the result of enemy action and
required treatment by a medical officer at the time of injury. A wound is an injury to any part of
the body from an outside force or agent. The term encompasses all kinds of wounds and other
injuries caused by an outsider force or agent, whether there is a piercing of the body, as in a
penetrating or perforating wound, or none, as in a contused wound; all fractures, burns, blast
concussions, all effects of gases and like chemical and biological warfare agents; and the effect
of exposure to radioactive substances.
8. Members, who are evaluated at a military hospital or by incident on-scene doctors/nurses for
injuries received at the time of an incident, and are classified as casualties, are reported on
casualty messages to the AFPC Casualty Matters Division. Members reported as casualties on
casualty messages are automatically considered, by virtue of being reported as casualties, by the
AFPC Purple Heart Review Board (PHRB) for eligibility to the PH. The PHRB has authority
(unless delegated to other command or by Table 2.1), on behalf of SECAF, to evaluate the
circumstances of the injuries to a member and determine the member’s entitlement to the PH.
Refer veterans claiming the PH to the National Personnel Records Center, 9700 Page Avenue,
St. Louis, MO 63132. AFPC prepares the PH elements and forwards them to the recipient’s
servicing MPS for update and presentation. Members not reported as casualties through the
AFPC Casualty Matters Division must provide to the MPS the following information/documents
in order to be considered for the PH: (T-3).

a. Signed memorandum from the injured member requesting the PH and explaining how the
injuries occurred.
b. Signed official medical documentation identifying the source, type, treatment, and date of
injury.
c. A completed DECOR6, signed by the member’s Squadron Commander or equivalent.

The MPS will ensure a, b, and c, above are met and forward those documents to AFPC/DPSIDR.
Refer any questions to the MPS. (T-3).

9. A US civilian or citizen of the US wounded under described circumstances, while serving
under competent authority in any capacity with the military forces of the Department of the Air
Force, will be recommended for the award of the DFM (refer to AFI 36-1004 for criteria). This
includes civil service and non-appropriated fund employees of the Air Force, technical
representatives, and newsmen, who are so serving.

10. Posthumous Award. May be awarded posthumously, and when so directed, may be
presented to such representatives of the deceased as the Secretary concerned considers
appropriate (War Department Circular 125 and E.O. 9277).

3. Lieutenant Colonels (Lt Col) (O-5) in the position of Group CC cannot approve the award of
the MSM. MSMs must be signed by Colonel (O-6) and above. These decoration
recommendations should be routed to the Wing CC or CL in Wing CC position for approval.

LOM of appropriate degree. Forward MSM recommendations for foreign general or flag
officers as a request for an exception to policy through the chain of command to SAFPC.

Notes:
1. AFCMs must be signed by Colonel (O-6) or CL (equivalent) and above. Lieutenant Colonels
(Lt Col) (O-5) in the position of Group CC cannot approve the award of the AFCM. These
decoration recommendations should be routed to the Wing CC or CL in Wing CC position for
approval.
2. Do not award to general or flag officer grades (O-7 and above). Place emphasis on award to
outstanding company grade officers and junior NCOs whose achievements and services meet the
standards.
3. Award of the "V" Device: Authorized only for events or situations occurring on or after 11
January 1996 for a contingency deployment operation will be dependent upon the AOR being
declared a hostile environment by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), or hostile acts identified by the
unified CC or higher authority. Award of the “V” device is based solely on the acts or services
of members who meet the basic criteria of the AFCM and exposed to a personal hazard due to
direct hostile action during a contingency operation. For a single event, COMAFFOR may
authorize. The “V” Device will not be awarded for normal peacetime achievements or service.

"V" device is
authorized.
Notes:
1. It is not appropriate to award this decoration to personnel completing Air Force Training
Programs (for example Air War College, Undergraduate Pilot Training, Air Staff Training, and
so forth).
2. Commanding officers may further delegate AFAM award authority to wing or equivalent
commanding officers (vice commanders) in the grade of colonel or above.
3. Award of the "V" device for a contingency deployment operation will be dependent upon the
AOR being declared a hostile environment by the JCS, or hostile acts identified by the unified
commander or higher authority. Award of the "V" device is based solely on the acts of members
who meet the basic criteria of the AFAM, and who are exposed to personal hazards due to direct
hostile actions during a contingency deployment operation. For a single event, Air Force
Component Commanders may authorize a "V" device when a single event, i.e., terrorist act,
isolated combat-type incident, etc., warrants the "V" device distinction. The "V" device will not
be awarded for normal peacetime acts or services. Award of the "V" device is authorized only
for events or situations which occurred on or after 11 January 1996.
4. The AFAM may not be awarded retroactive for any period of service with a close date prior
its effective date (1 Oct 1981).
5. It is particularly desirable that emphasis be placed on the award of this decoration to
outstanding junior officers and airmen whose achievements and services meet the prescribed
standards.
6. Superior performance of duty or attainment of honors based solely on academic achievement
(such as graduating with honors from an NCO Academy or other course of instruction) does not,
in itself, constitute justification for an award of the AFAM.
7. Appropriate remarks on effectiveness and performance reports, favorable communications,
locally developed certificates and command special trophies and awards provide ample means of
recognizing the high caliber performance expected of Air Force personnel. Awards should be
restricted to the recognition of achievements and services that are clearly outstanding and
unmistakably exceptional when compared to similar achievements and accomplishments of
personnel of like rank and responsibilities.
8. The successful accomplishment of a predesignated number of tasks or functions is not a valid
basis for an automatic award. However, unusual and extraordinary sustained performance may
be used as a point of departure in justifying meritorious achievement or service. In instances
where may persons are affiliated with an exceptionally successful program, project, or mission,
the AFAM will be awarded only to the relatively few members whose contributions clearly stand
out from the others, and who have contributed most to the success of the program.

3.4. Administrative Instructions for Preparing Citations for Specific Awards.
   3.4.1. Prepare citations on 8 1/2- x 11-inch, plain bond paper (orientation - landscape). If
   available use parchment paper. Prepare in letter-quality format without corrections, white-
   outs, strikeovers, or abbreviations. The use of the dollar sign ($) is typically not
   recommended, however, will be accepted if used in the proper format ($10 million).
   Citations must be in good taste and of quality that will capture the substance of the
   decoration with dignity and clarity.
   3.4.2. See figure 3.15 for sample citation headings. Use the mandatory opening and closing
   sentences listed in paragraph 3.5 below.
   3.4.3. The narrative is a short description of the act, achievement, or service. Be specific on
   facts.
   3.4.4. In citations for “retirement decorations” use the words “long and” (closing sentence)
   only for 30 years or more of service. Closing sentence for Air National Guard members not
   on Extended Active Duty (EAD) will read: “The singularly distinctive accomplishments of
   _______ _________ reflect credit (great credit) on himself/herself, the Air National Guard,
   and the United States Air Force.” Figure service of 30 years using total military service date
   (TMSD) or total active federal military service date (TAFMSD).
   3.4.5. The use of commonly identified code names is acceptable in citations (i.e., RED
   FLAG, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, etc). Do not use any abbreviations other than
   Jr., Sr., II, III, and so on, following the member’s name. For compound grade titles, such as
   First Lieutenant, Master Sergeant, Lieutenant Colonel, and so on, spell out the complete
   grade title in the opening sentence and then use the short title in the balance of the citation.
   Reflect the title “Chaplain” as “Chaplain, full grade, full name” (Ex: Chaplain, Lieutenant
   Colonel Frederick Thompson) in the opening sentence. Thereafter, reflect “Chaplain

                     UNITED STATES AIR FORCE UNIT AWARDS

4.1. Definition: A unit award is designed, intended, and awarded to recognize a unit, or units,
for heroism, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement during peacetime or in action
against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. Certain unit awards were also
created to recognize US Air Force organizations for outstanding heroism or achievement
performed during international tension, national emergencies, and/or extraordinary
situations/events that involve national interests.
   4.1.1. Air Force unit awards are not intended to recognize single individual actions, but
   rather to acknowledge and recognize the combined efforts of every member of a unit or
   organization.
   4.1.2. To preserve the integrity of unit awards, they are approved only to recognize acts or
   services that are clearly and distinctly outstanding by nature and magnitude. The acts or
   services recognized must place the unit’s performance above that of other units similar in
   composition and mission and be of such importance that they cannot be appropriately
   recognized in any other way.
   4.1.3. Unit recommendations based on exceptionally meritorious service must cover a period
   of not more than 2 years and not less than 1 year, and the recommendation must be formally
   entered into official military channels within 2 years and awarded within 3 years of the
   termination date of the act, achievement, or service performed.
   4.1.4. Air Force unit awards are primarily awarded to Air Force units and organizations.
   Sister Service units are not normally recommended for or selected to share in an Air Force
   peacetime unit award, as they are eligible for their own service unit awards.
   4.1.5. Only one unit award is awarded for the same achievement or period of service.
   4.1.6. For instructions on the display of streamers for unit or organizational guidons, refer to
   AFI 34-1201, Protocol.
4.2. Unit Awards Approval Authority. Refer to table 4.1 at the end of this chapter to
determine unit award approval authority. Approval authority for the Presidential Unit Citation
and Gallant Unit Citation is the SECAF.
4.3. Presidential Unit Citation (PUC).

Figure 4.1. PUC.



   4.3.1. Originally called the Distinguished Unit Badge and subsequently changed to the
   Distinguished Unit Citation, it is the highest USAF unit award is awarded in the name of the
   President to units of the Armed Forces of the United States and cobelligerent nations, for
   extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy on or after 7 December 1941. The
   unit must have displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing
   its mission, under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions, to have set it apart and above
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  103


  other units participating in the same campaign. The degree of heroism required is the same
  as that which would be required of an Air Force Cross to an individual. Being on combat
  duty for an extended period or participating in a large number of operation missions is not
  sufficient. Only on rare occasions does a unit higher than a wing qualify for this award. Not
  awarded to any unit or unit component previously awarded the Gallant Unit Award (GUC),
  Meritorious Unit Award (MUA), Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA), Air Force
  Organizational Excellence Award, or unit award from another U.S. Service Branch for the
  same act or achievement. The NAF commander or Air Component Commander is the
  recommending official and must have chain of command endorsement (i.e., Combatant
  Component CC or CV, MAJCOM CC or CV, 2-Digit Air Staff Director, etc.).
  4.3.2. Individual Entitlement. Only those members who received IDP/HFP in accordance
  with Title 37 U.S.C. Section 310 during the inclusive period identified are eligible for the
  award, update, and wear the award. Assigned and attached personnel (TDY or permanent
  party) may be entitled to the award on an individual basis, if they directly contributed to the
  unit mission and accomplishments. The unit commander confirms entitlement to wear the
  ribbon (whether attached by verbal or written orders) by issuing a memo or AF Form 104,
  Service Medal Award Verification, which contains the following:
     4.3.2.1. Member(s) rank, name, and Social Security Number.
     4.3.2.2. Certification of member(s) entitlement.
     4.3.2.3. Specific designation of the cited unit to which the member is attached, and date
     of attachment.
     4.3.2.4. States the award authority (i.e., order number, date, and issuing headquarters).
     4.3.2.5. Indicates the award inclusive period.
     4.3.2.6. Once signed by the unit commander, give a copy to each member, and forward
     the correspondence to each member’s servicing MPS for inclusion in the member’s
     record.
  4.3.3. Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster.
     4.3.3.1. Wearing the Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC). The DUC was renamed the
     PUC in 1965. Members entitled to wear both awards may wear an oak leaf cluster on the
     ribbon to denote entitlement to both awards.
     4.3.3.2. Wearing the Navy PUC. The Navy PUC ribbon is designed differently than the
     USAF or US Army PUC ribbons. A person entitled to wear the Navy ribbon may wear it
     on the Air Force uniform, whether or not they are entitled to the Air Force PUC.
  4.3.4. Approval Authority: The SECAF, however the nomination package must be
  processed through AFPC/DPSIDR.
  4.3.5. Award Elements: Citation, Certificate, Special Order, and Streamer.          Upon
  presentation, the streamer should be displayed immediately below the staff ornament of the
  flagstaff that carries the unit’s flag or guidon.

4.4. Gallant Unit Citation (GUC).

Figure 4.2. GUC.



   4.4.1. The Gallant Unit Citation was approved in March 2004 by the SECAF to recognize
   organizations for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United
   States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force
   on or after 11 September 2001.
   4.4.2. The GUC, although requiring a lesser degree of gallantry, determination, and esprit de
   corps than required for the PUC, requires the unit to have performed with marked distinction
   under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart
   from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The degree of heroism
   required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Silver Star to an individual.
   4.4.3. Units Eligible for the GUC: The GUC is awarded in the name of the SECAF to units
   that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans.
   Only on rare occasions will a unit larger than a group qualify for the GUC. Extended periods
   of combat duty or participation in a larger number of operational missions, either air or
   ground, is not sufficient. The unit commander is the recommending official and must have
   chain of command endorsement (i.e., wing, NAF, Combatant Component CC or CV,
   MAJCOM CC or CV, 2-Digit Air Staff Director, etc.).
   4.4.4. Individual entitlement is the same as that of the PUC. Refer to paragraph 4.3.2.
   4.4.5. Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster.
   4.4.6. Approval Authority: The SAFPC Decorations Board; however the nomination
   package must be processed through AFPC/DPSIDR.
   4.4.7. Award Elements: Citation, Certificate, Special Order, and Streamer.
4.5. Meritorious Unit Award (MUA).

Figure 4.3. MUA.



   4.5.1. The Meritorious Unit Award was approved in March 2004 by the SECAF to recognize
   organizations for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding
   achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days
   during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or
   after 11 September 2001.
   4.5.2. To qualify for award of the MUA, the recommended unit must display such
   outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it
   apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the
   same as that which would warrant award of the LOM to an individual. Superior performance
   of the normal mission will not alone justify the award of the MUA.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  105


   4.5.3. Units Eligible for the MUA: The MUA is awarded in the name of SECAF to
   squadrons, groups, and wings for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of
   outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90
   continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the
   United States. Service in a combat zone is not required, but service must be directly related
   to the combat effort. Wing-level and below units may be recommended for this award.
   4.5.4. Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster.
   4.5.5. Approval Authority: MAJCOM commanders; however, approval authority is
   delegated in cases when NAF/CCs are serving as Air Component Commanders (i.e., 9AF/CC
   serves as USCENTAF/CC).
   4.5.6. Award Elements: Citation, Certificate, Special Order, and Streamer.
4.6. Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA).

Figure 4.4. AFOUA.



   4.6.1. The AFOUA was established and awarded in the name of the SECAF on 6 January
   1954.
   4.6.2. Units Eligible for the AFOUA. The following types of units are eligible for
   consideration: Numbered Units such as Air Forces, Air Divisions, Wings, Groups, and
   Squadrons (units below squadron level are not eligible), to include provisional units; medical
   facilities such as hospitals, clinics, medical centers (numbered or unnumbered).
   Detachments, operating locations, training sites, or Air Force elements are often included in
   the parent unit’s award; however, they may be considered on their own merit or identified by
   the parent unit to share in the award, but not both. Subordinate unnumbered units included in
   the numbered parent unit’s award submission will be allowed to share in the approved unit
   award (AFOUA) only if submitted and approved as an exception to policy (ETP). All other
   unnumbered units (squadron-level and above) must be submitted for the AFOEA to the
   appropriate approval authority.
   4.6.3. Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster. The approval of both the GUC and MUA has
   warranted the discontinuance of the “V” Device being authorized for USAF unit awards
   approved on/after 1 January 2014.
   4.6.4. Approval Authority: Authority to approve recommendations for awarding the AFOUA
   is delegated to MAJCOM commanders or vice commanders; however, approval authority is
   delegated in cases when NAF/CCs are serving as Air Component Commanders (i.e., 9AF/CC
   serves as USCENTAF/CC). Recommendation packages requiring SECAF approval will be
   forwarded through the chain of command to AFPC/DPSIDR for further processing by
   SAFPC.
   4.6.5. Award Elements: Citation, Certificate, Special Order, and Streamer.

4.7. Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (AFOEA).

Figure 4.5. AFOEA.


   4.7.1. The Air Force Organizational Award (AFOEA) was approved in August 1969 by the
   Sec AF to recognize the achievements and accomplishments of USAF organizations or
   activities. It is awarded to Air Force internal organizations that are entities within larger
   organizations. They are unique, unnumbered organizations or activities that perform
   functions normally performed by numbered wings, groups, squadrons etc.
   4.7.2. Units Eligible for the AFOEA. The following types of organizations are eligible for
   consideration: Unnumbered organizations, such as MAJCOM headquarters, FOAs, DRUs,
   centers, and any other unnumbered organization (unnumbered organizations below squadron
   level are not eligible); SECAF and the office of the Chief/Assistant Chief of Staff agencies
   (i.e., all two-digit office symbol organizations in Secretariat and on AF Air Staff); each Air
   Force level school, academy college, and USAF ROTC detachments; similar Armed Forces
   of the United States services organizations or activities (except DoD joint activities).
   Detachments, operating locations, training sites, or Air Force elements are often included in
   the parent unit’s award; however, they may be considered on their own merit or identified by
   the parent unit to share in the award, but not both. Subordinate numbered units included in
   the unnumbered parent unit’s award submission will be allowed to share in the approved unit
   award (AFOEA) only if submitted and approved as an ETP. All other unnumbered units
   (squadron-level and above) must be submitted for the AFOEA to the appropriate approval
   authority.
   4.7.3. Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster. The approval of both the GUC and MUA has
   warranted the discontinuance of the “V” Device being authorized for USAF unit awards
   approved on/after 1 January 2014.
   4.7.4. Approval Authority: Authority to approve recommendations for awarding the AFOEA
   is delegated to major commanders or vice commanders. Recommendation packages
   requiring SECAF approval will be forwarded through the chain of command to
   AFPC/DPSIDR for further processing by SAFPC.
   4.7.5. Award Elements: Citation, Certificate, Special Order, and Streamer.
4.8. Subordinate Unit Sharing Approved Unit Award with Parent Unit. Subordinate
units/organizations do not automatically share in a parent unit/organization award. Each
subordinate unit must be able to demonstrate a direct impact on parent unit mission
accomplishment.
   4.8.1. Units/organizations can only share their award with like subordinate organizations
   (i.e., for a numbered parent organization, only numbered subordinate units may share; for an
   unnumbered parent organization, only unnumbered subordinate organizations/units may
   share).
       4.8.1.1. For units/organizations with a “mixed” composition (i.e., numbered and
       unnumbered units) an exception to policy may be requested from SAFPC.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   107


   4.8.2. Higher units or organizations are not entitled to share in an award approved solely to a
   subordinate unit.
   4.8.3. Host organizations may identify tenant units to share in their award providing the
   tenant unit’s parent MAJCOM, FOA or DRU concurs in writing.
4.9. Air Force Unit Awards Shared by Sister Services or a Foreign Nation. On very rare
occasions and typically during periods of war, units/organizations of the Departments of the
Army and Navy, or the Marine Corps may share in an Air Force unit award. Before completing
the special order, the Air Force approval authority must forward the entire recommendation to
AFPC/DPSIRDA to obtain concurrence from the respective service. Military units of friendly
foreign nations may not share in an Air Force unit award to an Air Force unit/organization.
Because units of friendly foreign nations are typically organized within a DoD combined
command, they are normally awarded DoD unit awards, verses Air Force unit awards.
4.10. Sister Service and Foreign Nation Unit Awards Shared by Air Force
Units/Organizations. These are considered sister service and foreign nation unit awards similar
to Air Force unit awards. Air Force units may be presented or accept sister service and foreign
nation unit awards only with advanced DAF written approval. Typically, the Departments of the
Army, Navy, Marine Corps or foreign nation, before approving a unit award to an Air Force
unit/organization, will obtain concurrence and approval from the Air Force or Department of
State. A unit known to have been recommended for a sister service unit award must ensure the
DAF has concurred and approved the unit award; a foreign nation unit award must have
Department of State or SAFPC concurrence/approval to AFPC/DPSIDR.                       If DAF
concurrence/approval was not obtained by the Departments of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or
foreign nation, the Air Force unit/organization being recognized must request acceptance through
its chain of command to AFPC/DPSIDR.
4.11. Air Force Personnel Entitled to Unit Awards. All unit/organization permanently
assigned or attached personnel (military or civilian) who served in the unit/organization for at
least one day during a period for which a unit award was approved are authorized the appropriate
ribbon, if they directly contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. When
needed, the squadron commander or other designated official in a unit recognized validates and
determines entitlement.
   4.11.1. Air Force TDY Personnel, Students, and Other Personnel Entitled to Unit Awards.
   Air Force personnel and students on accession status attached or TDY to a unit/organization
   awarded, or subsequently awarded a unit award are not entitled to share in the award
   individually, unless the unit/organization commander of the unit/organization awarded the
   unit award determines that the contributions of the TDY personnel or accession student(s)
   significantly and directly contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the
   unit/organization for which the unit award was approved if the unit/organization commander
   of the unit/organization recognized signs a memorandum identifying all TDY personnel or
   accession student authorized to share in the unit award; these personnel present this
   memorandum to their servicing MPS. Resident staff of Air Force units/organizations may be
   entitled to share in unit awards provided the commander that submitted the unit award
   recommendation made reference to this entitlement in the recommendation, or if the
   unit/organization commander signs a memorandum identifying each Resident and
   authorizing entitlement.
 108                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


   4.11.2. Air Force Personnel Entitled to AEF/Contingency/Provisional Unit Awards. Air
   Force personnel who were TDY or permanently assigned/attached for at least one day during
   a period for which a unit award was approved to an AEF, contingency, deployed, or
   provisional unit, are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly contributed to the
   mission and accomplishments of the unit.
   4.11.3. Sister Service Personnel Entitled to Share in Air Force Unit Awards. Personnel from
   the Departments of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps may share in a unit award if they were
   permanently assigned or attached to the unit.            The squadron commander of the
   unit/organization recognized signs a memorandum identifying Army, Navy, or Marine Corps
   personnel to share in a unit award; these personnel present this memorandum to their
   servicing personnel element.
4.12. Verifying Individual Entitlement to Share in Unit Award. The servicing MPS verifies
entitlement to Air Force personnel to share in a unit award and updates/creates the AF Form 104.
The MPS may use a variety of methods to verify unit award entitlement to include
Contingency/Exercise/Deployment (CED) orders, completed travel vouchers, decoration
citations/orders, LOEs, appraisals that are a matter of record, MILPDS data/information, or other
documentation deemed acceptable by the MPS (i.e. a memorandum from the approval authority
awarding the organization(s) confirming individual entitlement). To verify entitlement to
previous unit awards, refer to this instruction or other reference sources such as the DoD 1348-
33.M,         AFPAM          36-2801,          (previously         AFP       900-2),      and/or
http://access.afpc.af.mil/awardsDMZ/SearchAwards.aspx for awards and decorations
information. AFPAM 36-2801, contains unit award information from WWI to 1992. After
1992,     unit    award    information      is    updated     into   the    AFPC      web    site:
http://access.afpc.af.mil/awardsDMZ/SearchAwards.aspx.
   4.12.1. Normally, when a unit award is approved, the approval authority forwards the unit
   award elements (special order, citation, certificate, and streamer (if applicable), through the
   chain of command to the unit/organization recognized. The commander of the unit
   recognized informs the MPS of the award and requests that current records of
   assigned/attached personnel be updated. Personnel departed from the unit may request their
   servicing MPS update their records.
4.13. Unit Award Approval Authority Responsibility. Approve unit awards to military units
that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in action against hostile forces or an armed
enemy of the US.         Restrict approval to recognize acts or services that place the unit's
performance significantly above that of other units of similar composition and mission
responsibility. Only approve one award for the same act, achievement, or service. Approval
authorities ensure only 10 percent of similar units assigned to their command are approved for
the AFOUA/AFOEA annually.               If warranted, approval authorities may award the
AFOUA/AFOEA to one additional unit per specific category. For one-of-a-kind type units,
approval will be based on each unit's merits. Publish a special order to announce approval of the
unit award. Include in the special order the type of unit award, name of unit, subordinate units
entitled to share in the award, inclusive period(s) for each sharing unit if the period differs from
the parent unit. By 31 December of each year, forward a copy of each special order published to
AFPC/DPSIDR and a copy to the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA/RSO), 600
Chennault Circle, Maxwell, AFB AL 36112-6424 or email to afhra.rs@us.af.mil, Attention:
RSO. A unit award based on outstanding achievement does not preclude a second award based
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     109


on meritorious service. Do not include the justification used to substantiate the outstanding
achievement award in the recommendation for meritorious service. The unit's entire service
must have been honorable during the distinguished act. Notify National Guard Bureau Public
Affairs when approving a unit award for an ANG unit.
4.14. Unit Award Elements Prepared By Approval Authority. The approval authority
prepares unit award elements and makes presentation arrangements, or forwards to subordinate
command(s) for presentation arrangements to the recognized unit. Award elements consist of the
special order, citation, certificate, and streamer.
   4.14.1. Certificate. The certificate bears a replica of the ribbon and is embossed with the
   Department of the Seal. It identifies the unit decorated, indicates one or more dates of the act
   or achievement or the inclusive service period for which the award was made, and is signed
   by the award authority. The award authority issues the certificate.
   4.14.2. Special Order. A special order announces this award. It is not essential at the time
   of the presentation ceremony and may be furnished later. Copies of the special order are not
   distributed to persons entitled to this award nor placed in individual personnel records. Refer
   to paragraph 4.13 for distribution instructions.
   4.14.3. Streamer. The swallow-tailed streamer of the same design as the ribbon is issued to
   units authorized a flag or guidon. The streamer is embroidered in white with the name of the
   act or the inclusive dates of the service period. Authorized abbreviations may be used for
   lengthy action or achievement names. Each award is represented by a separate streamer.
4.15. Preparing a Unit Award Recommendation. Each approval authority will annually
solicit unit award nominations by publicizing the suspense date, recommendation format, and
required documents for unit award recommendations. The criteria for Air Force unit awards
requiring SAFPC approval is announced annually by AFPC/DPSIDR with the release of the
annual submissions of USAF unit awards requiring SECAF approval, via the PSDM. The
following are the requirements for an Air Force unit award recommendation for which SAFPC
has approval authority:
   4.15.1. Letter of Recommendation. See Figure 4.6. Must be accomplished on official
   letterhead and signed by the commander/vice commander of the parent unit/organization.
   Chain of command endorsement is required and higher level endorsements may be
   accomplished on this letter, or on separate letters.         For MAJCOMs, the MAJCOM
   commander (CC) is the recommending official. If the MAJCOM CC is unavailable, the
   MAJCOM vice commander (CV) may sign the recommendation letter. FOA/DRU
   commanders/directors assigned to an Air Staff directorate/agency will ensure their respective
   DCS endorses the recommendation. The letter must include the name of the parent
   organization being recommended, name of the award (GUC, AFOUA, etc.) and type of
   service (exceptionally meritorious service or outstanding achievement), as well as the
   inclusive period of the award. Accurately list all previous unit awards earned by parent unit.
   List other recognition earned by the parent and subordinate units during the inclusive period,
   and list one or more points of contact for the organization. The following documents will be
   submitted as attachments to the Letter of Recommendation.
       4.15.1.1. Subordinate Organization Matrix. See Figure 4.7. Lists all assigned and
       attached subordinate units that will share in the award. The matrix will list the full title,
 110                                                       AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


       office symbol, complete Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code, award inclusive
       period, and (if applicable) any additional information/changes (i.e., unit renamed, new
       organization, unit closure, etc.) pertinent to each subordinate unit.
       4.15.1.2. Organizational Chart. See Figure 4.8. Shows organizational structure of the
       parent unit/organization and each subordinate unit/organization recommended to share in
       the award.
       4.15.1.3. Subordinate Organization Mission Descriptions. See Figure 4.9. Mission
       statements/descriptions for each subordinate unit/organization recommended to share in
       the award. Note: The parent unit mission description will precede the narrative
       justification on the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award.
       4.15.1.4. Nomination. See Figure 4.10. All unit award nominations will be
       accomplished on the latest version of the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, in bullet
       format only. Limit justification to the “Specific Accomplishments” block on the first and
       second page of the form. Begin with a mission statement which will only be one
       sentence long and will be unclassified. Use the heading, “Mission:” and state in present
       tense what the unit/organization is designated to do. The award justification follows in
       bullet format and in past tense, and is expected to highlight the entire organization’s
       contributions to the mission—include any identified subordinate units. If possible,
       submissions should not contain classified information. The AF Form 1206 will not be
       utilized for PUC and GUC submissions. Please reference paragraph 4.15.3 and 4.15.6
       for PUC and GUC nominations, which are not completed on AF Form 1206).
       4.15.1.5. Proposed Unit Award Citation. See Figure 4.12 (AFOUA/AFOEA), 4.15
       (PUC), 4.16 (GUC), and 4.17 (MUA) for specific formatting instructions and mandatory
       opening and closing sentences. For exceptionally meritorious service nominations, this
       should capture only four to five of the most outstanding achievements. For outstanding
       achievement nominations, this should detail the specific act or accomplishment. The
       citation must be unclassified. If award recommendation is approved, do not use proposed
       citations for ceremonies/presentations. The award approval authority can modify the
       proposed citation and the final approved citation could read differently.
       4.15.1.6. Other Recognition Certificates. Significant unit/team recognition earned by
       parent and subordinate units during the inclusive period. Do not include individual
       awards or accomplishments.
       4.15.1.7. Acronym Page. Lists and defines all acronyms used throughout the
       recommendation package. Note: The use of acronyms should be minimized.
   4.15.2. Electronic Submission. Unit award nominations will be submitted electronically.
   All documents will be submitted as Microsoft Word Documents, with the exception of the
   Nomination, which will be submitted as an AF Form 1206. If desired the Organizational
   Chart(s) can be submitted as Microsoft PowerPoint slides.
Note: The following additional paragraphs apply to Presidential Unit Citation (PUC)
submissions only:
   4.15.3. Summary of Recommendation. This replaces the nomination on the AF Form 1206
   and provides for more detailed justification for units being recommended for the PUC. The
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 111

   single spaced typewritten pages. The Summary of Recommendation will contain the
   following paragraphs:
      4.15.3.1. Mission. This should be a complete but concise statement, that is usually one
      sentence long and its contents may not contain classified data. Use the heading,
      “Mission:” and in the present tense tell what the unit is designated to do.
      4.15.3.2. Concept of Operations. This brief narrative that is usually only one paragraph
      long and is stated in the past tense (wherever possible). Use the heading, “Concept of
      Operations:” and in narrative format include the following: One or more types of aircraft
      flown; number of flight locations (if applicable); list of the exact operations performed,
      indicating for whom they are performed; and the general geographical area of
      responsibility.

      of personnel rescued; amount of supplies delivered; amount of enemy materiel, ships, or
      personnel destroyed; number of flares dropped; number and type of decorations awarded
      during the period; the enemy defenses encountered, etc. Specific examples of typical
      successful missions may also be included; and when applicable, new innovations
      conceived and tested should be mentioned. This should not include specific types of
      weapons, caliber, or abbreviations, unless spelled out first. Round off numbers, where
      possible. Avoid flowery, descriptive language and military terminology not readily
      understood by laymen or that may lose its meaning with the passage of time.
      Additionally, comments should reflect the support personnel contributions. Classified
      information up to SECRET may be submitted, but is rarely necessary and should be
      avoided if possible.
   4.15.4. Proposed PUC White House/SECAF Press Release. See Figure 4.14. This is a
   double-spaced, portrait-style, 10 to 12-pitch, unclassified “Proposed Press Release” for use
   by the White House Communications Agency or the Air Force Public Affairs Division. This
   should be a condensed version of the unclassified summary using words understandable to
   the general public.
Note: The following additional paragraphs apply to Gallant Unit Citations (GUC)
submissions only:
   4.15.5. Summary of Unit Specific Accomplishments. For GUC submissions, this replaces
   the nomination on the AF Form 1206. The Summary of Unit Specific Accomplishments is
   completed on bond paper in 12-pitch and is limited to two single spaced typewritten pages.
   The Summary of Recommendation will contain the following paragraphs:
      4.15.5.1. Mission. This should be a complete but concise statement, that is usually one

      “Mission:” and in the present tense tell what the unit is designated to do.
      4.15.5.2. Execution Narrative. This narrative will demonstrate the scope of the unit’s
      achievements, factual matters should be included. This could include but is not limited to
      the following: Number of hours flown; number of combat missions completed; number
 112                                                      AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


       of lives saved; number of ground contacts hours and the enemy defenses offenses
       encountered, and so forth. Specific examples of typical successful missions may also be
       included. This should not include specific types of weapons, caliber, or abbreviations,
       unless spelled out first. Round off numbers, where possible. Avoid flowery, descriptive
       language and military terminology not readily understood by laymen or that may lose its
       meaning with the passage of time. Classified information up to SECRET may be
       submitted, but is rarely necessary and should be avoided if possible.
4.16. Air Force Unit Award Streamer: An Air Force unit award streamer is an embroidered
swallow-tailed ribbon of the same design as the Air Force unit award awarded to members. The
ribbon denotes award of an Air Force unit award. The most common Air Force unit awards are
the Meritorious Unit Award, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and Air Force Organizational
Excellence Award.
   4.16.1. Unit Eligibility: To be eligible for a unit award streamer, a unit must have been
   awarded an Air Force unit award, or authorized to share in a higher headquarters unit award.
   Upon approval of a unit award, the approval authority provides a streamer only to the head
   organization/unit (units sharing in the award procure the streamer through supply channels).
   4.16.2. Display of a Unit Award Streamer: Eligible units carry a unit award streamer on the
   organizational flag staff and guidon. Obtain streamer through Air Force supply channels.
   Embroider with the period recognized (1 JANUARY 2003 – 31 DECEMBER 2004). Do not
   issue a streamer to a unit not authorized a flag or guidon. Approval authority issues one
   streamer to parent or head unit/organization; commanders of subordinate units/organizations
   sharing in the award acquire their own after written evidence of approval/award (message,
   memorandum, special order) is available. Streamer sizes vary depending on the size of the
   flag on the flag staff:
       4.16.2.1. Ceremonial Flag: 2 ¾” inches wide and 4’ feet long
       4.16.2.2. Organizational Flag: 2 ¾” inches wide and 3’ feet long
       4.16.2.3. Guidon Flag: 1 3/8” inches wide and 2’ feet long
4.17. Campaign Streamers. Denotes participation of a unit in a designated Department of
Defense (DoD) campaign. Awarded for active Federal military service to units or organizations
that are authorized an organizational color or distinguishing flag to recognize receipt of
campaign participation credit. Campaign streamers are embroidered swallow-tailed ribbons of
the same design as campaign or service medals awarded to members for service in a named
campaign. Campaign streamers are usually embroidered with the name of the campaign,
operation, or expedition designated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), authorized by the DoD,
and announced in DoD Manual 1348.33.
   4.17.1. Unit Eligibility: To be eligible for a campaign streamer, a unit must have been
   awarded campaign participation credit by Headquarters Air Force. This authority may be
   delegated to the COMAFFOR to the Combatant Command that has operational control over
   the designated campaign, operation, or expedition. Air Force units are deemed to have
   participated if they were stationed in a designated combat zone and actually engaged the
   enemy in combat or performed duties either in the air or on the ground in any part of the
   combat zone at any time during the designated period of the respective battle, campaign or
   expedition. Campaign credit represents a unit’s participation in a campaign. Air Force units
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     113


   will be considered for eligibility if the home unit deploys more than 50 percent of their unit
   simultaneously to the deployed location.
   4.17.2. Procedures: Unit commanders are responsible for submitting requests for award of
   campaign participation credit through the chain of command to the appropriate COMAFFOR
   (refer to 4.17.1.1).    The COMAFFOR will endorse and forward the request to
   AFPC/DPSIDR for routing to Headquarters Air Force. AFPC/DPSIDR issues special orders
   announcing approved campaign credit and forwards a copy of the orders to the requesting
   COMAFFOR and the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) at
   afhra.rs@us.af.mil, Attention: RSO, for update of units’ lineage and honors.
   4.17.3. Display of Campaign Streamer. Eligible units carry a campaign streamer on their
   organizational flag staff and guidon. Each designated campaign name for which the unit
   receives participation credit is embroidered on an individual campaign streamer.
   Commanders of units that meet the unit eligibility requirements above procure, through
   supply channels, and display the appropriate campaign streamer after written evidence
   (message, memorandum, special order) from AFPC/DPSIDR or the Air Component
   Command that is responsible for the air war of the particular war, campaign or conflict.
   Streamer sizes vary depending on the size of the flag on the flag staff; see paragraph 4.16.2.
4.18. War Service Streamer: A war service streamer is awarded to a flag-bearing organization
for service in a theater or area of operation during a war or conflict when the organization is not
entitled to campaign credit. The war service streamer is identical to the applicable campaign
streamer, but without inscription.
   4.18.1. Unit Eligibility: To be eligible for a war service streamer, a unit must meet all of the
   following: have mobilized in support of a campaign for which a campaign or service medal
   was authorized, entered the geographical area designated for the campaign, its area(s) of
   operations, or campaign theater, and meet the “in geographical area” or service criteria
   prescribed for individual award of the campaign or service medal. Upon establishment or
   approval of a campaign or service medal, the establishing or approval authority (AF/DPS)
   determines if a war service streamer is authorized for the campaign and initiates actions for
   its availability through the Air Force supply system.
   4.18.2. Display of War Service Streamer: Eligible units carry a war service streamer on the
   organizational flag staff and guidon. Commanders of units that meet the unit eligibility
   requirements above may procure, through supply channels, and display the appropriate war
   service streamer after written evidence (message, memorandum, special order) establishing
   or approving the campaign or service medal is available. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs are
   responsible to resolve, if needed, any eligibility contentions and determine final eligibility to
   a war service streamer by their subordinate organizations. Streamer sizes vary depending on
   the size of the flag on the flag staff; see paragraph 4.16.2.
4.19. Assault Landing Credit.
   4.19.1. Assault landing credit may be granted to AF units that, in the combat zone of a
   battle, campaign, or expedition as established by the Joint Staff or HAF, accomplishes one of
   the following types of assault operation:
       4.19.1.1. Makes a parachute jump into enemy-held territory as a part of an organized
       force carrying out an assigned tactical mission.
 114                                                           AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


        4.19.1.2. Participates in the assault waves of an amphibious landing on enemy-held
        territory.
        4.19.1.3. Makes a helicopter assault landing into enemy-held territory as a part of an
        organizational force carrying out an assigned tactical mission.
    4.19.2. The assault landing must be of such scope that it would warrant HAF designation as
    a battle or campaign and be of such magnitude as to include tactical elements of at least one
    other Service. The forces committed should be spearheading a major assault into enemy
    controlled territory. The operation will be such that the committed forces will ultimately
    control the area in which they have landed and not rely on immediate link-up with other
    forces or extrication after a hit-and-run type mission. Day-to-day combat assault type
    missions in an already established combat zone do not qualify for award of the arrowhead
    device.
    4.19.3. Nominations will be endorsed by the COMAFFOR and submitted to AFPC/DPSIDR
    for staffing to HAF for SECAF, or his designees, approval. The nomination must contain:
    the size and composition of the force involved, list of units that participated in the assault
    landing with PAS codes, mission description, the length of the operation and the relationship
    to the tactical operations of the unified command controlling the operation, the date and time
    of start and close of the assault operation, enemy situation and reaction, and specific location
    where the assault landing occurred. Coordination with AF/HO and AF/A3 will be
    accomplished prior to SECAF decision. AFPC/DPSIDR will issue orders announcing
    approved awards.
    4.19.4. Individual authorization of the arrowhead. Refer to paragraph 11.5. Special orders
    are not published to announce individual entitlement.
        4.19.4.1. The member must physically exited the aircraft or watercraft during the assault
        landing.
        4.19.4.2. Information on eligibility for combat parachutist jump credit can be found in
        AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation
        Badges, paragraph 7.4.7.5.
4.20. Associated USAF Units. If a unit is associated (i.e., consisting of more than one USAF
Total Force component--Active Duty, ANG or AFR), nominations for unit awards must be
routed through each individual USAF component for approval. Unit award recommendations
can be combined and submitted for award consideration, but each component approval authority
must individually approve/disapprove the nomination.

   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND US AIR FORCE CAMPAIGN AND SERVICE
               MEDALS, AND ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS

5.1. Definition and Background. An achievement award is designed, intended, and awarded to
recognize a member for achieving or meeting specific types of pre-established criteria or
requirements of qualification, service, performance, or conduct.
   5.1.1. The US military campaign and service medals shall not be awarded to members of
   foreign military establishments.
   5.1.2. The US military campaign, expeditionary and service medals may be awarded
   posthumously.
   5.1.3. Refer any questions pertaining to Air Force achievement awards to the servicing MPS.
   The MPS, if unable to answer questions or resolve problems related to achievement awards,
   will contact their respective MAJCOM/A1 or the Air Force Contact Center for assistance.
   To       verify    entitlement       to    achievement     awards,    the     MPS       uses
   Contingency/Exercise/Deployment (CED) orders, paid travel vouchers, decoration
   citations/orders, Letters of Evaluations, appraisals that are a matter of record, medal
   certificates, authorization/certification letters/forms, MILPDS data/information, or other
   documentation deemed acceptable by the MPS. The MPS, upon verification of entitlement
   to achievement awards, updates MILPDS and prepares/updates AF Form 104, Service Medal
   Award Verification, on each Air Force member to reflect verified achievement awards, and
   forwards to ARMS for file in the member's record.
   5.1.4. Air Force achievement awards do not have Weighted Airman Promotion System
   (WAPS) point values, unless specified in the award criteria. Only award one Air Force
   achievement award to the same person, unless criteria authorize multiple awards.
   5.1.5. Air Force members may accept achievement awards awarded by a sister service
   (Army, Navy, Marine Corps). Refer to AFI 36-2903, paragraph 4-3 and figure 4.1, for
   authorized awards and instructions on how to wear these awards on Air Force uniforms.
5.2. Department of Defense Service Medals. The prescribing directive for the defense awards
and decorations is DoD 1348.33-M.
   5.2.1. Prisoner of War Medal (PWM).

Figure 5.1. PWM.




       5.2.1.1. The PWM is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the
       U.S. Armed Forces, was taken prisoner and held captive after 5 April 1917. The PWM
       shall be issued to U.S. military members and other personnel serving in any capacity with
       the U.S. Armed Forces, who were taken prisoner and held captive while:
          5.2.1.1.1. Engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States
          5.2.1.1.2. Engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign
          force
          5.2.1.1.3. Serving with friendly forces engaged in an armed conflict against an
          opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party
       5.2.1.2. The PWM may be awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity
       with the U.S. Armed Forces, was held captive under circumstances not covered by
       paragraphs 5.2.1.1.1., 5.2.1.1.2., or 5.2.1.1.3 (above), but which the Secretary concerned
       finds were comparable to those circumstances under which persons have generally been
       held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.
          5.2.1.2.1. Award of the PWM under the comparable conditions provision is the
          exception and not the rule. SECAF is the approval authority for PWM requests
          submitted under this provision.
          5.2.1.2.2. For comparable conditions comparison purposes, armed conflicts are
          defined as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam Conflict.
          5.2.1.2.3. In cases where personnel from multiple Military Departments were held
          captive in the same location, the Secretaries concerned will make a joint
          determination as to whether the conditions were comparable to those of POWs during
          periods of armed conflict.
       5.2.1.3. Missing in Action. Personnel officially classified as “Missing in Action” are not
       eligible for award of the PWM. The PWM will only be issued to the legal next-of-kin of
       military personnel or civilians who have received credit for US Military Service and
       whose POW status officially has been confirmed and recognized as such by the Military
       Departments. The next-of-kin of persons listed as “missing, but for whom there is no
       evidence of having been a POW” shall not be issued the PWM.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  131


      5.2.1.4. The return of remains, in and of itself, does not constitute evidence of confirmed

        5.2.4.2.3. Reflect favorably on the Military Service and the Department of Defense.
        5.2.4.2.4. Be of a sustained and direct nature.
     5.2.4.3. On 2 July 1996, the SECAF approved realigning the MOVSM approval
     authority to the group commander level. This includes commanders of composite and
     provisional groups and (colonel) group commander, or equivalent, of geographically
     separated units. This approval authority may not be further delegated.
     5.2.4.4. While there is no specific time period to qualify for the MOVSM (for example
     500 hours of community service within 24 calendar months), approval authorities shall
     ensure the service to be honored merits the special recognition afforded by this medal.
     The MOVSM is intended to recognize exceptional community support over time, not a
     single act or achievement. Further, it is intended to honor direct support of community
     activities. For the purpose of this award, attending membership meetings or social events
     of a community service group is not considered qualifying service, while manning a
     community crisis action telephone line for a sustained period of time is considered
     qualifying service. The overall level of volunteer participation and impact of a member’s
     community service is key to determining whether award of the MOVSM is justified.
     5.2.4.5. The MOVSM recognizes service provided to a community over time, therefore,
     multiple awards of the MOVSM during a single tour of duty are not authorized.
     However, a sustained record of significant community service performed during
     successive tours may be considered by approval authorities when adjudicating
     recommendations for award of the MOVSM.
     5.2.4.6. Service recognized by award of the MOVSM shall be of voluntary nature, not
     detailed or tasked, nor performed as part of a military mission (for example, a unit
     project).
     5.2.4.7. Authorized Device: A bronze service star will be worn to denote subsequent
     award of the MOVSM.

      recommendation by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force and the Awards and
      Decorations Summit, SECAF reinstated the AFGCM to USAF enlisted personnel with a
      retroactive date of 6 February 2006.
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 145

        5.3.3.4.1. Each 3 years completed on or after 1 June 1963
        5.3.3.4.2. For first award only, upon termination of service on or after 1 June 1963,
        of less than 3 years but more than 1 year.
        5.3.3.4.3. For first award only, upon termination of service, on or after 1 June 1963,

        States is at war, as declared by the US Congress. The entire year must have been
        served in the AOE during the period indicated. Notification of this change will be
        announced by either Air Staff or AFPC.
     5.3.3.5. Award of the AFGCM is automatic unless denied by the unit commander.
     Denials are the result of less than exemplary conduct. Commanders are required to
     prepare a memorandum or letter stating the period involved for denying and adjust the
     award to the new start date. Adjustment of the AFGCM qualifying period is in
     conjunction with adverse actions (such as UIF, control roster actions, Article 15s, letters
     of reprimand, etc.). Commanders cannot readjust a member’s AFGCM period from a
     previous assignment if the previous commander failed to file a signed memorandum or
     letter readjusting the member’s AFGCM period in the member’s record for permanent
     file.
     5.3.3.6. Update of the AFGCM for Active Duty personnel in MILPDS is under the
     awards category of “C” (Campaign Service Awards), update code of “CF” (AFGCM).
     For USAF officers who earned entitlement to the AFGCM while in an enlisted status or
     AFRES and ANG personnel on extended active duty (i.e., Title 10), the awards category
     code in MILPDS is “O” (Other Awards), update code of “CF” (AFGCM).

   6.13.2. Service members must be bona fide members of a unit participating in or be engaged
   in the direct support of the operation for 30 consecutive days in the area of operations (or for
   the full period when an operation is less than 30 days duration) or for 60 nonconsecutive days
   provided this support involved entering the area of operations or meet one or more of the
   following criteria:
      6.13.2.1. Be engaged in actual combat, or duty which is equally as hazardous as combat
      duty, during the operation with armed opposition, regardless of time in the area;
      6.13.2.2. Is wounded or injured and requires medical evacuation from the area of
      eligibility while participating in the operation, regardless of time;
      6.13.2.3. Accumulate 15 days service (consecutive/nonconsecutive) while participating
      as a regularly assigned crewmember of an aircraft flying sorties into, out of, within, or
      over the area in direct support of the military operation. One day’s service is credited for
      the first sortie flown on any day. Additional sorties flown on the same day receive no
      further credit.
          6.13.2.3.1. Prior to 1 December 1995, members on aircrew status were only required
          to fly over or into the AOE for one day during conflict to qualify for the award of the
          AFEM.
   6.13.3. The AFEM will be awarded only for operations for which no other U.S. campaign
   medal is approved. However, this does not prevent award eligibility for subsequent on-going
   operations if the associated campaign medal has been terminated. No member will be
   eligible for both the AFEM and a campaign medal awarded during a single tour in the
   designated operation. The military service of the service member on whom qualification for
   the award of the AFEM is based will have been honorable.

   6.13.4. Service members who earned the AFEM for service in Vietnam between 1 July 1958

   However, no service member may be issued both medals for service in Vietnam.
   6.13.5. Service members who earned the Southwest Asia Service Medal (SWASM) and
   subsequently became eligible, at any time, for the AFEM for Operation SOUTHERN

   awards during one tour in Southwest Asia (SWA). Service members who become eligible for
   both awards during their initial tour in SWA may elect to receive either the SWASM or the
   AFEM, but may not be issued both medals for a single tour in SWA. Service members who
   become eligible for both awards during their initial tour in SWA and elect to receive the
   SWASM may be awarded the AFEM for participation in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH
   during a subsequent tour in SWA under the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel
   Readiness Memorandum dated 7 February 1996.

   29 and 30 April 1975 may elect to receive the Vietnam Service Medal instead of the AFEM.
   No service member may be issued both medals for service in Vietnam.
   6.13.7. After 1 July 1958, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will designate U.S. military operations
   that qualify for the AFEM, and they will specify the degree of participation in designated
   operations warranting award of the medal.
   6.13.8. Service members who earned the AFEM for operations in Southwest Asia
   (SOUTHERN WATCH, Maritime Intercept, NORTHERN WATCH, and DESERT
   SPRING) and then became eligible for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal
   (GWOT-EM) between 11 September 2001 to 18 March 2003 can elect to receive either the
   AFEM or GWOT-EM, but they may not be awarded both for the same period.
   6.13.9. Authorized Device: A Service Star will be awarded for participation in subsequent
   operations. Participation in two or more engagements in the same operation does not qualify
   for the service star.

                                           Chapter 7

                        FOREIGN AWARDS AND DECORATIONS

7.1. Definition. A foreign award or decoration is typically a medal, award, or ribbon from a
foreign governmental authority (including any foreign national, state, local, or municipal
government), or any international or multinational organization whose membership is composed
of the agents or representatives of any of these foreign governments, awarded to a single Air
Force member, or in the case of unit awards, awarded to US military units, organizations, or
commands. It is similar in nature to an Air Force decoration or award and normally recognizes
an individual for active combat service or outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.
7.2. Foreign Decoration. Normally, foreign decorations are not awarded to Air Force members
engaged in activities normally undertaken by the Armed Forces of the United States in support of
an ally during peacetime. Not all items tendered by, or received from foreign governments, are
considered by the US government to be foreign decorations. The key factor to determine a
foreign decoration is whether the item is similar in nature to individual decorations awarded by
the US government. To comply with DoD Directive 1005.13 and DoD Manual 1348-33.M, Air
Force members may be required to request acceptance and retention of a foreign award or
decoration.
   7.2.1. Air Force members may accept foreign awards or decorations tendered in recognition
   of active field service in connection with combat operations or awarded for outstanding or
   unusually meritorious performance only upon receiving official approval to accept the award
   or decoration.
   7.2.2. Normally, before an award or decoration is presented to an Air Force general officer,
   senior representatives of the US government are notified initially by representatives of a
   foreign government of the intent to proffer a decoration. At this point, an official
   determination of acceptance is made by representatives of the US government (Department
   of State (DoS), US Embassy, US Defense Attaché Office (USDAO), or Military Command);
   therefore a request to accept and retain foreign award or decoration by general officers is not
   required. All other Air Force personnel and general officers awarded a foreign award or
   decoration without an official determination of acceptance must request authority to accept
   and retain a foreign award or decoration through their servicing MPS.
   7.2.3. Approval Authority. The approval authority evaluates the decoration or award to
   determine its appropriateness and directs the recipient to AFI 36-2903 for uniform wear
   instructions.
       7.2.3.1. The AFPC/DPSIDR approves or disapproves acceptance of an award or
       decoration to an active duty general officer, only if official determination of acceptance
       was not made by representatives of the US government (DoS, US Embassy, USDAO, or
       Military Command) at the time of presentation.
       7.2.3.2. MAJCOM, FOA, DRU Directors of Personnel approve/disapprove acceptance
       for Air Force members (O-6 and below) under their purview.
   7.2.4. Air Force members who have been told a foreign nation has made formal offer of an
   award or decoration to them may participate in a formal presentation ceremony and receive
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  185


  the decoration when accepting the award is not prejudicial to military or national interest.
  The recipient of the foreign award or decoration in this manner does not constitute official
  acceptance, unless an official determination of acceptance was made by a representative of
  the US government (DoS, US Embassy, USDAO, or Military Command). To gain official
  acceptance, the recipient must forward a request to accept and retain the award or decoration
  to the appropriate approval authority. The request must be made through the MPS in
  memorandum format and contain the following information:
     7.2.4.1. Full name, rank, and social security number of the recipient; the title of the
     decoration; the country offering it; the date and place of presentation; the name and title
     of the person making the presentation; the location and organization awarding the
     decoration; a brief description of the act or service performed; and a citation – an English
     translation of the citation is required.
  7.2.5. NATO Meritorious Service Medal (NATO MSM).

Figure 7.1. NATO MSM.




     7.2.5.1. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Meritorious Service Medal was
     established by the North Atlantic Council in 2003 to award military and civilian
     personnel who have been commended for providing exceptional or remarkable service to
     NATO. The award was approved by the Deputy Secretary of Defense for wear by
     member of the Armed Forces of the United States.
     7.2.5.2. Eligible personnel are members serving permanently or temporarily within
     NATO’s operational chain of command or in those forces under NATO command or
     control, or in a NATO Body, who are commended personally by a Commander or a Head
     of a NATO Body for:
         7.2.5.2.1. Performing acts of courage in difficult or dangerous circumstances; or
         7.2.5.2.2. Showing exceptional leadership or personal example; or
         7.2.5.2.3. Making an outstanding individual contribution in any activity or program;
         or
         7.2.5.2.4. Enduring particular hardship or deprivation in the interest of NATO

7.3. Foreign Unit Awards: Air Force units and members may accept a foreign unit award as
listed below or listed in DoD 1348.33-M. Members assigned to the cited unit at any time during
the award period may share in the award. Normally, before a unit award is presented to an Air
Force organization, senior representatives (US Embassy or DAO) of the US government are
notified by representatives of a foreign government of the intent to proffer a unit award to an Air
Force organization. At that point, a determination is made by the senior US representative as to
the propriety of the proffer and whether acceptance is authorized. Foreign unit awards from
common friendly nations may be accepted by USAF organizations without further acceptance
than that afforded by a senior US representative as stated above.
   7.3.1. Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation (PHRPUC).

Figure 7.2. PHRPUC.




       7.3.1.1. The citation was awarded to certain units of the Armed Forces of the United
       States in recognition of participation in the war against the Japanese Empire during the
       periods of 7 December 1941 and 10 May 1942, inclusive, and 17 October 1944 to 4 July
       1945, inclusive. The citation was also awarded to several US military units for
       outstanding service to the Republic of the Philippines in 1970 and 1972 during disaster
       relief operations.
       7.3.1.2. Authorized devices: None. Only one Philippine Republic Presidential Unit
       Citation shall be worn regardless of the number of awards received.

       7.3.3.1. The citation was awarded by the Republic of Vietnam to certain units of the
       Armed Forces of the United States for valorous combat achievement during the Vietnam
       Conflict, inclusive from 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.
       7.3.3.2. Authorized devices: None. Only one Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with
       Palm Unit Citation shall be worn regardless of the number of awards received.
7.4. Foreign Service Award. A Foreign Service award is distinct from a decoration in that
multiple members qualify for it and it is typically awarded for service to a foreign country or
nation. Foreign Service awards are normally offered by a foreign country to Armed Forces of
the United States, and SECDEF accepts on behalf of the Armed Forces of the United States.
Except for the awards listed below, Air Force members will not receive, accept, or make token
acceptance of service awards tendered by foreign governments while they are members of the
US Air Force.

      7.4.5.3. The UN Secretary General determines the amount of service required and
      individual eligibility. UN medals will normally be awarded by the Chief of the U.N.
      Mission to qualifying U.S. service members prior to their departure from service with the
      U.N.
      7.4.5.4. Wear Policy:
          7.4.5.4.1. In the past, Air Force members could accept the unique medal presented by
          the UN for the specific operation, but could only wear the standard UN Medal and
          ribbon, as shown.
          7.4.5.4.2. The Assistant Secretary of Defense approved a revision to the wear policy
          for UN Medals. Air Force members can now accept and wear the first UN Medal
          with the unique suspension and service ribbon for the mission/operation in which they
          qualified for. Only one UN Medal/ribbon (standard or unique) will be worn.
192                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


      7.4.5.5. Authorized Devices: If approved by SECDEF, a bronze service star will be
      affixed to the first UN Medal received for each subsequent UN mission/operation in
      which they participate and qualify for.
  7.4.6. NATO Campaign and Service Medals.
      7.4.6.1. In accordance with Executive Order 11446, SECDEF, with the concurrence of
      the Secretary of State, may approve the acceptance and wear of NATO medals authorized
      by the Secretary General of NATO and offered to the U.S. Representative to NATO to
      recognize U.S. Service members who meet the eligibility criteria specified by NATO.
      7.4.6.2. The NATO Medal shall be worn immediately after the United Nations Medal
      and before the Multinational Force and Observers Medal.
      7.4.6.3. The NATO medal, provided by a NATO representative, may include a ribbon
      clasp denoting the specific operation for which the award was made. U.S. Service
      members are authorized to retain the ribbon clasp if presented; however, U.S. Service
      members are not authorized to wear the ribbon clasp. U.S. Service members may wear
      only the basic medal or service ribbon.
      7.4.6.4. Authorized Devices: U.S. Service members are authorized to wear only one
      NATO medal (first medal received). A bronze service star will be affixed to the NATO
      medal suspension ribbon and service ribbon to recognize participation in subsequent DoD
      approved NATO operations.
      7.4.6.5. Requests for approval of eligibility for individual Service units to wear a specific

 Notes:
 1. Type of Services Recognized. Services must have been completely voluntary and performed as a
 public service or by patriotic motivation with not implication of financial or other remuneration.
 Contractors and technicians of corporations, and organizations that have a commercial or profit-making
 relationship with the Air Force, and render services inherent or implied by contract, do not qualify. If
 appropriate, commanders may recognize such service through award of favorable communications or
 other means of recognition avail- able to them. However, an act of heroism by an employee of any of
 the foregoing is a basis for a recommendation for award of the Exceptional Service Award, provided the
 act benefited the Air Force.
 2. Posthumous awards may be made.
 3. Exceptional Service Award nominations for spouses of 4-star general officers (regardless of position
 at retirement) and 3-star MAJCOM/CC’s will be endorsed by their deputy (e.g. MAJCOM/CV) and
 forwarded to AFPC/DPSIDR for processing.

           VETERAN APPLICATION FOR AWARDS AND DECORATIONS

10.1. Criteria of USAF Veterans Applying for Military Awards and Decorations. Once a
military member retires or separates from US Military service, the veteran’s military record is
archived to an approved storage facility that houses military records. Upon occasion, military
veterans may become eligible for an additional military award or decoration approved by the
Department of Defense or US Service Branch. The USAF has procedures in place in accordance
with governing laws and regulations that would allow US veterans to apply for these earned
entitlements.
10.2. Methods of Application for USAF Veterans for Military Awards and
Decorations. Veterans may apply for military awards they believe they are eligible to receive.
The following procedures should be taken by the veteran:
   10.2.1. For US service members serving from World War II to 31 December 2003: Veterans
   should contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in writing or by submitting a
   Standard Form 180 requesting action since their service record is stored by their facility.
   10.2.2. The veteran may write or contact directly to the appropriate US Service Branch
   served for assistance:

                     Quantico VA 22134
   10.2.3. Veterans may also apply for military awards and decorations through a member of
   the US Congress (i.e., US House of Representatives and the US Senate).
212                                                         AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013


      10.2.3.1. For awards, the veteran may request entitlement through the member of
      Congress. The staff for the member of Congress will submit the request through the US
      Service Branch’s Legislative Liaison Office (LLO). The LLO then forwards the request
      to the appropriate Service Branch for decision. Once a decision is rendered by the US
      Service Branch, a written explanation of the decision is forwarded to the LLO, who in-
      turn, contacts the member of Congress’ staff of the decision.
      10.2.3.2. For decorations, before any request can be considered for veterans, certain
      processing procedures must be followed. The veteran may not be aware, but the timeline
      for submitting decorations is two years from the date of the act or achievement.
      However, under section 1130 of title 10 U.S.C, this timeline has now been waived.
         10.2.3.2.1. Under this Act, which lifted the time limitations on submitting award
         recommendations, and DoD 1348.33-M, service members who may make a case for
         award consideration not previously eligible because of these time limits, may now
         submit for award consideration. However, the written recommendation must meet
         two criteria:
             10.2.3.2.1.1. The request must be made by someone other than the member
             himself, by someone in the member’s chain of command at the time of the
             incident, and, who has firsthand knowledge of the acts or achievements; and,
             10.2.3.2.1.2. The request must be submitted through a congressional member
             who can ask a military service to review a proposal for a decoration based on the
             merits of the proposal and the award criteria in existence when the event occurred.
         10.2.3.2.2. To be reasonably considered under the provisions of this act by the
         military service involved, it is important that the recommendation be accompanied by
         supporting documentation. At a minimum, a recommendation must include:
             10.2.3.2.2.1. Supporting Documentation. If it is not possible to route the award
             recommendation through all the levels of the original chain of command, official
             military documents such as unit logs, situation reports, investigations, after-action
             reports, fitness reports, and/or evaluations, must be included to aid in
             substantiating the actions delineated in the award recommendation. Since
             determinations regarding awards are based on verifiable facts, other forms of
             information such as letters, books, newspaper and magazine articles, and personal
             diaries would not be considered, as they are not official documents, but may be
             included to provide additional context.
             10.2.3.2.2.2. Summary of Action. A summary of action that provides a detailed
             description of the actions or service performed by the individual or unit being
             considered for recognition.
             10.2.3.2.2.3. Citation. A proposed citation.
             10.2.3.2.2.4. Notarized Eyewitness Statements. For all individual combat
             awards, notarized eyewitness statements, with contact information for the
             eyewitnesses, must be submitted. These statements must contain a complete
             description of the individual’s actions and must be in the eyewitnesses’ own
             words, not on a prepared form. The individual being recommended for the award
AFI36-2803 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   213


             may not submit a statement.
             10.2.3.2.2.5. A decoration checklist is provided at figure 10.1 to assist the veteran
             should a decoration be submitted.
         10.2.3.2.3. Should the veteran need assistance in obtaining information or filing a
         decoration recommendation, we suggest they contact their local Veterans
         Administration (VA) for assistance or go to their website: http://www.va.gov.
   10.2.4. The following sources for members seeking information for filing decoration

          medical records of discharged and deceased veterans of all services during the 20th
          century.
          10.2.4.2.2. Information from the records is made available upon written request to
          the extent allowed by law. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (section 552a of
          title 5 U.S.C.) and Department of Defense directives require a written request, signed
          (in cursive) and dated (within the last year), to access information from military
          personnel records. For this reason, no requests are accepted by e-mail. To request
          information via the Internet, NARA has the following website:
          http://www.archives.gov/veterans/evetrecs. Read through the instructions on the
          page, and initiate your request by clicking on the “REQUEST MILITARY
          RECORDS” button.
          10.2.4.2.3. Authorized third party requesters, e.g. lawyers, doctors, historians, etc.,
          may submit written requests for information from individual’s records with the
          veteran’s (or next of kin’s) signed and dated authorization.
          10.2.4.2.4. Certain basic information is needed to locate military service records.
          Standard Form (SF) 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, captures all the
          necessary information to locate a record. It can be printed off the website referenced
          above or obtained from your local Veterans Administration. You can also e-mail
          NPRC at the above INQUIRE e-mail address and request the form by form number.
          Include any additional questions you might have and be sure to provide your mailing
          address.
          10.2.4.2.5. Requests related to the issuance or replacement of medals and awards
          should be sent to the above address. Once received, NPRC will verify entitlement
          and annotate the awards and decorations to be sent to the individual on a National
          Archives (NA) Form 13059, Transmittal of and/or Entitlement to Awards. The NA
          Form 13059 is sent to the Air Force Personnel Center, Awards and Decorations
          Medals Room, who compile the medal sets and mail them to the individual.
          Response time varies and is dependent upon the complexity of your request, the
          availability of records, and the workload at NPRC. Do not send a follow-up request
          before 90 days have elapsed.

          documents of various joint and combined commands; miscellaneous documents or
          collection of various organizations, including the U.S. Army, British Air Ministry,
          and German Air Force; USAF individual aircraft record cards; and a large collection
          of material relating to USAF activities in the war in Southeast Asia and Operations
          Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
          10.2.4.3.4. Unit histories, if available, will be on 16mm microfilm. Many college
          and public libraries have microfilm readers/printers. The cost for each roll of
          microfilm is US $30.00. Keep in mind when ordering microfilm, there is no
          guarantee you will locate the document(s) or information you are trying to find.

          10.2.4.5.1. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) Worldwide Locator has access to
          the Military Personnel Data System listing of active and retired Air Force members.
          You may forward a letter to an active or retired member by placing a letter in a
          stamped envelope with a return address, and enclosing that envelope inside a larger
          one addressed to: AFPC/DSW1-WWL, 550 C Street West, Suite 50, Randolph AFB
          TX 78150-4752.

          10.2.4.5.2. You should include the name and present or former grade of any
          individual(s) you want to reach. There is a $3.50 research fee for each letter
          forwarded. A check or money order payable to "DAO-DE RAFB" must accompany
          the personal request. When correspondence is received, from an individual trying to
          locate a member for personal reasons, the contractor shall research the location of the
          addressee and forward a letter to the individual informing them of the name, address
          and phone number of the individual trying to locate them. This fee may be waived
          for military personnel (active duty, reserve, and retired) and their immediate families,
          but the requester must provide military identification (copy of an identification [ID]
          card) to obtain the waiver. Locator personnel will forward the letter(s) or return it if
          they do not have the forwarding address.
   10.2.5. Correction of Military Records. The last option a veteran has to apply or appeal a
   decision by a US Service Branch for awards and decorations entitlement is a submission of
   the DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record under the provisions of
   section 1552 of title 10 U.S.C. Initialization of this form begins the process is the highest
   administrative review board of the US Service Branches and are the authorities in making
   adjudication to a veteran's military personnel record. This option should only be utilized
   once a veteran exhausts all administrative avenues offered by the US Service Branch in
   question to correct the discrepancy or injustice. The form is self-explanatory and submission
   of the form into official military channels for action should be sent to the particular US
   Service Branch's address on the back of the DD Form 149.
