SUMMARY OF CHANGES
                                       INTRODUCTION

This publication will be used in conjunction with hands on training to familiarize air
traffic controllers with the operation of RAU equipment.

        REQUEST AND ACKNOWLEDGE (RAU) OPERATION
RAU communications consists of voice and visual signal coordination. Voice
communications are provided on an on-demand basis that instantaneously connects
selected users without interfering with other ongoing operations. Visual signals are
provided to allow selected users in the RADAR and Tower to coordinate aircraft
approach and landing with minimal use of voice and without interfering with other
ongoing operations. The RAU functions are enabled or disabled through the Supervisor
Configuration Terminal (SCT) or Maintenance Configuration Terminal (MCT) computer.

The RAU feature provides for two types of Touch Entry Display (TED) screen layouts:

   • RADAR TED Display
   The RADAR position TED display will employ the key layout shown in figure 1.
   This display provides seven light coordination buttons and up to two Push-To-Talk
   (PTT) buttons used to activate the shout line to selected Tower RAU positions.

   • Mini TED Display
   The Tower position display will employ the key layout shown in Figure 2. This
   display provides seven light coordination buttons as shown and up to eight PTT
   buttons used to activate the shout line to selected RADAR positions.

  Figure 3. Light Coordination System (LCD) Button Color Codes
1. Light Coordination System Buttons.

The Light Coordination System (LCS) buttons shown in Figure 3 are color coded, and
generally not labeled. The RAU light coordination function provides a means for a
RADAR RAU and Tower RAU operator to communicate the status of an incoming flight
through the use of visual indicators without requiring landline coordination.
The RADAR RAU page displays seven light coordination buttons for visual signal
communications between RAU RADAR and RAU Tower positions. Each light
coordination button is color coded in white, amber, green or red. An active white button
indicates the arriving aircraft has reached a specified point from the runway (normally 15
flying miles). A flashing amber button indicates the aircraft is (a minimum) of seven
miles from touchdown or the end of the runway and the radar controller is requesting
tower approval for the aircraft to continue. A flashing green button indicates the aircraft
is (a minimum) of four miles from the end of the runway on final approach. A flashing
red button cancels the clearance for aircraft on radar final approach.

The light coordination system shall consist of two columns of colored selectors. The
column in the left, represents the primary aircraft, shall contain, from bottom to top,
primary white, amber, and green range lights, along with a red indicator light. The
column in the right, represents the secondary aircraft, shall contain, from bottom to top,
secondary white, amber, and green range lights.
Note: Steady lights indicate acknowledgement and/or approval.
Note: Unless otherwise stated, the red light applies only to the first aircraft on radar final
approach.

2. PTT Buttons

The RAU employs PTT buttons to activate the shout line between the Tower and
RADAR positions. These selectors are programmable from the SCT.
The Tower position has up to eight shout selectors that individually address one of the
eight RADAR RAU positions. The RADAR positions each have (up to) two shout
selectors that individually address one of the two Tower RAU positions. The RAU PTT
buttons are non-locking in behavior and must be held in the activated mode to maintain
the audio connection between Tower and RADAR positions. Release of the PTT button
will release the audio connection automatically. This PTT selector is separate and
distinct from the radio PTT buttons and bears no relation to them. When only one
selector is pressed in either the Tower or RADAR, a one-way audio connection is
established to the destination. If the called operator wishes to establish a two-way audio
connection, both operators must depress the respective shout line PTT buttons to
communicate.

When an incoming call is received at a position, the PTT button at the called position will
provide an indication; a green bar located below the position name of the PTT button of
the called position, and remains illuminated until the call is released by the distant end.
The button will bear the name of the calling position as assigned by the local ETVS SCT.

When a PTT button is pressed at a position to establish a one-way audio connection to the
other facility, the pressed button will provide an indication, a green bar located below the
position name of the PTT button of the called position, and remain indicating until the
call is released by the calling party. If the call is made from a RADAR position, the
corresponding Tower button in all other RADAR positions will provide an indication, a
red bar located below the position name of the RAU RADAR PTT button, to show that
the audio shout line is in use by the indicated position. If the call is made from a Tower
position, the corresponding RADAR button in the other Tower position will provide an
indication, a red bar located below the position name of the RAU PTT button, to show
that the audio shout line is in use by the other Tower position. When a circuit is in use, all
other users will be locked out from selecting the shout line selectors. Any user can
operate the light coordination features at any time.

The green bar of the PTT selector will illuminate when a call is received and provide a
visual indication of the calling position. The green bar of the PTT selector will also
flutter green when pushed and provide a visual busy-in use indication (illuminated red
bars of the PTT buttons of the indicated calling positions) to other units in the same
facility (RADAR or Tower).

An RAU PTT call to an RAU RADAR position that has its RAU feature disabled will
produce a busy signal from the RAU Tower speaker.

3. RAU Chime Alert

An LCS state change from extinguished to flashing will cause a chime alert at a Tower
RAU position(s). A series of one-beep tones with a two-second delay between one-beep
tones is for the WHITE LCS; a series of two-beep tones with two seconds delay between
two-beep tones is for the AMBER LCS, a series of three-beep tones with two seconds
delay between three-beep tones is for the GREEN LCS, and a series of loud, penetrating
whistles is for the RED LCS. The chime alert can be recorded.

There is no chime to sound at any RAU RADAR during any LCS changing states.

4. RAU and Other Audio Interaction

The RAU shout line connection is handled as a telephone (IP or interphone) connection.

   a.   Intercom Call: Depressing and holding a flashing RAU PTT button that
        associated with an RAU PTT call will terminate any intercom call that is in
        progress at that position unless the in-progress call is placed on hold first. As a
        result, whenever the RAU shout line is used, no IC or IP calls should be in
        progress at the calling position – they should either be disconnected or placed on
        hold before the RAU shout selector (PTT button) is pressed.

   b.   Call Forwarding: RAU PTT call cannot be forwarded.

   c.   Call Monitor: Call monitor will be on hold until the RAU PTT call is
        terminated.

   d.   Call Override: Depressing and holding a flashing RAU PTT button that
        associated with an RAU PTT call will not terminate the call override that is in
        progress at that position. At the RAU position that receives the RAU PTT call,
           the audio generated from the call override and the RAU PTT audio can be heard
           at the same time.

   e.      Conference Call:

         (1) RAU PTT call cannot be conferred.

         (2) Depressing and holding a flashing RAU PTT button that associated with an
           RAU PTT call will terminate any Conference call that is in progress at that
           position.

   f.      Call on Hold: Depressing and holding a flashing RAU PTT button that is
           associated with an RAU PTT call will not interrupt any call that is on hold at that
           position. Call on hold won’t be terminated after a PTT call.

   g.      Radio Call: Radio transmissions will not be affected by the RAU operation
           because separate PTT controls are used to transmit over radio interfaces.

         (1) Depressing and holding a flashing RAU PTT button that is associated with an
           RAU PTT call will not terminate the radio call that is in progress at that position.
           At the RAU position that receives the RAU PTT call, the radio audio and the
           RAU PTT audio can be heard at the same time.

         (2) Radio earpiece audio in the RADAR is transferred to the position speaker upon
           answer of an IP or IC call if the global ETVS setting (HSLS) is enabled. IP and
           IC audio in the earpiece is transferred to the position speaker when a radio PTT is
           activated. If an IP or IC call is in progress when the RAU shout line PTT
           selector is depressed, the IP or IC call will be released. RAU audio routing will
           follow the ground-to-ground (G/G) audio routing rules since the RAU shout line
           is considered a G/G call.

   h.      Telephone Call: At an RAU position, depressing and holding a flashing RAU
           PTT button that is associated with an RAU PTT call will terminate any phone
           call that is in progress at that position.

5. Light Coordination Operation Requirements

The following are the requirements for the light coordination functions of the RAU.

   a.      Selector Activation and Use Sequence. Any selector will follow the sequence
           described below:

        (1) Only RAU RADAR positions can activate the range lights (White, Amber and
            Green) of both primary and secondary columns from an extinguished state to a
            flashing state.

        (2) A first activation of any selector from an extinguished state to a flashing state at
            any RAU RADAR position shall cause that selector to flash at all RAU
            RADAR and RAU Tower positions.
 (3) Only RAU Tower positions can activate the range lights in both primary and
     secondary columns from a flashing state to a steady-on state.

 (4) An activation of any selector from a flashing state to a steady-on state at any
     RAU RADAR position shall cause that selector to become steady-on at all
     RAU RADAR and RAU Tower positions.

 (5) An activation of any selector from a steady-on state to an extinguished state at
     any RAU RADAR or RAU Tower position shall cause that selector to be
     extinguished at ALL RAU RADAR and RAU Tower positions.


b.    Selector Sequence Interaction

In additional to the standard behavior described above in Selector Activation and Use
Sequence, the light coordination selectors will follow a predefined operation when the
following inputs are provided.

     (1) The secondary selector (right column) CANNOT be selected until the
         primary selector (left column) of the same row has been activated.

     (2) Extinguishing a primary selector (left column) causes the light indication of
         the secondary (right column) in that row to move, in the same state it had
         previously been, to its primary selector, when the light of primary selector is
         in steady-on state and secondary selector is in any combination of being in a
         flashing or steady-on state.

     (3) The first activation of an amber or green primary selector (left column) from
         an extinguished state to a flashing state shall cause any steady-on primary
         selector immediately below it to be extinguished.

     (4) If both primary (left column) and secondary (right column) selectors of the
         same row are illuminated, only the secondary will extinguish upon activation
         of the next higher primary selector.

     (5) Activation of the secondary selector (right column) will cause the primary
         selector (left column) immediately below it to be extinguished when the
         primary selector in the same row is steady-on.

     (6) Any RAU RADAR or RAU Tower position can cancel a RED indication
         activated by an RAU Tower position and acknowledged by an RAU RADAR
         position.

     (7) A RED indication activated by the RAU RADAR position and acknowledged
         by an RAU Tower position can only be cancelled by the RAU Tower position
         or the RAU RADAR position that activated the Red button.
6. Light Coordination and Interaction

   a. The light symbols are displayed below (Green, Amber, and White). Blue indicates
   that the light is extinguished.

              Green               Amber             White


        To generate a flashing state for a range light (Green, Amber and White), select an
        RAU range light button at extinguished state. This will cause the light indications
        of this button and the other selectors corresponding with this button, to flash at the
        RAU RADAR and RAU Tower positions.

        To generate a steady-on state for a range light (Green, Amber and White), select
        an RAU range light button at extinguished state. This will cause the light
        indications of this button and the other selectors corresponding with this button, to
        flash at the RAU RADAR and RAU Tower positions. From an RAU Tower
        position, activate the flashing button. The light indication at the RAU RADAR and
        RAU Tower positions will become steady-on.

   b.    After LCS activation at RAU RADAR or RAU Tower positions, the lights are
         displayed as follows:
