          inoperative due to equipment failure and during emergency conditions. Constant
          surveillance can be conducted by the driver of the truck or a designated person of
          owning agency.
          2.2.8.2. Security of shipments within the airfield fence (Stub 8B or Hot Cargo Pads
          1-4) will be achieved using a combination of owner/user security, normal controlled
          area observation of the airfield by Tower, Maintenance, and other airfield personnel.
          Observation from SFS and OSS by airfield camera (when available) will also be
          utilized. Security of shipments on Stub 8A will be provided by the driver of the truck
          and periodic checks by SFS (during non-duty hours, awaiting receipt by LGRTTF
          personnel).
          2.2.8.3. Shipments shall be checked upon receipt by 88 MSG/LGRTTF to ensure
          seals are intact and for any signs of theft, tampering or damage. If there are such signs
          an immediate inventory shall be performed to determine the extent of theft/loss,
          tampering or damage. If seals are intact inventory quantity verification of Security
          Risk CAT I and II shipments shall be conducted within 24 hours upon receipt.
          Security Risk CAT III and IV shall be subject to inventory verification within 48
          hours. The 88 MSG/LGRTTF has primary responsible for security upon accepting
