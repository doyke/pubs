Supersedes AFMCI21-302, 24 July 2002                                                                        Pages: 25

This instruction provides Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) implementing instructions for a process
of the Air Force Technical Order (TO) System established by AFPD 21-3, Technical Orders, AFI 21-303,
Technical Orders, and 00-5-series TOs. It assigns responsibilities and establishes procedures for develop-
ing, coordinating, approving and distributing Interim Technical Orders (ITOs) and Rapid Action Changes
(RACs). This instruction applies to United States Air Force (USAF) and Security Assistance Program
(SAP)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) systems and equipment. AFMC air logistics and product centers
(ALC and PC) may supplement this instruction. A copy of each supplement issued must be provided to
HQ AFMC/A4YE Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This change includes additional applicable publications, adds a requirement for issuers to perform
advance telephonic notification of release for formal Immediate and Urgent Action Time Compliance
Technical Order (TCTOs), transfers responsibility for Interim Time Compliance Technical Order
(ITCTO) advance notification from HQ AFMC/A8C to HQ AFMC/A4YE, corrects the 754 ELSG/ILMT
office title, updates attachments, adds modifications to Attachment 4, ITCTO Checklist to ensure Pro-
gram Managers comply with Safety and Technical Order policy in the TCTO risk assessment/acceptance
and notification processes, simplifies advance notification process to a 3-step process, and clarifies that
advance notification is not the same as ITO distribution. The term “Program Manager (PM)” previously
referred to as the “Single Manager (SM)” is used herein for consistency with DoD policy and documenta-
tion. The PM is considered the sole or final authority within an organization for a group or particular pro-
gram.

1. Types and Uses of ITOs and RACs:
   1.1. Description. ITOs are either priority changes to TOs or priority Time Compliance TOs (TCTO).
   IOSs/ISSs/RACs are issued to resolve deficiencies of an Emergency or Urgent nature (see TO
   00-5-3). They may revise procedures and/or restrict item use to known-safe areas of operation/flight
   envelopes. Immediate or Urgent ITCTOs or ITCTO Supplements direct one-time inspections, remove
   or deactivate defective subsystems or components, replace hazardous materials, or remove systems/
   end items from service, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard.
NOTE: See TO 00-5-3, AF Technical Order Life Cycle Management, for general procedures for issuing
ITOs and RACs. Use the advance notification procedures of this AFMCI in conjunction with the TO.
      1.1.1. Interim Operational Supplement (IOS): Issue IOSs when circumstances preclude timely
      publication of a formal TO update. Emergency IOSs are issued when the using command is unable
      to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION ESSENTIAL) or there is a field-level work
      stoppage. Urgent IOSs are issued for situations that reduce operational efficiency or probability of
      mission accomplishment, provide replacements for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) haz-
      ardous materials (HAZMAT) and ozone depleting substances (ODS), or could result in over
      $25,000 or 1,000 man-hours annual savings to the Air Force.
      1.1.2. Interim Safety Supplement (ISS): Issue ISSs when circumstances preclude timely publica-
      tion of a formal TO update. Issue Emergency ISSs when safety conditions would result in a fatal-
      ity or serious injury to personnel, or when extensive damage or destruction of equipment or
      property is involved. Issue Urgent ISSs when safety conditions could cause a fatality or serious
      injury to personnel, or when extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property is
      involved.
      1.1.3. Rapid Action Changes (RAC): RACs are fully-formatted TO changes distributed electron-
      ically. See TOs 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System and 00-5-3, Technical Order Life Cycle Man-
      agement, for RAC procedures. RACs are used in place of IOSs and ISSs to update TOs only.
      RACs require the same coordination, advance notification and approval as the equivalent interim
      supplement. Issue when update timelines cannot be met by a routine in-work change or if it is not
      cost effective to produce an out-of-cycle change.
      1.1.4. Interim Time Compliance Technical Orders (ITCTO) and ITCTO Supplements: ITCTOs
      are issued in the types listed below. They will not be replaced by formal TCTOs or formal supple-
      ments.
          1.1.4.1. Immediate Action ITCTO: Issue when safety conditions would result in a fatality or
          serious injury to personnel or extensive damage to or destruction of equipment or property.
          1.1.4.2. Urgent Action ITCTO with a 1-10 day compliance period: Issue when combat neces-
          sity or potentially hazardous conditions could result in injury to personnel, damage to property
          or unacceptable reductions in operational efficiency.
          1.1.4.3. Routine Safety Inspection ITCTO with an 11-35 day compliance period: They may be
          either non-kitted or issued with an approved waiver to the complete kit concept from the appli-
          cable using major command (MAJCOM) logistics office. Issue when a deficiency and or
          affected parts have been identified, but does not impose conditions of either an Immediate or
          Urgent Action ITCTO and would not result in a reduction in operational capability.

           1.1.4.4. Record ITCTO: Issued only for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) and asso-
           ciated Support Equipment (SE) (See TO 00-5-15).
           1.1.4.5. Routine ITCTOs: Routine-Software only TCTOs may be issued as ITCTOs..
           1.1.4.6. ITCTO Supplements: Issue when the basic TCTO was issued as an interim or there is
           an urgent need to change or stop compliance with a formal TCTO. Routine ITCTO supple-
           ments may also be issued for the purpose of extending formal TCTO rescission dates.
    1.2. IOS/ISS/RAC Timelines.
       1.2.1. An IOS/ISS/RAC must be issued within 48 hours after receipt of an Emergency report or
       within 40 calendar days after receipt of an Urgent report (see TO 00-5-1). An IOS must be issued
       within 72 hours after receipt of a Work Stoppage Emergency report. If an IOS/ISS/RAC is issued
       in conjunction with an ITCTO, the ITCTO timelines apply. Emergency IOS/ISS/RAC and Imme-
       diate Action ITCTO messages shall be sent using Immediate message precedence. Emergency
       RAC notification messages are sent using Immediate precedence and must be delivered within 2
       hours of receipt. Urgent notification messages are sent using Priority precedence, requiring deliv-
       ery as soon as possible during duty hours.
       1.2.2. Replace an ISS with a TO change or revision within 40 days of ISS release. Include IOSs/
       RACs in the next routine update (TO 00-5-1). EXCEPTION: ISSs and IOSs issued to provide
       temporary instructions (for example, restrictions to operating parameters pending completion of a
       TCTO, use of prototype equipment for flight test, etc.) may remain active until completion of the
       task or project or for 30 months, whichever is shorter.
    1.3. ITCTO Timelines. ITCTOs must be issued within a maximum of 24 hours for Immediate and
    48 hours for Urgent action situations (see TO 00-5-15, AF Time Compliance Technical Order). ITC-
    TOs must either provide a fix within that time, or provide instructions to "safe" the system or com-
    modity. When a fix is determined, it will be issued as a new TCTO or an ITCTO supplement.
    1.4. Security Assistance Program (SAP)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Support.
       1.4.1. IOSs/ISSs/RACs are issued to all customers, including SAP/FMS, authorized to receive the
       USAF TO. If Country Standard TOs have been developed, a separate IOS/ISS/ RAC must be
       developed for each.
       1.4.2. All ITCTOs must be approved for release by the Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) support-
       ing the responsible activity before transmission to foreign governments. A single ITCTO may be
       structured and issued to both USAF users and SAP/FMS countries authorized release when effec-
       tivity data and degraded mission capabilities are not identifiable by country. When one ITCTO
       cannot be released to all users, appropriate Interim Country Standard TCTOs must be issued (see
       TO 00-5-19, Security Assistance Technical Order Program).
       1.4.3. SAP/FMS customers must be notified by any means available of the imminent release of
       critical IOS/ISS/RAC and ITCTO messages.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. Program Manager (PM). The PM is responsible for ensuring and preserving the operational
    safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) of the system or end item throughout the operational
    life, per DoD Directive [DODD] 5000.1, Defense Acquisition System and AFPD 63-12, Assurance of
AFMCI21-302 19 DECEMBER 2007                                                                         5


   Operational Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness. The PM’s organization responsible for the affected
   weapon system or end item is called the "responsible activity" in this instruction. The responsible
   activity researches, develops, coordinates, obtains release approval and distributes, IOSs/ISSs/RACs
   and ITCTOs. The PM performs required advance notifications according to Attachment 3 for ITC-
   TOs and Attachment 5 for IOSs/ISSs/RACs. The Development System Manager (DSM) or Support
   System Manager (SSM), as applicable, makes required advance notifications at their locations.
   2.2. Chief Engineer. The chief engineer is responsible and accountable to the PM for consistent
   application of a disciplined engineering process IAW AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Engineering to ensure
   the system’s or commodity's OSS&E baselines are preserved for the life of the program. The chief
   engineer must coordinate on and approve all IOSs/ISSs/RACs, and ITCTOs affecting systems and end
   items for which they have technical responsibility.
   2.3. TO Managers/Flight Manual Managers (FMMs -AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program).
   Issue all IOSs/ISSs/RACs, and ITCTOs affecting the assigned weapon system/commodity. If Auto-
   mated Message Handling System (AMHS) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail will be
   used to distribute IOSs/ISSs/RACs or ITCTOs to all affected TO-using activities, the TO Manager
   will establish and monitor AMHS Address Lists (AL) or personal distribution lists (PDLs). When the
   TO manager/FMM is not assigned to the PM organization, the PM will appoint an in-house function
   to establish and monitor ALs and PDLs.
NOTE: Unsigned, unencrypted SMTP e-mail can only be used for transmitting restricted-distribution
Interim TOs, RACs or ITCTOs behind (inside) the base firewall. Any messages containing restricted-dis-
tribution data (codes B-F and X) being sent outside the firewall must be digitally signed and encrypted
using Common Access Card (CAC) or External Certification Authority (ECA) certificates (Outlook or
AMHS (see AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information and TO 00-5-3).
   2.4. Technical Content Managers (TCM)/Equipment Specialists (ESs). Evaluate accident/inci-
   dent reports and TO Recommended Changes (RC), then develop and coordinate IOSs/ISSs/RACs and
   ITCTOs when required.
   2.5. HQ AFMC:
       2.5.1. The Supply Engineering and Technical Data Branch, HQ AFMC/A4YE, manages the
       “Advance Notification of Release” process to inform Air Force, AFMC and MAJCOM senior
       management of an IOS/ISS/RAC or ITCTO release; the content of the Air Force Knowledge Now
       (AFKN) IOS/ISS/RAC and ITCTO submission web pages; and, in conjunction with HQ AFMC/
       A8C, resolves any error messages.
       2.5.2. The Flight Safety Division, HQ AFMC/SEF, will notify Air Force Safety Points of Contact
       (POC) according to Attachment 3.
       2.5.3. The AFMC Command Center, HQ AFMC/OPSO/A3XC will notify HQ AFMC/CC/CV/
       CA/A4 by telecon to confirm receipt of Advance Notification e-mails. They will also notify the
       Air Force Operations Center (AFOC) via an Operations Report-3B (OPREP) BEELINE require-
       ment in accordance with Attachment 3 or Attachment 5, as applicable.
   2.6. TO-Using Organizations. Distribute copies of incoming ITOs or notification messages to all
   affected base activities not included in the AL or PDL. Organizations omitted from ALs or PDLs who
   have a need for ITOs will notify the responsible activity to include them for future distribution.
6                                                                 AFMCI21-302 19 DECEMBER 2007


3. Procedures (See Flowchart, Attachment 7). IOSs/ISSs/RACs are usually prepared by the TCM/ES
of the basic TO. ITO preparation may be delegated to an overflow contractor or the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM). ITCTOs for specific commodities will be developed by the equipment specialist
responsible for that commodity or an assigned alternate, even though they might not be the TCM for the
basic TO.
    3.1. Development. Once an emergency or urgent situation is identified, the responsible activity eval-
    uates it for alternative courses of action. If the hazards or mission limitations can be resolved by a TO
    change, an IOS/ISS/RAC should be issued as appropriate. If there must be an inspection or a configu-
    ration change to the system or equipment, issue an ITCTO.
       3.1.1. IOS and ISS content and format shall be in accordance with (IAW) the examples contained
       in TO 00-5-1. ITCTO format shall be IAW the examples contained in TO 00-5-15; content shall
       be as specified in MIL-PRF-38804, Performance Specification, Time Compliance Technical
       Orders – Preparation. RACs will be formatted as closely as possible to the manuals they update,
       and will include a new title page and List of Effective Pages (LEP), as well as unchanged backing
       pages for each change page included. IOSs/ISSs/RACs and ITCTO Supplements applicable to
       TOs/TCTOs distributed digitally must be in the same application program format as the TO itself.
       RACs must be merged with the TO file, and IOSs and ISSs must be attached to the file and digi-
       tally linked to the affected TO procedures.
       3.1.2. Obtain the appropriate TO numbers and data codes from the TO Manager. Research and
       develop the revised TO instructions, verify them according to TO 00-5-3, and coordinate them as
       required by this instruction. Prepare a replacement interim or formal update if previously pub-
       lished IOSs and ISSs must be changed before it is incorporated (RACs are incorporated upon
       issue). Enter all TO updates into the Joint Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support
       (JCALS) system using the “Recommend a TM Change” process.
       3.1.3. The following procedures apply to ITCTOs only:
           3.1.3.1. When an ITCTO is commodity driven, the commodity’s responsible activity prepares
           and issues the companion ITCTOs for all impacted systems, sub-systems and platforms, after
           obtaining the inspection, removal or replacement instructions from the affected PM organiza-
           tions. Companion ITCTOs will reference the commodity ITCTO that provided the fix (see TO
           00-5-15).
           3.1.3.2. The TCM will complete the ITCTO checklist (Attachment 4) and provide a copy
           when requesting approval to release the ITCTO. The AFTO Form 82, TCTO Verification Cer-
           tificate, AFTO FORM 873, Time Compliance Technical Order Requirements; AFMC Form
           874, Time Compliance Technical Order Supply Data Requirements; and AFMC Form 875,
           Time Compliance Technical Order Programming Document, must be completed for every
           ITCTO, but may be completed after ITCTO issue. A TCTO Master Record will be created in
           the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), and pushed to affected units
           IAW TO 00-5-15. Prepare a replacement ITCTO or ITCTO supplement (as appropriate,
           according to TO 00-5-15) if the information in a published ITCTO or supplement must be cor-
           rected. When appropriate, obtain a waiver to the complete kit concept and/or verification by
           performance in accordance with TO 00-5-15.
           3.1.3.3. Prepare a concurrent IOS/ISS/RAC (as appropriate) to update operations and mainte-
           nance TOs changed by an ITCTO or ITCTO supplement (see TO 00-5-15).
AFMCI21-302 19 DECEMBER 2007                                                                            7


   3.2. Advance Notifications: The advance notification process consists of three basic steps (see
   Attachment 8): (1) PM releases the ITCTO, IOS/ISS/RAC Advance Notification E-mail via the Sub-
   mission web pages IAW Attachment 3 or Attachment 5; (2) PM calls the AFMC Command Center
   to confirm receipt of e-mail and notifies Command Center of OPREP requirement if applicable; and
   (3) AFMC Command Center calls AFMC/CC/CV/CA/A4 Execs and submits an OPREP-3B (BEE-
   LINE) voice report to the Air Force Operations Center, AF/AFOC, within 15 minutes (goal) if the
   ITCTO involves grounding weapon system assets IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Table
   3.4, Rule 1E.
      3.2.1. Immediate and Urgent ITCTOs require advance notifications according to Attachment 3.
      Immediate and Urgent IOSs/ISSs/RACs which restrict any Air Force operational weapon system
      from full capability or operational readiness require advance notifications in accordance with
      Attachment 5.
      3.2.2. Programs issuing formal Emergency and Urgent Operational and Safety Supplements and
      formal Urgent Action TCTOs which restrict weapons systems from full capability must also use
      the advance notifications in Attachment 3 and Attachment 5.
   3.3. Approval and Release. Approval and release levels are listed in Attachment 2. The TO Man-
   agement or FMM divisions shall be the only PM functions allowed to release approved ITOs/RACs.
   Each ITO/RAC shall be signed out by the senior TO Manager/FMM. This responsibility may be del-
   egated to a subordinate TO Manager or FMM, but no lower within the organization. The PM may del-
   egate ITO/RAC development and release authority to the contractor responsible for TO management
   when operating under a contract such as Total System Performance and Support Responsibility
   (TSPSR). Other PM personnel shall not issue ITOs or RACs affecting maintenance or flight manual
   TO content. Emergency suspension or rescission of an ITO/RAC will be approved at the same level as
   the original ITO/RAC approval. The Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) ITCTO Submission web
   page (see Attachment 3) and AFKN IOS/ISS/RAC Submission web page (see Attachment 5) con-
   tain the forms for preparing and submitting Advance Notification e-mails.
   3.4. Indexing. The TO Manager will index ITOs and RACs in JCALS as quickly as possible after the
   message is transmitted. ITOs will be listed in the next update of the Air Force TO Catalog, with a “Y”
   in the “INT IND” (Interim Indicator) column. RACs will be listed as regular changes.
NOTE: There are some types of TOs not indexed or managed in JCALS, e.g., Explosive Ordinance Dis-
posal (EOD) and Nuclear Weapon TOs. These procedures apply to ITOs and ITCTOs for those TO types,
and will be indexed in their respective Catalogs/indexes.
   3.5. Distribution. The TO Manager distributes ITOs and RACs approved for release using any
   method which will meet the required timelines and security protection. Electronic Distribution Proce-
   dures are contained in TO 00-5-3. The “Advance Notice of Release” message (Attachment 3 and
   Attachment 5) shall NOT be used as a substitute for ITO/RAC distribution. ITOs and RACs are
   issued as multiple addressee messages, and confirmation of receipt is requested by selecting the
   “Delivery Receipt” option in Outlook and/or AMHS. Retain a digital copy of every ITO and RAC
   issued for the weapon system/commodity, to facilitate follow-on distribution to field users not receiv-
   ing the Initial Distribution (ID). These copies may be disposed of two years after they have been
   superseded or rescinded. Ensure ITOs/RACs are sent to the TO Archives (see TO 00-5-3).
      3.5.1. Establish and maintain ALs or PDLs for ITO and RAC notification message distribution
      according to AFMAN 33-326, AFMCS1, Preparing Official Communications, and TO 00-5-1.
8                                                                AFMCI21-302 19 DECEMBER 2007


       The TO Manager developing them is the AL/PDL owner, and is responsible for determining all
       TO-using activities for a specific Mission/Design/Series (MDS) or type of equipment. Other PM
       personnel may use ALs/PDLs for dissemination of other administrative and technical information
       about the weapon system or commodity program.
           3.5.1.1. A separate AL or PDL shall be used for each separate weapon system MDS or major
           commodity series. This will preclude units having one MDS/type of equipment from receiving
           unneeded ITOs or RAC notifications on an MDS/type of equipment they do not possess. ITOs
           and RAC notifications that pertain to more than one MDS (e.g., ITCTOs numbered with a
           “base” header such as “1F-16-XXX”) will be addressed to multiple lists.
           3.5.1.2. Commodity TO Managers in “basket” program offices may establish their own lists,
           use lists established for other logistics purposes, or use the lists of the weapon systems
           employing their equipment. The TO Manager must obtain permission from the owner to use
           an AL/PDL belonging to another activity, and is responsible for coordinating with the owner
           to ensure that all applicable TO users are included in the list.
           3.5.1.3. AMHS addresses for each activity are contained in the Directory Information Tree
           (DIT) (similar to the Global Address List for SMTP e-mail addresses). The minimum required
           addressees for each unit on the distribution list is determined by the availability of AMHS
           accounts, but whenever possible shall be the Operations Group, Logistics Group and Commu-
           nications Group Commanders.
           3.5.1.4. The TO Manager will include other services, Military Assistance Groups (MAGs - for
           FMS), and affected defense contractors in the AL/PDL as applicable. Include special distribu-
           tion addressees (Attachment 6). Process requested additions, changes and deletions to the
           AL/PDL immediately upon receipt.
           3.5.1.5. Addressees not on the AMHS system may be included in AL/PDLs using Plain Lan-
           guage Addresses (PLA). The PM (TO Manager) may develop other means of communication
           with non- AMHS customers such as facsimile, overnight mail, etc.
           3.5.1.6. In order for the ITCTO, IOS, ISS distribution and RAC notification processes
           detailed in this instruction to work effectively, it is imperative that TO Managers and MAJ-
           COMs aggressively manage their lists by periodically reviewing the JCALS “Generate ID
           Report by Publication” function on assigned TOs, and by consultation with using command
           action officers or other PM personnel to confirm that all users are in fact included on the list
           being utilized.
    3.6. RAC Notifications. When a RAC is issued, the TO Manager or FMM responsible for the TO
    will notify affected TO users that the RAC is available and how to obtain it. The notification message
    will be sent using any method which will meet the timelines for Emergency or Urgent changes (see
    TO 00-5-1). RAC Notification messages are not the same as the IOS/ISS/RAC, or ITCTO, “Advance
    Notification of Release” message required by Attachment 3 and Attachment 5. RAC Notification
    messages will contain:
       - Affected TO number and title,
       - RAC number and date,
       - Criticality (Emergency or Urgent),
AFMCI21-302 19 DECEMBER 2007                                                                              9


       - File names and sizes of the merged TO (if applicable) and RAC files (the sizes are required to
ensure users have enough hard drive space to successfully accomplish the download), and either
        - E-mail transmission date and time (when distributing via e-mail), or
        - Uniform Resource Locator (URL) addresses where the files are located when distributed elec-
tronically other than e-mail.
        - Messages must include a point of contact and phone number to call in case of any technical prob-
lems.
   3.7. PM Internet Access Site.
        3.7.1. Electronic access to ITO and RAC files may be through the use of a weapon system Com-
        munity of Practice (CoP) or other dedicated web site in accordance with TO 00-5-3. The PM will
        notify the customers and 754 ELSG/ILMT of the CoP or other page address and when there are
        any changes to PM site address. The 754 ELSG/ILMT will post the site on the TO System Infor-
        mation Page. Sites must comply with applicable Internet security directives according to AFI
        33-129, Transmission of Information via the Internet, accessible at: http://www.e-publish-
        ing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI33-129.pdf, and should be updated frequently.
NOTE: Special arrangements will have to be made for SAP/FMS customers.
        3.7.2. The TO Manager is responsible for ensuring that ITOs/RACs, distribution lists, and other
        TO-related data are posted on the PM page. Each TO web page will list all PDLs and ALs cur-
        rently used for ITO distribution, the MDS/equipment they apply to, and the point of contact (POC)
        name, Defense Switched Network (DSN) and e-mail address. The pages will also list all active
        ITO numbers and their dates.
