This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and Facilities. This
instruction establishes an airfield sweeping program and outlines the duties and responsibilities of the var-
ious units on Holloman for its implementation. Each commander and supervisor is responsible for com-
pliance with this instruction.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Changed from a regulation to an instruction and from the 91 series to the 32 series.



1. Sweeping Operations. An airfield sweeping schedule has been established on AF Form 2519 (All
Purpose Checklist) Overprint, Airfield Sweeping Schedule, to ensure all airfield pavements receive the
appropriate attention required to minimize debris and foreign object damage (FOD) hazards, and improve
the overall safety of flying operations. A sweeper is committed to weekday operations from 0600 through
end of wing flying operations, Monday through Friday. Sweeper and operator will be on standby from end
of wing flying operations Friday to 0600 Monday. A sweeper operator will be on standby status at all
times not stated. The airfield manager or designated representative will direct the sweepers to all areas
that require sweeping and will control the movement of the sweepers during all scheduled sweeping
hours. The schedule (AF Form 2519 overprinted) will serve as a guide and will be followed to the extent
practicable. If possible, all sweeping shall be accomplished with minimum interference to the flying
schedule. One sweeper will be dedicated to the airfield at all times.

2. Organizational Responsibilities:

       2.1.1. Inspect airfield pavements for FOD potential or other debris.
