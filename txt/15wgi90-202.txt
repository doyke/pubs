5. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT).
   5.1. MICT is an interactive application designed to help all levels of leadership implement
   the self-inspection program and checklist management requirements defined in AFI 90-201
   and perform their missions successfully. MICT is the application for 15 WG units to manage
   their unit self-inspection program. All MICT users have permissions to download various
   reports and checklists.
   5.2. Self-inspection programs provide commanders with a vital tool for internal assessment
   of unit health and complement external assessments. The tools within MICT are available to
   all levels of leadership. Starting from the lowest levels, MICT Administrators and their
   designated Self-Inspection Checklist Assessors can access and run applicable checklists.
   Further, they can display Self-Inspection Program (SIP) results for later viewing. To
   facilitate the flow of information up and down the supervisory and inspection chains, each
   level of authority is assigned specific roles, responsibilities, and visibility within MICT. The
   roles each member play are based upon administrative permissions. These permissions are
   set by the 15 WG/IGI MICT Administrator and can be adjusted as necessary upon request.
   MICT permissions are established as follows in Table 5.1.

Table 5.1. Permission Established for MICT

 Wing PM             Permission given to wing process manager so they can setup
 (15 WG/IGI)         permissions for their wing. Can set up anybody in their visible units
                     with permissions, and can give themselves permission to their own unit,
                     but cannot assign themselves permissions to other units. The Wing PM
                     has implicit Unit Admin rights, which allows them to manage self-
                     inspection for all units in the wing.

 Unit Admin          Has access to and can create local checklists, assign checklist points of
                     contact, approve/close-out checklist for their unit within the 15 WG
                     MICT program.
 MICT                Special permission to allow somebody to close inspections via
 Supervisor          inspection support page.

 Unit Checklist      Has access to and can manage every feature related to checklists for
 Mgr                 their unit, however, does not have other administrative rights.

 Unit Checklist      Known as the “read only” permission. Member has read only access to a
 Reviewer            unit’s inspection data. Cannot see tracked checklists, unit point of
                     contact (POC) or administration pages.
 MICT Guest          Has access to search checklists and view reports for units to which
                     permissions have been granted. If this member is assigned as a primary
                     or alternate POC for an inspection checklist, they can fully manage all
                     inspection features for that checklist. Can also be used to give guest
                     temporary access to view another unit’s checklist.
