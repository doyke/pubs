                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Investigations and Reports.
     1.1.1. This manual, in conjunction with AFI 91-204, provides guidance for categorizing,
     classifying, investigating and reporting AF ground mishaps. Ground mishaps, in general are
     primarily categorized by the environment and duty status in which they occur. Report any
     unplanned occurrence, injury, or property damage, defined in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, and
     Figure 1.1 (afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty military, ground and industrial) and this manual as
     ground mishaps.
1.2. Accounting for Losses. In addition to the guidance provided in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1
and Chapter 4, the following should be used.
     1.2.1. Record a military or civilian injury/loss to the command the individual is assigned to
     at the time of a mishap. Use military personnel data records and civilian payroll records to
     make determinations. Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel who are activated under 10
     U.S.C. 12301 or 12302 are accounted to their parent unit.
     1.2.2. Record a mishap occurring to an individual in any permanent change of station (PCS)
     status to the losing command until the individual signs in at the new duty station. The
     ―transfer effective date‖ is not criteria for determining the unit of assignment.
     1.2.3. Record a mishap involving an individual being transferred PCS with temporary duty
     pending further orders to the organization originating the initial orders until the individual
     signs in at the next permanent duty station.
     1.2.4. Record mishaps involving foreign exchange students and military members in non-
     pay status while awaiting an appellate review (appellate leave) or court martial to the Air
     Force at Large. For mishap reporting purposes, personnel in a non-pay status are returned to
     active duty when notified (written or verbal) to return to an Air Force installation.
     1.2.5. When a unit makes an Air Force Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) or Government
     Vehicle, Other (GVO) available to another unit on a recurring or permanent dispatch, the
     using organization is the owning command. NOTE: Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by,
     non-DoD persons or agencies and activities such as the U.S. Postal Service or the American
     Red Cross are not GMVs.
1.3. Determining Duty Status. Ground mishaps may occur in many different environments
and duty status which are used as part of the determination for categorizing ground mishaps. The
definitions in AFI 91-204 are for mishap reporting purposes only and are not related to
compensation or a line-of-duty determination.
1.4. Mishap and Event Classification. Class E (High Accident Potential (HAPs)) are the only
events reported for ground safety.
1.5. Determining Injury Severity and Mishap Costs to Non-DoD Personnel and Property.
     1.5.1. Determine injury severity in accordance with AFI 91-204. Air Force operations can
     contribute to or cause on-duty mishaps when Air Force personnel are not present. This
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                               5


  determination is based on whether an Air Force action or inaction is totally or partially
  responsible for a non-Air Force injury or property damage. The loss of non-Air Force
  property in an Air Force-owned house fire caused by faulty electrical wiring is an example of
  an Air Force operation that causes or results in damage to non-Air Force property (resident’s
  personal property). An example of the Air Force causing or contributing to injuries to non-
  AF personnel could occur when an Air Force member allows non-Air Force personnel to
  visit an industrial work area containing powered equipment, the visitor is left alone, and
  injures him or herself on an unguarded piece of equipment.
  1.5.2. When determining injury severity or disability (i.e., fatality, permanent total disability,
  permanent partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case), for non-DoD personnel the
  investigator’s best judgment may be used if accurate information from civilian medical
  authorities is not available. Lost time for injured children and unemployed adults must be
  determined by assessing the degree of injury and an estimate of when the individual may
  have been able to return to normal activities.

   not directly contact contractors or vendors for teardown and analysis without first
   coordinating with the SM or HQ AFSC/SEG.
   5.4.4. Handle and ship exhibits according to T.O. 00-35D-54. Use T.O. 2J-1-18, Engine
   Shipping Instructions, which explains how to mark engines for teardown. Ensure the mishap
   event number is referenced in the I 90 field of the Deficiency Report. Enter the Deficiency
   Report Control Number into the mishap narrative in AFSAS. Include exhibit disposition
   instructions in all DRs (e.g., return exhibit to originator, convening MAJCOM, etc.). Do not
   dispose of exhibits sent from Class A mishaps or mishaps involving potential litigation until
   authorized by the Air Force Legal Service Agency (AFLSA/JACT). Store these exhibits at
   either the facility that performed the analysis, or return the exhibit to the SIB or the host
   installation commander, as appropriate. Take follow-up actions to ensure exhibits were
   received and teardowns are progressing in a timely manner.
   5.4.5. Place a copy of all teardown reports, including all supporting documents (e.g.
   metallurgical analyses, photographs, test reports, etc...), provided in response to DRs in the
   formal report.
   5.4.6. The convening authority safety office takes follow-up action if the final safety report
   was sent before receipt of all DR responses are received. If final exhibit disposition
   instructions were not included in the original DR, the convening authority safety office will
   provide them to the SM.
5.5. Ground Mishap Investigative Process.
   5.5.1. Once appointed, the SIB or SIO will relieve the interim safety board (ISB) or On-
   Scene Commander (OSC) as soon as possible, take control of the investigation and accept
   custody of all impounded evidence, lists of potential witnesses, etc..
   5.5.2. The SIB or SIO should provide timely, factual information to the convening authority
   for incremental release to the public through the Public Affairs office or designated official.
   5.5.3. For investigations that involve fire (AFI 91-204, Chapter 1), ensure fire personnel are
   engaged, either as a SIB member or as a technical advisor to the SIO, to determine the point
   of origin and cause of the fire.
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                            17


  5.5.4. The SIB or SIO must maintain a good working relationship with the legal
  investigator(s) (commander directed, OSI, Security Police, etc.) to facilitate a thorough safety
  investigation. If possible, the BP or SIO should formally meet with legal investigator(s) at the
  beginning of the investigation to establish a good working relationship. As a minimum, the
  BP or SIO should:
     5.5.4.1. Review the responsibilities of the Safety and Legal investigator(s).
     5.5.4.2. Review privileged information criteria but do not discuss privileged information
     with the legal investigator(s).
     5.5.4.3. Determine a debris recovery strategy.
     5.5.4.4. Review the process for planning, coordinating, approving, and executing tests
     that may alter or destroy evidence.
     5.5.4.5. Review the processes for control of information in order to:
         5.5.4.5.1. Protect information from unauthorized release and release appropriate
         information as soon as feasible.
         5.5.4.5.2. Maintain separation of factual and privileged information.
  5.5.5. Control information access to those with approved access and a valid need to know.
  5.5.6. Release impounded information and evidence when no longer needed for investigation
  purposes.
  5.5.7. The process ends with the completion of a final message report and, for on-duty Class
  A and B mishaps, a formal report (unless HQ AFSC grants a waiver). Once accepted by the
  convening authority, HQ AFSC reviews the report, issues a Memorandum of Final
  Evaluation for on-duty Class A and B reports, and tracks open recommendations until
  closure.
  5.5.8. During the investigation, do not assign SIB members or a SIO duties unrelated to the
  mishap investigation.

                                          Chapter 6

                                REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Prepare and submit ground mishaps in accordance with AFI 91-
204, Chapter 6, the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS), and this manual.
   6.1.1. Class C off-duty mishaps do not require a preliminary report.
   6.1.2. Report Class D mishaps within 6 days of notification (refer to section 6.6 of this
   AFMAN).
6.2. Preparing Message Reports.
   6.2.1. Unless otherwise noted, AFSAS is the primary means of documenting and
   transmitting all ground Class A, B, C, D reports and Class E event messages. In the event
   AFSAS is unavailable, mishap reporting may be delayed until it is available. However, if the
   mishap is Class A or B on-duty or Class A off-duty, immediate telephonic notification will
   be made to the owning MAJCOM, DRU, FOA safety office who will in-turn notify HQ
   AFSC/SEG.
   6.2.2. Addressees listed in Table 6.1 will be used for distribution and are based on the
   organization’s need to know. Use of the table will help to prevent inadvertent release of
   privileged safety information outside the Air Force. Currently HQ AFSC/SEG and
   MAJCOM addresses are included in AFSAS message by default and do not have to be
   selected however; units must select additional addresses based on the requirements of Table
   6.1.
   6.2.3. Ensure all Department of the Air Force agencies identified as Office of Primary
   Responsibility (OPR) for mishap recommendations are included in the addressee list. For
   OPRs outside the Air Force, the convening authority should consult with HQ AFSC/JA on
   the appropriate means of conveying the tasking.
6.3. Reviewing the Final Message Report. Upon completion of the investigation, the SIB or
SIO forwards the final message report to the convening authority for approval and release.
6.3. (AMC)Reviewing the Final Message Report. Final message reports will be coordinated
through AMC/SEG prior to release.
   6.3.1. (Added-AMC) Upon completion of an on-duty Class A / B mishap investigation, the
   SIB or SIO will contact AMC/SE to schedule an outbrief with the convening authority.
   6.3.2. (Added-AMC) Upon completion of an off-duty Class A and B investigation, the SIB
   or SIO will contact AMC/SEG to schedule required briefing in accordance with paragraph
   7.2.2.
      6.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) The SIB or SIO will provide, as a minimum, AMC/SEG weekly
      status up-dates of factual information collected and status of the investigation processes.
6.4. Determining the Mishap Event Number.
   6.4.1. A single Mishap Event Number is automatically assigned by AFSAS, which tracks
   each mishap when information is initially entered into AFSAS.
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                         19


   6.4.2. Because the mishap event number is the single common worldwide identifier for a
   mishap, include this number on all correspondence relating to a specific mishap
   (endorsements, classification changes, etc.).
   6.4.3. The Mishap Event Number consists of the base code (XXXX), the year the mishap
   occurred (2003), date of the mishap (0926), a series of AFSAS assigned numbers, and the
   alpha classification (A, B, C, D, or E) of the event being reported.
   6.4.4. An optional Unit Control Number (UCN) is available for additional unit tracking and
   should follow the format defined by the MAJCOM.
6.5. Formal Reports.
   6.5.1. Follow the guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 6 and this chapter, to prepare and
   distribute ground formal reports.
   6.5.2. Formal Report Waivers.
      6.5.2.1. On-duty Class A/B mishaps require a formal report unless waived by HQ
      AFSC/SEG. See AFI 91-204 for guidance on formal report waivers.
      6.5.2.2. HQ AFSC/SEG will normally only consider waivers for mishaps involving
      known materiel deficiencies for which corrective actions have been established.
      6.5.2.3. Waivers will not normally be granted for mishaps involving personnel factors
      (such as human performance failures or inadequate supervision).
      6.5.2.4. Waivers for formal reporting are processed through AFSAS. Waiver requests
      validated by MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Chief of Safety or designated authority will be
      forwarded to AFSC/SEG for approval/disapproval of the request.
      6.5.2.5. HQ AFSC/SEG evaluates each waiver request on a case-by-case basis,
      considering all completed message reports, supporting material and other factors. When
      requesting a waiver, the request must be accompanied by an updated STATUS Report
      entered into AFSAS that includes all available information with sufficient detail in the
      narrative that clearly shows the mishap sequence of events, causal findings, and proposed
      recommendations.
   6.5.3. What to Include in Formal Reports.
      6.5.3.1. Formal report composition and format are detailed in Attachment 2 of this
      manual.
      6.5.3.2. Ground safety investigators will use tabs as necessary based on the category,
      complexity, and other factors involved in the mishap.
      6.5.3.3. Formal reports for on-duty Class A and Class B will include as a minimum, but
      are not limited to, the following tabs. (NOTE: Additional information may be inserted as
      necessary based on the investigation.)
          6.5.3.3.1. A completed AF IMT 711A, USAF Mishap Report Checklist and Index,
          filed in the front of the formal report.
          6.5.3.3.2. Tab A. Formal Report Distribution Memorandum of Transmittal and one
          copy of the orders appointing the SIB or SIO. See Appendix 3 for report distribution.

      6.5.3.4. For Class C, D, and E reports, the convening authority and MAJCOM safety
      staff may make non-substantive changes to the reports in order to improve the quality of
      the reports.
   6.5.4. Distributing the Formal Report
      6.5.4.1. Distribution of formal privileged reports is restricted to AF personnel with a
      need to know for mishap prevention purposes. See AFI 91-204 for information on access
      to safety reports. See Table 6.2 of this AFMAN for formal report distribution
      requirements.
      6.5.4.2. HQ AFSC or MAJCOM safety offices may require additional copies to be sent
      to their headquarters to aid in staffing the report, but must destroy all reports after
      completion.
   6.5.5. Forwarding Formal Reports. If an Air Staff office is the action agency for a validated
   recommendation, the MAJCOM safety office will forward a copy of the report to AF/SEI for
   transmittal to the Air Staff office. MAJCOM safety offices forward reports directly to FOAs
   or DRUs.
6.6. General Guidance Related to Recording Occupational Injuries and Illnesses.
   6.6.1. Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health Program for Federal
   Employees, requires federal agencies to report occupational mishaps to the Secretary of
   Labor. Title 29 CFR 1960, Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational
   Safety and Health Programs and Related Matters and Title 29 CFR 1904, Recording and
   Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness, sets requirements and provides standard forms
   for documenting occupational illnesses and injuries.
   6.6.2. The host ground safety staff is the official Air Force office of record for maintaining
   occupational illness and injury data and maintains consolidated records of injuries and illness
   meeting ground mishap Class A, B, C and D criteria. Mishaps involving injury and illnesses
   to on- and off-duty Air Force military and on-duty civilian personnel are recorded separately.
   6.6.3. SE and PH officials will record Class A - D occupational injuries and illnesses within
   6 workdays of notification using the OSHA Form 300, Log of Work-Related Injuries and
   Illnesses . Public Health provides illness data to safety by the third workday each month (if
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                              21


     not otherwise accessible, e.g. AFSAS). NOTE: This form can be found at on the OSHA
     Website or the AFSC Website, Ground Safety, Library page.
     6.6.4. Maintain consolidated occupational illness and injury logs to satisfy the Occupational
     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirement for single-point access to
     occupational illness and injury cases. Tenant units will provide the host safety office a
     summary of civilian and military occupational injuries/illnesses data by the third workday
     each month (if not otherwise accessible, e.g. AFSAS).
     6.6.5. (Added-AMC) AMC units may use the AMC IMT 441, Mishap Report of Injury /
     Illness and Treatment, to collect and report mishaps. If used, the staff will establish
     submission procedures and timelines in supplemental guidance.
6.7. Annual Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses (OSHA 300).
     6.7.1. Not later than 1 February, using information recorded on the OSHA 300, the OSHA
     300A, Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses report reflecting civilian occupational
     injury and illness cases of all units must be posted in a conspicuous place and remain in place
     until 30 April. NOTE: This includes tenant units as well. NOTE: This form can be found on
     the OSHA Website or the AFSC Website, Ground Safety Library page.
     6.7.2. Information required is listed on the OSHA 300A Summary form.

   external to the convening authority, these agencies must review and comment on the report
   within 30 days of the message report release date.
       7.2.1.1. Action agency comments should provide the information needed to monitor
       corrective actions, such as a project number or engineering change proposal (ECP)
       number. When recommendations concern proposed equipment modifications the AF
       Program Executive Office (AFPEO), AFMC action agencies, or System Program Office
       (SPO) must state whether or not proposed modifications require a new development
       effort significantly beyond the scope of current responsibility.
   7.2.2. (AMC) For all off-duty fatal Class A mishaps (and other mishaps as requested), the
   immediate commander of the individual involved in the mishap, accompanied by the next
   higher echelon commander, will brief AMC/CV, AFFOR , and Special Staff Directors
   through video teleconference on the circumstances leading to and resulting in the mishap. For
   mishaps involving members above wing level, the member’s division chief (or equivalent)
   will brief in lieu of the squadron commander and the director will fulfill the role of the wing
   commander. AMC wing and group commanders will participate in the briefing via video
   teleconference. HQ AMC/SEG schedules and coordinates the briefings. Briefings will
   normally be scheduled within 30 to 45 days of the mishap. The briefing template will be
   provided by AMC/SEG. Briefings will center on 72-hour look back, sequence of events,
   conclusions, causes, recommendations, and preventative actions taken.
       7.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) Non-Fatal, Class A and B off-duty mishaps (and other major
       mishaps as requested by AMC leadership) will be briefed to 18 AF/CV or USAF EC/CV.
       AMC wing and group commanders will participate in the briefing via video
       teleconference. The SIB or SIO will contact AMC/SEG to schedule required briefing in

vessel. This also includes DOD diving or swimmer operations. This term includes mishaps
occurring while loading and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and mishaps
occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It
applies also to all injuries to DOD personnel occurring on board, whether or not job-related.
Fatalities and/or injuries occurring on board that result from shipyard, repair facility, or private
contractor operations are not afloat mishaps.
AIR FORCE AT LARGE—Used for recording losses. Mishaps involving exchange students,
military members in a non-pay status while waiting for appellate review if they have no written
or verbal orders to return to an Air Force installation, prior service personnel on leave before
reporting to initial permanent duty assignment, etc., are recorded to the Air Force at large. Also
used for recording losses of non-accepted Air Force aerospace vehicles (AFI 91-204, paragraph
4.9.2.) and aerospace vehicles leased to a non-DOD organization for modification, maintenance,
repair, test, contract training, or experimental project for a DOD component, when the
Government has assumed ground and flight risk (AFI 91-204, paragraph 4.9.3.).
AIR RESERVE COMPONENTS (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the ANG
and AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG
and AFRC technicians; include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Military status starts
upon beginning duty for military pay and ends when duty stops. All references to Air Force
military personnel and property also apply to ARC military personnel and property.
CAUSAL FINDING—Causal findings are those, which, singly or in combination with other
causal findings, logically result in damage or injury. They are identified with the word "CAUSE"
at the start of the text of the finding.
CAUSE—A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have
prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury.
CONVENING AUTHORITY—The individual who has the authority to order a safety
investigation.
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                             37


DISABILITY—See permanent partial disability or permanent total disability.
EVENT—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet the reporting
criteria of a mishap.
FATAL INJURY (Class A)—Injuries resulting in death, either in the mishap or at a later time,
to include within 30 days subsequent to being medically discharged, retired, or separated from
the service, due to complications arising from mishap injuries.
FINDINGS—Findings are the conclusions of the safety investigator. They are statements, in
chronological order, of each significant event or condition sustaining the sequence leading to the
mishap.
FIRST AID CASE— Any initial one-time treatment and any follow-up visit for observation of
minor scratches, cuts, burns, and splinters, etc., that does not ordinarily require medical care.
Such one-time treatment and follow-up visit for observation is considered first aid, even though
provided by a physician or medical professional.
The following information describes those cases that would be considered first aid.
Treatment outside this finite list is considered medical treatment greater than first aid:
-- Using a non-prescription medication at nonprescription strength (for medications available in
both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed
health care professional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is
considered medical treatment);
-- Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or
rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment);
-- Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin;
-- Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band-Aids™, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly
bandages or Steri-Strips™ (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are
considered medical treatment);
-- Using hot or cold therapy;
-- Using any non-rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts,
etc. (devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are
considered medical treatment);
-- Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints,
slings, neck collars, back boards, etc.).
-- Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister;

NOTE: See 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness, for
further guidance for injury and illness classifications.
GOVERNMENT MOTOR VEHICLE (GMV)—A motor vehicle that is owned, leased, or
rented by a DOD Component (not individuals); primarily designed for over-the-road operations;
and whose general purpose is the transportation of cargo or personnel. Examples of GMVs are
passenger cars, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, vans, ambulances, buses, motorcycles,
trucks, tractor-trailers, rental vehicles authorized by official travel orders, and General Service
Administration (GSA) vehicles. Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DOD persons or
agencies and activities such as the US Postal Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs.
Includes Air Force owned motor vehicles not identified as GVOs and General Services
Administration (GSA) vehicles leased on a long- or short-term basis.
GOVERNMENT VEHICLE OTHER (GVO)—Vehicles designed primarily for off-the-
highway operation such as construction tracked vehicles, forklifts, road graders, agricultural-type
wheeled tractors, and aircraft tugs. Includes military combat/tactical vehicles; e.g., tanks, self-
propelled weapons, armored personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles ashore, HMMWV, and off-
highway motorcycles.
GROUND AND INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—An Air Force mishap that does not meet the
mishap category definition of nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, explosives and chemical
agents, directed energy, afloat, motor vehicle, or off-duty military as defined by this instruction.
HAZARD—Any real or potential condition that can cause injury or occupational illness to
personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the environment.
HIGH ACCIDENT POTENTIAL (HAP) EVENT—Any hazardous occurrence that has a high
potential for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
INDUSTRIAL AVIATION MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that:
involve a DOD aircraft or UAV when being handled as cargo; or involve DOD aircraft or UAV
component not attached to the fuselage/airframe. Additionally, use this subcategory as a cross
category for aviation mishaps where maintenance or operations in the industrial environment
result in a reportable mishap.
INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment
that does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of fire, combat training, physical and
athletic conditioning, contractor, natural phenomena, industrial space, industrial aviation, or
industrial weapons as defined by this instruction. The work environment, as defined in 29 Code
of Federal Regulations 1960, is "The establishment and other locations where one or more Air
Force employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment; this would
include those areas or locations where persons are TDY for training purposes. The work
environment includes not only physical locations, but also the equipment or materiels used by
the employee during the course of his or her work."
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                            39


INDUSTRIAL SPACE MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that
involve space systems (pre-launch) or unique space support equipment. As defined in paragraph
1.6.1.2., these mishaps will always be classified as space mishaps. Use this subcategory for
cross-categorization to ground and industrial only.
INDUSTRIAL WEAPONS MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that
involve weapons (i.e., nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, or directed
energy) or associated unique support equipment. Examples include bomb fin damage during
handling or injury to a worker during a MJ-1 bomb lift operation.
INJURY—A traumatic wound or other condition of the body caused by external force or
deprivation (fractures, lacerations, sprains, dislocations, concussions, compressions, drowning,
suffocation, exposure, cold injury, and dehydration), including stress or strain, which results
from an unplanned event. The injury is identifiable as to the time and place of occurrence and
member or function of the body affected, and is caused by a specific event or incident or series
of events or incidents in a single day or work shift.
LOST TIME CASE (Class C)—A nonfatal traumatic injury or occupational illness or disease
that causes loss of one or more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When
determining if the mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee
was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person
was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off
are included in the total number of days, if the employee would not have been able to work on
those days because of a work-related injury or illness. NOTE: While 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2)(iii)
and 1904.5(b)(2)(iv) exempts reporting of certain occurrences that result from voluntary
participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class,
racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting to an employee eating, drinking, or
preparing food for personnel consumption, the Air Force requires reporting of these occurrences.
MAJCOM—The term "MAJCOM " as used in this instruction includes ANG, DRUs, and FOAs
unless otherwise specified.
MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in
damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI 91-204,
paragraph 1.8. Damage or injury includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to
DOD military or civilian personnel; injury to DOD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to
on-duty DOD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury or illness to
non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
MISCELLANEOUS GROUND MISHAP—Mishaps that do not fit into any of the other
subcategories identified in this instruction.
MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAP—An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized
land vehicle operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a
DOD-owned or leased motorized land vehicle by non-Air Force personnel while operationally
controlled by a DOD component. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or bicyclists involving
moving motor vehicles are included in this category. This category does not include ground and
industrial mishaps such as injuries occurring while loading or unloading, mounting or
dismounting a non-moving vehicle; cargo damaged by weather; damage to a properly parked
DOD vehicle, unless caused by an operating DOD vehicle. Additionally, damage to an Air Force
 40                                              AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006


vehicle caused by objects thrown or propelled into it by weather or natural phenomena, or by fire
when no collision occurred; or damage to an Air Force vehicle when it is being handled as cargo
and not operating under its own power and is properly parked, are not categorized as motor
vehicle mishaps. Motor vehicle mishaps are divided into the following subcategories:
Government Motor Vehicle (GMV), Government Vehicle Other (GVO), and Private Motor
Vehicle (PMV).
NO LOST TIME CASE (Class D)—Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not
meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational
illness, Air Force personnel only works partial days, restricted work or were transferred to
another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, lost of consciousness, or a
significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional,
even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical
treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness. NOTE: While 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2)(iii)
and 1904.5(b)(2)(iv) exempts reporting of certain occurrences that result from voluntary
participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class,
racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting to an employee eating, drinking, or
preparing food for personnel consumption, the Air Force requires reporting of these occurrences.
OBSERVATION AND/OR DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE—Hospitalization or restriction
from assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost time case," "no lost time
case," or "first aid case" provided no treatment or medication is given for the suspected injury or
occupational illness, and competent medical authority determines the individual could have
returned to his or her normal job without impairment or disability. This classification applies also
where an individual is temporarily restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent exceeding
time-weighted exposure limits. This is not reportable if a competent medical authority provides
no treatment or medication for the suspected injury or occupational illness or finds the person
could have returned to normal assigned duties without impairment or disability.
OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS—Any reported condition that does not meet the definition of
injury. Any abnormal physical condition or disorder, other than one resulting from an
occupational injury, resulting in adverse consequences and caused by occupational factors
associated with employment. Includes all confirmed cases of acute and chronic illnesses or
diseases caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion or direct contact with suspect substances.
OFF-DUTY—DOD personnel are off-duty when they are not on-duty (see on-duty definition).
Personnel participating in base team sporting activities or in a permissive temporary duty (TDY)
status are off-duty. Reserve and National Guard personnel performing inactive duty training
(drill) will be considered off-duty: when traveling to or from the place at which such duty is
performed; or while remaining overnight, immediately before the commencement of inactive-
duty training; or while remaining overnight between successive periods of inactive-duty training,
at or in the vicinity of the site of the inactive-duty training, if the site of the inactive-duty training
is outside reasonable commuting distance of the member's residence. NOTE: This definition is
for mishap reporting purposes only and has no relation to compensability or line-of-duty
determination.
ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when:
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                               41


Physically present at any location where they are to perform their officially assigned work.
Officially assigned work includes organization-sponsored events an employee is permitted to
attend, regardless of location. This includes those activities incident to normal work activities
that occur on DoD installations, such as lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard
military vessels. NOTE: Personnel walking to and from work place parking areas at the start and
end of the duty day are in an on-duty status.
Being transported by DOD or commercial conveyance to perform officially assigned work. (This
includes travel in PMVs or commercial conveyances while performing official duty, but not
routine travel to and from work.)
On temporary duty. Personnel on assignment away from the regular place of employment are
covered 24 hours a day for any injury or occupational illness that results from activities essential
or incidental to the temporary assignment. Essential or incidental activities include travel
between places of business or lodging and eating establishments, drugstores, barbershops, places
of worship, cleaning establishments, bowling centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums,
and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF) facilities and similar places required for the
health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty.
However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in
activities, personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary
assignment contemplated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for
investigation and reporting purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or occupational
illnesses to personnel resulting from activities unrelated to the temporary duty assignment or
non-commander directed sports and recreation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing, basketball) will
be reported as off-duty mishaps.
Military members are working in part-time Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) positions. NOTE: Use
the NAF position series (instead of the military Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for safety
reporting.
Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness
evaluation activities (including cycle ergometric testing when permitted). On-duty compulsory
fitness training and activities include directed sports activities at professional military education
(PME) and formal training courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical Training Schools,
Airman Leadership School, Squadron Officer School, and the Air Force Academy. These
activities are considered on-duty when a superior directs participation at a specific location and
time. This includes supervision-directed physical conditioning activities when a mandatory
location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees authorized to participate in
physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty.
NOTE: The definitions above are for mishap reporting purposes only and have no relation to
compensability or line-of-duty determination.
PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY (Class B)—Any injury or occupational illness that
does not result in death or permanent total disability, but in the opinion of competent medical
authority, results in permanent impairment through loss or loss of use of any part of the body.
EXCEPTIONS: Loss of teeth, fingernails, toenails; loss of fingertips or toe tips without bone
involvement; repairable inguinal hernia; disfigurement; sprains or strains that do not cause
permanent limitation of motion.

PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY (Class A)—Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness
that, in the opinion of competent medical authority, permanently and totally incapacitates a
person to the extent that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation and results in a medical
discharge, retirement, separation. The loss, or the loss of use of both hands, both feet, both eyes,
or a combination of any of those body parts as a result of a single mishap will be considered as a
permanent total disability. For purposes of this instruction, any mishap resulting in injury severe
enough for an individual to be in a non-medically induced coma is a permanent total disability.
(NOTE: Upgrade injury to a fatal mishap if death occurs within 30 days of medical discharge,
retirement, or separation from service due to complications arising from the mishap injury).
PHYSICAL AND ATHLETIC CONDITIONING MISHAP—Mishaps involving injuries that
occur during participation in some form of duty related athletic or recreational sport activities
designed to develop an Air Force member’s physical ability or to maintain or increase
individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills. Examples are: firefighter injured during
weight-lifting or basketball game to maintain physical conditioning; Air Force fitness testing,
compulsory sport exercises, unit formation activities, physical fitness activities during
professional military education courses, or individual physical workout to meet Air Force
physical fitness standards (see TRAINING RELATED DEATH).
PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE (PMV)—A non-commercial vehicle that is neither a GMV nor
GVO. A vehicle normally registered for highway use.
PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE (PMV) MISHAP—A motor vehicle mishap, regardless of
identity of the operator, that does not involve a GMV or GVO, but results in a fatality or
reportable injury to military personnel on- or off-duty or to on-duty civilian personnel, or
reportable damage to DoD property. Fatalities and injuries to bicyclists and pedestrians in the
traffic environment are included in this category.
RECOMMENDATIONS—Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate
identified hazards, or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard’s potential
consequences. Actions likely to prevent a similar mishap or reduce its effects.
SAFETY REPORT—Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and final),
formal reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs.
SINGLE MANAGER—The single individual specifically designated, under the integrated weapon
system management architecture, to be responsible for the life cycle management of a system or end-
item. The Single Manager is the program manager vested with full authority, responsibility, and
resources to execute and support an approved Air Force program. A list of the Single Manager
organizations and MDSs is available at: http://afsafety.af.mil/AFSC/RDBMS/Flight/SIB-
Support/Formal%20Report%20Files/TableA31andMDSLists.xls.
SPORTS AND RECREATION MISHAP—Mishaps involving injuries that occur during
participation in some form of sporting or recreational activity. Examples of sports and
recreational activities include softball, handball, golf, football, sight seeing, dancing, auto racing,
bicycling, motorcycles driven off-road, off-duty parachuting/sky diving, and flying private
planes, ultra lights, and gliders.
TRAINING RELATED DEATH—A death associated with a non-combat military exercise or
training activity that is designed to develop a military member's physical ability or to maintain or
increase individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills, and is due to either a mishap or
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                            43


the result of natural causes occurring during or within one hour after any training activity where
the exercise or activity could be a contributing factor. NOTE: The cause of death must be
attributed to the mandatory physical exercise as determined by a competent medical authority.

               INSTRUCTIONS ON ASSEMBLING A FORMAL REPORT.

A2.1. General Information.
   A2.1.1. Ground formal reports must have two parts:
      A2.1.1.1. Part 1, Factual Information and Releasable Material, may be disclosed outside
      the Air Force.
      A2.1.1.2. Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material, will not be disclosed
      outside the Air Force safety channels. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, for authorized use
      and release of privileged safety reports and information.
   A2.1.2. Investigators must use appropriate AF Form 711-series forms to document formal
   reports. All AF Form 711-series forms are available on the Air Force Electronic Publications
   Web page at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A2.1.3. SIBs and SIOs should make electronic versions of formal reports. Formal reports
   will be constructed both in traditional paper form and electronic CD form as necessary.
   Minimize the number of hard copies produced. As a minimum, HQ AFSC is sent the original
   and one CD (CD-R) version. The convening authority will be provided one paper copy and
   one CD version, while all others may receive an electronic version (CD-R or diskette). See
   Table 6.2 for organizations receiving the formal reports.
      A2.1.3.1. Safety investigation boards or SIOs creating electronic formal reports will use
      Microsoft Word and then convert them to Adobe Acrobat, pdf files.
      Reports are typically saved as two (2) files: Part 1 (non-privileged) and Part 2
      (privileged). Reports will be saved on CD-ROM media, preferably on a "CD/R."
      A2.1.3.2. The CD must be labeled with: (as a minimum) mishap number, date and time
      of the mishap, mishap category, duty status, injuries sustained, unit and command
      experiencing the loss, report copy number, and the safety privilege warning statement.
A2.2. Administrative Guidelines for assembling Formal Ground Mishap Reports. These
requirements will be adhered to for conformity reasons.
   A2.2.1. Assemble the report in a legal size folder or most appropriate binder for size.
   A2.2.2. Use the AF IMT 711A, USAF Mishap Safety Checklist and Index, will be the first
   document in the report followed by the applicable tabs. This form is used to show which
   Tabs are included in the formal report. Place an "X" for each item in the columns "Not
   Applicable," "Applicable Not Attached," or "Attached."
      A2.2.2.1. When checking the "Applicable Not Attached" block explain why in the
      "Remarks" section.
          A2.2.2.1.1. Estimate the date the missing attachment will be sent for inclusion in the
          report.
          A2.2.2.1.2. If an attachment will be sent later, insert a blank page with the proper
          lettered tab in the report.
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                             47


          A2.2.2.1.3. Later, when the attachment is sent to recipients of the report, it can put it
          in the report at the proper tab.
   A2.2.3. Type/print in black ink on both sides of 8.5 by 11 inch paper. Use Times New
   Roman, 12 point for text documents.
   A2.2.4. Under Page Set-Up in Microsoft Word (or other word processing program) follows
   these guidelines):
      A2.2.4.1. Set Top and Bottom margins at one inch.
      A2.2.4.2. Select "Mirror Margins" and set "inside" to 1.5 inches, "outside" to 1.0 inch.
      Set "gutter" to zero. (If you do not have a duplex printer, this will set the margins
      correctly for front-back reproduction. If you have a duplex printer this is the same as
      setting the left margin to 1.5 inches and deselecting "Mirror Margins").
      A2.2.4.3. Set header margin to .5 inches and ensure the class, category, sub- category,
      cross-category, report type, base code, mishap date and AFSAS number is inserted. An
      example: CLASS B GROUND, OFF DUTY MILITARY - MISCELLANEOUS, NONE,
      FINAL REPORT, XXXX20030920 12345B
          A2.2.4.3.1. Type it in 10 point Times New Roman, italicize, and center.
          A2.2.4.3.2. For motor vehicle mishaps also indicate the number of wheels (e.g. two
          or four-wheel) and vehicle category (e.g., GMV, GVO, or PMV).
      A2.2.4.4. Place a footer on each page in Part 2 of the report (privileged section) using
      information provided in AFI 91-204, Attachment 3.
      A2.2.4.5. Arrange the tabs in alphabetical order, with Tab A on top. Additionally, most
      Tabs now have "sub-tabs." Each tab is discussed in detail in the paragraphs below.
          A2.2.4.5.1. The first page of each tab will have the title of the tab, followed by a
          table of contents showing where to find information for each tab’s ―sub-tab.‖
          A2.2.4.5.2. Number all pages in order within the tab (for example, A-1, A-2, X-1, X-
          2, Y-1, Y-2).
          A2.2.4.5.3. Center page numbers at the bottom of each page.
      A2.2.4.6. For classified pages, use the proper security classification markings from AFI
      31-401.
   A2.2.5. Do not place special handling markings on unclassified pages in Part 1 of the formal
   report, for example do not use "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" footers. Ensure the Privilege
   Warning is located at the foot of each page of Part 2 of the Formal report. For classified
   documents, add the proper security classification marking from AFI 31-401, Information
   Security Program Management, and omit the notation "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

     communications that may aid the investigator. Begin the transcript as early in the mishap
     sequence as is practical and end the transcript when all damage and injury has occurred.
     Long term rescue/SAR transmissions need not be included. Because these transcripts are
     factual data, they often provide a basis for information in the factual summary of
     circumstances. Do not include actual recordings in Tab N.
     A2.3.2.14. TAB O. Any Additional Substantiating Data and Reports. This is supporting
     data not otherwise defined. It can include local operating instructions (OI), directives,
     approach and landing charts, and other forms. If the SIB cites a brief document (such as a
     three-page local OI), place it within this Tab. Do not mark, highlight, or extract a
     particular page to show the SIB’s exact area of interest. (Highlighted pages are placed in
     Part 2 of the Formal Report.) For lengthy documents, it is sufficient to show a listing of
     documents or records reviewed by the SIB and their effective dates.
     A2.3.2.15. TAB P. Damage and Injury Summaries.

        operator, passenger, etc.).
        A2.3.2.17.2. R2. Releasable (Non-privileged) Witness Statements and Interview
        Transcripts. Investigators take testimony from all individuals involved in the mishap
        and those who were witnesses to the mishap. Testimony includes both written
        statements and recorded interviews. Place testimony from individuals and witnesses
        that were not granted a promise of confidentiality in this tab. Do not include audio
        recordings. If a promise of confidentiality was offered to an individual, the testimony
        will be placed in Tab U. See AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.5. for discussion of promise
        of confidentiality. All testimony must be properly documented stating if a promise of
        confidentiality has or has not been extended IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.6.2. For
        non-privileged interviews, read, record, and transcribe the Notice to Witness that
        Recorded Statement is not Confidential (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.5). For non-
        privileged written witness statements, include a copy of Memorandum for Non-
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                              51


        Privileged Written Witness Statements (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.4). NOTE: There
        may be occasions, such as mishaps involving complex systems, military-unique items
        (such as laser devices or armored vehicles), or military-unique operations or
        exercises, where a witness or involved contractor will not provide a statement or
        information without a promise of confidentiality. When this appears to be the case,
        contact HQ AFSC/JA to obtain AF/SE approval to offer a promise of confidentiality.
     A2.3.2.18. TAB S. Releasable Photographs, Videos and Diagrams.
        A2.3.2.18.1. S1. Include releasable photographs and diagrams as needed to enhance
        the mishap narrative. Well-defined photographs help in mishap analysis. Use them to
        show damage, impact areas, metal fractures, vehicle travel, etc. Only include
        photographs aiding in understanding the mishap, and reference them in the analysis in
        Part 2, Tab T. Use of scanned or color copies for reproduction in the formal report is
        preferred over pasting of actual photographs. Do not include photographs of deceased
        personnel or graphic photographs of injuries in the safety report. Place an index of
        photographs at at the beginning of the Tab. Do not refer to privileged safety
        information on the page captions or in comments on the index. Photographs are
        privileged if they are staged for the board’s analysis. Staged photographs are placed at
        Tab T near the related narrative. Assembling or reconstructing damaged parts or
        aligning parts to show failure patterns or impact marks are examples of staged
        photographs. Pointing with a finger or other device at a portion of wreckage does not
        make the photograph staged. When investigators include privileged safety
        information on a transparent overlay, place the photograph with the overlay in Tab T
        and the photograph without the overlay in this Tab. Hold all photographs and
        videotapes taken by the SIB, except those staged for analysis, for use by the AIB.
        Every photograph and videotape needs to be labeled by the photographer. If a DoD
        photographer worked it, he/she should label the photo with name, office symbol, and
        office phone number. If a civilian worked it, then the investigator should label the
        photo with name, address and phone number (if the person will provide this
        information).
        A2.3.2.18.2. S2. Civil Engineering Diagrams. (Fallout, Impact Area, etc.). Ensure
        diagrams are self-explanatory. Include only those diagrams that add to the report such
        as wreckage patterns, impact areas, or route-of-travel. Indicate direction with a
        northward pointing arrow on each diagram. If practical, indicate scale. Ensure the
        diagrams do not depict the location of human remains. Such diagrams should be
        placed in Part 2, of the formal report to protect the privacy interests of the decedent’s
        family.
  A2.3.3. Part 2—Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material.
     A2.3.3.1. (Mandatory) TAB T. Investigation, Analysis and Conclusions. This is the
     most important part of the report. It draws on all portions of the report to provide a
     complete picture of what happened. It is a thorough analysis of all evidence and the
     findings, causes, and recommendations. This section records the opinions of the SIB/SIO,
     and it either accepts or rejects all scenarios or theories in the report. Only in the case of a
     minority report are there differing findings, causes, or recommendations. Life sciences

     recommendations related to causal findings will be included with other SIB/SIO
     recommendations.
        A2.3.3.1.1. T1. Authenticity. Include an authentication page after the last page of
        Tab T. Include each primary SIB member’s name, grade, position, and date on this
        page. Have each concurring member, including primary members from other services
        on Joint Investigations, sign above their name for authentication of the report or for
        any changes to the report. If a final SIB or SIO message report needs to be changed
        after it is completed the authentication page must be updated and inserted in front of
        the original.
     A2.3.3.2. (As Required) TAB U. Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of
     Confidentiality. This tab can only be used when HQ USAF/SE has granted approval to
     give witnesses in ground mishap investigations promises of confidentiality. Before
     requesting HQ USAF approval to extend a promise of confidentiality to witnesses,
     investigators should first attempt to take statements from all individuals involved in the
     mishap or who were eyewitnesses to it. Investigators that feel offering a promise of
     confidentiality is the only way to collect meaningful, complete mishap prevention data
     should request approval to offer potential witnesses promises of confidentiality. When
     confidential witness statements are taken, include a list of witnesses interviewed in this
     tab. Also, include those statements the SIB or SIO believe are pertinent. The promise of
     confidentiality must be clearly understood by those witnesses extended the promise (see
     sample memorandums in AFI 91-204. Non-privileged statements will be placed in Tab R.
        A2.3.3.2.1. Transcripts of complete interviews must contain the advisories in AFI
        91-204 for written statement or recorded statement as appropriate. In cases where
        witness testimony is summarized by the interviewer, it must be clear that the witness
        was advised of, and understood the advisory.
        A2.3.3.2.2. Select only meaningful statements and testimony to include in this tab. It
        is not necessary to publish every statement taken from every individual interviewed.
        Place the statements and testimony of each individual together in chronological order
        with the earliest on top to make it easier to compare the individual’s impressions.
        Consider all statements and testimony included at this tab in the analysis at Tab T.
     A2.3.3.3. (As Required) TAB V. Other Supporting Privileged Products. Whenever
     findings or recommendations involve deficiencies in or changes to technical orders,
     checklists, local operating procedures or directives, include the applicable portions of the
     original publications in this tab. The SIB’s/SIOs conclusion that a particular paragraph of
     a document was or was not a mishap factor is privileged. Place highlighted pages or
     publication extracts revealing the deliberative process of the board in this tab. Include
     copies of submitted AFTO Forms 22 or AF Forms 847 here. Additionally, statements
     made by persons found causal to the mishap should be filed in this tab.
     A2.3.3.4. (As Required) TAB W. Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations
     Provided Under a Promise of Confidentiality. Normally ground safety investigations are
     not authorized to grant a promise of confidentiality. However if HQ USAF/SE has given
     approval to grant promises of confidentiality to contractors or technical specialists
     participating in ground safety investigations (AFI 91-204, Chapter 3) who built,
     designed, or maintained the equipment and they provides an engineering analysis under a
AFMAN91-224_AMCSUP1_I 31 MARCH 2006                                                             53


     promise of confidentiality, include the evaluation in this tab. If possible, include a factual
     summary in Tab N. Also, include memorandums of acknowledgment on protection of
     privileged safety data signed by these contractors when their evaluations are included in
     privileged formal reports (see sample format in AFI 91-204).
     A2.3.3.5. (As Required) TAB X. Privileged Photos, Videos, and Diagrams. Well-
     defined 8 by 10 inch glossy photographs help in mishap analysis. Use them to show
     damage, impact area, etc. Use diagrams if photographs or other visual media are not
     available or specific. Ensure diagrams are self-explanatory, indicating mishap locations in
     association with structures, facilities, etc. Photos supporting analysis in Tab W may be
     included here or imbedded in Tab W for clarity.
        A2.3.3.5.1. Privileged Diagrams. Attach appropriate copies to all reports. These
        should be electronically scanned for electronic formal reports.
        A2.3.3.5.2. Privileged Videos. Videos of a mishap prepared for or by the SIB are part
        of the SIB’s analysis of the mishap. Include CD copies in hard- copy formal reports
        and save as MPEG or other similar file for electronic formal reports.
        A2.3.3.5.3. Privileged Animation. Include CD-ROM copies in hard-copy formal
        reports and save as MPEG or other similar file for electronic formal reports.
     A2.3.3.6. (As Required) TAB Y. Life Sciences and Medical Reports. Includes medical
     analysis, 72-hour history, toxicology tests and any other information obtained by the
     medical evaluator. Tab Y may contain the following information and will be arranged in
     the following order:
        A2.3.3.6.1. Life Science Narratives, Part A and Part B. Part A provides a thorough
        discussion of all human factors contributing to the mishap and a discussion of all
        significant life support, egress, survival and rescue issues. Part B provides a
        discussion of factors investigated and found not to be relevant in the mishap, and any
        other negative findings that the medical investigator determines should be discussed
        to show how they were logically ruled out.
        A2.3.3.6.2. AFSAS Life Science Summary.
            A2.3.3.6.2.1. 72-Hour History. Required for all personnel (maintenance,
            operations, motor vehicle operators, etc.) whose action or inaction, in the
            commander’s judgment, may have been factors in the mishap sequence.
            A2.3.3.6.2.2. Life Science Consultant Reports when available.
            A2.3.3.6.2.3. Physical Examinations. Post-mishap physicals must be documented
            on a SF 88. Include physicals for individuals involved in the mishap only if
            determined appropriate by the medical investigator, (include this information only
            in the report sent to HQ AFSC).
            A2.3.3.6.2.4. Any other reports obtained by the medical investigator, e.g., TOX
            tests, x-rays, autopsy reports, post mishap exam results, etc., that support findings
            or recommendations made by the medical investigator (include only in the report
            sent to HQ AFSC).
