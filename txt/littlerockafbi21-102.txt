SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
were made to training requirements, and documentation. In addition to how deicing teams will be
managed.
1. Terms explained:
     1.1. Holdover: The length of time de-icing/anti-icing fluids maintain their effectiveness
     inhibiting snow, ice, frost, and slush accumulation. The times are variable based on
     fluid/water mixture, meteorological conditions, temperature, and expected precipitation
     accumulation. This is explained in depth in the AFFSA/XO Holdover Tables that are used as
     a mandatory extension of T.O. 42C-1-2.
     1.2. De-icing: The process of removing snow, ice, frost, or slush accumulation from aircraft
     surfaces, flight controls, openings, and hinge points. If there are significant amounts of snow
     build-up on the aircraft manually de-icing will be conducted whenever possible; de-icing
     fluids will only be used as an alternative method. De-icing holdover times are outlined in
     T.O.42C-1-2. Note: (Type I de-icing fluid should be applied after manual snow removal
     methods are completed.)
     1.3. Anti-icing: The process of inhibiting further snow, ice, frost, or slush accumulation on
     aircraft surfaces, flight controls, openings, and hinge points using an anti-icing fluid. Anti-
     icing fluids have holdover times during which their anti-icing properties are most effective,
     holdover times are outlined in T.O. 42C-1-2.
     1.4. One-step de-icing process: The process of removing accumulation of snow, ice, frost,
     and slush from aircraft surfaces when no frozen precipitation is falling or anticipated.
     Maintenance personnel are to accomplish this process using a combination of manual
     methods and/or Type I heated de-icing fluids. Maintenance will complete this process on the
     aircraft parking spot prior to aircrew arrival.
     1.5. Two-Step anti-icing process: This process is accomplished when visible precipitation is
     present or predicted to occur within the time the aircraft is scheduled to depart. This involves
     the combination of both de-icing (one-step) and anti-icing (two-step).
     1.6. De-icing Operations Supervisor: The 19th/314th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
     (AMXS) Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO)/Superintendent (SUPT) or designated
     representative will direct operations during non-routine/extreme weather events.
     1.7. De-icing Team Coordinator: The 19th/314th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS)
     designated representative will direct operations during normal weather conditions (call sign
     Victor 4). During non-routine/extreme weather conditions the De-icing Operations
     Coordinator is responsible to the De-icing Operations Supervisor.
     1.8. De-icing Team Leader: The most experienced de-icing team member, responsible to the
     De- icing Team Coordinator.
     1.9. De-icing Team: 19 AMXS/314 AMXS personnel will be assigned to de-icing teams
     and operate under the control of De-icing Team Coordinator. All de-icing team members
     will be fully trained/qualified prior to being assigned to this duty and squadrons must ensure
     that they have an adequate number of personnel trained to cover all shifts and time schedules.
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-102 20 AUGUST 2013                                                              3


   The 19 AMXS/314 AMXS teams will operate autonomously in regards to their respective
   de-icing requirements. Note: (Due to the unpredictable nature of icing conditions, de-icing
   teams may be called out at any time.)
   1.10. De-icing vehicle servicing log: This log is maintained in each vehicle during the de-
   icing season (see Attachment 2). Use an approved general purpose form or one approved by
   19 MXG Quality Assurance. This log should contain the following information:
       1.10.1. Date.
       1.10.2. Aircraft tail number.
       1.10.3. Time called to deice (Call time).
       1.10.4. Start/stop times of de-icing/anti-icing operation.
       1.10.5. Amount of fluid discharged.
       1.10.6. Freezing point (FP) of the fluid.
       1.10.7. Weather/Aircraft surface Condition.
2. De-icing/anti-icing fluids approved for C-130 use are:
   2.1. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II (approved until stocks are depleted).
   2.2. AMS 1424 Type I (both glycol based and glycol free fluids are approved): this is an
   improved commercially supplied de-icing fluid that replaces the military specific de-icing
   fluid MIL-A-8243 that has been discontinued. The fluid is normally mixed with water and
   applied “heated” to remove snow, ice or frost accumulations from aircraft surfaces. This
   fluid provides longer “holdover” times than the military specific fluid. AMS 1424 is a de-
   icing fluid with limited anti-icing properties. Type I fluid is orange-red in color and can be
   easily mistaken for hydraulic fluid.
   2.3. AMS 1428 Type II and Type IV: Type IV authorization must be obtained from the C-
   130SPO prior to each use speeds that generally exceed approximately 100 to 110 knots and
   have a take-off ground roll time of not less than 23 – seconds.
3. Responsibilities:
   3.1. MOC will:
       3.1.1. Monitor de-icing operations and track the aircraft that have completed de-icing.
   3.2. De-icing Operations Supervisor will:
       3.2.1. Direct de-icing operations during Non-Routine De-Icing Operations.

       available resources.
       3.2.3. Ensure the effective management of trained/qualified personnel and resources
       during Non- Routine De-Icing Operations.
   3.3. De-icing Operations Coordinator/Team Leaders will:
       3.3.1. Conduct annual de-icing/anti-icing training. Instructors will be designated by the
       unit commander and a letter filed at the 19 MOS/MTF. Certified individuals as De-icing

       3.3.3. Ensure assigned deicers are operational and serviced with the applicable de-
       icing/anti- icing fluid. Ensure the servicing log is annotated with the proper information
       each time the truck is filled or utilized to deice an aircraft.
       3.3.4. When the number of serviceable deicers falls below the minimum essential level
       (MEL) after normal duty hours, during weekends/holidays and when the flying schedule
       dictates contact the 19 LRS/LGRV stand-by technicians through vehicle operations
       dispatch element.
       3.3.5. After a de-icing team completes the aircraft de-icing/anti-icing operation a team
       member will inform the flight crew of the type and concentration of de-icing fluid used,
       the time application was started and finished, and the fact the aircraft has been inspected.
       This information will be recorded in the AFTO Form 781A or verbally communicated to

 6                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI21-102 20 AUGUST 2013


     4.11. De-icing Teams will inspect, service, and report discrepancies to vehicle maintenance
     in preparation for the next day’s de-icing operations.
5. Non-Routine De-icing Operations (as weather dictates)
     5.1. The 19/314 AMXS MOO/SUPT, 19 OG (or designated operations and maintenance
     representatives) will determine operational limitations based on flying schedules and
     resources available. During non-routine operations they will assume the role of de-icing
     operations supervisor.
     5.2. Production Superintendents are responsible for ensuring the following:
        5.2.1. De-icing operations are accomplished IAW established procedures.
        5.2.2. Place heaters in the front and rear of the aircraft five hours prior to crew show.
        5.2.3. Inform the MOC when de-icing/anti-icing operations begin and end on each
        aircraft.
        5.2.4. Contact the MOC when de-icing is complete for the current days flying schedule.
     5.3. Document all fluid use and submit the information to the De-icing Operations
     Coordinator for inclusion in the glycol usage slide.
6. Runway/Hammerhead de-icing and anti-icing procedures.
     6.1. Final end-of-runway de-icing/anti-icing will not be accomplished on the Hammerhead
     (runway 25 and 07). Aircraft will taxi to an approved spot in coordination with the MOC and
     the De-icing Operations Coordinator to have the aircraft deiced
     6.2. Aircraft are not permitted to take off with coatings of snow or frost buildup on areas of
     the wing other than the lower surface fuel tank region. The aircraft commander is the final
     authority for decisions regarding adequacy of de-icing/anti-icing prior to flight. Maintenance
     personnel will first remove large accumulations of snow from aircraft surfaces by some other
     method besides the use of de-icing fluid. Maintenance will ensure that all flight control
     surfaces, hinges, and sealed compartments are free of slush, snow, and ice. Aircrews will
     also check flight control surfaces for freedom of movement after de-icing is completed.
