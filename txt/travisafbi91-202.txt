   uted to appropriate units as required. Upon receipt of the messages, the unit commander will ensure
   the widest possible dissemination, including through the use of email. They will brief the information
   at the next safety meeting, Commander’s Call, etc., and document in safety meeting minutes to ensure
   absent members also receive the information. Units will include a section in their continuity book
   describing these procedures. Additionally, a file will be maintained by each unit stating when each
   message was received and briefed and any other actions taken.

7. Wing Commander’s Safety Policy.

   cations are maintained with the Wing Safety staff.

Section B—Ground Safety

9. Scope. The squadron ground safety program is the squadron commander’s program. It must be specif-
ically oriented to the squadron mission. The unit safety program should focus on the application of mis-
hap prevention and Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles and procedures. It should also be
designed to provide safety coverage in all unit ground activities involving Air Force personnel, material,
equipment, and facilities, both on/off duty and on/off base.

10. Ground Mishap Notification.
   10.1. Commanders will ensure standard procedures are developed for prompt reporting of all govern-
   ment property damage mishaps, injuries to Air Force military, and on-duty civilian personnel to the 60
   AMW Safety Office and applicable functional managers.

    10.2. In order to perform adequate and accurate investigations, timely notification of mishaps is
    extremely important. Consequently, individuals must immediately report an on-duty injury to their
    supervisor. The supervisor will contact the unit safety representative as soon as possible. The unit
    safety representative will respond to the mishap immediately and also contact the Wing Safety Office
    within 30 minutes. Off-duty mishaps will be reported by 1100 hours the next duty day.
    10.3. During duty hours, contact Wing Ground Safety personnel and after duty hours, Safety Standby
    Duty Investigator can be reached through the Travis Command Post (TCP), which will in turn notify
    the 60 AMW safety standby duty investigator.
    10.4. 60 AMW Form 141, Ground Mishap Worksheet:
       10.4.1. All mishaps will be initially investigated by the safety officer/NCO or a representative

       haps.
       10.4.3. 60 AMW Form 141 will be delivered to the Ground Safety Office (60 AMW/SEG) no
       later than (NLT) 1100 hours the first duty day following the initial notification of the mishap.
       10.4.4. When an injury results in lost duty time, include a copy of the quarters notice along with
       the 60 AMW Form 141.

11. Submission and Staffing of Ground Mishap Reports.
    11.1. Ground mishap reports must be completed by the 60 AMW Ground Safety Office entered into
    the USAF Safety Reporting System, and forwarded to higher headquarters, within 30 working days
    from the date of occurrence. Actions to be completed within this period include investigation, prepa-
    ration, and staffing of the report. To enable the Ground Safety Office to meet this requirement, com-
    manders will establish procedures to ensure that:
       11.1.1. Full cooperation and support are given the individual investigating the mishap.
       11.1.2. All mishap reports received for staffing are given immediate action. The maximum time
       for completion of staff action at each level is 24 hours.

12. Seasonal Campaigns.
    12.1. Unit commanders will conduct seasonal safety campaigns in their units based on guidelines and
    assistance provided by 60 AMW Safety Office. The program of separate mishap prevention cam-
    paigns throughout the year is tailored to meet mishap potential unique to different periods and sea-
    sons. Safety posters and other educational material can be used to enhance these campaigns. This
    material is available to all squadrons through 60 AMW Safety Office.
    12.2. Fall, Winter, and Spring Mishap Prevention Program: Campaigns for this period are initiated 1
    September and extended through Memorial Day each year. This campaign places continued emphasis
    on private motor vehicle operations and mishap prevention during the winter, with emphasis on haz-

   exposure times involving more people on the roads, in swimming pools, and on camping grounds
   enjoying these and other types of outdoor activities. The campaign includes programs for seatbelts,
   prevention of alcohol abuse, swimming, boating, and motorcycle safety. Automobile accidents and
