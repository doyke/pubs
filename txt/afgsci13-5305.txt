                                          Chapter 1

                  GENERAL PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Missile Alert Facility Management Program. The primary mission of the MAF
management program is to provide trained Facility Managers (FM) to perform management tasks
at the MAF on a 24-hour basis. Additional duties and other taskings that do not directly support
the mission will be kept to a minimum to avoid interfering with the successful accomplishment
of the mission.
1.2. Resource Utilization. Assigned personnel and resources must be effectively utilized to
maximize mission accomplishment. The Operations Group (OG) FM Superintendent MAF
Management shall establish policy to equalize FM alert scheduling as necessary and will
maintain finalized monthly schedules for the previous 12 months.
   1.2.1. Qualifications for entry into the 8S000 special duty are contained in AFI 36-2101,
   Classifying Military Personnel, (Officer and Enlisted).
   1.2.2. Assignment availability codes (AAC) 43 and 50 are used to regulate FM tours of duty.
   AFI 36-2110, Assignments, contains detailed information about the use of AACs. All Air
   Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) must be submitted to AFGSC/A1KA for addition to
   Stabilized Tour Guide.
       1.2.2.1. The FM tour of duty is four years. The four year controlled tour is contingent on
       manning requirements, needs of the Air Force, and individual duty performance. A code
       50 will be applied to FMs at no later than the 4-year point to ensure personnel do not
       spend more than five years in the facility manager special duty.
       1.2.2.2. This tour length will allow for continued career progression, prevent loss of
       previous AFSC, and will ensure FM duty is only used as a special duty. The OG FM
       Superintendent MAF Management will monitor and coordinate the tour of duty lengths
       with the 8S000 Assignment Enlisted Manager and 20 AF/A3NF.
   1.2.3. Use of the facility manager to reduce maintenance specialist dispatch must be limited
   to the scope of the facility manager’s 8S000 Career Field Education and Training Plan
   (CFETP).
   1.2.4. For manning purposes, FMs will not be assigned to positions outside the 8S000
   Special Duty Identifier (SDI) that would preclude them from performing duties listed within
   this AFGSCI unless released from the 8S000 SDI.
   1.2.5. Workload requirements: The following limitations may be waived by the Operations
   Group Commander (OG/CC) when operational requirements dictate.
       1.2.5.1. The maximum alert days per month should not exceed a total of 16alert/travel
       days (17 days in a 31 day calendar month). The minimum alert days per a month should
       not be less than 12 alert/travel days. Squadron CCs will designate in writing to the
       OG/CC FMs available for duty who perform less than 12 or more than 17 alert/travel
       days per month with the following exceptions: OG FM Superintendent MAF
       Management, Missile Squadron Superintendent MAF Management, Missile Squadron
       FM NCOIC, Evaluator, OSS FM Instructor, MAF Supply NCO, and personnel on leave
       and/or TDY.
 4                                                              AFGSCI13-5305 25 APRIL 2013


            1.2.5.1.1. OG FM Superintendent MAF Management and Missile Squadron
            Superintendents will be a certified FM from within the OG.
        1.2.5.2. The minimum duration of an alert tour is 24 hours. This time begins when
        personnel report for alert duty at support base.
        1.2.5.3. Depending on operations tempo, MAF activities should be limited to permit at
        least 8 hours rest during each 24-hour alert period. This does not preclude response to
        abnormal indications that require immediate response.
        1.2.5.4. FMs normally perform duties at the MAFs within their assigned missile
        squadron. FMs may be utilized at any MAF to equalize workloads.
        1.2.5.5. FMs earn the minimum of 50 percent of their alert-related time as a rest period
        following a MAF alert. Alert time ends when all alert related activities are completed
        upon return to the support base.
1.3. Testing Procedural Improvements. If a unit identifies the need for a new procedure or
methods to streamline an existing procedure codified in technical orders, CE manuals or HHQ
instructions, coordinate with 20 AF/A3NF to determine if testing authorization is required. This
will ensure the standardization of any approved change in procedure. Before field-testing new
procedures, forward a copy of the test proposal, to include all necessary support information, to
HQ AFGSC/A3I, through 20 AF/A3NF. Proposals affecting real property (RP) and real property
installed equipment (RPIE) require HQ AFGSC/A4/7 coordination through the base missile
engineer (reference AFGSCI 32-1005, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Real
Property/Real Property Installed Equipment (RP/RPIE) Responsibilities) with information
copies to 20 AF/A3NF and HQ AFGSC/A3IA.
     1.3.1. Proposals should include, but are not limited to, the following:
        1.3.1.1. New procedure or concept.
        1.3.1.2. Anticipated management improvement.
        1.3.1.3. Impact outside this instruction.
        1.3.1.4. Time required to fully test.
        1.3.1.5. Unit point of contact and telephone number.
        1.3.1.6. Specific test objectives.
     1.3.2. If field-testing is approved, HQ AFGSC/A3I will provide appropriate notification and
     implementing authority.
     1.3.3. Units will coordinate any decision to stop, suspend or resume testing with HQ
     AFGSC/A3I through 20 AF/A3NF.
     1.3.4. Forward progress reports and field test results to HQ AFGSC/A3I, through 20
     AF/A3NF for final evaluation. Address each specific objective and assess attainment of that
     objective in quantifiable terms.
1.4. Clarification and Guidance. Units requiring clarification or guidance on MAF
management activities may request this information by AF Form 847.
     1.4.1. Send requests to HQ AFGSC/A3I, through 20 AF/A3NF.
AFGSCI13-5305 25 APRIL 2013                                                                    5


   1.4.2. Originators/HQ AFGSC/A3I will ensure all units that could be affected are included

   annually to ensure proper documentation and task coverage.
   4.2.9. Manage the FM evaluation program. The evaluation program provides leadership the
   means to assess mission capability and management effectiveness. To assess these areas it
   uses management inspections and proficiency evaluations.
      4.2.9.1. Develop a management system that reflects required evaluations/inspections,
      completion dates, and due dates.
      4.2.9.2. Determine evaluation/inspection report content, format, distribution, and routing
      procedures. Forward all copies of Q3 proficiency evaluation reports monthly to 20 AF/
      A3NF.
          4.2.9.2.1. Produce evaluation/inspection reports that identify positive efforts as well
          as underlying causes of substandard quality. Make recommendations when
          applicable; however, ensure the evaluated/inspected activity remains free to choose
          the solution that best fixes the problem. For proficiency evaluations cover the
          following:
             4.2.9.2.1.1. Strengths and weaknesses of the individual performance during
             evaluation.
             4.2.9.2.1.2. Document deviations observed and annotate with all applicable
             references.
             4.2.9.2.1.3. An impact assessment for each deviation noted. Units may develop
             local criteria to assist in determining impact of deviations; however, this criteria
             must be a reasonable expectation of the deviation. 20 AF/A3NF will review all
             impact assessments and provide units with feedback as necessary. The evaluator
             knows best the significance of each observed deviation and must translate that
             significance so management has a clear perspective of actions observed. The
             intent is to inform management of all observations and identify those deviations
             that may require significant retraining vice those noted only for possible trend
             analysis.
4.3. Manning, Qualification and Proficiency:
   4.3.1. All evaluators must complete the unit evaluator training program and will complete
   the 20 AF/ICE evaluator course at a minimum. OGV may use augmentee evaluators.

      4.5.3.1. Personnel proficiency evaluations (PPEs). Evaluators conduct PPEs on
      personnel involved in MAF management actions. These observations will encompass
      safety, security, tool usage, general management practices, technical data usage, etc.
      4.5.3.2. Evaluators must stop, correct, alert appropriate agencies, and render a Q3 rating
      for any of the following deviations (actual or possible): Significant security violations or
      safety deviations that could result in injury to themselves and/or other personnel and
      deviations that could result in potential/imminent serious equipment damage. Errors of
      this magnitude are critical for any FM evaluation. Refer to Table 4.1 for further
      guidance.
      4.5.3.3. For all Q3 ratings the evaluatee is rendered unqualified to perform unsupervised
      FM duties. The FM Evaluator will remain at the MAF, and supervise all FM duties until
      a qualified FM assumes control. The FM Evaluator will provide recommendations to the
 20                                                          AFGSCI13-5305 25 APRIL 2013


      squadron commander whether to relieve the FM based on their assessment. The
      evaluatee must be retrained and recertified in accordance with Facility Manager
      certification procedures as outlined in paragraph 2.4.8 Remedial training on the tasks
      leading to the unfavorable rating will be conducted by a certified FM trainer and
      documented in the training record, regardless of whether the evaluatee is relieved from
      the field or not.
      4.5.3.4. The Squadron Superintendent MAF Management will provide the evaluator with
      a new certification letter and the individual will be re-evaluated within 60 days. The re-
      evaluation will encompass the tasks that led to the Q3 rating as well as other tasks that
      were deviated but were not critical. The highest possible qualification rating that can be
      assessed on a re-evaluation is a Q1.
      4.5.3.5. Formal review boards for all Q3 ratings will be conducted at the discretion of the
      OG/CC.
4.6. Proficiency Evaluation Guidelines:
   4.6.1. Before conducting a PPE the evaluator will verify the evaluatee is task qualified in
   their TBA.
   4.6.2. When selecting tasks for evaluation, evaluator must ensure evaluation of a variety of
   tasks, different equipment and different management actions for each individual.
   Additionally, OGV must ensure evaluations cover a sampling of all systems in which an
   individual is qualified.
   4.6.3. Evaluate personnel as desired on any TBA MAF management task(s). Evaluators will
   have their own copy of technical data available for the task being evaluated.
   4.6.4. Use no-notice evaluations whenever possible. The FM evaluator will notify personnel
   when they are within 90 days of their annual evaluation date. Initial evaluations will be
   scheduled and conducted no later than 90 days after the missile squadron FM superintendent
   provides the evaluator with an initial certification letter for newly assigned FMs.
   4.6.5. Manage PPE scheduling requirements. Conduct PPEs on an annual basis. 20 AF
   conducted PPEs may be used to fulfill this annual requirement. Use the following for
   evaluation eligibility:
      4.6.5.1. Evaluate each line FM annually. Do not exceed 12 months between evaluations.
      An FM will be considered overdue on the first day of the 13th month since their previous
      evaluation. Ensure the evaluation includes a sampling of TBA tasks and at a minimum,
      one emergency procedure.
          4.6.5.1.1. If an evaluation cannot be accomplished before the last day of the
          anniversary month, the evaluator will generate a Memorandum for Record (MFR)
          stating the reason and retain a copy for his/her records and forward a copy to 20
          AF/A3NF.
      4.6.5.2. Evaluation of the OG FM Superintendent MAF Management, Missile Squadron
      Superintendent MAF Management, OGV Evaluator, and MAF Supply NCOIC will be
      conducted at the discretion of the OG/CC. The OG/CC shall specify in a memorandum
      which of the aforementioned individuals are exempt from an annual evaluation which
      will be retained by the FM evaluator and renewed annually.
AFGSCI13-5305 25 APRIL 2013                                                                     21


     4.6.5.3. If an Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Component (AFRC)
     member is on active duty orders for longer than 90 days, he/she will receive an initial
     evaluation within 90 days of certification date and annually thereafter. Those members
     fulfilling monthly ANG or Air Force Reserve (AFR) requirements and not on active duty
     orders will be certified but will not require personnel proficiency evaluations.
  4.6.6. Conducting Proficiency Evaluations:
     4.6.6.1. Brief individuals before beginning a PPE. For tasks already in progress, notify
     the individuals they are under evaluation and brief them as soon as practical. The
     evaluation in-brief should be conducted immediately following MAF entry and the visitor
     safety briefing.
     4.6.6.2. During the briefing, the evaluator must advise the individual of the following:
         4.6.6.2.1. All management actions performed are subject to observation. This
         includes management actions that are observed, but are not included in the evaluation
         script.
         4.6.6.2.2. Do not compromise safety or security. This will result in a Q3 rating.
         4.6.6.2.3. Under normal circumstances, do not consider the evaluator as the second
         person to satisfy buddy care requirements.
         4.6.6.2.4. Take breaks during the evaluation if needed. Breaks will not be taken
         during the emergency procedure unless absolutely necessary.
         4.6.6.2.5. Notify the evaluator of applicable, site specific information that could
         affect the task.
         4.6.6.2.6. The evaluator may ask questions to determine the evaluatee’s knowledge
         of a task. The evaluatee may use technical references to answer any questions.
         4.6.6.2.7. The evaluatee is responsible for all tasks and related actions.          The
         evaluator’s presence does not shift this responsibility.
         4.6.6.2.8. The evaluatee may ask for technical help from personnel or agencies
         normally available in the conduct of day-to-day operations. The evaluator conducting
         the evaluation should be asked only as a last resort and when all other avenues of help
         have been exhausted.
     4.6.6.3. During task observations, the evaluator must detect and correct all deviations.
     Select the best option available to correct the situation. The evaluator will correct
     insignificant deviations during the critique phase; other deviations may warrant prompt
     correction. The evaluator will give individuals the opportunity to make decisions on the
     best courses of action on their own, using the resources available to them.
         4.6.6.3.1. During the out-brief, the evaluator will explain each deviation, conduct
         training to the level necessary to ensure the individual’s understanding of the
         circumstance in question. The evaluator may be prohibited from conducting the out-
         brief by time, resources, attitudes, or a combination of factors. If prohibited, note the
         situation in the final evaluation report. The evaluator may recommend the individual
         should not perform the task until retrained.

          4.6.6.3.2. Apply the following guidelines when an individual cannot correctly or
          safely perform a task without excessive outside intervention or assistance.
              4.6.6.3.2.1. Prior to the out-brief, the evaluator will discuss all deviations and
              overall qualification level with the Chief OGV. Once coordination with the Chief
              OGV is complete the evaluator will contact the following individuals:
                 4.6.6.3.2.1.1. Squadron Commander (or Director of Operations)
                 4.6.6.3.2.1.2. OG FM Superintendent MAF Management
                 4.6.6.3.2.1.3. Squadron Superintendent MAF Management
      4.6.6.4. Critique individuals as soon as practical after the evaluation. The evaluator must
      cover the following:
          4.6.6.4.1. Explain each deviation. Include mission impact and correct procedures.
          4.6.6.4.2. Review the strengths and weaknesses of the individual performance during
          evaluation.
          4.6.6.4.3. Recommend methods of task accomplishment.
          4.6.6.4.4. Exchange ideas and techniques.
          4.6.6.4.5. Award an overall qualification level rating of qualification level 1 (Q1),
          qualification level 2 (Q2), or qualification level 3 (Q3) for the entire evaluation
          process using the guidance provided in Table 4.1
          4.6.6.4.6. To recognize top Q1 performances an award of Exceptionally Qualified
          (EQ) may be awarded. EQ will only be utilized in conjunction with a Q1 rating and
          is reserved for recognition of exceptional performance.
          4.6.6.4.7. Individuals will be rated Q3 at any time during the management process if
          they commit any of the following deviations: failure to utilize technical data,
          significant security violations, safety deviations that could result in injury to
          themselves and/or other personnel, and deviations that could result in
          potential/imminent serious equipment damage.

           4.7.6.2.3. Technicians that commit deviations described in paragraph 4.5.3.2 at any
           time during the management process will be rated unqualified.
4.8. Evaluation Ratings. Overall evaluation performances are rated by qualification levels.
   4.8.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the desired level of
   performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within prescribed
   tolerances.
       4.8.1.1. Criteria for a Q1 rating consist of no critical errors and two or fewer non-critical
       errors.
   4.8.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the ability to perform
   duties safely, but may need additional training at the discretion of the squadron commander
   or operations officer.
       4.8.2.1. Criteria for a Q2 rating consist of no critical errors, and three to four non-critical
       errors.
       4.8.2.2. The level of training and other corrective actions for any errors (briefing, formal
       training or evaluation) and possible restriction for the evaluatee will be determined by the
       squadron commander or operations officer.
   4.8.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3) indicates an evaluatee is unqualified based on an
   unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
       4.8.3.1. Criteria for a Q3 rating consist of one or more critical errors, or more than four
       non-critical errors.
       4.8.3.2. The level of training for any errors (briefing or formal training) will be
       determined by the squadron commander or operations officer.
       4.8.3.3. A requalification evaluation including all tasks with critical errors and non-
       critical errors that lead to the Q3 rating is required.
       4.8.3.4. The evaluatee is restricted and may not perform unsupervised MAF FM duty
       until completion of retraining on all tasks where errors that lead to the Q3 rating were
       committed. At the discretion of the Squadron Commander the individual may be
       retrained/recertified on the spot by a qualified FM trainer. Recertification must be
       accomplished by either the Missile Squadron Superintendent MAF Management or
       Operations Group FM Superintendent MAF Management.
   4.8.4. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated exceptional
   knowledge and performance above the standard. The goal of the exceptionally qualified
   rating is to recognize an evaluation performance considered to be among the top 15% of all
   FM evaluations.
       4.8.4.1. To be eligible for nomination, an evaluatee must complete a PPE, TPE or a EPE,
       and receive a Q1 rating with zero errors committed.
       4.8.4.2. Evaluatees will be nominated to receive the EQ designation on the evaluation
       report based on the discretion of the evaluators.
