                                           Chapter 1

                    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN THE AIR FORCE

1.1. Overview. Financial management is the process of determining requirements, obtaining
resources, and effectively and efficiently applying those resources to meet the Air Force's direct
mission and support responsibilities. Commanders are responsible for this process. Financial
management also has oversight responsibilities to include evaluation of internal controls,
procedures, and protection of government assets.
1.2. Applying This Instruction. All activities that prepare, justify, and execute Air Force
appropriations, including Air Force business areas of the Defense Working Capital Fund, must
follow this guidance.
1.3. Responsibilities. The following responsibilities are established:
   1.3.1. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Budget (SAF/FMB):
       1.3.1.1. Establishes Air Force appropriated fund budget guidance and procedures for
       preparing, justifying, and executing budgets.
       1.3.1.2. Provides guidance on organizational and appropriation funding responsibilities
       and use of funds (propriety) issues.
       1.3.1.3. Develops and maintains the budget structure and associated codes.
       1.3.1.4. Serves as a member of the Air Force Services Council (SAF/FMB), serves as
       Chairperson, NAF Finance Committee (SAF/FMB) and provides the Chairperson for the
       Air Force Services Audit Committee (SAF/FMBO). See details in AFI 65-107,
       NonAppropriated Funds Financial Management Oversight Responsibilities, and
       Committee Charters.
   1.3.2. MAJCOMs, Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National Guard (ANG), Headquarters Air
   Force (HAF), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and Civil
   Air Patrol (CAP) program managers and installations will program, budget and administer
   appropriated funds according to the guidance and procedures in this instruction.
1.4. Related Guidance. See related guidance in Department of Defense (DoD) 7000.14-R,
Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, authorized by DoD Instruction
7000.14, Department of Defense Financial Management Policy and Procedures; Volume 2 of
this AFI, Budget Management for Operations; AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and
Budget Codes, and AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation
(MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). See financial regulations of the
Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for related accounting guidance available at
https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    23


                                           Chapter 2

     WARRANTS, APPORTIONMENTS, TRANSFERS, AND REPROGRAMMING

2.1. Overview. The Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Treasury
Department, and Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) must take
certain actions before the Air Force can legally obligate and expend appropriated funds.An
appropriation bill becomes law (is enacted) when the President signs it, or when the Congress
passes it over the President‘s veto (unless the bill gives a different effective date). After the
Congress enacts an appropriation, the Treasury issues an appropriation warrant and OMB
apportions the appropriation. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1512 contains apportionment criteria.
2.2. Responsibilities:
   2.2.1. SAF/FMB requests apportionment from the DoD Comptroller.
   2.2.2. When the DoD operates under a continuing resolution authority (CRA), SAF/FMB
   must request apportionment from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for amounts
   needed during the period of the CRA. SAF/FMB will issue funding documents to major
   commands (MAJCOM) and other Air Force field activities. OMB approves apportionment
   requests.
   2.2.3. If the Congress has not enacted the DoD appropriation act and has not passed a CRA,
   SAF/FMB will provide guidance on how to operate without funding authorization. Usually,
   federal agencies cannot initiate new program starts under continuing resolutions.
   2.2.4. The transfer of funds between appropriations resulting from congressionally directed
   transfers or reprogramming actions are accomplished by SAF/FMB using SF Form 1151,
   Nonexpenditure Transfer Authorization, processed through and validated by the Treasury
   Department. SAF/FMB can make transfers only with legal authority, e.g., congressionally
   directed transfers in appropriation language, or specific Congressional direction/approval,
   e.g. reprogrammings.
2.3. Reprogrammings:
   2.3.1. Reprogramming involves realigning funds from one purpose (or program) to another;
   a program may be defined as a line item on the Base for Reprogramming Actions (DD 1414)
   for a given year. Within DoD, reprogramming includes transferring funds between
   appropriations and moving funds between programs (which can include line items, sub-
   programs, sub-projects as applicable) in the same appropriation.
   2.3.2. The Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for programs that are either stated in
   statutory language or discussed in the committee reports that accompany authorization and
   appropriation acts. However, Congress recognizes unforeseen requirements occur during the
   execution phase of a budget and, therefore, permits reprogramming of funds in execution
   within certain guidelines, which are subject to annual Congressional guidance. Both statutory
   and regulatory rules govern reprogramming.
   2.3.3. Follow these rules:
       2.3.3.1. The Congress must provide prior approval of a reprogramming if it:
 24                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


          2.3.3.1.1. Transfers funds between appropriation accounts or working capital funds
          that involve the use of transfer authority.
             2.3.3.1.1.1. For Internal Reprogramming actions, transfer of funds from one
             appropriation to another for the same purpose does not require Congressional
             Approval. However, there may be exceptions; see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume
             3, Chapter 6. The transfer is requested via a DD Form 1415-3 Internal
             Reprogramming. DoD FMR 7000.14-R details ‗audit-trail type actions‘ that fall
             under internal reprogramming. Example: A congressional add to the O&M, AF
             appropriation for research and development work – this activity is properly
             funded in RDT&E, AF. See OSD Reprogramming Authority Policy for
             additional details; reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 6.
          2.3.3.1.2. Affects an item known to be of special interest to one or more
          Congressional oversight committees. In rare instances, when funds from special
          interest items are to be reprogrammed from an existing program, subprogram, project,
          or subproject to another program, subprogram, project, or subproject within the same
          procurement line item or program element, letter notification to the congressional
          committees may be made.
          2.3.3.1.3. Increases the quantity of a procurement line item authorized by Congress
          in quantity terms, unless specific Congressional language allows for additional
          quantities to be procured within appropriated funds. Increases resulting from such
          language require approval via a DD 1415-1, Reprogramming Action.
   2.3.4. See Chapter 6 for guidance on within-scope contract changes and upward obligations
   for canceled accounts.
   2.3.5. See Chapter 18 for Reprogramming in Defense Working Capital Fund Business
   Areas.
   2.3.6. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapters 6 and 7 for further details.
2.4. Congressional New Start Notification Procedures.
   2.4.1. Congressional new start notification procedures are delineated in DoD FMR 7000.14-
   R, Volume 3, Chapter 6. Appropriation thresholds are established by the OUSD(C); contact
   the SAF/FMB appropriation manager for threshold, etc. matters.
      2.4.1.1. New Start: A program, subprogram, modification, project or subproject,
      regardless of amount, not explicitly and previously justified to, and funded by, the
      Congress in a given appropriation through the normal budget process. This includes any
      effort that is not described in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E)
      or Procurement Justification Books accompanying the President‘s Budget (PB). Budget
      justification documentation submitted to Congress can be found on the SAF/FM web site
      at http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/budget. For purposes of this paragraph, the following
      definitions apply.
      2.4.1.2. Program.
          2.4.1.2.1. For investment accounts, the aggregate level of budget line items as
          identified in the President‘s Budget P-1 and R-1 justification documents and related
          classified annexes and reports as subsequently modified by Congressional action.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   25


        2.4.1.2.2. For O&M and Military Personnel accounts, new starts would be
        significant new programs that have not been explicitly justified to Congress in budget
        justification material. Refer to the subactivity group on the O-1 for the program level
        identification and the detailed narrative justification for specific activities.
     2.4.1.3. Sub-Program/Project/Sub-Project: The most specific level of budgeted items
     identified in the President's Budget justification documents and related classified
     annexes. These sub-programs, project, and sub-projects are shown as separate efforts
     below the P-1/R-1 line.
        2.4.1.3.1. For RDT&E refer to R-2A budget exhibits by fiscal year. The Budget
        Program Activity Code (BPAC) may also indicate the level of detail that should be
        reviewed.
        2.4.1.3.2. For Aircraft, Missile, and Other Procurement refer to P-40 narrative and
        supporting exhibits such as P-3As, P-5s.
        2.4.1.3.3. Note that the RDT&E BPAC may exist and have funds in the year of the
        effort under consideration; however, if this new effort is not included in the budget
        documentation, a new start notification is still required.
     2.4.1.4. Modifications: Modifications are the alteration, conversion, modernization, or
     major service life extension of an end item of investment equipment which changes or
     improves either the original purpose or operational capacity in relation to effectiveness,
     efficiency, reliability or safety of that item. P-1 line items are considered programs, and
     modification number identified on the P-3 report would be the sub-program or project.
        2.4.1.4.1. All modifications, regardless of amount, not previously justified and
        appropriated by Congress require Congressional notification or prior approval
        (depending upon dollar value) before obligations can occur. See OSD
        Reprogramming Authority Policy for additional information.
        2.4.1.4.2. Safety Modification. Safety modifications and safety programs costing less
        than $20 million for the entire effort can be initiated immediately following
        submission of Congressional notification. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3,
        Chapter 6, paragraph 060403.D. A modification that corrects a material deficiency
        which caused a Class A Mishap (per AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports),
        as determined by the AFSC Memorandum of Final Evaluation, shall be classified a
        safety modification. Other modifications may be classified as a safety modification as
        described in AFI 63-131, Modification Management.
        2.4.1.4.3. Low cost Modification (Mod #9999X): Individual modifications funded in
        the Low Cost Modification line generally satisfy an unforeseen requirement estimated
        to complete within one year. Total funding for efforts on the Low cost Mod line for
        each fiscal year should not exceed $2.0M per year. Any effort not consistent with the
        Low Cost Mod line budget documentation or efforts exceeding the $2.0M dollar
        threshold are not considered ―low cost‖ and must be documented on a separate P3A
        and are subject to new start guidelines.
        2.4.1.4.4. Service Bulletin. Service bulletins are airworthiness directives issued by
        the FAA or the weapon system manufacturer. These modifications are required to
 26                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


          keep the weapon system in compliance with FAA standards and to maintain FAA
          certification. Modifications as a result of FAA service bulletins are considered new
          starts if they occur during execution years and are not consistent with the Service
          Bulletin modification line budget documentation.
      2.4.1.5. Spares and Repair Parts: Items procured by these lines are normally not
      individually justified; therefore, procurement of additional items, based upon demand,
      would normally not be considered to be new starts. New Start notification procedures do
      apply whenever it results in a new program or P-1 line item.
   2.4.2. Refer to AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management for
   additional guidance.
2.5. Deferrals and Rescissions. Initiate deferral actions only with SAF approval. Forward
requests for deferrals through MAJCOMs/FOAs to SAF/FMB for review and approval. See
Attachment 4 for specific DoD Comptroller guidance on using deferrals and rescissions.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    27


                                          Chapter 3

         BUDGET AUTHORIZATION, ALLOCATIONS, AND ALLOTMENTS

3.1. Administering Budget Authority Documents:
   3.1.1. This chapter explains procedures for using budget authorizations, allocations,
   suballocations, allotments, and suballotments for appropriations that are not administered
   under the accounting system for operations. AFI 65-601, Volume 2, explains how to use the
   operating budget authority document (OBAD) for appropriations administered under the
   accounting system for operations.
   3.1.2. The Air Force goal is to provide optimum fund flexibility at all levels. Therefore, Air
   Force funds issuing activities will:
      3.1.2.1. Issue budget authorizations and other management type authorizations at the
      highest practical level within an appropriation, consistent with the requirements of
      management and limitations imposed by the executive and legislative branches of the
      federal government.
      3.1.2.2. Issue allocations and allotments (including suballocations and suballotments) at
      the appropriation level at all echelons except as indicated in paragraph 3.6.
      3.1.2.3. Include limitations on funds use required by law and limitations on funds use
      required by the legislative and executive branches of the federal government and the
      Department of the Air Force on allocation documents. Limitations subject to Title 31
      U.S.C. (and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14) must apply to total availability or total
      obligations for specific purposes. Clearly identify each specific limitation in the
      "Limitations" portion of the allocation document.
   3.1.3. Operating agencies that receive budget authorizations and allocations from SAF/FMB
   must issue budget authorizations and suballocations or allotments to themselves for direct
   administration and obligation, or to subordinate or lateral activities.
   3.1.4. Operational activities that receive budget authorizations and suballocations or
   allotments must use these authorizations for direct administration and obligation. However, if
   performance is to be by another activity, issue budget authorizations and allotments,
   suballotments, AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, or other citation of funds to those
   activities.
   3.1.5. Recipients who subissue budget authorizations, suballocations, allotments, or
   suballotments may not remove nor add to restrictions contained in the instruments they
   receive.
   3.1.6. The ultimate end user may subdivide the budget authorizations, allotments, or
   suballotments as necessary to maintain control over funds, provide data for budget estimates
   and reports, and provide for local management requirements.
   3.1.7. Commands, subcommands, or installations that receive budget authorizations and
   allotments or suballotments from parent organizations, which are to be obligated for the
   requirements of tenant units located on or supported by the host organization, will subdivide
   them when necessary to:
 28                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      3.1.7.1. Make sure their use is in accordance with the tenant's approved execution plan.
      3.1.7.2. Maintain control on limitations placed on the use of funds.
      3.1.7.3. Provide required data for preparing and revising the tenant's annual execution
      plan and required reports.
   3.1.8. Further divisions of budget authorizations and allotments or suballotments by the
   ultimate user (for example, element of expense investment codes (EEIC) or responsibility
   center/cost center codes (RC/CC)), are not subdivisions of funds under DFAS-DE ―Interim
   Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made
   Available to the Department of the Air Force‖. (NOTE: AF Form 616 is not a subdivision
   of funds under DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14).
3.2. Basis for Budget Authorizations:
   3.2.1. The approved annual execution plan is the basis for the budget authorizations issued
   by SAF/FMB. SAF/FMB will advise the major commands (MAJCOM) and field operating
   agencies (FOA) of the approved execution program by issuing budget authorizations for the
   applicable fiscal or program year. All echelons of command responsible for issuing budget
   authorizations to subordinate or lateral organizations must make sure that the aggregate of
   amounts issued does not exceed the amount of the budget authorization received.
   3.2.2. Budget authorizations represent the approved execution program with which the
   recipient can plan to accomplish the mission in an orderly manner. Each additional budget
   authorization received for the applicable fiscal or program year must reflect the cumulative
   authorization for that year. Budget authorizations do not grant the authority to incur
   obligations and are not administrative subdivisions of funds under DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
   Volume 14. For the procurement and RDT&E appropriations, see paragraph 3.6.1.1.
3.3. Expired Year Budget Authorizations. When the authority to incur new obligations
moves into expired year status, the purpose of budget authorizations issued (MILPERS and
O&M are exempt) remain valid, at line item detail, until they reach cancelled year status.
3.4. Using Allocations and Suballocations:
   3.4.1. Use an allocation or suballocation to delegate financial authority to the office
   responsible for making funds available for obligation. Air Force policy requires that fund
   allocations, suballocations, and allotments follow program responsibility; therefore, issue
   these documents to the commanders who administer the programs.
   3.4.2. HQ USAF allocates funds to commands in amounts consistent with the apportionment
   approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or under a continuing resolution
   authority (CRA) passed by the Congress. Allocations represent a maximum limit for further
   suballocation, allotment, or suballotment. Allocations for multiple year appropriations are
   issued in full for each respective fiscal year's appropriation.
   3.4.3. MAJCOMs and FOAs must distribute allocations at once by issuing suballocations or
   allotments to intermediate commands or installations. (EXCEPTION: in the case of
   construction projects funded from the military construction and military family housing
   authorizations, the MAJCOM may retain a contingency reserve and review and approve all
   changes other than mandatory field changes.)
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     29


   3.4.4. Intermediate commands that receive suballocations must issue allotments to
   installations. Each additional allocation or suballocation received under an appropriation will
   be either an increase or decrease to the original amount received.
   3.4.5. Carry forward unobligated balances of quarterly allocations and suballocations to
   succeeding quarters of the fiscal year.
   3.4.6. Specific line items included on combined budget authorization and allocation
   documents issued by SAF/FM for the procurement and RDT&E appropriations are legal
   limitations under Title 31 U.S.C., Sections 1341 and 1517, and DFAS-DE ―Interim Guidance
   on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to
   the Department of the Air Force”. Include a statement to this effect in the remarks section of
   the combined document.
3.5. Using Allotments and Suballotments:
   3.5.1. The Air Force uses an allotment to make funds available for commitment or obligation
   from an allocation or suballocation. A suballotment makes funds available for commitment
   or obligation from an allotment. The allotment or suballotment grants and limits an
   installation's authority to incur commitments or obligations.
   3.5.2. Commands issue allotments or suballotments to installations in amounts consistent
   with the allocation or suballocations received from higher authority and with budget
   authorizations made to the installations.
3.6. Issuing Budget Authorizations and Allocations. SAF/FM issues budget authorizations
and allocations as follows:
   3.6.1. Aircraft Procurement (57*3010), Procurement of Ammunition (57*3011), Missile
   Procurement (57*3020), and Other Procurement (57*3080) appropriations are available for
   new obligation for 3 years. The RDT&E appropriation (57*3600) is available for new
   obligation for 2 years.
      3.6.1.1. For the life of the appropriation, budget authorizations (BA) are issued at the
      legal limit and carry through into the expired years.
          3.6.1.1.1. Specific limitations to budget authorizations issued for these accounts are
          established by line items on AF Form 401, Budget Authority/Allotment, based on
          limitations imposed by the DoD, Congress, SAF/FM, and reprogramming flexibility.
          3.6.1.1.2. The line item amount or ceiling amount, whichever is larger, on AF Form
          401 is an absolute restriction and has the same effect as a separate subdivision of
          funds within the related allocation or allotment (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14
          and DFAS-DE ―Interim Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of
          Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of the Air Force”).
          SAF/FM approval is required to exceed the line item or ceiling amount, whichever is
          larger, on AF Form 401.
          3.6.1.1.3. Requests should indicate if required financing is available from other line
          items and by what date the adjustment is required. Confirm telephone requests in
          writing. Approved adjustments must be shown on the next Program Authority (PA)
          and Budget Authority (BA). When time is a critical factor, approve adjustments by
          message and confirm on the next PA and BA issued. Recipients of funding
30                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


         documents should maintain a suspense control system for timely follow-up and
         receipt of formal written copies of documents when authority is received by telephone
         or other informal means.
  3.6.2. Military Construction Air Force (57*3300), Military Construction Air Force Reserve
  (USAFR) (57*3730), Military Construction Air National Guard (ANG) (57*3830), and
  Family Housing Account (57*/*0740) appropriations are available for new obligation for 5
  years.
     3.6.2.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program level, except budget programs
     320 and 330, and budget programs 351, 711, 712, 713, and 714 which are issued at the
     installation or construction program level.
     3.6.2.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for the current and all program years,
     except for budget program 710 which is issued within the budget project level.
  3.6.3. Operation and Maintenance, ANG (57*3840) and Family Housing Account
  (57*0745). (See AFI 65-601, Volume 2, for Operation and Maintenance, Air Force
  (57*3400), and Operation and Maintenance, Air Force Reserve (57*3740).)
     3.6.3.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program activity level for each fiscal year.
     3.6.3.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for each fiscal year.
  3.6.4. Military Personnel (57*3500), Reserve Personnel (57*3700), and National Guard
  Personnel, Air Force (57*3850):
     3.6.4.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program and project level for each fiscal
     year.
     3.6.4.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for each fiscal year.
  3.6.5. Military Assistance Program, Executive Appropriation (57-11*1080):
     3.6.5.1. Issue budget authorizations:
         3.6.5.1.1. At budget project level for the current program year and program level for
         prior program years under limitations .00l and .003.
         3.6.5.1.2. At program year level for limitations .002 and .004.
     3.6.5.2. Budget authorizations for the current year cover estimated current year
     requirements only (limitations .00l and .003). Budget authorizations for limitations .002
     and .004 cover program year requirements.
     3.6.5.3. Issue allocations for each limitation on a "from inception" basis.
     3.6.5.4. Chapter 17, DFAS-IN/JAX [DFAS Security Cooperation Accounting (SCA)],
     and DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume 15 contain procedures for International Military
     Education and Training (IMET) (57-11*1081) and Military Assistance Program,
     Executive Appropriation (MAP) (57-11*1080) funds.
  3.6.6. Chapter 17, DFAS-IN/JAX [(DFAS Security Cooperation Accounting (SCA)], and
  DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapters 2 and 3 cover Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund
  (97-11X8242) budget authorization use.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       31


   3.6.7. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) (97*4930): OUSD(C) issues annual
   Operating and Capital Budget authority schedules to the Air Force and other DoD
   Components. OUSD(C) issues separate schedules providing official management cost goals
   for each AF Business Area. In turn, SAF/FMB issues operations and capital budget operating
   authority and Unit Cost (UC) goals to each Command/FOA with business areas in the
   DWCF. Activity goals may vary from the Component business area's total goal. However,
   the sum of the activity goals may not exceed the Component total cost authority. See
   Chapter 18.
   3.6.8. Air Force Management Fund (57X3960):
      3.6.8.1. Issue budget authorizations at the management fund project account level for
      each fiscal year.
      3.6.8.2. Issue allocations at the management fund project account level for each fiscal
      year.
   3.6.9. Wildlife Conservation, Military Reservations, Air Force (57X5095):
      3.6.9.1. Issue budget authorizations at appropriation level for each program year.
      3.6.9.2. Issue one allocation at appropriation level covering all program years.
      3.6.9.3. You may use allocations for any program year for which a budget authorization
      is issued.
   3.6.10. The Air Force will issue budget authorizations and allocations on any other
   appropriations or funds that the Air Force administers on the same basis as on comparable
   appropriations or funds identified above.
   3.6.11. Budget authorizations issued by HQ USAF reflect additional subcategorization used
   by HQ USAF to determine the overall authorizations. Such subcategorization is
   informational. It is neither a limitation of use of the budget authorization nor an indication of
   the number and type of subcategory breakouts that may be made by the ultimate user. Unless
   specifically stated to the contrary, this added detail is intended only to provide the recipient
   with a better understanding of the dollar amounts.
   3.6.12. The centrally managed account for foreign currency fluctuations (OAC 34), DFAS
   records the difference between the budgeted foreign currency rates versus those in effect at
   the time of payment for the operation and maintenance, Air Force appropriation. The
   amounts recorded in the account also serve as the basis for obtaining a nonexpenditure
   transfer authorization (SF 1151, Non-expenditure Transfer Authorization) from the Foreign
   Currency Fluctuation, Defense Account.
3.7. Operating Centrally Managed Allotments (CMA):
   3.7.1. The Secretary of the Air Force must approve centrally managed allotments (CMA)
   (see DFAS-DE ―Interim Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of
   Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of the Air Force”). AFMAN
   65-604 identifies the CMA under the respective appropriations and project accounts.
   3.7.2. Usually the Air Force uses these allotments to finance those activities where central
   controls are more practical than establishing controls with specific allotments. Examples of
 32                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   activities that are usually funded with CMAs are pay and allowances of military personnel
   and permanent change of station expenses, subsistence-in-kind, and medical care.
   3.7.3. CMAs provide a way to advise budget, accounting, purchasing, certifying officers,
   disbursing officers, and others that funds are available for the purpose authorized under the
   stated account classifications.
   3.7.4. The amount of the CMA is an administrative subdivision of funds in accordance with
   Title 31 U.S.C., as implemented by DFAS-DE ―Interim Guidance on Procedures for
   Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of
   the Air Force.‖
   3.7.5. Activities that want to establish a CMA must obtain approval by the Secretary of the
   Air Force. Send the request to establish a CMA to SAF/FMPC in accordance with DFAS-DE
   ―Interim Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds
   Made Available to the Department of the Air Force‖ for review and evaluation to determine
   that adequate controls have been established to avoid over obligation.
      3.7.5.1. You must fully justify the need, delineate possible alternatives, and demonstrate
      clearly why the CMA method is the only practical administrative procedure.
      3.7.5.2. The official who establishes the CMA must, to the extent prescribed by law,
      directive, and regulation, make sure that obligations are not incurred in excess of the
      amount available.
   3.7.6. The establishing official is responsible for administering the CMA and must prescribe
   an adequate system of control to include: designation (by name or position) of specific
   individuals authorized to incur obligations or make expenditures against each CMA, and
   establishment of suitable limitations on the numbers, quantities, or volume for which
   obligations may be incurred. The system must provide for accounting and reporting at least
   monthly and ensure that timely notice is given to prevent the CMA from being over obligated
   by taking necessary management action, which may include:
      3.7.6.1. Increasing the amount of the CMA, before incurring an over obligation.
      3.7.6.2. Terminating the CMA.
      3.7.6.3. Taking other necessary management actions to prevent an over obligation.
   3.7.7. The official establishing a CMA must do an annual review to determine whether to
   continue its operation. The Secretary of the Air Force makes this determination. Include an
   internal evaluation of the control procedures established to prevent violation of Title 31
   U.S.C. and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and
   Antideficiency Act Violations, Appendix A and recommend whether to continue the CMA.
3.8. Year-End Adjustments:
   3.8.1. When an appropriation expires for new obligation purposes, the unobligated balance
   of allocations, suballocations, allotments, and suballotments, remains available for valid
   adjustments (DFAS -DE 7000.4-R, Accounting for Obligations). Usually, the appropriate
   echelon of command does not withdraw the unobligated balance of allocations,
   suballocations, allotments, or suballotments until there is no known requirement for the
   balance. In turn, each echelon must advise the next higher headquarters when the balance or
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     33


   a portion of the balance is available for withdrawal. The issuing authority makes subsequent
   adjustments (usually downward) to an allocation, suballocation, allotment, or suballotment
   on the basis of information in the status of funds reports.
   3.8.2. If you need an additional allocation, suballocation, allotment, or suballotment because
   obligations incurred in a previous year were not known until after 30 September,
   immediately request additional funds from the issuing authority. Give a full explanation of
   why you need the increase and comply with DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14. See
   Chapters 2 and 6 on expiring appropriations and canceled accounts.
   3.8.3. After funds have expired for new obligations, it is imperative that comptrollers,
   budget officers, resource advisors, and contracting personnel, in cooperation with DFAS,
   review the status of prior year obligations and promptly deobligate invalid or unneeded
   Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO). A periodic review of these balances is required to
   assure that sufficient unobligated balances are available to cover upward obligation
   adjustments (claims, overruns, target-to-ceiling, etc.) and avoid the risk of incurring
   antideficiency violations.
3.9. Using AF Form 401, Budget Authority/Allotment:
   3.9.1. HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, intermediate commands, and FOAs use AF Form 401, or its
   mechanized equivalent, to issue budget authorizations, allocations, suballocations, allotments
   and suballotments, or make adjustments to these actions. Usually, you use AF Form 401 to
   issue other than O&M-type funds, and an Operating Budget Authority (OBA) document to
   issue O&M type funds (see AFI 65-601, Volume 2). Funding issued on this form is an
   administrative subdivision of funds under DoD FMR 7000.14-R; therefore, do not use it in
   lieu of the AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization. You may use the form for all
   appropriations or funds issued to subordinate activities. The receiving budget office must
   furnish a copy of the AF Form 401 to the servicing accounting office.
   3.9.2. Prepare AF Form 401 as follows:
      3.9.2.1. Heading. Self-explanatory. To number documents begin with number "1" at the
      start of the program year and continue in numerical sequence for each recipient
      organization for each appropriation.
      3.9.2.2. Program/Project Column. If control is maintained at other than appropriation
      level, enter control codes such as the budget program (BP), budget program activity code
      (BPAC), project/subproject, Budget Authorization Account Number, (BAAN), and/or
      program element code (PEC) in this column.
      3.9.2.3. Annual Budget Authority (ABA) Columns. Enter in the respective columns
      the total of previous funds issued, amount of increase or decrease, and revised funding
      available for the appropriation (or applicable BP, BPAC, PEC, project/subproject or
      BAAN) shown in the program/project column.
      3.9.2.4. Cumulative Quarterly Authority Column. These columns reflect the
      cumulative amount of funds issued starting with the first quarter of the program year. The
      AF Form 401 issued during the:
          3.9.2.4.1. First quarter will show cumulative amount authorized for the first quarter.
 34                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


           3.9.2.4.2. Second quarter will show the cumulative amount from the beginning of the
           year for the second quarter.
           3.9.2.4.3. Third quarter will show the cumulative amounts from the beginning of the
           year for the third quarter.
           3.9.2.4.4. Fourth quarter will reflect annual program in the fourth quarter column.
       3.9.2.5. Remarks/Limitations Block:
           3.9.2.5.1. The issuer should identify the document as an allocation, suballocation, or
           allotment. For example, "This is a suballocation."
           3.9.2.5.2. Parent organizations issuing funds for tenants to host organizations must
           include information required by the host to administer the approved execution plan of
           the tenant.
           3.9.2.5.3. Limitations on issued funding will be in accordance with paragraph 3.1
           above.
           3.9.2.5.4. Other remarks should include any general information that would provide
           the recipient with a better understanding of entries shown on the upper parts of the
           AF Form 401.
       3.9.2.6. During the year of execution, quarterly obligation authority issued by
       SAF/FMBOI on funding documents to commands is based on gross obligations, not gross
       commitments in the accounting system. However, quarterly and annual obligation
       authority available to a command must be sufficient to cover that command’s gross
       commitments.
3.10. Locally Prescribed Forms and Formats. Air Force activities that have implemented
mechanized procedures for issuing budget authorizations, allocations, suballocations, and
allotments may substitute computer-generated forms, properly identified as AF Form 401, Apr
84 (electronic form), for the AF Form 401. The use of an electronically reproduced equivalent of
an original signature is acceptable for a document requiring an original signature.
   3.10.1. Accomplish internal control of fund documentation through use of computer
   software.
   3.10.2. Command fund control systems will provide validation of fund authorities by use of
   access codes and lockout procedures.
   3.10.3. Budget analysts will use one set of assigned access codes to prepare fund
   authorizations. Individuals with the signature authority will use other controlled access codes
   to cause their signature element and an authorization symbol to appear in the signature
   section of the fund document and permit the transmission of the authority to the funded
   activity.
   3.10.4. Transmit the authentication, signature element, and symbol to the field as part of the
   funding document.
   3.10.5. The issuing activity will retain signed originals of the computer-generated fund
   documents.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   35


3.11. Emergency Funding Actions. When urgent funding adjustments are required, you may
need to use interim methods (messages, telecoms, etc.). Continue to maintain funds control
discipline in these situations. This discipline must ensure that activities do not inadvertently
violate DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14.
   3.11.1. Funding by Messages, Data faxes, Etc. When using this technique, include in your
   correspondence, as a minimum: the FY and appropriation being adjusted, the effective date
   of the adjustment, funds information (previous total, adjustment, and the revised total), and
   the name and phone number of the issuing action officer. In addition, advise the receiving
   activity to promptly acknowledge receipt of the adjustment.
   3.11.2. Funding by Telecom. Both the issuing and receiving activities will immediately
   document the transaction with a memo for record. The memo will minimally include: the FY
   and appropriation being adjusted, funds information (previous total, adjustment, and the
   revised total), and the name and phone number of both the issuer and receiver.
   3.11.3. Follow-up Requirements. In all emergency transactions, the issuing activity will
   issue a formal funding document, reflecting the adjustments, within 1 month or at the next
   document issue cycle, whichever occurs first. Both the issuing and receiving activities will
   establish follow-up suspenses to ensure compliance with the formal funding document
   timeframe requirements.

                                          Chapter 4

    BUDGETING AND FUNDING GUIDANCE FOR VARIOUS APPROPRIATIONS

Section 4A—-Obligating Funds During the Last Two Months of the Fiscal Year.

4.1. Applying the 20-Percent Limit on Obligations. Except as noted below, obligate no more
than 20 percent of your annual (1 year) appropriations during August and September of any
fiscal year. Every department or agency must apply this limit at the appropriation level rather
than against each budget program or project, with one exception: for the Reserve Personnel
appropriation, apply the 20-percent limit to the total of the annual budget authorizations for
projects that must meet this limit.
   4.1.1. If HQ USAF directly issues funds to your command, limit Operation and
   Maintenance Appropriations (3400, 3740 and 3840).
   4.1.2. If you are in the Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve (AFR) do not limit
   your Military Personnel appropriation (3700 and 3850).
   4.1.3. Applying Exceptions to the 20-percent Limit.            Do not limit      obligations
   during August and September of the fiscal year if Figure 4.1 below applies.

Section 4B—Information Technology Equipment (ITE) and Resources

4.3. Budgeting and Funding for General Purpose ITE. Whether you are in an Active or
Reserve component, follow this section to select the correct appropriation for funding to develop,
buy, lease, and maintain Information Technology (IT) Resources. Acquisition of ITE may
involve procurement actions ranging from base-wide, organization, or functional community
local area network (LAN) systems down to ancillary equipment (e.g., personal computers,
printers, etc.) and software that operates totally independent of a LAN. When commands cannot
agree to funding responsibilities, refer the matter to SAF/FMBM.
   4.3.1. Network Acquisition. Network infrastructure consists of the equipment necessary for
   the effective transfer of electronic information between terminal devices. Common examples
   of networks include the base telephone systems; Non-secure Internet Protocol Routed
   Network (NIPRNET); Land Mobile Radios; Giant Voice; and Second Generation Wireless
   Local Area Network (2GLAN). A network can be broken down into discrete network
   segments.
       4.3.1.1. Include the total cost of the entire discrete network segment within the scope of
       effort, when applying the $250,000 expense and investment criteria to a procurement
       action. Include any additional network installation costs (e.g., quality assurance, system
       engineering, equipment installation, testing, etc.) in the aggregate cost of all equipment
       items being acquired to make the network segment operate. [NOTE: Use O&M funds to
       finance installation if anyone other than the prime contractor (or direct subcontractor)
       installs the system or modifies it as a result of state-of-the-art changes.]
       4.3.1.2. Network segment system modifications or upgrades of equipment essential to
       network operations obligated within any 12-month period should be considered part of
       the same requirement and the total cost will be subject to the expense and investment
       criteria. Cost each upgrade or modification separately from the original purchase. The
       same applies to parts purchased to replace components, which are functioning but "are no
       longer logistically supportable." Ensure that network segment system modifications or
       upgrades are not an attempt to fragment the requirement to circumvent the expense and
       investment threshold.
       4.3.1.3. Network Terminal Equipment Acquisition. Terminal equipment consists of
       end-user communications equipment such as computers, telephones, land mobile radios,
       and portable computers. Terminal equipment procured with the initial procurement of
       the network infrastructure may be budgeted with investment funding, as the collection of
       equipment is needed for the capability. The periodic technical refresh and replacement of
       terminal equipment should be budgeted in accordance with the expense and investment
       threshold on a "cost per component" basis. Repair parts or components should be
       functionally equivalent to the unit being replaced and purchased to replace a failed
       component. Use O&M funds for these types of requirements if each component
       purchased is less than $250,000 (current threshold). The overriding rule is that stand-
       alone operational integrity of ancillary Information Technology Equipment (ITE) must be
       maintained in deciding to procure, upgrade, or modify ITE using O&M funding.
       4.3.1.4. PC Application Software Loaded on Network File Server. MAJCOMs and
       installations must implement management controls to ensure that sufficient applications
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  39


      software is procured to permit implementation of stand-alone operation of each PC,
      should the network fail for an extended period of time. The major task is to ensure that
      only the authorized number of copies of application software are procured, installed and
      used throughout the network, whether in a networked mode (launched from the file
      server) or from the individual PC hard drives. Where the application software is to be
      loaded or stored, does not determine the type of expense and investment funding to be
      used for a PC, only whether the PC can operate independently or is integral to a LAN's
      system operation. Purchase sufficient application software at the same time network PCs
      are procured using O&M funds to ensure stand-alone PC operational integrity is
      maintained. EXCEPTION: Those requirements where the procurement of a PC is
      intended to upgrade older, less capable computer equipment and the application software
      can be reused on a one-for-one basis on the upgraded PC.
4.4. O&M Funded Facilities and Activities. Finance the acquisition and operation of IT
resources supporting O&M funded facilities and activities as follows:
   4.4.1. Leasing or Maintaining ITE. Use O&M funds.
   4.4.2. Acquiring ITE. Apply the $250,000 expense and investment threshold criteria to the
   total cost of the ITE system to determine which appropriation to use. (NOTE: An ITE system
   is a group of components that are interconnected, designed mainly to operate together, and
   procured at the same time. The complete system cost is the aggregate cost of all components
   that are part of, and function together, as a system to meet a documented requirement.)
      4.4.2.1. Use O&M if the total system cost is under $250,000.
      4.4.2.2. Use Other Procurement if the total system exceeds $250,000 or more.
      4.4.2.3. Use Other Procurement funds for centrally managed equipment items. (The
      $250,000 threshold does not apply; see Figure 4.3)
      4.4.2.4. Exclude contract costs associated with the preparation of real property (e.g.,
      building modification, cable trenching, etc.; see Table 4.1).
      4.4.2.5. Do not fragment the validated requirement for IT, or upgrade to a
      communications or automatic data processing system or acquire IT in a piecemeal
      fashion in order to circumvent the expense and or investment criteria guidance.
      4.4.2.6. Apply the determination of expense or investment cost on the basis of each
      system in the requirements document (e.g., Cyberspace Infrastructure Requirements,
      Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System, etc.), if the document includes more than one
      system. Purchasing several items at the same time does not necessarily mean the items
      are part of one system. For example, if you are buying four small computers for
      administrative offices in an organization, which may be interconnected (e.g., for sending
      electronic mail), consider these as four separate systems if their primary purpose is to
      operate independently. Regarding LANs, a basic rule to follow is that separate
      requirements documents should be prepared for items integral to an independent LAN's
      operation and items not integral to a LAN's operation.
      4.4.2.7. Using Productivity Programs. If you are purchasing ITE under provisions of
      Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI) Programs, group the ITE to comprise
      an integrated system (or systems) capable of amortizing all investment costs within the
40                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


     criteria established in AFI 38-301, Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment Program.
     Under PECI analyst direction, approved projects are funded with specific Fast Payback
     Capital (FASCAP) or Productivity Investment Fund (PIF) funds.               Apply the
     expense/investment rule criteria to determine correct funding.
  4.4.3. Acquiring Software:
     4.4.3.1. Use O&M funds for:
         4.4.3.1.1. Software maintenance and minor modification, and for other IT contractual
         services. Additionally, software releases categorized as iterations on the basic release
         and not involving significant performance improvements or extensive testing are
         considered a maintenance effort and are purchased with O&M type funds. Minor
         improvements in software functionality which are accomplished during routine
         maintenance are also funded using O&M type funds, as are modernization costs
         under $250,000 and one-time projects (e.g., developing planning documents and
         studies). See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1.
         4.4.3.1.2. Software that is not obtained from a development or services contract and
         for which the Air Force obtains unlimited data rights (i.e., the Air Force will actually
         own the software and be free to use, duplicate, distribute, and dispose of the software
         without restriction from its publisher or developer).
     4.4.3.2. Use O&M or investment funds based on the expense/investment threshold (and
     include in the total system cost, if applicable) for application software with limited data
     rights or licensed to the Air Force (proprietary software). If proprietary software is
     financed on an annual fee basis, it is an expense item properly financed in RDT&E or
     O&M.
     4.4.3.3. Use RDT&E funds for major upgrades increasing performance envelope,
     development activities bringing a program to its objective system, COTS requiring
     engineer design, integration, and T&E to meet objective performance. Use RDT&E to
     obtain software via a software development contract (i.e., where the acquiring activity
     pays a contractor for the software development services).       Use RDT&E for the
     acquisition, and operation and maintenance of IT systems used exclusively to support
     RDT&E activities.
  4.4.4. Communications Cable Funding:
     4.4.4.1. For maintenance and repair of existing cable (e.g., metallic, fiber optic, premise
     wiring, etc.) regardless of whether or not the cable is located inside a building or between
     buildings, Commands will always use O&M funds for these requirements.
     4.4.4.2. For an entire information transport system (e.g., cable plant) purchase and
     installation the expense and investment criteria will be applied. Other Procurement funds
     will be used for information transport systems (ITS) that exceed $250,000. O&M funds
     may be used if the system cost is $250,000 or less.
     4.4.4.3. Construction in Conjunction With Cabling Projects. Commands will follow
     rules of minor construction projects. If the specific requirement is less than $750,000,
     then Commands will use O&M funds. If an expansion is above $750,000, Commands
     will document the requirement in the Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System where it
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    41


       can be centrally funded (e.g., Combat Information Transport System or Base
       Communications Infrastructure) using Other Procurement funds. Refer to Table 4.1 for
       additional guidance regarding ITE site preparation and types of funding.
   4.4.5. Land Mobile Radio Systems. For the purchase of new trunked systems exceeding
   $250K, use Other Procurement funds to acquire the trunked infrastructure (antennas, base
   stations, repeaters) and enough radios to achieve initial operational capability for one
   functional set. O&M funds should be used to purchase the remainder of the individual
   radios, each of which is less than the expense/investment threshold. For future infrastructure
   upgrades, use O&M or investment funds based on the expense/investment threshold.
4.5. RDT&E Funded Facilities and Activities. Use RDT&E for all of the costs identified in
4.4, above, for funding by the O&M and Other Procurement appropriations.
4.6. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) Facilities and Activities. Use DWCF to
finance all costs associated with the acquisition and operation of IT resources supporting DWCF
funded facilities and activities.
   4.6.1. Use operational DWCF to acquire IT if the total system cost is under $250,000. See
   18.7.9.2. for exceptions.
   4.6.2. Use capital DWCF if the total IT system cost exceeds $250,000. See DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, paragraph 090103.C.15 for guidance regarding associated
   software costs.
4.7. Site Preparation. Table 4.1 Contains guidance for determining the type of funds to use
for ITE site preparation. Additional guidance is in paragraph 8.18
   4.7.1. Table 4 1. Covers two situations: Alteration of an existing facility to accommodate
   new ITE or to better accommodate ITE currently housed in the facility (columns 2 and 3);
   and addition to an existing facility or construction of a new facility to accommodate ITE
   (columns 4 and 5).
   4.7.2. Types of funds are denoted by CON for construction, EQP for investment equipment,
   and EXP for expense.

4.8. Embedded Computers. Apply the following rules to determine how to fund embedded
Information Technology Equipment (ITE) and software developed or acquired under the systems
management procedures (acquisition series of instructions).
   4.8.1. Use RDT&E to:
       4.8.1.1. Fund all initial ITE and software development efforts up to the point where an
       operational configuration baseline has been tested, evaluated, and accepted or qualified.
       4.8.1.2. Finance the design, development, test and evaluation of embedded ITE and
       software. This includes all costs related to feasibility studies, system design, preparation,
       integration (including interface with other systems or subsystems), and associated
       documentation.
       4.8.1.3. Design and develop training devices, such as simulators, that employ new or off-
       the-shelf computers and system components, but have software and interface components
       unique to the training system. Use RDT&E for the initial system and all of its support
       cost through acceptance by the Air Force. Typically, these training devices have small
       quantity requirements and the initial system is eventually used for operational training.
   4.8.2. Do not use RDT&E funds beyond the initial system unless the training organization
   needs more than one full system to demonstrate the training device performance before
   accepting it.
   4.8.3. To buy fully developed and tested ITE and software, use the same appropriation that
   funds the acquisition of the weapon or support system of which it is a part. Fund fully
   developed and tested ITE and software associated with an equipment modification with the
   same appropriation that funds the production mod kits (see also paragraph Chapter 8,
   Section 8G for guidance on modification funding).
   4.8.4. Use O&M-type funds to finance the maintenance of embedded ITE and software,
   except for investment items necessary for maintenance. Use procurement appropriations to
   finance investment items that are funded by the procurement appropriations. Paragraph 4.8
   applies for embedded ITE and software used in research and development programs or
   owned by RDT&E funded activities.
   4.8.5. Fund changes to existing operational software as follows:
       4.8.5.1. Use O&M-type appropriations or funds for changes designed to correct latent
       errors or deficiencies in software programs that otherwise meet criteria for operational
       suitability and usefulness.
 44                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       4.8.5.2. Use O&M-type appropriations or funds for changes designed to improve
       reliability, maintainability, safety, or that otherwise qualify as normal life-cycle support.
       4.8.5.3. Use RDT&E funds for changes designed to increase the capability of the system
       to perform its mission, to add new capability, or to remove an existing capability.
       However, use the O&M-type appropriation that funds the maintenance for software
       changes (or blocks of such changes) that are relatively minor in scope and cost, and that
       can be accomplished during regular software maintenance.
   4.8.6. See Chapter 8, Section 8G for instruction on funding software changes related to
   equipment modification engineering tasks. Use O&M, RDT&E or DWCF funds for other
   software changes associated with end item modification programs as discussed elsewhere in
   paragraphs 4.8 and 8.26
4.9. Funding Other Equipment with Computers. This category includes equipment items
such as materiel handling equipment that contain or depend upon computer devices but are not
C4 systems.
   4.9.1. Use procurement accounts to finance the initial acquisition cost.
   4.9.2. Finance software changes as an expense.
   4.9.3. Finance such charges from the DWCF for DWCF-funded facilities and activities
4.10. Information Technology (IT) – Summary Considerations. IT is a complex subject with
many exceptions and criteria. Another helpful way to look at this topic is to bear in mind major

Section 4C—Honoraria

4.11. Approving Honoraria and Speaking Fees. Follow guidance in the DoD FMR 7000.14-
R, Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section 1208. Use O&M funds to pay honoraria or fees according to
established approval levels:

Table 4.3. Honoraria Approval Thresholds.

 Installation Commanders                             $1,000 or less

 MAJCOM, FOA, DRU Commanders                         $2,000 or less

 HQ USAF/CVA                                         More than $2,000

      4.11.1.1. To determine the appropriate approval level for honorariums or speaking fees,
      only the actual amount of the honorarium or speaking fee, excluding per diem and travel
      expenses, will constitute the cost against which the threshold is to be applied. If a person
      is going to sign a speaking contract for $2,000 and that contract is for 4 speeches on an
  46                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


        installation at $500 each, the $2,000 contract would determine the approval level required
        (MAJCOM, FOA, DRU Commander), not the $500 cost of each address.

Section 4D—Emergency and Special Program (ESP) Codes

Table 4.4. Assigning ESP Codes.
Air Force activities at all levels assign ESP codes. These special accounting and reporting codes
 collect costs incurred during an emergency or in support of a special program.
 Assigning                                            Code Description
 Organization                 Scope                   First Position          Second Position
 SAF/FMB                      Air Force-Wide          Any alphanumeric        "A" through "G"
 MAJCOM-FOA/FMs               MAJCOM-Wide             Any alphanumeric        "H" through "W"

 Installation/FMs             Local                   Any alphanumeric        "X", "Y" or "Z"

4.12. Reserved For Future Use.
4.13. Using ESP Codes:
    4.13.1. The assigning FM organization along with the activity requiring the data will assign
    a title to each ESP code, and will determine whether incremental or total costs need to be
    collected.
    4.13.2. Comptrollers and budget officers at all levels must make sure that operating
    personnel are made aware of the importance of properly identifying and capturing all costs
    associated with emergency and special programs. Only accurate cost data can provide the
    documentation to obtain funding or reimbursement when appropriate and meet reporting
    requirements.
    4.13.3. Installations or commands must send requests for establishing Air Force-wide ESP
    codes through MAJCOM/FM channels to SAF/FMBMM for assignment of an Air Staff
    sponsor. Describe the program or situation that requires cost identification and indicate
    whether full or incremental costs should be collected. SAF/FMB will assign the code and
    issue implementing instructions. In addition, once a year (usually in September) SAF/FMB
    issues a list of all Air Force level ESP codes for the next fiscal year.
    4.13.4. ESP codes apply to most appropriations. Use these codes on all applicable
    commitment, obligation, and expenditure documents, generally placing them in the
    accounting classification immediately following the accounting and disbursing station
    number (ADSN) (for example: ESP Code AA). Periodically, SAF/FMB or MAJCOMs
    require the use of specific ESP codes.                  Reference AF ESP codes at
    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
    af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13532B0FB5E044080020E329A9
    when constructing a line of accounting. Also reference MAJCOM ESP lists.

Section 4E—Technical Data
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    47


4.14. Financing the Procurement and Printing of Technical Data. The source of funds to
procure and print tech data depends upon the appropriation or fund that procures the end item of
equipment or system to which the data is applicable. Apply funds as follows:
   4.14.1. Acquisition Phase. Pay for the initial technical data with the same appropriation
   (and budget program) or DWCF business activity that pays for the end item of equipment or
   system being supported. Include the cost of both the reproducible copy and the cost of
   printing multiple copies, whether you obtain the printing by a separate contract from a
   government printing plant or as a provision of the production contract. Use these same rules
   for spare and repair parts.
   4.14.2. Modifications. Pay for all technical data required as a result of a modification to an
   end item of equipment or system with the same appropriation (and budget program) or
   DWCF activity that pays for the modification. Use the rules for printing in the preceding
   paragraph. See also Chapter 8.
   4.14.3. Post Acquisition and Modification Phase. Use O&M in these situations, but only
   when the technical data support equipment or systems are financed with procurement
   appropriations (3010, 3011, 3020, and 3080). (See paragraph 4.14.5 for printing and
   reproduction costs.)
       4.14.3.1. When production contracts and modification contracts funded with investment
       appropriations no longer exist to satisfy requirements for reproducible copy not initially
       procured with the equipment or system.
       4.14.3.2. For new requirements for developing and preparing equipment program master
       tapes for out of production (in-service) equipment.
       4.14.3.3. To finance the revision or replacement of previously procured technical data
       that has become unusable due to excessive use, abuse, or loss and to fund the changes
       needed to bring the guidance into current status.
   4.14.4. Use DWCF funds for the technical data and associated requirements when the
   equipment is procured by the DWCF or when modifications to that equipment require
   technical data after production or modifications.
   4.14.5. Funding Printing and Reproduction Requirements. Use O&M funds - EEIC
   50100 for printing procurement by the Government Printing Office (GPO) and by
   commercial printers and EEIC 75671 for printing services by the Document Automation and
   Production Service (DAPS) and 75672 for printing services with GPC by the Document
   Automation and Production Service (DAPS) - (NOTE: The DWCF finances all of the
   foregoing requirements for equipment funded by the Defense Working Capital Fund.)
       4.14.5.1. To finance the contractual printing (reproduction) of multiple copies of
       technical data (or literature from technical data) applicable to out-of-production
       equipment and systems. This rule does not apply to printing requirements relating to
       initial equipment or system data procurement, modification and initial tech data funded
       with investment appropriations.
       4.14.5.2. To pay for contractual reproduction (duplication) of automatic equipment
       program master tapes prepared from Air Force-owned reproducible master tapes.
 48                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       4.14.5.3. See DoD Instruction 5330.03 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document
       Services, for policy on use of DAPS.
4.15. Funding Engineering Drawing Requirements:
   4.15.1. When obtained in connection with procurement of equipment or a system, use the
   same appropriation (and budget program) or DWCF business area as used to finance
   procurement of the equipment or system for which the drawings are required. These same
   funds also finance the printing or reproduction of multiple copies.
   4.15.2. When procured in conjunction with a modification, use the same appropriation (and
   budget program) or DWCF activity that financed the modification. This applies both to the
   cost of the drawings and the printing of needed multiple copies.
   4.15.3. To finance the following requirements, use either O&M funds if the equipment or
   system was procured or modified using investment funds or DWCF funds if the equipment
   was procured or modified with DWCF funds:
       4.15.3.1. Replacement of previously procured drawings that have now become unusable
       due to excessive use (illegible, worn or torn).
       4.15.3.2. Drawings needed for purposes other than equipment or system procurement,
       and required because they were not originally procured on the production or modification
       contract, which is now closed.
       4.15.3.3. The cost of contractual engineering or drafting talent when needed to update,
       consolidate or redraw existing engineered drawings.
       4.15.3.4. Contractual accomplishment of master layout (MLO) drawings, templates, tube
       bend data and like items.
   4.15.4. Use O&M funds (EEIC 50100) to finance the contractual cost of printing or
   reproducing necessary multiple copies of drawings for equipment or systems procured with
   investment appropriations. Use DWCF for the same requirement for equipment procured by
   DWCF.
4.16. Commercial Manuals. Initial procurement of these manuals is part of the equipment or
system procurement cost. Apply the following for additional copies:
   4.16.1. Charge to O&M (EEIC 50100) if the Air Force has reproduction rights and the
   equipment or system was procured with investment appropriations and the manual is
   incorporated into the system.
   4.16.2. Charge the printing cost to DWCF if the manuals are applicable to equipment
   procured by DWCF.
   4.16.3. Charge the cost to O&M if a commercial manual has a TO number, but only for
   those manuals applicable to equipment or systems procured with investment appropriations.
   4.16.4. Charge the printing to DWCF if the manuals are applicable to equipment or systems
   procured by DWCF.
4.17. Technical Data for Replenishment Spares Procurement. Charge both the cost of the
reproducible copy and the cost of reproducing multiple copies to the same funds used to procure
the spare parts if procuring replenishment spares involves acceptance of:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       49


   4.17.1. A substitute item,
   4.17.2. A different manufacturer of the item, or
   4.17.3. A new item specification, and
   4.17.4. New specifications, new technical data, or revisions to existing data are required.
4.18. Technical Data for Common Support Equipment. Finance changes to weapon systems
technical data resulting from the replacement of common support equipment from the
appropriation buying the equipment.

Section 4F—Space Launch Support Services

4.19. Financing Launch Services. Fund launch support services as follows:
   4.19.1. If the launch is of a research and development (3600 funded) payload, use the
   RDT&E (3600) appropriation.
   4.19.2. If the launch is of an operational (3020 funded) payload, use the Missile Procurement
   (3020) appropriation budgeted in the year of the launch.
   4.19.3. Charge launch support services provided by Major Range and Test Facility Bases
   (MRTFB) to the funding appropriation as indicated above on a direct cost basis per AFI 99-
   103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. Use O&M funds to pay for standard range
   support costs.
   4.19.4. Contractor launch support services budgeted in Procurement appropriations are
   incrementally funded if they are not related to the delivery of an end item (OUSD(C) (P/B)
   May 16, 1997 Policy).
4.20. Propellants Funding. Use O&M (3400) funds to pay for liquid and gaseous propellants.
Pay for solid propellants with 3020 funds.

Section 4G—Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot Logistic Support Provided By
Contractors

4.21. Funding Contractor Support Programs:
   4.21.1. Interim Contractor Support (ICS). Budget and fund ICS in the weapon
   system/equipment procurement line item or the weapon system/equipment modification
   procurement line, as applicable. When non-Air Force agencies require work on an Air Force
   ICS contract, the using activity will reimburse the appropriate procurement account through
   the responsible system program office. Budget for the ICS on the end item line or
   modification procurement line even if there is no end item or modification kit being
   procured. ICS specifically refers only to the use of a contractor in the following cases:
       4.21.1.1. The items to be supported or items of support equipment that have an unstable
       design, and the projected cost of setting up an organic capability at the time operational
       support is first required is excessive, due to uncertainties in the type and level of support
       required because of the risk that support resources will become obsolete if procured too
       early.
50                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


     4.21.1.2. All or part of the resources required to establish an organic capability that will
     not be available until after operational support is first required. In this case, the system
     development, production, and deployment phases do not allow enough time to develop
     the support resources before organic support is needed (e.g., automatic test equipment
     development that generally lags behind the development of the system which it supports).
         4.21.1.2.1. Under no circumstances is ICS to be interpreted as a means of
         compensating for a budget cut or any other unforeseen situation that may require the
         use of contract support. ICS must be planned budget lead-time away and have been
         subjected to rigorous cost and risk analysis.
         4.21.1.2.2. ICS is not used to replace the requirement for testing and for fully
         demonstrating the adequacy of a new design for an acquisition or modification
         program before making a major deployment commitment. Instead, it is a method of
         controlling capital investment in logistics support while refining the requirements,
         resolving the technical problems, achieving design stability, and compensating for
         lead-time for complex support resource development.
         4.21.1.2.3. ICS is predominately a depot level program because sound program
         management normally demands organic capability for the performance of all
         organizational and intermediate (O&I) level tasks when operational systems are
         initially delivered. Inclusion of O&I tasks under ICS should be accomplished only on
         an exception basis.
  4.21.2. Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). Funding responsibilities are as follows:
     4.21.2.1. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Centralized Asset Management (CAM)
     program office will budget for Air Force active duty CLS programs. Use EEIC 578 to
     identify costs. Guard and Reserve will budget for their own CLS requirements.
     4.21.2.2. For systems that are not weapon system specific (for example, Base and
     Installation Security System), the operating command that has the closest relationship
     and/or receives the most benefit has budgeting responsibility. If there is no clear
     relationship to any one operating command or no one command receives more benefit
     than the others, AFMC will retain budgeting and programming responsibility.
     4.21.2.3. When a system transitions from organic logistics support to CLS, the operating
     command will program enough resources to fund those system spares which are in the
     Supply Management business activities inventory and are to be transferred to the CLS
     contractor.
     4.21.2.4. The System Program Managers (SPM)/Product Group Managers (PGM) are
     responsible for budget execution and costing CLS requirements. The SPMs shall submit
     annual CLS labor obligations, material obligations, and labor hours reported in Cost
     Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG) format for each MDS no later than January 15th
     for the previous fiscal year ending on September 30th. CLS reporting formats are located
     on the AFTOC web page. The formats can be accessed via the Air Force Portal,
     Applications A-Z listing, and AFTOC – Air Force Total Ownership Cost Decision
     Support System link. These costs shall be further defined by a percentage break out
     between contractor and government for labor and materials. Submissions should be
     made in electronic format, sent by e-mail to SAFFMC.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  51


   4.21.3. Appropriations Chargeable. Determine the type of funds that will be used based
   on the type of contract, or services and items provided under the contract. There may be
   more than one appropriation, budget program activity code (BPAC), or element of
   expense/investment code (EEIC) that will be involved with one program. The following are
   examples:
       4.21.3.1. If the contract is written to provide strictly a maintenance service (time and
       effort), charge the cost to an operating account, for example, O&M Air Force (except for
       DT&E or IOT&E). Contracts could require the contractor to provide all spares, repair
       parts, labor, and test equipment.
       4.21.3.2. If the contract calls for the government to purchase and furnish the spares,
       repair parts, or equipment, including test equipment, then you may need to use more than
       one appropriation, BPAC, and EEIC.
       4.21.3.3. Use the appropriate procurement/RDT&E appropriation to pay the cost if
       capital investment items (peculiar support or test equipment) centrally managed items,
       and/or data are furnished to the contractor.
       4.21.3.4. Use O&M (EEIC 579 in the case of ICS) for the maintenance service part of
       the contract.
       4.21.3.5. Charge an operating account (EEIC 605 or 609 from the DWCF, EEIC 619 if
       from other) if the government furnishes the supply parts (expense type items) used in
       maintenance.
4.22. Determining the Funds Chargeable. Specific funding guidance cannot cover all
contracts or situations; therefore, the system manager, with assistance from and advice of the
MAJCOM FM organization, must take the following actions for each proposed contractual
action:
   4.22.1. Review each contract with maintenance and procurement personnel to determine the
   type of service or product that is being procured.
   4.22.2. Determine the proper appropriation and BPAC to use per AFMAN 65-604.
   4.22.3. Refer questions that cannot be resolved to your HQ MAJCOM FM policy office,
   with subsequent submission to SAF/FMBM as needed. Provide your analysis and
   recommendations when submitting funding (propriety or responsibility) questions.
Section 4H—Prompt Payment Act (P.L. 97-177, 5CFR Part 1315, 31 U.S.C. Section 3901-
3906)
4.23. Financing Prompt Payment Charges:
   4.23.1. Federal departments and agencies must absorb interest penalties within existing
   appropriations. For DFAS paying offices supporting Air Force sites, the interest will be
   financed by the operating funds of the base being supported without regard to who caused the
   late payment.
   4.23.2. Use only four appropriations to finance expenses for prompt payment--Air Force
   O&M (57*3400), Air Force Management and Support RDT&E (57*3600), Air Force
   Reserves O&M (57*3740), and Air National Guard (ANG)O&M (57*3840).
 52                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   4.23.3. Host installations may charge the penalty to tenant O&M funds or DWCF only when
   evidence clearly exists that the tenant or DWCF was directly responsible for the incurrence
   of the interest penalty. If the host and tenant cannot agree on the tenant‘s liability for the
   penalty charge, the host installation commander, with advice from his or her comptroller, will
   make the final determination based on the facts of the individual case.
   4.23.4. When non-Air Force paying offices (Army, Navy, Marines, DoD, etc.), not
   supporting Air Force sites, administer or pay Air Force contracts and incur prompt payment
   penalties, charge the interest payments to those activities without subsequent recoupment
   from the Air Force. For DFAS paying offices, not supporting Air Force sites that administer
   or pay contracts citing Air Force funds, charge the incurred interest payments to the
   operating funds of the base being supported without regard to who caused the late payment.
   EXCEPTION: Interest paid on Air Force contracts by DFAS-CO are charged to a Military
   Interdepartmental Purchase Order (MIPR) provided to DFAS-CO by the 11th Wing on behalf
   of SAF/FM.
   4.23.5. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS), 4F interest penalty payments the following fund
   citation is authorized: 97-11X8242.0002 4F 8467 NPPI39 00*S380100. (The * in the fund
   citation indicates the position to place the reason code.) This field corresponds to the FMS
   line position normally cited. DSCA (27 Jan 98 Memorandum, ―Line of Accounting for the
   Prompt Payment Act Interest‖) has directed that all disbursing activities request expenditure
   authority (EA) before making PPI disbursements. EA will be requested IAW guidance
   previously issued for all FMS disbursements. Questions regarding the 4F fund citation and
   EA should be directed to DFAS-JAXBA/IN (ref DFAS-AY/DE msg 121352Z Oct 01). For
   FMS Administrative Surcharge (4A) interest penalty payments cite the applicable CY Admin
   line of accounting using EEIC 682**. Reference the FM Data Quality Service (DQS) to
   determine the correct fourth and fifth position codes. Questions regarding the 4A fund
   citation should be directed to DFAS-JAXBG/IN.
   4.23.6. Nonappropriated funds (NAF) paying offices or activities will charge interest penalty
   costs to NAFs.
   4.23.7. See DFAS-DE 7010.5-R; Direct, Refund, Reimbursement and Receivable
   Transactions at Base Level for specific accounting instructions.
4.24. Assigning Data Elements:
   4.24.1. . Use fourth- and fifth-position AFEEIC code shreds for AFEE 759XX as follows
   (see the FM Data Quality Service for definitions):
   4.24.2. Use the fourth-position numeric shred of AF EE 759 to reflect the reason a prompt
   payment interest penalty was incurred.
      4.24.2.1. Use the fifth-position alpha-code shred of AFEE 759 to reflect the original
      appropriation cited on the voucher that incurred an interest penalty payment. Where more
      than one appropriation is cited on the contract, use the predominance rule to determine
      the fifth-position shred. The appropriation with the most dollars dictates the alpha shred
      selected. (An exception to the guidance is for FMS-related fund cites. Because these are
      reimbursable-type transactions, use a prorated breakdown between the appropriations

Section 4I—Telephone System Costs

4.25. Funding Advance Deposits for Installation Costs of Telephone Cable Required for
New Family Housing. Installations responsible for installing telephone cabling for new family
housing will comply with the following guidance:
   4.25.1. Charge the costs of trenching, backfilling, and paving associated with cable
   installation both within a new residential subdivision and within the 100 foot allowance to
   the appropriate construction appropriation.
   4.25.2. Charge the payment of deposits against the cost of installing underground telephone
   equipment specifically required servicing a new subdivision to the appropriation financing
   the host-base operation.
   4.25.3. Credit the appropriation financing the host-base operation for refunds of the deposits
   against the cost of installing underground telephone equipment specifically required
   servicing a new subdivision. (Refunds of the deposits are provided in the form of setoffs or
   credits against bills to the Air Force for services.)
4.26. Funding Other Telephone Activities:
   4.26.1. Paying for Telephone Reconnection Charges. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) and
   Chief of Services (CE) may approve appropriated fund payment for telephone reconnection
   fees which result from base actions for the convenience of the Air Force (only for local, non-
   PCS moves) . These entitlements are usually due to either a mandatory assignment to
   government housing facilities or the termination of assignment to quarters due to death of
   qualifying dependents.
   4.26.2. Providing Telephones for Government Transient Facilities. Air Force installations
   may spend appropriated funds for telephone service and equipment in transient quarters when
   sufficient official need exists for a telephone (AFI 33-111, Voice Systems Management). Host
   MAJCOMs must establish controls to make sure appropriated funds are not used to pay for
   unofficial toll calls. The host MAJCOM must establish procedures for billing to transient
   residents when direct toll calling is allowed.
   4.26.3. Paying for Commercial "Unofficial" Telephone Service. This paragraph, along
   with Figure 4.2, describes funding procedures for acquiring, installing, and maintaining
   inside wiring used to provide commercial "unofficial" telephone service in facilities such as
   dormitories, military family housing, VAQs, VOQs, TLFs, etc. This funding guidance refers
   to the inside wiring that extends between the telephone company's point of demarcation at a
   facility and the subscriber's telephone outlet.
       4.26.3.1. Assigning Funding Responsibilities:
          4.26.3.1.1. Pay for the installation and maintenance of inside wiring in Air Force
          quarters with the appropriation that finances the construction, repair, or maintenance
          of government quarters.
          4.26.3.1.2. In facilities other than Air Force quarters, the subscriber pays for the
          installation and maintenance, regardless of who owns the facility.
              4.26.3.1.2.1. The subscriber pays for all costs associated with the service
              provided by the telephone company (for example, circuit activation fees, monthly
54                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


            access fees, toll calls, long haul carrier access fees, instrument rental or
            procurement, etc.).
            4.26.3.1.2.2. See Figure 4.2 of this instruction and AFI 33-111 for further
            procedures and instructions. AFI 33-111 contains guidelines for both "official"
            and "unofficial" telephone service.
  4.26.4. Financing Telephone Wiring and Cable TV Wiring:
     4.26.4.1. Use Military Family Housing (MFH) P722 maintenance funds to finance the
     maintenance, repair, and minor alteration requirements for telephone wiring within MFH
     units.
     4.26.4.2. The occupant pays for the provision and installation of the telephone
     instrument and for the relocation of outlets solely for the convenience of the occupant.
     4.26.4.3. Installations must use MFH funds (P71X/P72X) to pay for cable TV prewiring
     as part of housing unit construction or improvement of units where cable TV is, or will be
     available.
     4.26.4.4. For MWR and Lodging organizations, see AFI 65-106.
  4.26.5. Providing Command and Control Communications Services in Base Housing.
     4.26.5.1. Official telephone service in the form of direct lines to the base switchboard
     (NOTE: For this purpose, a direct line from the appropriate operational command post is
     an acceptable alternative) or Class C phone lines in personal quarters is authorized per
     AFI 33-111,        only for those individuals in ―positions requiring immediate
     communications response for command and control.‖ Class A telephone service that
     provides local off-base or commercial long distance telephone service is not authorized.
     Telephone service may be authorized for on-base and Defense Information Systems
     Network (DISN)/Defense Switched Network (DSN) communications (given a mission
     essential need) when appropriate. Written authorization for such service must be kept on
     file for the duration of the service by the activity that provides the service. Except for
     alternate work sites (covered in P.L. 104-52, Title IV, Sec. 620, 19 Nov 95, Treasury,
     Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996 and AFI 33-111,
     paragraph 7.2.), appropriated funds are not authorized to provide telephone service in
     personal quarters where there is no clearly established requirement for immediate
     command and control capability. Personal need or convenience alone does not meet
     command and control criteria.
     4.26.5.2. The access requirement cannot be granted solely on the basis of grade or rank.
     Individuals authorized official telephone service in their private (on-base) residence must
     have both a functional and immediate need for command and control access.
     4.26.5.3. Appropriated funds may be used to provide Military Data Network services
     (such as NIPRNET, SIPRNET, and other special-purpose data networks) to private (on-
     base) residences when there is a command and control need for these services.
     Establishing a requirement for immediate command and control capability is
     applicable before providing access to a military data network in a private (on-base)
     residence. These military data network services can be used for official business only.
     The cost of cable installation in the MFH unit is chargeable to the Military Family
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    55


      Housing (MFH) O&M Appropriation. Additional guidance on LAN services is provided
      in AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use.
      4.26.5.4. Costs associated with the installation, maintenance, repair, and upgrade of
      communications infrastructure in housing units and areas required by occupants for their
      official duties (and approved under AFI 33-111) will not be charged to the Military
      Family Housing appropriation.
   4.26.6. Flexiplace/Telecommunicating Support to Alternate Work Sites. P.L 104-52,
   Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996, Sec. 620
   provides that appropriated funds may be used to install telephone lines and necessary
   equipment and to pay monthly charges in any private residence or private apartment of an
   employee who is authorized to work at home in accordance with guidelines issued by the
   Office of Personnel Management (OPM): Provided that the head of the department, division,
   bureau, or office certifies that adequate safeguards against private misuse exist and that the
   service is necessary for direct support of the agency‘s mission. Additional guidance may be
   found in AFI 33-111.
   4.26.7. Telephone Calling Cards. See AFI 33-111, paragraph 17, for guidance on
   obtaining and use of telephone calling cards. Funding for telephone calling cards is the
   responsibility of the requesting organization.
   4.26.8. Wireless Cards, Cell Phones, Blackberry Devices, and Other-Hand Held
   Communications Devices. Funding for these items, to include applicable user charges, is
   the responsibility of the requesting organization from their O&M type funds.

NOTES:
1. The cost of construction includes telephone wiring, jacks, terminal blocks, etc., so as to make
the facility telephone ready. Construction does not include instrument rental-procurement or any
charges levied by the telephone company associated with activating the telephone circuit or
providing the telephone service to the subscriber. The subscriber is responsible for these charges
in all cases. AF prewiring guidance, ETL 02-12, requires the installation of inside wiring using
Military Construction Program (3300 appropriation) funds, either new construction or major
renovation.
2. Prewiring does not apply to AF funded minor construction (57*3400, EEIC 529). However,
as a minimum, provisions for communications wiring and equipment (conduit, space, plywood
backboards, etc.) are provided as part of the project. In these cases, physical spaces are a part of
the funded cost (EEIC 529); conduit, plywood backboards, etc., are treated as secondary utilities
per AFR 86-1 and are an unfunded cost . Communications wiring may be installed as part of the
project, consistent with the general guidelines of ETL 87-XX, but are funded as an expense
(57*3400).
3. For MFH units, pay for minor renovations costing $7,500 or less with P-722. Pay for minor
renovations costing over $7,500 with P-713.
4. AFI 33-111 has guidelines for the authorization and funding of Class A, B, C, and D
"official" telephone service. Reference AFI 65-106 for MWR and other AF NAF fund source
authorizations.
5. Follow the funding guidance above when using appropriated funds. Follow nonappropriated
funding guidance when using nonappropriated funds. Reference AFI 65-106 for MWR and
other NAF fund source authorizations.

Section 4J—USAF Heritage Program

4.27. USAF Heritage Program (USAFHP) and associated activities. USAF Museums,
Heritage Centers, Historical Holdings, and Air Parks are, in part, appropriated – fund
organizations. USAFHP activity facilities are not privately owned, but are owned, operated, and
maintained by the Air Force. Commanders will include funding in their annual unit budgets
(financial plans) by type of activity and expense element as prescribed in the MAJCOM / DRU /
FOA budget call. AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage Program, provides instruction for the
USAFHP, activity operation, and new activity approval. USAFHP activities are also supported
by gifts from private organizations and other entities IAW AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Air Force
        .
   4.27.1. Financing the National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF). The
   NMUSAF at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is the Air Force‘s official service museum
   operation and the only USAFHP activity eligible to receive appropriated funds for new
   construction. The NMUSAF also relies on an annual budget of O&M funds for its day-to-
   day operational needs.
   4.27.2. Financing Air Force Field Museums, Heritage Centers, Historical Holdings, and Air
   Parks. The supporting Air Force organization should employ the judicious use of resources
   and other funds for establishment, management, operation, and maintenance of the supported
   USAFHP activities
       4.27.2.1. Commanders may use O&M-type funds, provided the costs are reasonable and
       in line with the base mission and funding priorities. The appropriate uses of O&M type
       funds include, but is not limited to, repair and maintenance of real property such as
       buildings and grounds, which are normal BOS support; installation and use of physical
       security equipment such as intrusion detection devices; services, supplies and equipment
       for the accountability, preservation, and display of USAF historical property such as
       artifacts and aerospace vehicles
       4.27.2.2. Do not use O&M or MILCON for facility construction, additions, or
       alterations.
   4.27.3. Private Organization support of USAFHP activities. The Air Force encourages but
   does not require a private organization (such as a charitable foundation) in the establishment
   and operation of a USAFHP activity. Commanders may permit supporting private
   organizations to be established to support USAFHP activities at their locations as prescribed
   by AFI 34-223, Private Organization (PO) Program and AFI 84-103. These organizations
   support USAFHP activities by raising funds to support command-approved capital
   construction of facilities; raising funds in general support of USAFHP activities; and funding
 58                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   the acquisition of significant historical property for the supported USAFHP activity within
   the supporting private organization‘s fiscal reporting year.
       4.27.3.1. Establish a memorandum of understanding between the parties to outline the
       responsibilities and limitations for each party, including a general description of those
       areas where the private organization will assist the USAFHP activity
       4.27.3.2. Offers of donations of money or real or personal property from private
       organizations will be submitted in writing through command channels IAW AFI 51-601.

Section 4K—Ethnic and Holiday Observances, Traditional Ceremonies, and Entertainment

4.28. Ethnic and Holiday Observances Funding Guidance:
   4.28.1. Ethnic Observances. Air Force organizations at all levels may spend appropriated
   funds, as authorized by the host or installation commander, to carry out activities that
   recognize the contributions that minorities and women have made to society. Observances
   include such activities as scholarly lectures, ethnic historical exhibits, art exhibits, displays,
   and musical groups, including those procured from the private sector.
       4.28.1.1. Air Force organizations may use O&M-type funds to finance a live artistic
       performance as an authorized part of an equal employment opportunity (EEO) effort if it
       is part of a formal program determined to advance EEO objectives, and consists of
       different types of presentations designed to promote EEO training objectives of making
       the audience aware of the cultural or ethnic history being celebrated (60 Comp Gen 303).
       While the Air Force may not normally provide "free food" to either government or non-
       government personnel, federal agencies may pay for lunches for guest speakers under 5
       U.S.C. 5703 if the speakers were in fact away from their homes or regular places of
       business. (NOTE: Government employees must pay for their own meals, whether on
       TDY or not, because food is a personal expense.)
       4.28.1.2. Sponsoring Air Force activities may use appropriated funds to purchase small
       "samples" of ethnic foods prepared and served during a formal ethnic awareness program.
       The samples should be of minimal proportion and are not intended to serve as meals or
       refreshments.
   4.28.2. Holiday Observances. Installation Commanders may approve the use of
   appropriated funds (APF) to purchase seasonal decorations on a case by case basis. Be
   prudent when using APFs for this purpose. The following conditions apply. Purchase
   decorations only where all installation personnel may benefit from their use, e.g., a decorated
   Headquarters building, Thanksgiving/Christmas decorations for the installation main dining
   facilities, base Christmas tree, or decorated foyer of the Headquarters building. Do not use
   APFs to purchase decorations for the interior of government offices or for personal use. The
   decorations may not be religious in character. Also, do not use APFs to purchase or mail
   seasonal greeting cards.
4.29. Traditional Ceremonies. The use of appropriated funds that might be prohibited as
personal expenses may be permissible when they are incurred incidental to certain traditional
ceremonies. Do not provide free food, snacks, alcoholic beverages, etc., except as provided in
paragraph 4.30 (and associated subparagraphs below). Comptroller General decisions permit the
commercial printing, including DAPS, of invitations and programs only for the following
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      59


traditional ceremonies, which do not include retirements, unless performed concurrently with a
formal Change of Command ceremony:
   4.29.1. Groundbreaking and Dedication Ceremonies. Expenses necessarily incidental to
   a groundbreaking or cornerstone ceremony are chargeable to the appropriation used for
   construction of the building. These expenses include: engraving and chrome-plating a
   ceremonial shovel (53 CG 119); flowers used as centerpieces at a dedication ceremony
   (B158831, 8 Jun 1966); group photographs at cornerstone ceremonies (B-11884, 26 Aug
   1940); and the printing of programs and invitations for cornerstone ceremonies (B-158831, 8
   Jun 1966, and B-107165-0.M, 3 Apr 1982).
   4.29.2. Armed Forces Change of Command Ceremonies. The Comptroller General
   extended the rationale of the cases cited above to Change of Command ceremonies for the
   cost of printing invitations (56 CG 81). The invitations are not inherently personal in nature,
   and therefore are not prohibited by the decisions on use of public funds for greeting cards. A
   Change of Command ceremony on an Air Force installation, which would warrant the
   commercial printing of invitations, including DAPS, is one which would be of interest to and
   have impact on the installation at large and usually involve the civic leaders of the
   surrounding community. Generally, the only command position on an installation which
   would fit this criteria is the Wing/Installation Commander. It is not intended that every unit
   commander, i.e. transportation, personnel, civil engineer, comptroller, etc., on an installation
   has commercial invitations, including DAPS, printed when he or she leaves the position.
   4.29.3. Graduations. The Comptroller General (Comp Gen Decision B-211700, March 16,
   1984) authorized the printing of invitations for graduation ceremonies at the Uniformed
   Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). Invitations for official graduation
   ceremonies at Air Force schools and academies are not to be ―by name‖ specific invitations
   for an individual who may be graduating. The announcement and invitation are for the
   commencement exercises being held by the school, not for the graduation of a particular
   individual. A graduate may include his or her personal name card in the invitation when
   mailing it to family or friends, but their name is not to appear in the printed invitation or
   announcement.
   4.29.4. Retirement Ceremonies. Military and federal civilian employee retirement
   ceremonies provide an appropriate recognition of the individual retiree‘s contribution to the
   Air Force through years of military or federal civilian employee service. Appropriated funds
   may be used for the following.
       4.29.4.1. Transportation. Government vehicles are not generally authorized for the
       transportation of the retiree or guest unless the retiree is an individual who is authorized
       to use a government vehicle as part of their official duties, for example a wing
       commander. See AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations for additional guidance.
       4.29.4.2. Invitations. Invitations, announcements, and programs for retirement
       ceremonies may be printed on personal computers with existing computer software and
       agency-purchased card stock, but not procured from commercial sources, including
       DAPS.
       4.29.4.3. Personnel. Non-protocol Air Force civilian and military members may
       consolidate address lists, address and stuff envelopes, mail retirement invitations, plan a
 60                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       retirement event, escort guests and setup and/or serve refreshments after the ceremony.
       A rule of reasonableness is expected to be followed and these activities should not be the
       military members‘ or employees‘ primary duties for an extended period of time. Military
       and civilian personnel may attend retirement ceremonies during duty hours, provided
       their supervisor authorizes such attendance, it is for a reasonable period of time, and it
       does not unduly interfere with performance of normal duties. Local Air Force Band
       members, Air Force Honor Guard members, and communications personnel may be used
       in duty status as part of the ceremony.
       4.29.4.4. Postage. APF postage is allowed for official announcements of official
       retirement ceremonies (see DoD 4525.8-M, DoD Official Mail Manual). A rule of
       reasonableness is expected to be followed as to the number of invitations that can be
       mailed.
   4.29.5. Wreath Laying - National Patriotic Observances. APFs are authorized for the
   purchase of an appropriate wreath in solemn remembrance or celebration of national patriotic
   observances to include Memorial Day, Independence Day, September 11, Veterans Day, and
   POW/MIA Recognition Day. There is to be only one wreath procured representing the
   entire Wing or Installation, including tenants, and not one purchased by each host and
   tenant organization. There are specific days at specific locations, i.e. December 7 at Joint
   Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI (previously Hickam AFB), which have singularly historical
   significance and for which it is fitting and proper to remember the events of that day with the
   laying of a wreath. Those installations in foreign countries may purchase a wreath on other
   occasions, which are of singularly historical significance to the Armed Forces of the United
   States in that country or which are dictated by protocol in the host country. Fiscal prudence,
   in keeping with protocol requirements and appropriate decorum, shall be exercised.
4.30. Entertainment. You cannot provide food, drink, or entertainment for military members,
civilian employees, or any other persons, except in cases specifically authorized by law. The
Comptroller General defines entertainment as ―food, drink, live and recorded music, theatrical
performances, and any other item or activity designed to entertain.‖ Authorized and unauthorized
―entertainment‖ situations payable from appropriated funds are shown below. Prohibitions
include items used to prepare, serve, or present entertainment (such as food or drink serving
materials and equipment, loudspeakers, video recorders, etc.).
   4.30.1. Use appropriated funds for these expenses:
       4.30.1.1. Food and drink provided to military personnel as subsistence-in-kind through
       the Military Personnel Appropriation (57*3500). NOTE: See AFMAN 34-240, Food
       Service Program Management, paragraph 8.18, on providing mission essential beverages
       from dining facilities for those military members who are authorized to receive them.
       Mission essential beverages are funded from the MILPERS (3500) appropriation and not
       from organizational O&M type funds.

       Blue‖) which normally perform at base theaters or service clubs for the entertainment of
       military personnel, their dependents, and others as authorized by the charter of the bands
       or choral groups. Rental of a local facility using O&M funds is authorized for Air Force
       entertainment such as Tops in Blue or a military service band if the majority of the
       anticipated audience will be military and their dependents (including retirees) and no
       suitable facility is available on the installation.
       4.30.1.9. Programmed ―incentive music‖ (such as ―MUSAK‖) to enhance employee

       ―hired‖ by Open Messes or Service Clubs for entertainment of members of these messes
       or clubs.
       4.30.2.2. Fireworks displays because they constitute ―entertainment‖. While a fireworks
       display may be useful in establishing good relations with the surrounding community, it
       is not a ―necessary expense‖. (See CG B-205292, 2 Jun 1982.)
   4.30.3. Air Force Open House Relations. See AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open
   Houses, for additional funding guidance.

Section 4L—Awards, Award Ceremonies and Gifts

4.31. Awards and Gifts. Do not use appropriated funds to purchase gifts for military members,
employees, or private citizens unless specifically authorized by law. Currently, the only authority
to use Air Force appropriated funds for gifts is AFI 65-603, which specifies the circumstances
and the individuals to whom gifts (or ―mementos‖) may be presented. Commanders may
authorize the use of appropriated funds to make cash and non-monetary awards to military
members and appropriated fund employees in accordance with the provisions of this section,
 62                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


AFPD 36-28, Awards and Decorations Programs, and its implementing instructions, and AFI
36-1004, The Air Force Civilian Recognition Program, for civilian performance awards.
Employees paid from nonappropriated funds are not eligible to receive awards charged to
appropriated funds, with one exception. That exception would be a HQ USAF-level award,
funded with APF, for which APF and NAF employees are competing for that single award.
   4.31.1. Innovative Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Awards. The
   following guidelines apply to cash awards to military and civilian employees:
      4.31.1.1. Air Force Personnel. The Air Force organization (active or reserve forces) to
      which a member or employee is assigned is responsible for budgeting and funding of
      IDEA awards, including tenant units that are separately funded. Funding of suggestion
      awards made after an individual is transferred or separated is the responsibility of the
      organization of assignment when the IDEA was submitted. Use the O&M-type funds of
      the organization to which the individual is or was assigned. When this applies to a
      Reservist transferring between AFRC bases, follow AFRC guidance for funding rules.
      For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA), the unit of assignment is the activity
      where the individual performs his/her IMA duty.
      4.31.1.2. Non-Air Force Personnel. If the Air Force adopts a suggestion from a person
      in another DoD or federal agency, charge the cash award to the O&M type funds of (a)
      SAF/AA if the IDEA benefits the Air Force as a whole, or (b) the command or
      organization that receives the primary benefit.
   4.31.2. Mission Accomplishment Awards. Air Force activities may use appropriated funds
   to purchase special trophies and awards authorized by those AFI 36-XXXX series
   instructions which pertain to mission accomplishment or a MAJCOM/Base/FOA/DRU
   supplement thereto. Included are trophies, plaques, emblems, certificates, organizational
   coins, and similar items that are designed for display purposes. For organizational coins, do
   not personalize them by stamping the presenter‘s name on the coin and the presenter‘s name
   is not to be added after the coin is cast (EXCEPTION: Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of
   Staff of the Air Force, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, four (4) star general
   officers and four (4) star civilian equivalents are authorized to personalize coins). The
   coins are to be presented as cast from the die without further embellishment, i.e. presenter‘s
   name engraved. They are organizational coins, not personalized mementos. Use only the
   organization‘s name and the position of the presenter (e.g. Commander 33 rd FW Eglin AFB,
   FL). The prohibition against personalizing stationery in AF Supplement to DoDI 5330.03, is
   applicable to organizational coins for the same reasons – it creates frozen stock (waste) when
   personnel change and requires an additional expenditure to change the die from which these
   items are cast. Appropriated funds are not legally available to procure
   ―commemorative‖ coins. Merchandise items such as belt buckles with a nominal cost, as
   determined by local Command authorities, and which display the activity logo, insignia or
   other inscription that clearly identifies its purpose meet Comptroller General criteria for
   mission accomplishment awards. Air Force activities may use such items for mission
   accomplishment awards to the extent authorized by agency directives or instructions. The
   authority for merchandise-type items for mission accomplishment awards for civilians is 5
   U.S.C. 4501-4507 (see Comptroller General Decision B-243025) and for military, 10 U.S.C.
   1125 (see Comptroller General Decision B-247687).
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    63


     4.31.2.1. Recruitment and Retention. Appropriated funds may be used to procure
     recognition items of nominal or modest value (less than $50.00 per item) for recruitment
     or retention purposes. These may be presented to Air Force members as well as their
     family members, and other individuals who are recognized as providing support that
     substantially facilitates service in the armed forces. The authority for purchasing these
     recognition items is 10 U.S.C. 2261. Organizations may elect to use the same coin used
     for mission accomplishment awards addressed in paragraph 4.31.2 above for this
     purpose.
  4.31.3. Promotional or Incentive Gifts and Awards:
     4.31.3.1. Items of a utilitarian nature, having intrinsic value, such as TVs, radios,
     cameras, briefcases, etc., fall into the category of merchandise. The Comptroller General
     considers them as personal gifts. Existing statutes do not permit the purchase of such
     items with appropriated funds for use as incentives. This rule also applies to lower-value
     ―merchandise-type‖ items, such as coffee mugs, key chains, ashtrays, luggage tags and
     similar items. (See paragraph 4.31.2 for exceptions). Additionally, there is no authority
     which allows the use of appropriated funds to procure mementos, i.e., coins or
     medallions, for Air Force individual military or civilian personnel or units if the reason
     for the presentation is not specifically addressed as a mission accomplishment award
     published in the Command or Base supplements to AFI 36-XXXX. However, Air Force
     activities may purchase pertinent literature, specialized lesson plans, bumper stickers,
     informational stickers (for tools, telephones, notebooks, and so on), visual aids for
     training and to secure compliance with mission-related objectives, to the extent permitted
     under functional instructions. Where children are concerned, for example, in crime and
     fire prevention programs, these guidelines allow purchase of items that convey an
     appropriate message targeted to the age group of the audience (such as coloring books,
     balloons, buttons, badges, etc., which depict or relate a crime or fire prevention message).
     4.31.3.2. The guidance in paragraph 4.31.3.1 does not apply to the Air Force IDEA
     Program, the Air Force Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment Program, the Air
     Force Voting Assistance Program, the Air Force Recruiting Advertising Program, the Air
     Force Mishap Prevention Program, the Air Force Pollution Prevention Program and the
     Air Force Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. AFI 38-401 (Air Force
     Innovative Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program), AFI 38-301
     (Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment Program), AFI 36-3107 (Voting Assistance
     Program), AFI 36-2015 (Air Force Recruiting Advertising Program), Air Force
     Retention Program (AFI 36-2624 Career Assistance Advisors), AFI 91-202 (Air Force
     Mishap Prevention Program), AFI 36-6001 (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response
     Program), Family Support Centers (AFI 36-3009, Family Support Center Program &
     Supporting Role in 10 U.S.C. 1789) provide instructions for these programs.
     Additionally, the guidance does not apply to Health Promotion Programs funded with
     the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation (97X/X0130.1883 - FC 2X).
  4.31.4. Sports Competitions. Activities may use appropriated funds to purchase T-shirts,
  trophies, plaques or similar devices for presentation to winners of intramural sports and
  athletic competitions. Such competitions shall generally be of a continuing nature. T-shirts
  can be used in lieu of other awards and cannot be used in conjunction with any plaque,
  medal/medallion, trophy or similar device. No other type of shirt is authorized. Awards,
 64                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   including T-shirts, may be given to winners only and not participants in general. The
   trophies, plaques, or similar devices shall be for display purposes only, and not redeemable
   for cash, merchandise, or services. See DoD Directive 1348.19, Award of Trophies and
   Similar Devices in Recognition of Accomplishments.
   4.31.5. Physical Fitness Centers. O&M-type funds may be used to procure low cost
   incentive items such as T-shirts, ball caps, water bottles, etc. to encourage customers to
   complete specified and published exercise regimens at Air Force Physical Fitness Centers.
   Examples of such regimens could be jogging a set number of miles or so many hours on a
   Stairmaster or rowing machine. There is no authority for cash awards or high dollar items
   that would give the appearance of a gift or fiscal imprudence. The unit cost of any incentive
   item will not exceed $10 dollars. Because of the high cost of a die, coins or medallions are
   not to be used as incentive items. The authority for this incentive program is a 25 Jan 99
   Policy Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy
   (ASD/FMP).
   4.31.6. Health and Wellness Centers (HAWC). Incentive items for completion of a
   health-related regimen such as smoking cessation or weight loss are funded from Medical
   appropriations (Fund Code 2X). For AFRC, use O&M (3740).
   4.31.7. Other Awards. Do not use appropriated funds to make or purchase any awards
   other than those outlined above. Use nonappropriated funds in accordance with AFI 34-201,
   Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS), (currently in rewrite status).
4.32. Civilian Performance Awards. AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance
Program, AFI 36-1004 and DoDM1400.25_AFMAN 36-115 provide policy and guidelines:
   4.32.1. Charge the cost of cash awards made to civilian employees under the performance
   management systems to funds current at the time final approval of the award is made. The
   year of actual payment is not the controlling factor.
   4.32.2. AFI 36-1004 allows agencies to purchase merchandise items such as jackets at
   nominal cost (less than $50) which display the activity logo, insignia, or other inscription that
   clearly identifies the purpose of the award. Such items are honorary awards under the
   Government Employees Incentive Awards Act (CG Decision B-243025).
4.33. Refreshments at Awards Ceremonies. Commanders may hold awards ceremonies for
military members and civilian employees, including their families, friends, work associates, and
union representatives (See CG Decision B-223319, 21 July 1986 which addresses a national
award ceremony). While light refreshments may be served, the Comp Gen Decision implies that
the award being presented must be substantial in nature to qualify for the serving of
refreshments. A substantial award would involve a competitive USAF-wide selection (national
award), such as 12 Outstanding Airmen, or a competitive Command-wide selection (regional
award), such as Command Officer, NCO, Airman, and Civilian of the Year. To avoid any
confusion, presenting an award at a base or organization picnic does not qualify the picnic
for APF funding under the guise of an award ―ceremony.‖ PCS, promotion, school
graduations, recurring quarterly recognitions, commanders‘ call, and retirement ceremonies are
not considered award ceremonies for the serving of refreshments using appropriated funds.
   4.33.1. Civilian Employees. Appropriated funds may be used to provide light refreshments
   at such award ceremonies at nominal cost under authority of 5 U.S.C. 4503. AFI 36-1004
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   65


   provides guidance on the Air Force recognition program. See also CG Decision B-223319,
   21 July 1986 (National Award Ceremony), and CG Decision B-236040, 9 October 1990
   (Regional Award Ceremony). As indicated by the CG Decisions, the award must be
   substantial in nature, as opposed to local awards. The presentation of a longevity
   certificate and pin is not considered an award.
      4.33.1.1. Nonappropriated funds finance the cost of light refreshments for awards
      ceremonies of personnel paid from nonappropriated funds.
      4.33.1.2. Commanders may pay fees charged for a regional or national incentive
      awards ceremony that includes refreshments (luncheon, banquet, buffet, tea, etc.) for
      attending civilian employee nominees, award recipients, and their supervisors or
      managers.
   4.33.2. Military Personnel. Similar authority exists under 10 U.S.C. 1124 for military
   personnel.
   4.33.3. Examples. Light refreshments may include beverages such as sodas, coffee, or tea
   with dessert or snacks. Alcoholic beverages of any kind do not qualify as refreshments.
   4.33.4. Guidance for Approval. Exercise prudence in using appropriated funds for this
   purpose. A commander must first determine that a reception with light refreshments, in
   accordance with OPM regulations and 10 U.S.C. 1124 will materially enhance the
   effectiveness of an award ceremony before approving the use of appropriated funds for
   refreshments at the ceremony. Charge the cost of the light refreshments to each command‘s
   primary O&M budget activity and not to Official Representation Fund accounts. (NOTE: CG
   Decision B-223319, 21 Jul 86 covers only those award ceremonies resulting from
   competitive-type activities cited in AFPD 36-28 and its instructions and the Federal
   Personnel Manual. It does not cover PCS departure or retirement ceremonies except to the
   extent applicable awards are an integral part of the ceremony.)
   4.33.5. Procurement from Nonappropriated Funds Instrumentalities (NAFI). NAFIs
   (clubs, restaurants and snack bars, etc.) may provide the light refreshments only if the
   persons making the arrangements process the request for goods or services through the base
   contracting officer in accordance with existing procurement directives, or under a NAFI
   Memorandum of Agreement authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2492. (See CG Decision B214810, 29
   Nov 1984.).
   4.33.6. Refreshments at Recruiting Functions. Appropriated funds may be used for small
   meals and refreshments during recruiting functions for certain individuals (FY 97 NDAA,
   Sec. 361 (P.L. 104-201), as amended by the FY 02 NDAA, Sec. 545 (P.L. 107-107);
   Codified in 10 U.S.C. 520c). For specific details, see AETC 36-2002, Recruiting Procedures
   for the Air Force.

Section 4M—Chapel and Chaplain Programs

4.34. Funding Guidance. Installations that support chapels and chaplain programs will apply
the following funding guidance.
   4.34.1. The source of funding direct mission requirements is appropriated funds. Chaplain
   Corps direct mission requirements fall into the following categories: contracts (one musician
 66                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   and music director per worship service, religious education/parish coordinators, and civilian
   clergy); facilities (to include repairs, maintenance, alterations, minor construction, and
   military construction); facility infrastructure and multi-media technology (to include sound
   systems); readiness requirements; training; communication and information technology;
   temporary duty expenses; ecclesiastical supplies and equipment (to include expendable
   communion supplies such as host, grape juice, and wine); transportation; honoraria for
   commander-sponsored religious events; community religious observances (to include
   National Prayer Breakfasts/Luncheons; and office supplies.
      4.34.1.1. O&M funds provide support services for Chaplain-led programs to assist active
      duty members of the Armed Forces and their immediate family members in building and
      maintaining a strong family structure. The support services are costs of transportation,
      food, lodging, childcare, supplies, fees, and training materials for members and their
      family members while participating in the programs.
      4.34.1.2. Indirect Mission Support requirements are funded by Chapel Tithes and
      Offerings Fund (CTOF) funds. A listing of Chaplain Corps Direct and Non-direct
      Mission Support requirements is contained in AFI 52-105 Volume 2, Chapel Tithes and
      Offerings Fund (CTOF) (attach 2).
      4.34.1.3. Wing/installation chaplains are authorized to use appropriated funds to
      purchase equipment and furnishings to operate and sustain chapel facilities and Airmen
      Ministry Centers. Amenities may include TVs, game rooms, cyber café equipment,
      kitchen appliances, meeting rooms, communication and information technology (to
      include commercial internet service for Airmen Ministry Centers) and a chaplain‘s office.
   4.34.2. Do not use appropriated funds for provision of food or beverage items (unless
   specifically authorized by law), except as determined by the wing/installationchaplain to be a
   necessary integral part of an authorized religious ceremony or otherwise specifically
   authorized by law.
   4.34.3. Chaplain Corps resourcing is based on the chapel ministry plan.

Section 4N—Criteria for Determining Expense and Investment Costs

4.35. Distinguishing Between Expense and Investment Costs. Air Force activities at all
levels; Headquarters, MAJCOMs/FOAs, installations, must apply uniform cost definition
criteria. These criteria determine whether costs are classified as either an expense or an
investment, and consequently whether it should be budgeted in the expense appropriations of
Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel or the investment appropriations of
Procurement, RDT&E, and Military Construction. DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, provides
general guidance for DoD use.
4.36. Investment Cost Decision. Figure 4.3 depicts decision-making factors for investment
costs.

 * Since FY 1994, the threshold amount has been law as stated in the General
 Provisions of the annual Appropriations Act. Prior to FY 1994, the threshold was
 established in Committee Reports. (The DWCF threshold is separately codified in
 10 U.S.C. 2208.)

Section 4O---Licencing of Intellectual Property. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Section 2260 (added by
Section 1004 of Publicv Law 108-375), the Air Force may licence trademarks, service marks,
certification marks, and collective marks, owned or controlled by the Air Force, and may retain
 68                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

   procedures.
4.42. Accounting Codes. Additional codes must be used within the base level accounting
systems to separately track unused funds carried forward from the fiscal year of collection
through the following two fiscal years, as required. Unused funds remaining after the second
fiscal year following the year collected will be deposited to ―General Fund Proprietary Receipts,
Defesne Military, Not Otherwise Classified‖. Contact HAF/RMB for specific coding procedures.

Section 4P—Other Guidance

4.43. Personalized Stationery. Authorized: using appropriated funds to print functional titles
of key officials on memorandums and notes. Not Authorized: Using appropriated funds or
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 69


government equipment to print the names of officers or other officials on stationery,
memorandums, or notes. (See AF Supplement to DoDI 5330.03).
4.44. Business and Greeting Cards:
   4.44.1. Appropriated funds may be used for the printing of business cards, using personal
   computers, existing software and agency-purchased card stock, for use in connection with
   official communications (as distinct from the extension of social or business courtesy).
   (Department of Justice 11 Aug 97 Ruling and OSD (DA&M) 28 Aug 98 Policy
   Memorandum). Additionally, the purchase of business cards from the Lighthouse for the
   Blind, Inc., a Javits-Wagner-O‘Day participating non-profit agency, is authorized when the
   organization determines that costs are equivalent or less to purchase cards rather than to
   produce them on a personal computer (OSD (DA&M) 15 Jul 99 Memo) (41 U.S.C. 46-48c)
   (See AF Supplement 2 to DoDI 5330.03). The purchase of business cards must be
   accomplished through the DLA Document Services per OSD direction.
      4.44.1.1. Commercial Printing of Business Cards. Only those individuals in the
      following five categories are authorized to have business cards commercially printed,
      which includes DLA Document Services:
          4.44.1.1.1. Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS). AFRS/CC approves business
          cards for AFRS personnel involved in recruiting activities. AFRS obtains the cards
          from DLA Document Services.
          4.44.1.1.2. Air Force Academy. HQ USAFA/DAR obtains all cards for the Air
          Force Academy Liaison Officers from DLA Document Services using USAFA O&M
          funds.
          4.44.1.1.3. Civilian Employees. The MAJCOM or FOA/DA must approve cards for
          civilian employees engaged in professional recruiting programs. MAJCOM/FOA-
          level officials purchase the cards from DLA Document Services.
          4.44.1.1.4. United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR). HQ AFRC/DAP approves
          requests for all USAFR military recruiters, and obtains the cards from DLA
          Document Services.
          4.44.1.1.5. Air National Guard (ANG). The Adjutant General (TAG) of the State
          in which the recruiter is located approves orders for cards of National Guard Bureau
          military recruiters. When cards are procured using State funds the ANG is authorized
          to obtain them from local vendors. If ANG O&M funds are used to acquire cards, use
          a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), or a DD Form
          282, DoD Printing Requisition/Order through DLA Document Services.
   4.44.2. Seasonal greeting cards, birthday cards, get well cards, anniversary cards, and
   the like are a personal expense to be borne by the persons who ordered and sent them; do
   not charge their cost to public funds.
4.45. Housing Damage Liability:
   4.45.1. Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH)/Military Family Housing
   (MFH). Personnel residing in UPH or MFH are liable for damage to the quarters/dwelling
   and damage or loss of any equipment or furnishings contained therein provided it is
 70                                                              AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   determined that the loss or damage was caused by negligence or abuse of the member (or a
   guest of the member).
   4.45.2. Disposing of Refunds. The amounts received as a result of the loss and/or damage
   to Unaccompanied Personnel Housing or Military Family Housing are appropriation refunds.
   Therefore, they are available for immediate reobligation for the same purposes and under the
   same circumstances as other funds in these accounts (see Chapter 5).
4.46. Buying Books, Periodicals, Newspapers and Pamphlets:
   4.46.1. Mission Essential. Air Force libraries procure all mission essential commercial
   books, periodicals, newspapers, and pamphlets for Air Force organizations with appropriated
   funds (APF) centrally managed by HQ AFSVA/SVPAL. AFI 34-270, Air Force Library and
   Information Systems (AFLIS), designates those specific organizations and types of
   publications which are exempt from centrally managed procurement through the library. AFI
   34-270 authorizes libraries AFSVA/SVPAL does not centrally fund and procure essential
   books and subscriptions for: Air Force Reserve; Air National Guard; Surgeon General; Judge
   Advocate General; the Air University (including AFIT); United States Air Force Academy;
   or tenant units or agencies funded with non-Air Force appropriations.
4.47. Funding Consecutive Overseas Tours. All Air Force consecutive overseas tours (COT),
in-place and to another overseas base, are funded from the Military Personnel Appropriation
(Appn 3500). AFMAN 65-604 contains the appropriate projects and subprojects to charge the
costs. Refer to this manual to construct the appropriate fund cites for the military member and
their command sponsored family member‘s round trip travel to CONUS.
4.48. Appliances and Furnishings. Air Force organizations may use appropriated funds to
purchase appliances (and related furnishings) only in common areas where available for use by
all personnel, under the following conditions:
   4.48.1. Responsible officials must first determine the appliance(s) (and related furnishings)
   are reasonably necessary to execute the Air Force mission, and the primary benefit accrues
   to a larger community (as opposed to just an individual or small group of individuals).
   4.48.2. The acquisition costs of appliances (and related furnishings) will be for basic
   capabilities only and sized accordingly.
   4.48.3. The appliances (and related furnishings) will not be purchased for the purpose of
   providing entertainment.
   4.48.4. Appropriated funds will not be used to furnish goods, such as coffee, food,
   beverages, condiments, or food preparation/serving items.
4.49. Retiree Activities Programs. This is a formal program for interface between volunteer
retirees and the active duty community. Details of the program are in AFI 36-3106, Retiree
Activities Program. Installation commanders may use appropriated funds to support the Retiree
Activities Office (RAO) as follows.
   4.49.1. Official mail in support of the Retiree Activities.
   4.49.2. Office supplies, printing, equipment, travel, and other operating costs, which have
   been identified and approved in the installation execution plan.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    71


   4.49.3. Official travel expenses authorized per the JTR, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Part K.
   Reimbursement of transportation expenses for travel to and from the retiree volunteer‘s
   residence and the duty station (RAO) is not authorized.

Section 4P—Meals, Conferences, Training, and Fees

4.50. Use of Appropriated Funds for Meals and Light Refreshments.
   4.50.1. Whether you sponsor a conference or attend a conference, absent specific statutory
   authority, appropriated funds may not be used for meals and light refreshments. Statutory
   authority allows meals and light refreshments for a conference, seminar, symposium or
   similar meeting (collectively referred to as a ―conference‖), 5 U.S.C. Section 4110, and for a
   training event, 5 U.S.C. Section 4109, and under other very specific conditions.
      4.50.1.1. Conferences
          4.50.1.1.1. Appropriated funds may be used for meals and light refreshments ONLY
          under the following conditions: a) when meals and refreshments are incidental to a
          conference; b) attendance at the meals and when refreshments are provided is
          important to ensure full participation in essential discussions, lectures, or speeches
          concerning the purpose of the conference; and c) the meals and refreshments are part
          of a FORMAL conference that includes not just the meals and refreshments and
          discussions, speeches, or other business that may take place when the meals and
          refreshments are served, but also includes substantial functions occurring separately
          from when the food is served.
          4.50.1.1.2. A ―formal conference‖ is defined as including registration, a published
          and substantive agenda, and scheduled speakers. Simply referring to a local meeting
          on an installation, at a MAJCOM, or at HQ USAF with one or two people TDY in
          attendance as a conference, seminar, or symposium does not confer authority to use
          appropriated funds. NOTE: SAF/AA controls conference policy and is creating a
          new AFI on conferencing approval processes. All MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs
          must conform with existing SAF/AA conference memoranda.
          4.50.1.1.3. You may pay for food and light refreshments for those employees not in a
          travel status under the provisions of Title 5 U.S.C., Section 4110.
      4.50.1.2. Training
          4.50.1.2.1. Appropriated funds may be used for food and light refreshments which
          constitute ―training‖, as defined within 5 U.S.C., Section 4101(4). For these types of
          training events, the costs of the food must be non-severable from other overall costs.
          Simply calling an event ―training‖ is not legally sufficient; neither are routine or
          recurring business meetings discussing agency business.
          4.50.1.2.2. For Formal Training events, follow guidance prescribed in appropriate
          training instructions for meetings or conferences that qualify as formal training.
          4.50.1.2.3. If under the authority of Formal Training guidance (see Education and
          Training Course Training Announcements at https://etcs.randolph.af.mil) and a
          registration fee is charged, the approving official is responsible for ensuring no
          unauthorized charges are included in the fee. Prepare a budget itemizing each of the
 72                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


          costs to be included in the fee (such as meals, guest speakers, meeting rooms, set-up
          charges, and other similar costs).
          4.50.1.2.4. You may pay for food and light refreshments for those employees not in a
          travel status under the provisions of Title 5 U.S.C., Section 4109.
4.51. Funding for Air Force Sponsored Conferences. This guidance applies to all levels of
command.
   4.51.1. Air Force Sponsored - Air Force Only Participation. Within the Air Force,
   organizations that sponsor a conference (subject to the definitions above in paragraph 4.44)
   will pay for speaker fees, honorariums, light refreshments, snacks, meals, off base facility
   costs (excluding lodging) and other allowable related costs (which shall not include gifts or
   mementos for guest speakers) from their O&M type funds rather than recover such costs
   through a registration fee. For example, if HQ USAF, a MAJCOM, or base level
   organization directs or invites attendance at a conference, the organization sponsoring the
   meeting or conference must fund these costs from their own O&M-type funds. If HQ USAF
   or a MAJCOM directs a subordinate installation to host a meeting or a conference, the HQ
   USAF or MAJCOM organization is the sponsor and responsible for the costs of the meeting
   or conference. The subordinate installation is merely the host, not the sponsor. In general, use
   the AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, to contract for off-base conference facilities, if
   appropriate.
   4.51.2. Funding for Air Force Sponsored – Federal (in addition to Air Force) and Non-
   Federal Participation
      4.51.2.1. Collecting Fees From Federal (non-Air Force) Government Sources: If you
      sponsor a meeting or conference including non-Air Force federal government employees,
      you may charge them a fee covering food and beverage costs as a minimum. Sponsors
      may charge an additional fee for a pro-rata share of other costs if circumstances dictate.
      Follow the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapters 1 and 4.
      4.51.2.2. Collecting Fees From Non-Federal Sources: Title 10, U.S.C., Section 2262,
      provides the authority to collect fees from individuals and commercial participants
      attending DoD sponsored conferences (seminars, exhibits, symposiums, or similar
      meetings). Follow DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 12, Chapter 32, ―Collection and
      Retention of Conferences Fees From Non-Federal Sources‖; comply with established
      OUSD(C)(P/B) reporting requests, and ensure a complete and accurate accounting for all
      conference fees collected.
   4.51.3. Hospitality Fees. If you sponsor a conference, you may levy a hospitality fee to
   cover purely social functions, i.e., ―ice breakers‖, occurring before the opening of the
   conference or farewell gatherings after the close of the conference. These are personal
   expenses, voluntary, and are not reimbursable from appropriated funds. Do not authorize
   such a fee in travel orders. (See JFTR Appendix R2, Part II, Miscellaneous Reimbursable
   Expenses).
   4.51.4. Serving Materials for Conferences. Protocol offices at MAJCOMs, NAFs, FOAs,
   DRUs, ALCs, Product Centers, and Air University having conference facilities with the
   capacity, décor, and equipment to host conferences such as Corona, General Officer
   Orientation, Retired General Officer‘s Summit, significant foreign defense delegations, Air
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       73


   Force-wide functional conferences or other large and significant conferences may procure the
   minimum serving materials necessary to serve snacks and refreshments. A coffee maker for
   the conference facility is authorized for purchase with APF. Its sole use is for conferences
   and not day-to-day use in any individual office. Coffee makers, microwave ovens, and the
   like for individual offices are a personal expense, not a government expense. The serving
   materials authorized are intended for serving snacks and beverages and are not intended to
   equip protocol offices for serving full course meals. Fine china, genuine silverware or silver-
   plated utensils, linens and linen laundry service are not authorized. While the serving
   materials may be borrowed for use in the most senior command offices to serve VIP visitors,
   but not stored or retained there, this does not convey any authority to procure snacks and
   beverages with APF for those visiting VIPs. That is a personal expense, unless otherwise
   authorized for APF funding with Official Representation Funds (ORF) (AFI 65-603
   implementing 10 U.S.C. 127). The authority to procure these serving materials does not
   extend to base level protocol offices that may only procure disposable serving materials or
   borrow materials from the clubs as may be required for a conference.
4.52. Non-government Sponsored Conferences. If you attend these types of activities, charge
the cost of employee registration fees and other official expenses for non-government
meetings/conferences to your organization O&M type funds, as per applicable directives (for
example, the Joint Federal Travel Regulations and the Joint Travel Regulations, as appropriate).
There are two types of conferences sponsored by non-Federal entities.
   4.52.1. The first is a conference with a non-severable fee for food. Food costs are
   considered non-severable if they are billed as part of the overall costs of the training, and the
   training costs cannot be reduced by foregoing the food or by breaking out the food costs as a
   separate option. The Air Force may pay or provide reimbursement for food purchased as a
   non-severable, non-negotiable portion of a registration or attendance fee.
   4.52.2. The second is a conference with a severable fee. The availability of appropriated
   funds must be based on: a) meals and refreshments being incidental to the meeting or
   conference; b) attendance at the meals or when refreshments are served is important for the
   attendee‘s full participation in the conference; and c) the conference includes substantial
   functions occurring separately from when the food is served, even though discussions,
   speeches, lectures or other business may take place when the meals and refreshments are
   served.
4.53. Government (non-Air Force) Sponsored Conferences. If you attend these types of
activities, charge the cost of registration fees and other official expenses to the attendee‘s
organizational O&M type funds, per applicable directives (for example, the Joint Federal Travel
Regulations and the Joint Travel Regulations, as appropriate). There are two types of
conferences sponsored by other Government Agencies – those with a non-severable fee for food
and those with a severable fee for food. The rules established in paragraph 4.45 above also
apply to these Government (non-Air Force) agencies.
4.54. Avoiding Double Recovery for Meals. If you attend a meeting or conference where a
registration fee includes meals, and the charge is an integral part of the registration fee (meaning
inseparable from the fee) you must include in your travel orders (and your travel voucher must
identify) the number of meals provided. See the JFTR, Appendix R2, Part II, for further details.
 74                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


4.55. Scientific, Technical, and Professional Symposiums, Conferences, and Similar
Meetings. Conferences, symposiums, and similar meetings in the scientific, technical, and
professional fields may employ a contractor, through normal acquisition procedures, for the
purpose of handling the administrative arrangements. Generally, these types of gatherings
involve the Air Force Research Laboratory. DoD, non-DoD Federal, and non-government
personnel may be charged a registration fee by the contractor to cover all the costs associated
with the contract, including a reasonable profit. The contractor collects all registration fees. This
registration fee is a reimbursable expense on the travel voucher. However, any meals included in
the fee will be deducted from the authorized per diem.
   4.55.1. Co-sponsorship. Chapter 3 of DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, authorizes a
   DoD component to co-sponsor scientific, technical, and professional conferences, seminars,
   or like events with a non-Federal entity when specific conditions in the regulation are met.
   Those conditions are restated in AFI 61-205. As a co-sponsor of one of these events, the Air
   Force organization, acting as a co-sponsor, may follow the same procedures as when the Air
   Force is the sole sponsor. Follow the same procedures as in paragraph 4.49 above.
   Alternatively, the Air Force organization may choose to have the non-Federal entity, which is
   the co-sponsor of the event, handle the administrative arrangements. In that case, the DoD,
   non-DoD Federal, and non-government personnel would pay the registration fee to the non-
   federal entity co-sponsor to cover all administrative costs.
4.56. Veterinary Services:
   4.56.1. For fiscal administration of DoD veterinary treatment facilities, refer to AFJI 48-
   131, Table 6-1 for specific guidance
   4.56.2. Collect surcharge fees for veterinary services into the General Receipt Account
   573210.9999 (Receipts not otherwise classified) no less often than weekly, or daily when
   total collections reach $1,000 or greater. (See DFAS-DE 7010.5-R for detailed procedures.)
4.57. Membership in Professional Organizations. Air Force organizations may use O&M
funds to pay membership fees in professional organizations only in the name of the Air Force
organization and only if the membership will benefit the organization‘s mission. Air Force
activities may not use O&M funds to pay for membership fees which are in the name of an
individual. (See 53 CG 429, 52 CG 495, 24 CG 814, 3 CG 963, 5 U.S.C. 4109, and 5 U.S.C.
5946.)
   4.57.1. Membership in Civic Organizations. Comp Gen Decision B-205356 (61 Comp.
   Gen. 542, July 23, 1982) allows for the use of appropriated funds for an agency/installation
   membership, not an individual membership, in civic organizations which allow
   membership in the name of an organization, provided there is ―an administrative
   determination that the payment of fees is necessary for the agency to carry out its authorized
   activities‖ and ―the proposed membership must primarily benefit the agency involved, not its
   individual employees.‖ Comp Gen Decision B-205356 should be read in its entirety before
   deciding to expend APF for such a membership. The Comptroller General has cautioned that
   their decision ―does not mean that every military installation or regional Government office
   can use appropriated funds to join the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions and similar organizations.‖
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      75


4.58. Special Drinking Water. Air Force organizations may purchase drinking water (bottled
water) with appropriated funds only when it is a necessary expense from the government‘s
standpoint:
   4.58.1. The public water supply is unsafe for human consumption as determined by
   competent medical/environmental authority in writing.
   4.58.2. There is an emergency failure of the water source on the installation.
   4.58.3. A temporary facility has no drinking water available within a reasonable distance.
   4.58.4. There is no water fit for drinking purposes, as determined by competent
   medical/environmental authority in writing, available without cost or at a lower cost to the
   government. The purchase of drinking water (bottled water) with APF ceases to be
   authorized when the problem with the drinking water has been remedied. (See Comp
   Gen B-247871, B-147622, 3 CG 828, 5 CG 90, 17 CG 698, 18 CG 238, 24 CG 56, and 25
   CG 920.)
   4.58.5. Bottled or Potable Water Purchases Incident to Temporary Duty
   (TDY). Military members and civilian travelers, directed to perform TDY, are not
   authorized bottled/potable water as a reimbursable expense. Bottled water is part of the
   subsistence portion of the per diem allowance. Reference: JFTR (military), Chapter 4, Part F,
   Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses and JTR (civilian), Chapter 4, Part O, Reimbursable
   Travel Expenses.
   4.58.6. Sports Beverages. Any requirement to provide sports beverages such as Gatorade
   must be established by competent medical authority. If the local medical treatment facility
   (MTF) commander or a medically qualified representative makes a medical determination, in
   writing, that consumption of such beverages during the performance of official duties is
   necessary to maintain the physical well being of Air Force members, the use of
   organizational O&M funds to procure the beverages is authorized. The authority to make this
   medical determination cannot be delegated to other installation organization commanders.
   This is the only circumstance under which APF is authorized to procure such beverages for
   consumption during the performance of official duties. This direction is not intended to
   and does not preclude competent medical authority from prescribing the use of sports
   beverages for medical reasons for individual members on or off duty.
4.59. CREEK SWEEP Credits. CREEK SWEEP credits are entitlements to the United States
Air Force from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the form of goods and services (not
money). The FRG provides the credits under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed
by HQ USAFE on behalf of the DoD and FRG. Air Force installations may accomplish facility
requirements (maintenance, repair, renovation, and construction) normally funded with
appropriated funds, except as noted herein; with CREEK SWEEP credits provided that the using
installation applies all policies, rules, and procedures which apply to appropriated funded
projects to the CREEK SWEEP credit projects. Any deviation from this guidance must have the
prior approval of SAF/IEI. (Section 9008, Public Law 101-165, November 21, 1989, provides
standing authority).
   4.59.1. Do not use for minor construction projects costing over $750,000 accomplished with
   CREEK SWEEP credits to renovate or improve office space; further,
 76                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   4.59.2. Do not use them for any purpose on Senior or General Officer housing.
   4.59.3. Do not use CREEK SWEEP credits to accomplish facility requirements normally
   funded with nonappropriated funds (NAF) unless specifically approved by SAF/IEI.
4.60. Licenses and Certificates for Military Members. Comp Gen Decision B-252467, June
3, 1994, allows the Air Force to pay for licenses and certificates for military personnel in
instances where Federal law compels Air Force members to comply with state and local
regulations requiring the licenses or certificates. The Comp Gen Decision is not applicable to
civilian employees of the Air Force, only to Air Force members. However, as stated in the
Decision ―….appropriated funds are not available to meet the licensing requirements of
professional personnel such as teachers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, doctors, and nurses.‖
Appropriated funds will not be used for professional licenses of military or civilian personnel,
except as provided below.
   4.60.1. Expenses for Professional Credentials. Title 5, U.S.C., Section 5757, provides that
   an agency may use appropriated funds to pay for: 1) expenses for employees to obtain
   professional credentials, including expenses for professional accreditation, State-imposed and
   professional licenses and professional certification; and 2) examinations to obtain such
   credentials. This authority may not be exercised on behalf of any employee occupying or
   seeking to qualify for appointment to any position that is excepted from the competitive
   service because of the confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy advocating
   character of the position. This authority is permissive, not mandatory. It does NOT
   establish an entitlement. Because of the financial impact this authority may have on the DoD,
   OSD has decided that they will issue implementation guidance for the Services‘ exercise of
   this authority.
       4.60.1.1. HQ USAF/DP 28 March 2003 ALL MAJCOM-FOA-DRU/CV Memorandum
       provided Air Force policy on payment of expenses to obtain professional credentials.
       Because the authority is codified in Title 5 U.S.C., Government Organization and
       Employees, this authority is applicable to civilian employees only and not to military
       members.
       4.60.1.2. The use of appropriated funds to pay expenses to obtain professional
       credentials does not extend to employees‘ memberships in professional organizations
       unless the membership is a prerequisite to obtaining the professional license of
       certification (see Comp Gen Decision B-302548, 20 August 2004).
4.61. Service Contracts Crossing Fiscal Years. The FY 98 National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) (P.L. 105-85) (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 2410A) allows ―for procurement of severable
services for a period that begins in one fiscal year and ends in the next fiscal year if (without
regard to any option to extend the period of the contract) the contract period does not exceed one
year.‖ The total cost of the services to be provided over the 12- month period must be reflected
in the contract and that amount must be obligated when the contract is signed. The FY 2004
NDAA (P.L. 108-136), Section 1005 further amended 10 U.S.C. 2410A. In addition to
authorizing severable service contracts for a 12-month period crossing fiscal years, it now
authorizes 12-month contracts crossing fiscal years for leasing of ―real or personal property,
including maintenance of such property when contracted for as part of the lease agreement.‖
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     77


4.62. Air Navigation and Overflight Fees. It is U.S. Government (USG) policy not to pay
inappropriate charges against military aircraft, which include air navigation, terminal navigation
or overflight fees.
   4.62.1. Air navigation and overflight fees are chargeable only in the few exceptional cases
   where the USG has negotiated a treaty or other agreement with a foreign government or
   federation that authorizes the payment of these fees. This is rare, and the only such
   agreement at the time of printing is the New START Treaty (authorizing payment of air
   navigation fees for certain New START Treaty inspection flights).
   4.62.2. If an aircrew is asked to pay inappropriate charges, they must follow the procedures
   in the DoD Foreign Clearance Manual, Chapter 2, Paragraph C2.2.7, available at
   https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil. If local authorities will not let the aircraft depart without
   payment, the procedures described in the DoD Foreign Clearance Manual include marking
   inappropriate charges on the receipt or bill as ―INVALID FEES‖ and annotating the receipt
   or bill with the remark ―PAID UNDER PROTEST.‖ The aircraft‘s home station fund
   citation will be charged for this purpose.
4.63. Landing and Parking Fees. It is USG policy not to pay inappropriate charges against
military aircraft, which include landing or parking charges at any government airport. Air Force
aircraft squadrons/flying units may pay landing and parking fees at foreign airports which have
been deemed to be ―commercial‖ in accordance with USG policy, if required to do so. USG also
pays reasonable charges for services requested and received, whether at governmental or non-
governmental airports. Aircraft landing in a country where a bilateral or multilateral agreement
addressing such fees exists will be governed by the terms of that agreement. If local authorities
will not let the aircraft depart without payment, the aircrew will mark inappropriate charges on
the receipt or bill as ―INVALID FEES‖ and annotate the receipt or bill with the remark ―PAID
UNDER PROTEST.‖ The aircraft‘s home station fund citation will be charged for this purpose.
4.64. Funding for Athletic Supplies and Fitness Equipment. Per AFI 34-204, Property
Management, Paragraph 2.4.5., unit level physical fitness equipment is authorized under certain
conditions. The appropriate Services/Group Commander must approve the use of organizational
funds to procure fitness equipment (FSC 7830). Written justification must be provided to the
commander when an organization requests such approval. For ordering and inventory guidance,
review AFI 34-204, Paragraph 2.4.5. Organizations may now use the GPC card to procure
organizational intramural sports uniforms. The uniforms may not be personalized with individual
names or nicknames and are to be returned to the unit following the season or when the member
PCSs. Units whose operations are funded solely with working capital funds are prohibited from
using such funds to procure MWR equipment such as intramural uniforms and fitness equipment.
These units should continue to use Services sports uniform loan program and utilize equipment
provided at the base fitness center. Examples of such units are those at AMC aerial ports i.e.,
Dover, McGuire, Travis, McChord, and Charleston AFBs, which are funded with Transportation
Working Capital Funds (TWCF). (NOTE: Local funds are not authorized for purchase of PT
Uniforms. Additional information on the Physical Training Uniform (PTU) and Improved
Physical Training Uniform (IPTU) Wear Policy is available on the Air Force Portal, under
AF/A1SO, Uniforms and Recognition Branch, and also within AFI 36-2903).
4.65. Real Property Damage Recovery. The FY 96 Authorization Act (P.L. 104-106) Section
2821 (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 2782) authorizes amounts recovered for damage to real property
 78                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


(excluding MFH) to be credited to the accounts for which costs of repair or replacement may be
paid at the time the recovery is received. However, the law provides that amounts recovered
from such damage are not available for obligation and expenditure unless provided in advance in
an Appropriations Act. Do not use funds collected for real property damages to finance any
repairs unless provided for in an Appropriations Act. Real property includes land improvements
(e.g., road and curbing), buildings and permanently attached equipment (e.g., truck scale),
structures (small buildings and entrance facilities), and appurtenances (signs and fences).
4.66. Undefinitized Contractual Actions (UCA). These are also referred to as ―unpriced
orders‖ and ―letter contracts.‖ When an annual appropriation or a multi-year appropriation in the
last year of availability is used to execute one of these types of contractual actions and
definitization occurs in the following fiscal year, the amount being definitized becomes a bona
fide need of the (annual appropriation) or a (multi-year appropriation) fiscal year current at the
time of definitization (Comp Gen Decision B-197274, Sept. 23, 1983). Under the Federal
Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, no more than 50% of the overall ceiling price on these
types of contracts may be obligated. Any amount of that 50% of the ceiling price, which is not
obligated in the fiscal year the letter contract is signed, becomes part of the definitization amount
in the current fiscal year. Current waivers to DFARS 217.7404-3 and 217.7404-4 can be found
in AFFARS, Mandatory Procedures (MP) 5317.7404-3.
4.67. U.S. Flag for Active Duty Military Retirees. The FY 99 Authorization Act (P.L. 105-
261), Section 644 (c) (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 8681) directs that ―upon release of a member of the
Air Force from active duty for retirement, the Secretary of the Air Force shall present a United
States flag to the member.‖ As stated in the statute, ―The presentation of a flag under this section
shall be at no cost to the recipient.‖ The flag will, in fact, be presented by the organization from
which the individual is retiring and not the SECAF. The flag will be funded from the
installation‘s O&M-type account. Obtaining flags flown over the U.S. Capital for presentation at
retirement are eligible for funding from O&M. The use of appropriated funds to procure a
display box for a retirement flag is not authorized by this statute. The statute prohibits multiple
presentations of flags (see 10 U.S.C. 8681). (NOTE: Civilian employees of the Military
Departments are not authorized to receive Government-funded U.S. Flags or any other type of
Government-funded flag at retirement. The only exception is that members of the Senior
Executive Service (SES) may, upon retirement or separation, be awarded their SES Flag.)
   4.67.1. U. S. Flag for Reserve Component Retirees. The FY 2000 Authorization Act (P.L.
   106-65), Section 652 (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 12605) directs that ―(A) Upon the transfer from
   an active status or discharge of a reserve who has completed the years of service required for
   eligibility for retired pay under Chapter 1223 of this title [10 U.S.C.], the Secretary
   concerned shall present a United States flag to the member.‖ The same information in
   paragraph 4.61 above applies, except Reserve (3740) or ANG (3840) O&M funds will be
   used for procuring the U.S. Flag and 10 U.S.C. 12605 should be reviewed for prohibition on
   multiple presentations.
   4.67.2. Joint Organizations. Air Force O&M funds will be used to procure flags for
   retiring military members, without regard to Service affiliation, in Joint Organizations for
   which the Air Force is Executive Agent, i.e. CENTCOM.
   4.67.3. Printing of Invitations and Programs for Military and Civilian Retirements and
   Promotions. In recognition of technology advances, OSD(DA&M) 28 Aug 98 Policy
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                        79


   Memorandum authorized the printing of business cards using personal computers, existing
   software, and agency-purchased card stock for official communications. For the same reason,
   that authority is extended to the printing of invitations and programs for retirement
   ceremonies. APFs are not authorized for the commercial printing, including DAPS, of
   invitations and programs for military and civilian retirements.
4.68. Memorials and Monuments. Absent specific statutory authority, appropriated funds are
not available to fund the construction of memorials or monuments. The construction of
memorials in Washington, DC is funded through private donations, e.g. the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, the World War II Memorial, the Air Force Memorial, the Navy Memorial, etc. The
Federal Government donates the land and private funds construct the memorial. Once
constructed, federal funds are used to maintain the memorials. See AFI 36-3108,
Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.
4.69. Cable TV in Dormitories. Appropriated funds are not authorized for procuring television
sets for or funding Cable TV subscription charges in individual rooms or suites in dormitories.
They are a personal expense. (EXCEPTION: Beginning in FY 03, OSD has authorized
appropriated funds (PBD 205, 10 Dec 01) to provide all on-base USAFE personnel access to the
cable television services of AFRTS for command & control and force protection purposes). APF
may be used to fund cable TV for day or community rooms utilized by all dorm occupants, as
well as, various gaming items found in the recreation area of a home such as a billiard table,
foosball table, VCR, video games, DVD player, etc. It is essential that internal controls are
present to avoid loss of these items through theft. Reference coordinated SAF/FMB/A6P/A6O
and AF/A1S/A7C memorandum ―Internet Access in Dormitories‖ dated 21 Mar 2012 for
additional guidance.
4.70. Heart Link Program. CSAF May 30, 2002 memorandum, SUBJECT: Implementation of
Heart Link Program established this program based on a determination of the Air Force
Community Action Information Board (CAIB) ―that a standardized Spouse Orientation Program
is critical to family preparedness and enhances mission readiness.‖ Among other things, as a part
of this program, each spouse will be presented with a standardized coin after completing the
Heart Link Program. The front of the coin will have the Heart Link logo and the back will have
the MAJCOM crest. The logo may be modified to reflect the MAJCOM mission.
4.71. Temporary Authority to Hire Contract Security Guards. Authority to hire civilian
contract security guards is provided in Public Law 107-314, Section 332. Contract authority is
granted ―for any increased performance of security-guard functions at a military installation or
facility under the jurisdiction of the Secretary undertaken in response to the terrorist attacks on
the United States on September 11, 2001, and may waive the prohibition under section 2465(a)
of title 10, United States Code, with respect to such contract‖ under the specific conditions
detailed in the NDAA section. This authority has been extended by P.L. 110-181 and shall
terminate 30 September 2012. The conditions pertaining to this authority are set out at DFARS
237.102-70.
4.72. Exemption of Certain Firefighting Contracts from Prohibition on Contracts for
Performance of Firefighting Functions. 10 U.S.C. 2465(b) paragraph 4 exempts ―a contract
for the performance of firefighting functions if the contract is for a period of one year or less and
covers only the performance of firefighting functions that in the absence of the contract, would
have to be performed by members of the armed forces who are not readily available to perform
 80                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


such functions by reason of a deployment.‖ The conditions pertaining to this authority are set
out in DFARS 237.102-70.

Section 4Q—Planning and Tracking Obligations and Outlays

4.73. Supplementing OSD Appropriations (97X) with O&M 3400 Funds. Per OUSD(C)
guidance, do not commingle OSD (97X) appropriations and O&M 3400 funds on a contract
when initiating the contract or to cover any cost increase on contracts funded with one or the
other appropriation. However, you may use O&M 3400 funds to support an OSD-funded
program for civilian pay, supplies, and other miscellaneous purchases that do not involve the
commingling of the two appropriations on one contract, as long as those OSD-funded program
efforts are the same as those for which O&M 3400 are or could be authorized, i.e. RAP and TAP
programs. This does not preclude the citing of the two appropriations on a service contract when
the use of the service is subject to a documented prorata cost sharing arrangement based on usage
of that service by organizations funded from the two appropriations.
4.74. Submitting Outlay Plans. OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 4, Section 135, Procedures For
Monitoring Federal Outlays, provides guidance on monitoring and submitting outlay plans Each
year, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (Program/Budget) requires
the services to develop a monthly outlay forecast plan for the upcoming fiscal year. HQ AFMC
provides a monthly plan for major weapon systems for the investment and RDT&E
appropriations per annual guidance from SAF/FMB. The monthly plan for all other
appropriations is prepared by SAF/FMB. SAF/FMB consolidates and submits the outlay plan for
all Air Force appropriations to the DoD Comptroller. SAF/FMB analyzes variances at the
weapon system/program element level and provides deviation reports to the DoD Comptroller
when requested.
4.75. Planning:
   4.75.1. In October each year, OUSD(C) requests obligation/outlay plans from the Services.
   These obligation/outlay plans are updated when an appropriation or supplemental bill is
   enacted and when the Omnibus Reprogramming is implemented. SAF/FMBMM tasks the
   SAF/FMB appropriations managers for obligation/outlay plans. SAF/FMB appropriation
   managers submit obligation/outlay plans via excel spreadsheet to SAF/FMBMM.
   SAF/FMBMM will post obligation/outlay plans for Operation & Maintenance, Military
   Personnel, Procurement and RDT&E appropriations on the OSD Executive Dashboard no
   later than 10 days following the enactment of the appropriations bill and implementation of
   the Omnibus. SAF/FMB appropriation managers in SAF/FMBI and SAF/FMBO task
   MAJCOMs as needed for information required for the obligation/outlay plans. SAF/FMB
   reviews and adjusts the appropriation and program year monthly distributions as needed.
4.76. Tracking. DoD compares execution data against the plans as follows:
   4.76.1. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Centers submit summary
   flash execution data to OSD. DFAS provides outlay data on the eighth workday following
   the end of the month. Once OSD produces outlay tracking reports, the Air Force provides
   variance analyses by weapon system within 24 hours. Currently, Air Force Materiel
   Command provides detailed variance analyses on the 10th workday to meet the OSD
   suspense.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                             81


  4.76.2. DFAS submits execution data for outlays under RCS: SAF-FMB(M)7131, Update
  Obligation/Outlay Tracking System, in order to update the Outlay Tracking System on the
  10th workday of each month. The Air Force uses this information to identify shortages or
  overages by weapons system or program element within the appropriations. The RCS: SAF-
  FMB(M)7131 report has been designated emergency status code C3. Continue reporting
  during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed,
  but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Submit by
  nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue electronic reporting during MINIMIZE.
  4.76.3. SAF/FMBMM provides monthly status by appropriation that gives variances from
  plan, along with written rationale for significant variances over or under plan by
  appropriation.
 82                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


                                           Chapter 5

                APPROPRIATION REIMBURSEMENTS AND REFUNDS

Section 5A—Appropriation Reimbursements

5.1. General Reimbursement Guidance:
   5.1.1. The appropriation reimbursement concept avoids duplicating services, facilities,
   personnel, and stocks of supplies and materiel, and requires the agency requesting these
   services or supplies to budget for the cost and to defend its requirements to the President and
   the Congress.
   5.1.2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) includes anticipated appropriation
   reimbursements as part of approved apportionments. SAF/FMB transmits this funding
   authority to the commands (except for procurement appropriations, see paragraph 5.4.2.1),
   in addition to, and separate from, funds appropriated exclusively for Air Force mission
   requirements.
   5.1.3. MAJCOMs will not allot anticipated reimbursements unless they have reasonable
   assurance that the reimbursements will be collected. Even when reimbursements are
   apportioned and allotted, these estimates do not become budgetary resources available for
   obligation unless you have valid orders (including written agreements), have furnished goods
   or services and there is entitlement, or in the case of orders from the public (that is, financed
   by other than federal government sources), the requester has made advance payment.
   EXCEPTION: in the case of the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply, under
   the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), 10 U.S.C. 2210(b) authorizes, with OMB
   approval, incurring obligations against anticipated reimbursements.
   5.1.4. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) orders convey obligation authority, but do not disburse
   until cash is transferred from the FMS Trust Fund to the performing appropriation account or
   the holder of the FMS Trust provides an expenditure authorization. Therefore, except as
   provided above, funding based on anticipated reimbursements is available only to the extent
   you actually realize reimbursements. Do not anticipate conversion from your approved
   reimbursement programs to direct obligation authority.
   5.1.5. Financial Management and Comptroller offices will credit reimbursements to
   appropriations based on the type of work done. Finance reimbursements from appropriations
   that fund similar direct program requirements. For example, Research Development Testing
   and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation finances reimbursable RDT&E efforts.
   5.1.6. DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A lists the types of costs that are reimbursable and
   the amounts to recoup when DoD components do work or sell property within the
   Department of Defense, to other U.S. Government agencies, and to private parties when
   allowed by legal authority.
5.2. Responsibilities for Developing Anticipated Reimbursements:
   5.2.1. The Air Force supplying or performing activity must include estimated anticipated
   reimbursements to be realized from sale of supplies and services in their budget estimates
   and execution plans. Based on this, SAF/FMB will develop Air Force-wide budget estimates
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     83


   and apportionment requests. SAF/FMB estimates reimbursements for centrally administered
   programs and for centrally procured materiel based on departmental agreements and financial
   data available. SAF/FMB asks supplying or performing activities for supporting data and
   backup exhibits as required (such as computation sheets or additional listings). SAF/FMB
   will budget for military construction reimbursements based on the historical level of effort or
   substantiated documentation changing that level from the Program Manager‘s management.
   5.2.2. Operating agencies must inform SAF/FMB of changes in estimates of anticipated
   reimbursements and identify the changes by category and sales code. Request you provide
   these changes as soon as they are known so adjustments may be made during the Air Force
   budget submission to reduce disconnects in the year of execution.
5.3. Responsibilities for Earning Anticipated Reimbursable Programs. Budget officers and
appropriate functional area staff agency heads, such as Civil Engineer and Transportation, must
act jointly to review reimbursement programs to make sure these programs are proceeding as
planned. Consider all programs where reimbursements are anticipated, including programmed
support for materiel and services identified in support agreements for intraservice, interservice,
and non-DoD activities.
   5.3.1. Responsibility for Establishing Reimbursement Receivables for Earned
   Reimbursements. MAJCOM and installation Financial Management and Comptroller
   offices must provide their operating location Defense Accounting office (Field Organization)
   with appropriate billing information to establish reimbursement receivables. This is
   necessary to ensure accurate and timely billing of earned reimbursements. All reimbursement
   receivable balances must be validated during quarterly and year-end certifications.
5.4. Funding Procedures and Application. In developing the execution plan, SAF/FMB will
include anticipated reimbursements based on estimated customer orders to be received in the
total amount planned to be available for obligation. Appropriation managers distribute planned
obligations between those for ―service account‖ (Air Force) and those for ―customer account‖
(reimbursable). This plan will be the basis for the initial apportionment request and for funding
to commands.
   5.4.1. Annual Appropriations. MAJCOM and installation Financial Management and
   Comptroller offices and Financial Services Officers (FSO) will initially account for
   reimbursable orders under the appropriation available for obligation when they accept the
   order. But, if you have not filled the order and have not set up the related reimbursable
   obligation before the appropriation expires, the FSO/FMA must move the unfilled order to
   the next fiscal year‘s appropriation on or before 30 September (see DFAS-DE 7220.1-R). See
   paragraph 5.8.2 for statutory restrictions on Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535).
       5.4.1.1. All Annual Appropriations Except Operation and Maintenance, Air Force,
       (O&M) and Military Personnel, Air Force. Appropriation managers issue budget
       authorizations, including financing for customers‘ orders for goods or services, at
       program level and specify the amounts for ―service account‖ and for ―customers‘ orders‖.
       Use sales codes to identify reimbursable customers.
       5.4.1.2. Automatic Apportionment for O&M Reimbursements: The Office of
       Management and Budget (OMB) authorizes using automatic apportionment of
       reimbursements for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M), AF appropriation (57*3400,
84                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


     Fund Code 30) and AFRC O&M appropriation (57*3740, Fund Code 54). SAF/FMBO
     may automatically increase the OMB apportionment up to the planned amount of
     anticipated reimbursements expected to be received during the current year of execution
     at the departmental level. In addition, during the year of execution, SAF/FMBO
     automatically apportions and issues all reimbursement authority to MAJCOM/FOAs FM
     offices. The field level budget offices load reimbursements as they are earned. (No target
     is given to the MAJCOM or base budget office).
     5.4.1.3. This paragraph intentionally left blank.
     5.4.1.4. Family Housing Appropriation 57*0745 (Fund Code 3Y, O&M). Deposit
     proceeds from renting family housing and reimbursements received for family housing
     services to the family housing account. Apply proceeds from sales of designated excess
     military family housing to the Military Family housing Operations and Maintenance
     (O&M) Account 57X0745 (Refer to Chapter 21 for additional information).
  5.4.2. Multiple-year Appropriations. For multiple-year appropriations whose periods of
  availability for obligation overlap, apply new reimbursable orders and related transactions
  only to the most current account available during the period the orders were accepted. In
  other words, do not accept new orders in a multiple-year appropriation account after its first
  year of availability. Performing activities that are accounting for customer orders funded by
  multiple year appropriations shall retain the unearned and unobligated balances of valid
  unfilled reimbursable orders with the unexpired appropriation current at the time the
  customer order was accepted. However, FM offices and FSOs must take action at fiscal
  yearend for expiring accounts to move unfilled orders for which reimbursable obligations
  have not been established to the ensuing current fiscal year appropriation account (see
  DFAS-DE 7220.1-R Paragraph C2.5) and eliminate anticipated reimbursements (authorized
  reimbursable budget program), which are nullified at fiscal yearend, to the extent they have
  not been realized.
     5.4.2.1. Procurement Appropriations:
         5.4.2.1.1. Budget authorizations include financing for procurement of customer
         orders or security assistance sales, grant aid, etc., and are available only to the extent
         you receive valid customer orders. This procedure assumes firm customer orders and
         customer reimbursement at time of delivery. For customer orders from the public,
         state, and local governments, DoD requires payment in advance before using Air
         Force funds provided for financing customer orders.
         5.4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs must provide SAF/FMB, before the fiscal year begins the total
         annual amount of estimated anticipated reimbursements (other than FMS) by
         appropriation and sales code. MAJCOMs must report anticipated reimbursements in
         the Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801 report.
         MAJCOMs must also report the status of the total customer program to the degree
         that orders are received and deliveries are reported. Anticipated reimbursements
         reported by MAJCOM:
             5.4.2.1.2.1. For the current appropriation year are identified by accounts
             receivable sales code, and must equal the sum of filled and reported orders to
             agree with the Air Force program at departmental level. SAF/FMB or MAJCOMs
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       85


             may make changes to the anticipated program during the operating year.
             5.4.2.1.2.2. For each unexpired prior-year appropriation must show the most
             recent 30 September certified status, as adjusted by the operating agency for
             actual customer order adjustments during the current year. When there have been
             significant customer order adjustments to prior-year programs, MAJCOMs will
             advise SAF/FMB of the reason for such adjustment.
             5.4.2.1.2.3. Table 5.1 explains how to charge and credit the procurement
             appropriations for the purchase or sale of investment items to fill customer orders.

                                                                       appn
       5.4.2.2. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) Appropriation:
          5.4.2.2.1. SAF/FMB, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and Air Force Space
          Command (AFSPC) are responsible for reporting anticipated reimbursements to
          DFAS on the monthly status of reimbursements for the RDT&E appropriation.
          Anticipated reimbursements reported for the current year must equal the budget
          authorization provided and identified by sales code as shown in the FM Data Quality
          Service (DQS). Anticipated reimbursements reported for each unexpired prior year
          appropriation are equal to the sum of actual filled and unfilled orders. Adjust unfilled
          orders reported to show the actual customer order adjustments during the fiscal year.
          SAF/FMB adjusts the budget authorization for RDT&E reimbursable accounts
          annually by providing adjustments to equal the sum of the unfilled and earned
          amounts in the respective Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS: SAF-
          FM(M)7801 report.
          5.4.2.2.2. AFMC and AFSPC use RDT&E to finance its installations that perform
          development and test functions. These activities do work such as testing and
          engineering support at the request of other Air Force commands or other government
          agencies on a reimbursable basis. The requesting organization will reimburse the
          RDT&E operating funds of the performing AFMC installation for direct costs of
          supplies, civilian overtime, related TDY, etc. (see Chapter 7, Section 7I). At least
          quarterly, AFMC will review and recommend appropriate adjustments to the
          estimated reimbursable amounts based on written agreements with other
          organizations for test and engineering support.
          5.4.2.2.3. FM and FSO offices account for amendments to prior-year orders in the
          appropriation year in which the customer amendment is accepted (and obligated) by
          the performing agency.
       5.4.2.3. Construction Appropriations. Appropriation managers issue budget
       authorizations at the Budget Authorization Account Number (BAAN) level for P-354.
       This document indicates the amount for ―service account‖ and for ―customers‘ orders.‖
    5.4.3. Centralized Reimbursements:
       5.4.3.1. Redistribution and Marketing (R&M) and Forest Management (DoD FMR
       7000. 14-R, Volume 11A, Chapters 7 and 16). HQ USAF centrally administers these
       programs. DFAS does central accounting. Deposit proceeds collected from selling forest
       products to 57F3875.000*. (Note: asterisk represents current fiscal year.) Commands
       (except Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)) receive funds for these programs as part
       of the direct authority furnished in their operating budget authority.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     87


          5.4.3.1.1. SAF/FMB will separately identify the amount of the authority issued to
          each command in the remarks section of their operating budget authority document.
          5.4.3.1.2. DFAS will centrally make reimbursable reports for this activity.
          5.4.3.1.3. SAF/FMB will advise DFAS of the total anticipated reimbursements
          estimated to be realized from these programs each year.
          5.4.3.1.4. Commands operating under appropriation 57*3400 and 57*3740 will
          identify these obligations in their Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS:
          SAF-FM(M)7801report under the functional category code and special RC/CC codes
          provided in DFAS-DER 7000.1.
      5.4.3.2. Freight Loss or Damage. Credit reimbursements from carriers to the
      appropriation from which you will replace the lost or damaged property (see Public Law
      97-258 and 10 U.S.C. 2636)). Under a working agreement, DFAS-IN credits all such
      collections that pertain to general fund appropriations as reimbursements (on a pro rata
      basis) to the central procurement appropriations. DFAS-IN credits reimbursements to
      other than general fund accounts (stock and industrial funds) to the applicable account
      and transmits them to the accountable station.
      5.4.3.3. Classified Projects. SAF/FMB processes reimbursements for certain classified
      projects.
      5.4.3.4. FMS Training. The Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT)
      organization (Randolph AFB, TX) centrally manages O&M reimbursements for
      specialized FMS training performed at the MAJCOMs. Specific pricing guidance is in
      DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 15, and Appendix E of Volume 15.
   5.4.4. Military Personnel Appropriation:
      5.4.4.1. DoD usually requires reimbursement for labor and permanent change of station
      (PCS) when DoD provides military personnel services to non-DoD federal and non-
      federal customers. However, do not require reimbursement when other agencies provide
      the services for DoD‘s benefit, per AFI 36-2114 and departmental agreements.
      5.4.4.2. The Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) charges DWCF customers for
      military personnel labor expenses incurred by the DWCF business areas in supporting
      customer orders except for the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), which
      does not budget, reimburse, or include MILPERS costs in its tariff rates. The DWCF
      reimburses these amounts to the Military Personnel appropriation at the Activity level.
      See Chapter 18.
      5.4.4.3. The DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations, Policy and
      Procedures, provides additional guidance on reimbursing Military Personnel services.
5.5. Billing and Collecting Small Amounts:
   5.5.1. When an appropriated fund activity is the performer and the amount to be billed
   within the same DoD Component or to another DoD Component is less than $1,000, the
   billing may be suspended by the billing organization until the end of the fiscal year, or until
   the total billed exceeds $1,000. However, no later than the end of the fiscal year, all
 88                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   suspended amounts must be billed even though the amount to be billed is less than $1,000.
   (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 3, Paragraph 030503. B.)
   5.5.2. Working capital funds, the Corps of Engineers Civil Works Revolving Fund, and any
   other DoD revolving fund may not waive reimbursement of any amount. This does not
   preclude identification of a central payment office by a DoD Component to pay small bills.
   (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 3, Paragraph 030503.A.
5.6. Reporting Instructions:
   5.6.1. See basic reporting instructions in DFAS-DE 7010.1-R (for installation level) and
   DFAS-DE 7220.3-R (for command level).
   5.6.2. See DFAS-DE 7220.1-R for 30 September certification. It gives special guidance for
   moving unfilled customer orders to the next fiscal year.
5.7. Statutory Authorities. Attachment 1 (Public Laws) to this AFI shows statutory
authorities for appropriation reimbursements commonly used in DoD.
5.8. Obtaining Materiel, Work, or Services from Others. The preceding paragraphs relate
mainly to selling materiel, work, or services to others on a reimbursable basis. However, the Air
Force also purchases materiel, work, or services from other agencies. Usually, you will use one
of the following techniques and legal authorities:
   5.8.1. Project Orders (41 U. S.C. 23). Project Orders are requests to manufacture materiel,
   supplies, and equipment or other work or services placed with and accepted by a
   government-owned and -operated (GOGO) establishment within the DoD that meets the
   criteria in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 2. It is essential that you are aware of
   those types of efforts, listed in the DoD FMR, which may not be funded using a Project
   Order. Per DoD FMR 7000.14-R, apply this guidance regardless of what form you use
   (including DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)), to
   request the materiel, work, or services. The organization or activity receiving a project order
   must be capable of manufacturing the goods or supplying the services requested on the order
   and not simply be a conduit or middleman for funds being used to procure the goods or
   services. For more information on the use of MIPRs see AFI 65-116 ―Air Force Purchases
   Using Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRS)” Project Orders are
   authorized by 41 U.S.C. 23. They are not subject to the Economy Act. That is, obligations on
   project orders remain valid until expended or the funds cited are canceled. Comp Gen
   Decision B-246773 states that Project Orders are to be used only within the DoD. Issue
   project orders only on a reimbursable basis. Use the Project Order Form (AF Form 185)
   when executing orders subject to 41 U.S.C. 23. If the AF Form 185 is not available when a
   project order must be executed, the MIPR -(DD Form 448) may be used to establish a
   project order. All project orders must include the following statement on the form: "this
   order is placed per 41 U.S.C. 23 and DoD FMR 7000.14-R. It is not subject to the
   Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535).‖
       5.8.1.1. Make sure that the orders are true project orders as defined in DoD FMR
       7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 2. Do not issue intrafund project orders that you know
       will not be started by FY-end. If the dollar amount at FY-end is large, consider canceling
       the orders to preclude any inference that you are using project orders to extend the life of
       the appropriation (―parking funds‖).
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   89


   5.8.2. Economy Act Orders (31 U. S.C. 1535) (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A,
   Chapter 3) (DFAS-DE 7000.4-R). A DoD component may place requests for materiel,
   work, or services with another DoD component or another government agency under the
   Economy Act. 31 U.S.C. 1535 requires ordering agencies to reduce obligations recorded on
   the books against these reimbursable orders at the end of the period for which the
   appropriation is authorized for obligation to the extent that the agency ordered on has not
   incurred obligations under that order. This statutory restriction applies only to Economy Act
   orders, which excludes FMS and grant aid orders.
   5.8.3. Orders for Procurement by Another DoD Component (10 U. S.C. 2309). These
   are requests (MIPRs or other authorized purchase requests; also see 31 U.S.C. 1535) for
   materiel, supplies, or equipment placed with another DoD component that has single service
   procurement assignment or procurement responsibilities, pursuant to an agreement
   authorized under Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Subpart 208.70.
   5.8.4. Orders From Stock for Supplies, Materiel, or Equipment Placed on Another DoD
   Component.
   5.8.5. Orders Required by Law To Be Placed With a Government Agency. For
   example: Federal Prison Industries (18 U.S.C. 4124); Government Printing Office (44 U.S.C.
   501); Corps of Engineers (33 U.S.C. 576, 701b-10); and General Services Administration
   (Federal Supply Schedule).
5.9. Deobligation, Reimbursable Economy Act Orders (31 U. S.C. 1535). Only orders
placed under Section 601 of the Economy Act are subject to deobligation as prescribed by 31
U.S.C. 1535 and implemented by DFAS-DE 7000.4-R. All other orders remain on the
accounting records until liquidated, adjusted, or deobligated according to normal procedures.
Unless MIPRs are used as project orders, meet requirements of a project order and DD Form 448
contains the words ―this order is placed per 41 U.S.C. 23.‖ (Note: Per Comptroller General
Decision B-196404, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Orders (MIPR) are issued under the
Economy Act; thus the deobligation requirement applies to MIPRs.)
5.10. Security Assistance Program Reimbursements. See DFAS-IN/JAX [DFAS Security
Cooperation Accounting (SCA)] and DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume 15 for appropriation
reimbursement policies and procedures that apply to the Security Assistance Program, including
Foreign Military Sales (FMS), the Military Assistance Program (MAP), and the International
Military Education and Training (IMET) program.

Section 5B—Appropriation Refunds

5.11. Using Refunds. ―Refunds are returns of advances, collections for overpayments made,
adjustments for previous amounts disbursed, or recovery of erroneous disbursements from
appropriation or fund accounts that are directly related to, and are reductions of, previously
recorded payments from the accounts‖ (Comptroller General Decision B-257905, December 26,
1995). FM and FSO/FMA offices will treat these items (such as the recovery of a salary
overpayment or a return of the unused portion of a travel advance) as reductions of
disbursements; do not include them as reimbursements. Refunds also include credits to an
appropriation or fund account because of accounting adjustments relating to obligations or
disbursements where law or regulation allows this procedure. Credit refunds to the same
 90                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


appropriation or fund account to which you recorded the previously related expenditure. To the
extent practical, give refund vouchers the same detailed accounting classification cited on the
related expenditure voucher.

   subsequently returned for cancellation.
   5.12.10. Repayments against advances or loans made to contractors, and so forth.
   5.12.11. Amounts recovered as a result of price redetermination actions or other adjustments
   under contracts, including voluntary refunds by contractors.

   5.12.23. Recoveries collected from insurance companies, carriers, members, private parties,
   etc., pursuant to claims where the government has already paid the amount of the damage
   (For specifics on carrier recoveries see paragraph 10.68)
   5.12.24. Rebates received from approved banking institutions applicable to the Government
   Purchase Card (GPC) and Government Travel Card programs. Refunds attributable to use of
   the GPC may be credited to the appropriate accounts of the Department that are current
   when the refunds are received and that are available for the same purposes as the accounts
   originally charged and refunds attributable to the Government Travel Card may be credited
   to operation and maintenance accounts of the Department which are current when the
   refunds are received. The authority for crediting the current year in both cases is contained
   in recurring General Provisions of the annual Appropriations Act.
5.13. Refunds Receivable. To facilitate accrued expenditure and revenue accounting,
FSOs/FMAs recognize refunds in the account as soon as it has been determined that a refund is
due the United States government. FSO/FMAs account for a refund receivable (except
outstanding advances and prepayments) as a reduction of accrued expenditures rather than as
accrued revenue.
5.14. Disposing of Refunds. Because the FSO/FMA adjusts the amount of an obligation to
agree with the amount of the expenditure at the time final payment is recorded, any subsequent
adjustment of the expenditure amount will also affect the amount of the obligation. If refunds are
collected, therefore, the net effect is to increase the unobligated and unexpended balance.
Refunds that apply to:
   5.14.1. Current annual appropriations may be reobligated during that year.
   5.14.2. Multiple-year appropriations may be reobligated during the designated years
   identified by the multiple-year citation.
   5.14.3. Continuing appropriations are identified with the program year of the original
   expenditure and become available for obligational adjustment in that program year or for
   new obligations in the current year.
   5.14.4. Expired appropriations are available for obligational adjustments to the applicable
   expired account only.
   5.14.5. Canceled appropriations are deposited to Miscellaneous Receipts of the Treasury.
5.15. Other Refunds. FM and FSO/FMA offices may also treat the following types of
transactions as appropriation refunds in the interest of accounting and reporting simplicity:
   5.15.1. Accounting adjustments for temporary charges made to an appropriation that is
   subsequently charged to another appropriation or to funds of another agency (see OMB
   Circular A-34 and Public Law 89-473).
   5.15.2. Certain refunds pertaining to government bills of lading and transportation requests
   credited by the Transportation Division, DFAS-IN, to special refund accounts prescribed by
   AFMAN 65-604, rather than to the detailed accounting classifications originally charged.
   DFAS centrally administers these special refund accounts (see DFAS-DE 7010.1-R and
   DFAS-DE 7010.5-R).
 92                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   5.15.3. You may recoup utility connection charges through credits applied at a
   predetermined rate against billings submitted by the utility supplier (see AFI 32-1061,
   Providing Utilities to US Air Force Installations and DFAS-DE 7010.5-R).

Section 5C—Administrative and Accessorial Costs

5.16. Special Guidance. Apply this section and Figure 5.1 to determine and charge
administrative and accessorial expenses. Administrative costs include items such as fees for
copying, certifying, and searching records or other documents. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
Volume 11A, Chapter 1 (Addendum 1) and Chapter 4. Accessorial costs include costs related to
issuing, selling, shipping and transferring supplies, equipment, and other materiel to non-Air
Force activities. Do not use this guidance for the USAF Security Assistance Program (see
DFAS-IN/JAX [DFAS Security Assistance Accounting (SAA)] and DoD FMR 7000.14-R
Volume 15). See Figure 5.1 for accessorial descriptions and percentage rates.
   5.16.1. Accessorial expenses include packing, crating, transportation, and port
   loading/unloading. The Air Force may incur them for direct delivery of items from contractor
   facilities and items furnished from Air Force stocks. Vendors usually include accessorial
   expenses for direct delivery items in the items’ contract price. If the contractor separately
   bills for accessorial costs of direct delivery items, reimburse for them per these instructions.
   5.16.2. Do not charge other DoD components for accessorial costs. EXCEPTION: Charge
   DWCF or other working capital funds.
   5.16.3. Generally, credit reimbursements to the current operating agency and appropriation
   accounts in which the expenses were incurred, unless otherwise specified by law.
   5.16.4. Air Force activities will budget for projected reimbursable accessorial and
   administrative charges. See DFAS-DE 7010.5-R for billing procedures.
   5.16.5. Treat the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) the same as other DoD components for billing
   accessorial charges.
5.17. Charging Accessorial Costs. Use the guidance and rates in this paragraph and Figure 5.1
to determine charges for accessorial costs. Non-DoD agencies must reimburse the Air Force for
any part of the accessorial costs not included in the standard price of the item or paid directly
from funds cited by the buyer. Ensure that you do not duplicate accessorial charges financed by
direct citation of the customer agency‘s funds or included in the standard prices of reimbursable
issues.
   5.17.1. Charges for transportation costs not included in standard prices or financed from
   funds cited by the buyer are from point of shipment to the point at which consignee accepts
   delivery.
       5.17.1.1. Air Force DWCF (formerly stock fund) sales are at a standard price, which
       includes a surcharge for transportation, Distribution Depot, and Inventory Control Point
       expenses. See Table 18.1, Table 18.2 and Table 18.3 for TWCF transportation funding
       responsibilities (FDT and SDT). Customers or users pay this standard price to the
       applicable Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply, of the DWCF. If the Air
       Force supplier incurs any additional costs (second destination transportation, packing,
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      93


       crating, handling, etc.), bill such costs to the purchaser for reimbursement of the Air
       Force appropriation bearing such costs at either standard percentage or actual cost.
       5.17.1.2. Returns to the DWCF Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply
       divisions are creditable or non-creditable according to directives prescribing the returns.
       These DWCF credits may offset later billings for DWCF sales. Pay any accessorial costs
       (packing, crating, handling, overseas inland transportation) incurred for the creditable
       returns from the funds of the activity returning the materiel. If an Air Force appropriation
       pays accessorial costs, then the DWCF Division reimburses the Air Force appropriation
       and reduces the credit, if this is the most efficient and acceptable way of handling these
       costs. An alternative would be to have the DWCF Division give credit as usual, and have
       the appropriation bearing the expense collect directly from the activity returning the item.
       5.17.1.3. When you sell or transfer items procured locally to a non-DoD activity, include
       only the accessorial cost elements you actually incur.
       5.17.1.4. The FSO/FMA must add an accessorial charge when authorized non-DoD
       charge sale customers purchase items in overseas commissaries. The FSO/FMA collects
       the accessorial charge from the customer.
   5.17.2. USAF supply activities making shipments to non-USAF activities must ensure that
   they show correct coded shipping designators on shipping documents (or substitute media)
   covering overseas surface shipments as prescribed in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply
   Manual. To facilitate billing for shipments by the TWCF business area (formerly DBOF-T),
   transportation account codes must be reflected on all shipping documents.

 transportation rates; it is additive to overseas transportation.
 3. CONUS transportation.                                                  3.75

 5. Overseas inland transportation.                                        3.00
 6. Overseas port unloading and handling.                                  1.00
 7. Ocean transportation from CONUS to:
 Alaska, Hawaii, Europe, Latin America, and Mediterranean Ports            4.00
 Newfoundland, Labrador, Thule, Iceland, South America (east and           6.00
 west coast), Far East, African Ports (other than Mediterranean), and
 Near East.


 NOTES:

 1. Percentages are applicable to billing price of materiel shipped or inventory price of
 materiel issued without reimbursement. These rates will not be arbitrarily applied to the
 acquisition price of all items having a unit value of $10,000 or over. Instead, actual or
 estimated costs will be used when determination is made by the supplying agency that a lower
 and more equitable charge results.

 2. Source item packing is distinguished from cargo assembling, packing, and preservation,
 such as shipments placed in sea vans or trailer vans at ports of embarkation. These latter
 services are normally performed by the purchasing DoD Component. When such services are
 performed by the selling DoD Component, use actual or estimated costs as the basis for reim-
 bursement.

 3. Storage charges are billed to all non-DoD customers for customer owned materiel, which
 is held for 30 days or more. Storage charges are determined at the end of each 30-day period.
 A uniform DoD annual rate of .015 or .00125 percent monthly of the average value of
 customer-owned materiel is charged unless a commercial storage rate or actual cost is
 applicable.

5.18. Contract Cost Billings. When you let contracts as part of a reimbursable agreement, bill
the benefiting organization for costs incurred for awarding the contract.
   5.18.1. Bill the cost of Government-furnished materiel in addition to contract costs.
   5.18.2. When the contract is provided to meet the requirements of a non-Federal
   Government organization, the contractor must reimburse the Air Force a rental charge for the
   use of plant or production equipment the Air Force utilizes in manufacturing the item being
   sold.
   5.18.3. Bill contract administration charges to other Federal agencies and private parties at
   the hourly rate established by DoD Comptroller per statutory or guidance requirements. Do
   not bill these charges within a DoD component or to another DoD component.
   5.18.4. Bill non-DoD activities for DoD personnel services in support of contracts described
   above.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      95


                                           Chapter 6

                    EXPIRED AND CANCELED APPROPRIATIONS

6.1. Applying this Chapter. Follow this chapter in approving upward obligation adjustments
and in using current appropriations to fund payments and adjustments related to canceled
appropriations. The contract change rules for charging prior year funds for within-scope changes
became effective 8 April 1992. Do not make retroactive adjustments except as directed by
SAF/FMB.
6.2. Applying Changes in the Appropriation Life Cycle:
   6.2.1. Maintain fiscal year identity indefinitely for appropriations that had not transferred to
   the ―M‖ accounts as of 5 November 1990. DoD requires fiscal year identity to meet statutory
   requirements and line item detail to meet reporting requirements concerning the use of
   current appropriations. See paragraph 6.8 for related Antideficiency Act violations.
   6.2.2. Do not record obligations as hedges against future contingencies; these are not valid
   obligations. Financial Management and Comptroller (FM) and Financial Services Office
   (FSO) offices should rescind these obligations as part of certification procedures at the end of
   each fiscal year. See requirements for recording obligations in DFAS-DE 7000.4-R,
   Accounting for Obligations.
6.3. Determining Contract Changes and Upward Obligation Adjustments (UOA). (Title 31
U.S.C., Section 1553). It is the intent of Congress to monitor within-scope changes made by
government agencies to contracts funded in expired years and canceled appropriations.
   6.3.1. Under the law, the DoD Comptroller (OUSD(C)) must approve within-scope contract
   changes if:
       6.3.1.1. The change requires additional work by the contractor, and
       6.3.1.2. It may be financed with prior year funds, and
       6.3.1.3. The funds required for the program, project, or activity (PPA) exceed $4 million
       during a fiscal year (cumulative on the PPA throughout the fiscal year). OUSD(C) must
       notify the Congress of changes that exceed $25 million. (NOTE: OUSD(C) must review
       any adjustment to the PPA above the $4 million threshold including items under $100
       thousand.)
   6.3.2. Use paragraph 6.3 and the decision tree at Figure 6.1 to distinguish within-scope
   contract changes that may require reporting to Congress or USD(C) from other upward
   obligation adjustments. Figure 6.1 also includes a third category, changes in contract
   scope. (NOTE: Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553, states that the type of contract change you
   may charge to an expired account is ―a change to a contract under which the contractor is
   required to perform additional work. Such term does not include adjustments to pay claims or
   increases under an escalation clause.‖ The contract provides for these latter adjustments,
   which are not ―contract changes.‖ Charge such adjustments to the account cited on the
   original contract.)
       6.3.2.1. All upward obligation adjustments that are considered ordinary and within-scope
       contract changes and/or involve a canceled year account must be processed using the
96                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


     automated OARS (Obligation Adjustment Reporting system) program. SAF/FMBMM
     and SAF/FMBIC must review all UOAs for appropriations 0740 (Military Family
     Housing), 3300 (Military Construction), 0500 (Defense-Wide Construction, and 0103
     (BRAC 88) Budget Program 100 and 200. UOA requests in any amount for these
     appropriations must be submitted in OARS.
  6.3.3. Use the three categories mentioned in paragraph 6.3.2 (and related situations) and
  Figure 6.1 as tools for analyzing contract changes and other prior year obligation
  adjustments. The types of transactions in paragraph 6.3 are not all inclusive; they highlight
  areas common to most AF activities. Commands must review unique transactions in light of
  Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553, DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, applicable Comptroller General
  Decisions, the bona fide need rule, and this chapter. Title 31 U.S.C, Section 1553, does not
  alter the Comptroller General role. Document Comptroller General decisions in making
  determinations and recommendations for processes unique to your command. Also, use the
  bona fide need rule to evaluate all within scope and change in contract scope transactions.
  (See DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, Chapter 2, and GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law,
  Volume 1, Chapter 5, for more information concerning the bona fide need rule). SAF/FMB
  will evaluate all contract change and upward obligation adjustment requests in light of the
  bona fide need rule regardless of the requester‘s identified condition.
  6.3.4. If your request for a contract change or upward obligation adjustment contains more
  than one condition or action, you should separately identify each action in the OARS
  package to speed processing.
  6.3.5. Paragraphs 6. 4 and 6.5 address funding of the transaction; paragraph 6.6 covers
  approval procedures.
  6.3.6. Category One: Upward Obligation Adjustments are not contract changes as
  described in paragraph 6.3.2 and do not require DoD or Congressional review. Use current
  year funds if the funds from the related obligation have been canceled. See paragraphs 6.4
  and 6.5 for more funding guidance. The following types of transactions normally fall into
  this category:
     6.3.6.1. Award and incentive fees.
     6.3.6.2. Correcting administrative errors. Includes obligations properly recorded and
     then erroneously deobligated by contracting or a designated contracting representative;
     correcting procuring contracting officer (PCO) errors discovered after the contract is
     signed; and recording of payments made before the appropriation is closed but not
     recorded by the accountable station until after closure (in-transit).
     6.3.6.3. Correcting accounting errors. Includes an obligation that was properly
     recorded and then erroneously deobligated by accounting (accounting did not record a
     valid obligation); and establishing or maintaining erroneous accounts or refund
     receivables, whenever you require funding to cover approved accounts or refund
     receivable write-offs.
     6.3.6.4. Price inflation adjustments included in the original contract clause (economic
     and escalation price adjustments); labor wage redeterminations; and cost sharing per
     contract clause ratios.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      97


     6.3.6.5. Ratification Actions. These occur when an unauthorized officer or employee
     incurs an obligation, which becomes binding on the Air Force and is ratified under AF
     FAR Supplement 5301.602-3. This can occur when an employee knowingly allows a
     contractor to do work outside the contract‘s specifications without certifying fund
     availability and procurement authorization. Charge the appropriation and fiscal year that
     would have been charged had the obligation been valid from the beginning (DFAS-DE
     7000.4-R and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14).
     6.3.6.6. Foreign currency fluctuations (see paragraph 6.9).
     6.3.6.7. Claims. In most cases, FSOs/FMAs should obligate claims for meritorious
     claims (under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978) against the appropriation on the
     contract. But, FM offices must analyze each claim on its own merits to determine which
     funds to obligate to cover the Government‘s liability. In every case, consider applying the
     bona fide need rule to determine which appropriate fiscal year to charge funds against.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        6.3.6.7.1. If you pay a claim from the statutory Judgment Fund as a result of a
        decision by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or the United
        States Claims Court, charge the Air Force‘s reimbursement to the Judgment Fund to
        appropriations current on the date of the board‘s or court‘s decision. (DFAS-DE
        7000.4-R). Judgment Fund claims paid from current year funds are not counted
        against the 1% limitation for paying canceled bills with current year funds. Do not
        submit Judgment fund reimbursements involving current years through OARS, as this
        will cause an erroneous adjustment to the 1% limit.
        6.3.6.7.2. Under 10 U.S.C. 2863 and notwithstanding any other provision of law, you
        may pay meritorious contractor claims that arise under military construction or family
        housing contracts from any unobligated funds appropriated and available for these
        two kinds of projects. So, do not fund claims on construction projects, including
        O&M-funded minor construction projects, from the project amounts, and do not
        count these against statutory limits.
     6.3.6.8. Definitization of undefinitized contractual actions (UCA), such as letter
     contracts or unpriced orders, after the appropriation expires. (The term UCA includes any
     action entered into when final terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before
     work begins.) Continually update definitization schedules for all UCAs issued. UCAs are
     new contracts for which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon
     before performance is begun under the action. UCAs do not include within-scope
     contract modifications and do not apply to foreign military sales, purchases under
     $25,000, special access programs, or Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement
     contracts. Prior to amendment by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of
     1994, no more than fifty percent (50%) of the overall ceiling price could be expended
     prior to definitization. SAF/GCA has ruled that the original obligations incurred under
     the letter contracts are valid and properly chargeable to the original fiscal year. Therefore,
     all obligations made on letter contracts prior to the passage of the FASA of 1994 are valid
     obligations of the fiscal year in which the letter contracts were signed, as long as those
     obligations did not exceed the amount in the Limitation of Government Liability clause
     in the letter contracts. With the passage of the FASA of 1994, the Act restricted the
98                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


     amount that may be obligated at the time a letter contract is signed to 50% of the overall
     ceiling price. This virtually guarantees that there will be additional obligations at the time
     of definitization. If definitization takes place in a subsequent fiscal year, those
     additional obligations are chargeable to the appropriation current at the time of
     definitization, without regard to whether the current appropriation is a multiple or
     one-year appropriation.
     6.3.6.9. Provisioning Item Orders (PIO) price definitization. Some contracts contain
     options, which allow activities to issue provisioning orders for items such as spares,
     repair parts, or aerospace ground equipment. Record obligations at the time your
     organization issues the SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract, to
     the contractor. Charge price definitizations that require additional obligations to the same
     appropriation charged on the initial order provided the scope of the order does not
     change. PIOs that change scope or incorporate new Engineering Change Proposals (ECP)
     must be charged to appropriations current when the scope was changed or the ECP
     accepted.
     6.3.6.10. Contract overruns. Evaluate each transaction against the bona fide need rule
     to determine the proper fiscal year to charge, especially on contracts with multiple
     modifications over several fiscal years. If a contract modification has increased its scope
     and work on the additional effort results in an overrun, fund the overrun from
     appropriations available for obligation at the time of the contract modification, which
     increased the scope of the contract.
     6.3.6.11. Contract closeout costs. Evaluate each transaction against the bona fide need
     rule to determine the proper fiscal year to charge, especially on contracts with multiple
     modifications spanning several fiscal years. If a contract modification increased the scope
     of the contract and you need to fund closeout costs relating to work on the additional
     effort, fund these costs from appropriations available for obligation at the time of the
     contract modification which increased the scope of the contract.
     6.3.6.12. Incentive contracts funded from target to ceiling. If cost growth from target
     to ceiling results from following the contract‘s terms and conditions, fund with the same
     appropriation obligated on the contract. Some examples are: negotiation of final overhead
     rates, scrap and rework, and configuration updates.
     6.3.6.13. Contingency items (within the scope of the contract). Contract provisions
     may authorize the government to require more work on facilities, maintenance, repairs
     and parts, etc. Fund with the same appropriation used for the original obligation.
     6.3.6.14. Contract defaults resulting in reprocurement contract actions. If you
     require a reprocurement action that will result in a replacement contract, you may fund it
     from the same fiscal year funds as the related obligation if:
        6.3.6.14.1. The Air Force has a continuing bona fide need for the goods or services
        involved.
        6.3.6.14.2. The original contract was made in good faith.
        6.3.6.14.3. The original contract was terminated for default or for the convenience of
        the Government. If for the convenience of the Government, the termination was the
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                        99


         result of a court order, a determination by a contracting officer that the contract award
         was improper when there is explicit evidence that the award was erroneous, and when
         the determination is documented with appropriate findings of fact and of law, or a
         determination by other competent authority (e.g., the General Accounting Office or a
         Board of Contract Appeals) that the contract award was improper.
         6.3.6.14.4. The replacement contract is substantially of the same size and scope as
         the original contract; executed without undue delay after the original contract is
         terminated; awarded to a different contractor.
  6.3.7. Category Two: Within-Scope Contract Changes includes contract changes that
  you can charge to expired accounts and which the Air Force may have to submit to OUSD(C)
  and Congress for approval. For within-scope contract changes, use the same fiscal year
  funds as for the related obligation unless you cannot satisfy the bona fide need rule for the
  same year. Use current year funds if funds on the related obligation have been canceled and
  the account is closed. See paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 for more guidance. Examples of changes
  that are normally within-scope are:
     6.3.7.1. Any contract modification that requires the contractor to do more within-scope
     work.
     6.3.7.2. Increased costs because of differing site conditions.
     6.3.7.3. Engineering change proposals (ECP), Value Engineering Change Proposals
     (VECP), solicited or unsolicited, and Contract Change Proposals (CCP). Because these
     proposals may result in changes of contract scope, analyze each situation separately to
     determine the proper funds to cover the Government‘s liability.
     6.3.7.4. Change orders to cost reimbursement contracts with a limitation cost or
     limitation of funds clause that do not cause the contract ceiling to be exceeded and are
     otherwise based on antecedent liability shall be funded from the appropriation used to
     originally fund the contract.
     6.3.7.5. Change orders to cost reimbursement contracts with a limitation of cost or
     limitation of funds clause that cause the contract ceiling to be exceeded, and which are
     not based on antecedent liability, enforceable by the contractor, shall be charged to
     funds legally available when the contracting officer grants the discretionary increase.
  6.3.8. Category Three: Change in Contract Scope. When contract changes increase the
  contract‘s scope, fund the additional work from appropriations available for current
  obligation. The Air Force does not have to report these transactions to DoD or Congress
  under Title 31 U.S.C.. See paragraphs 6.4, 6.5 and DFAS-DE 7000.4-R for more funding
  guidance. Whether the contract scope has changed depends on the unique facts and
  circumstances of each situation; analyze each case separately to make this determination.
  Examples of situations which change the contract‘s scope are:
     6.3.8.1. Increases in quantities.
     6.3.8.2. Modifications of service contracts that increase deliverable services or reports.
     6.3.8.3. Increase to the number of hours to be worked.
 100                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       6.3.8.4. Extended periods of performance. But, determine the scope based on how the
       revised delivery schedule affects work on the contract. If the extension does not
       materially alter the contract‘s purpose and scope, any resultant increase in obligations
       (e.g., stretch-out of labor costs) remains a bona fide need to the prior year. Conversely,
       clearly new efforts (e.g., storage costs not contemplated in the contract) would potentially
       be beyond scope, current year costs. Make a final determination regarding within scope
       or beyond scope after evaluating the unique contractual circumstances.
       6.3.8.5. Changes to form, fit, or function of end items beyond the scope of the original
       specifications.
       6.3.8.6. Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Value Engineering Change Proposals
       (VECP), solicited or unsolicited, and Contract Change Proposals (CCP). Note that these
       situations may also be within scope contract changes.
   6.3.9. This chapter does not address funding procedures for contract options because they
   are not considered prior year transactions; you finance contract options when exercised.
   Follow this chapter‘s guidance on upward obligation adjustments when the funds related to
   the exercised option expire or are canceled.

 paragraph 6.3.7.5.)
 *Some situations may require the use of current year funding.

6.4. Using Current and Expired Appropriations.
   6.4.1. Using Current Appropriations:
      6.4.1.1. Pursuant to Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553, use current appropriations to finance
      payment of obligations and upward obligation adjustments against canceled account
      years. However, the Air Force may not use more than one-percent of each current
      appropriation over the appropriation‘s life to finance canceled obligations and upward
      obligation adjustments. See paragraph 6.5 for administering the one-percent limitation.
      The one-percent limitation is administered by SAF/FM and automatically tracked in
      OARS.
      6.4.1.2. You must use currently available appropriations for changes in contract scope.
      Follow applicable reprogramming procedures when the source of funds is from a
      different budget line than the requirement. See paragraph 6.14 for more reprogramming
      guidance.
   6.4.2. Using Expired Appropriations:
      6.4.2.1. After an appropriation expires, you may use the unobligated balance plus any
      deobligations to finance valid adjustments until the appropriation closes at the end of the
 102                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       fifth expired year. Do not use current year funds to finance adjustments applicable to
       expired years.
       6.4.2.2. Paying stations must be aware of accounts about to be closed. When the paying
       office receives a request for payment of an obligation, they must ensure the funds cited
       are available and the disbursement can be made before the account closes. Use current
       year funds if you can not pay before cancellation of the account.
          6.4.2.2.1. If the funds cited are from a closed appropriation, the paying office must
          request a new (current) fund citation from the accountable office before disbursement.
          Fund the payment of obligations against a closed appropriation from current
          appropriations made available by the accountable office.
          6.4.2.2.2. Do not authorize payment against an appropriation account which has been
          closed. That is a reportable violation of the Antideficiency Act under DoD FMR
          7000.14-R, Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act
          Violations.
          6.4.2.2.3. Except for the Military Construction and Family Housing Construction
          appropriations (3300 and 0740) and DoD appropriations (Treasury Index Code 97),
          MAJCOM/ FOA/ DRU comptrollers of the accountable office may approve using
          current funds to make these payments for amounts of $2,000,000 or less.
          SAF/FMBIC must review both 3300 and 0740 related transactions of $2,000,000 and
          under prior to action. Process transactions exceeding $2,000,000 according to
          paragraph 6.6. For within-scope contract changes and DoD appropriations, the
          MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptroller approval limit is for adjustments of $100,000 or
          less.
          6.4.2.2.4. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs must also comply with any restrictions
          incorporated in statute and on the most recent funding documents (including
          Congressional Special Interest restrictions). These limitations continue in effect
          following expiration of the appropriation.
   6.4.3. Operating Agency Responsibility. The operating agency to which the original funds
   were issued will provide sources of current appropriations for payments and upward
   adjustments relating to closed appropriations. If the operating agency responsible for the
   program has changed, e.g., the establishment of Air Force Special Operations Command, the
   operating agency currently responsible for the program must provide current appropriation
   sources.
6.5. Controlling Current Appropriation Limitations:
   6.5.1. Checking the Original Appropriation. Under the law, the total of current funds
   used to finance upward adjustments to canceled appropriations can not cause the total
   obligations and expenditures for the canceled appropriation to exceed the amount originally
   appropriated to it. This requirement applies to appropriations that expired at the end of FY 89
   and after.
   6.5.2. Complying With the One-Percent Limitation. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553,
   permits DoD activities to use current appropriations to fund canceled obligations where
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   103


  payment is imminent in the current fiscal year. The law limits this authority to one-percent of
  each current appropriation during that appropriation‘s life.
     6.5.2.1. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will footnote the one-percent
     limitation on Air Force apportionment documents. However, OMB, DoD, and the Air
     Force will not withhold funds based on this footnote. Generally, MAJCOMs should not
     withhold funds either. It is mandatory that all upward obligation adjustments for canceled
     year bills be recorded in the Obligation Adjustment Reporting System (OARS),
     regardless of dollar amount. OARS automatically tracks the one-percent limitation.
     6.5.2.2. SAF/FMBMM will not issue to the field a limitation related to payments or
     upward obligation adjustments exceeding $2,000,000. Approval thresholds for payments
     and upward obligation adjustments have been established in OARS.
     6.5.2.3. While the one-percent limitation is a ceiling, SAF/FMB does not withhold
     funding. You must provide funding sources when it requires current appropriations to
     fund obligations related to canceled accounts for which payment is imminent. Consult
     with the SAF/FMB appropriation manager when funding is unavailable at the
     MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.
     6.5.2.4. These ceilings are limitations subject to the Antideficiency Act. Report
     violations under DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14.
     6.5.2.5. Use ESP Code ZC when you obligate current year appropriations to fund
     canceled account obligations and expenditures.
     6.5.2.6. Any canceled year adjustment request which cumulatively reduces the current
     year availability of a procurement or RDT&E BPAC by 50 percent or more of the
     originally enacted amount (adjusted for reprogramming, transfers in/out, supplementals
     and rescissions) must be forwarded to SAF/FMBMM for prior approval. This includes all
     proposed adjustments, including those under $100,000 which would cumulatively exceed
     this threshold. OARS will automatically track this level.
  6.5.3. Approving Upward Adjustments and Contract Changes:
     6.5.3.1. For other than the 0740 and 3300 appropriations, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
     comptrollers will approve using current year funds to cover canceled account
     requirements and contract changes that are for no more than $2,000,000 (except for
     within scope contract changes and DoD appropriation adjustments for which the
     limitation is no more than $100,000). Contact SAF/FMBMM and/or SAF/FMB
     Appropriation Managers to obtain most current threshold limitations for canceled to
     current year transactions. MAJCOMs may re-delegate approval below the command
     level, but their procedures must clearly identify and periodically review such adjustments
     at MAJCOM level. See paragraph 6.6.2 for reporting requirements.
     6.5.3.2. For the Military Construction and Military Family Housing appropriations (3300
     and 0740), SAF/ FMBIC must approve all upward adjustments of $100,000 and below.
     For upward obligation adjustments over $100,000 in these accounts, follow procedures in
     paragraph 6.6
     6.5.3.3. SAF/FMBMM will retain Air Force approval authority for using current
     appropriations to fund:
 104                                                        AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


          6.5.3.3.1. Payments against canceled appropriations exceeding $2,000,000.
          6.5.3.3.2. All upward obligation adjustments exceeding $2,000,000.
          6.5.3.3.3. Within scope contract changes exceeding $100,000.
          6.5.3.3.4. Adjustments to DoD appropriations (Treasury Index Code 97) exceeding
          $100,000.
       6.5.3.4. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptrollers must recommend and designate current
       appropriation sources when requesting approval. Follow the process identified in
       paragraph 6.6
6.6. Approving Upward Obligation Adjustments and Contract Change Requests:
   6.6.1. SAF/FMBMM must approve adjustments, including transactions to correct accounting
   errors greater than $2,000,000 ($100,000 for within scope contract changes and DoD
   appropriations) that involve any individual action or contract, before the accounting office
   records the adjustment in the accounting records. Do not net upward adjustments against
   downward adjustments to avoid this approval requirement.
   6.6.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptrollers must provide SAF/FMBMM with the information
   in OARS when requesting adjustment and contract change approvals.
   6.6.3. SAF/FMBIC must review all 3300 and 0740 appropriation requests for $100,000 and
   below. The limitation for within scope contract change and DoD appropriation adjustments is
   $100,000. MAJCOMs may re-delegate approval, provided the MAJCOM establishes
   MAJCOM-level procedures to clearly identify and periodically review the transactions.
   MAJCOMs must maintain supporting documentation to fulfill reporting requirements to
   OUSD(C) and Congress on these adjustments. Before approving or forwarding any requests,
   MAJCOMs must ensure that lower levels have reviewed them.
   6.6.4. If you are at a base, forward inquiries on the status of requests to your
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU. The status of any adjustment you have worked on can be reviewed at
   anytime in OARS. SAF/ FMBMM will answer MAJCOM/FOA/DRU budget office
   inquiries. SAF/FMB will not respond to contractor inquiries; direct those inquiries to
   the program offices.
   6.6.5. If you are at a MAJCOM or installation FM, work with FSO/FMA and paying offices
   to ensure prompt obligation and liquidation of amounts approved for upward adjustment to
   expired or canceled appropriations.
   6.6.6. Timing of requests for adjustment. SAF/FMB will work emergency requests for
   valid urgent requirements case-by-case. MAJCOMs should routinely submit requests for
   upward adjustments at least two weeks in advance of the need, to allow time for
   staffing. At fiscal year-end, after the first week in September, discuss any request with
   SAF/FMBMM prior to submission. At fiscal year-end, the MAJCOM must ensure that
   upward obligation adjustments citing expiring year or canceling account funds will be
   obligated and expensed prior to fiscal year-end. If not, the adjustment will have to be
   resubmitted the next fiscal year for approval by SAF/FMBMM.
6.7. Processing Unrecorded Obligations and Payments:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   105


   6.7.1. Commands and bases must use current appropriations to finance any obligation which
   was not recorded prior to closure of the appropriation and must process such transactions as
   upward obligation adjustments. Also, MAJCOMs and bases will treat an obligation which
   was properly recorded and then erroneously deobligated by contracting or a designated
   contracting representative as a correction of an administrative error (see paragraph 6.3.6.2
   for more information about administrative errors). If the erroneously deobligated obligation
   pertains to a closed appropriation, follow guidance in paragraph 6.4.1
   6.7.2. Unmatched disbursements for closed accounts. Treat any payment that occurred
   prior to the cancellation of an appropriation but was not recorded in the official accounting
   and finance records of the accountable station before the date of closure as an administrative
   error. Correction of the error condition will not constitute a violation of the Antideficiency
   Act. This includes ―by-other‖ payment cycles where the paying station makes payment in a
   fiscal year prior to account closure, but the accountable station does not complete the cycle
   until the next fiscal year when the account is closed.
   6.7.3. Accounting error corrections. MAJCOMs must send accounting error corrections
   over $2 million to SAF/FMBMM using OARS. If a disbursement or collection was made in
   error to the wrong appropriation and that appropriation canceled before adjusting the
   accounting records, an adjustment may be made to the canceled appropriation. Comptroller
   General Decision B-251287.3, issued November 1, 1995 allows the Treasury to accept
   adjustments to canceled accounts as long as the transaction needing adjustment occurred
   before the account closed. This situation is most likely to arise through NULO research,
   validation of canceled bills/invoices, and correction of an unrecorded or improperly charged
   disbursement from a wrong appropriation or in contract reconciliation. These adjustments
   would be processed through the DFAS accounting systems and treated, most often, as
   memorandum type adjustments and are not treated as UOAs. Canceled account obligations
   and receivables that were not disbursed or collected until after the account canceled will
   continue to be charged to current year funds or collected in the Miscellaneous Receipt
   Account, 3200.
6.8. Complying with the Antideficiency Act. In accordance with DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
Volume 14, the following are reportable violations of the Antideficiency Act:
   6.8.1. Total obligations, including adjustments to obligations, exceed the original
   appropriation. (Note: the cumulative fund resources of the original appropriation consist of
   amounts appropriated, net authorized transfers, and realized reimbursements from inception
   of the appropriation.) This includes any obligation against an appropriation or fund account
   exceeding the amount available in the original appropriation or fund account. This applies to
   all appropriation accounts, the obligated balance of which had not transferred to the ―M‖
   account as of 5 November 1990. As a result of the law, all appropriation accounts retain
   fiscal year identity indefinitely.
   6.8.2. New obligations or expenditures in canceled accounts. Includes any obligations or
   expenditures against an appropriation account canceled pursuant to sections 1552, 1555,
   1557 of Title 31, United States Code.
   6.8.3. Total obligations, or adjustments to obligations, exceed the amount apportioned or
   allotted. This includes any obligation against any appropriation or fund exceeding the amount
   apportioned or allotted to the original appropriation or fund account.
 106                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   6.8.4. All aspects of the Antideficiency Act still apply to fund limitations. The one-percent
   limitation is a single, cumulative limit. Agencies may not use more than one-percent of
   unexpired funds to pay any combination of canceled obligations (OMB Bulletin No. 91-07).
   6.8.5. All upward obligation adjustments involving an ADA violation investigation or
   potential ADA violation must be submitted to SAF/FMBMM for approval, regardless of
   dollar amount. Timely submission of reports and upward obligation adjustment requests are
   essential to preclude the Air Force from being subjected to ADA violation investigations
   arising from exceeding the legal limitations or otherwise over obligating or over disbursing
   an appropriation.
   6.8.6. The use of current availability for expired account adjustments. A violation of
   the Antideficiency Act occurs whenever an upward obligation adjustment falls within the
   parameters of Section 1004 of the FY 93 National Defense Authorization Act. If the one-
   percent limitation on the use of the current year appropriation under Section 1004 is
   exceeded, this is a reportable Antideficiency Act violation.
   6.8.7. Exceeding the $4/25M threshold for within-scope contract changes. Within-scope
   contract changes above $4M of expired/canceled funds require OUSD(C) approval and those
   changes above $25M require congressional notification. This is at the program, project, and
   activity level and is cumulative during a fiscal year. Report a violation if the $4M or $25M
   thresholds are exceeded without prior approval from OUSD(C) or Congress, respectively.
   6.8.8. An increased focus on Antideficiency Act (ADA) violation investigations and recent
   DoD policy on disciplinary actions to be taken have prompted the need for closer
   surveillance of those upward obligation adjustments associated with potential Antideficiency
   Act violations.
6.9. Handling Foreign Currency Fluctuation Obligations and Payments:
   6.9.1. Apply these procedures for making a payment from an expired or canceled account
   when the foreign currency exchange rate is higher or lower than the established budget rate.
   6.9.2. Apply current procedures for using the foreign currency fluctuation Centrally
   Managed Allotment (CMA) during the five expired years after the period of availability for
   obligation ends. Once the account is canceled, follow procedures in paragraph 6.9.3
   6.9.3. When expired accounts are canceled, make the payments related to the canceled
   accounts from current year appropriations. Paying offices will disburse canceled obligations
   involving designated foreign currencies by charging the basic appropriation at the current-
   year budget rate and charging or crediting the CMA for the difference between the budget
   rate and the current rate. As stated above, only the amount charged to the basic appropriation
   affects the one-percent limitation.
   6.9.4. SAF/FMBMM must approve any proposed upward obligation adjustment to the
   foreign currency CMA exceeding $2,000,000 prior to recording in the accounting system.
   Provide the same information required by paragraph 6.6.
6.10. Using Other DoD Appropriations:
   6.10.1. Per DoD Comptroller, the Military Departments must scrutinize all budget authority
   (appropriations) executed through the Air Force, including non-expenditure transfers
   (identified by the government agency appropriation symbol code 97) with the same attention
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    107


   we provide AF appropriations. Non-AF DoD activities provide these appropriations for Air
   Force projects and the Air Force retains control of them.
   6.10.2. Apply the procedures regarding upward obligation adjustments, including
   SAF/FMBMM review of changes over $100,000, for the DoD appropriations as specified in
   this guidance. All financial managers must ensure that the obligations recorded do not exceed
   the amounts authorized by law. Air Force activities must also charge valid upward obligation
   adjustments related to canceled DoD accounts to current 97-coded appropriations.
6.11. Obligating Upward Adjustments in the Accounting System:
   6.11.1. Perform these checks and balances prior to recording the obligation. First, determine
   whether there is a valid obligation. DFAS-DE 7000.4-R permits recording only those
   transactions which meet specified standards for legitimate obligations. DFAS-DE 7000.4-R,
   Chapter 2 further defines these standards. Second, apply the bona fide need rule in
   determining the proper appropriation and fiscal year for the fund citation. Application of the
   rule depends largely on the facts and circumstances of the specific case. Assist the FSO/FMA
   or Field Organization in selecting the correct fund citation.
   6.11.2. Use available sources such as statutes, regulations or higher headquarters direction in
   determining the correct fund citation. For example, when there appears to be a lack of funds
   at the base level to cover an obligation related to an expired account, MAJCOMs should
   review the facts and circumstances of the case before concurring with the base that, in fact,
   the suggested fund citation is correct. Do this prior to recording the transaction in the
   accounting system.
   6.11.3. The DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 10 states that all upward obligation
   adjustments against expired appropriation accounts (including Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553
   defined contract changes) that exceed $100,000 shall not be accomplished automatically (to
   include recording the transaction in the accounting system). The MAJCOMs or
   SAF/FMBMM must approve these adjustments before recording in the accounting system.
   Do not place any upward adjustment greater than $2,000,000 ($100,000 for within scope
   contract changes and DoD appropriation adjustments) on the books without approval by
   SAF/FMBMM.
6.12. Reviewing Unliquidated Obligation (ULO) Balances in the Expired Years:
   6.12.1. MAJCOM and installations should periodically verify ULO balances, including
   reconciling ULO balances to supporting documents and reviewing documents to ensure each
   obligation meets valid criteria. (DFAS-DE 7000.4-R requires accounting offices to
   deobligate proper and unliquidated obligations when standards for recording are no longer
   met.) Emphasizing the ULO validation process will help prevent any DoD audit follow-up
   findings, free funds for use on valid prior year upward adjustments, and enhance the
   credibility of Air Force accounting reports.
   6.12.2. MAJCOMs should establish procedures to assess obligations that are unduly
   outstanding or inactive, including making a tri-annual review of expired (especially fourth
   and fifth year) account balances.
   6.12.3. To guarantee a thorough review, MAJCOMs will:
 108                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       6.12.3.1. Ensure that field activities follow guidance in DFAS-DE 7000.4-R (Chapter 9)
       and DFAS-DE 7220.4-G, Tri-Annual Review Program, (Chapter 7) for validity review
       and update procedures.
       6.12.3.2. Ensure that your files document the follow-up effort and provide a clear audit
       trail supporting adjustments.
       6.12.3.3. Provide support to field activities regarding non-response to follow-up action.
       6.12.3.4. Meet promptly with contracting officers if follow-up action to procurement
       offices does not receive adequate or timely attention.
       6.12.3.5. Emphasize to field activities the need to elevate problems in a timely manner.
   6.12.4. Reviewing ULOs. (Note: normally, you should not have negative unliquidated
   obligations except when used as progress payments against contracts or as valid refund
   receivables.)
       6.12.4.1. Do not close any account with a negative cash balance until you have made
       corrections or recorded an offsetting collection which will produce a positive cash
       balance. If during the negative ULO analysis you determine that the negative is a
       legitimate account receivable, establish a refund receivable and cancel the negative ULO.
       Take action to ensure the receivable is collected promptly. This refund receivable should
       remain on the books until you receive a collection. If the collection is received after the
       account is closed, deposit the funds to receipt account 3200, ―Collections of Receivables
       from Canceled Accounts‖.
       6.12.4.2. The Department of Defense must maintain records for any open items
       (obligations or receivables) for as long as they are outstanding, even if the account is
       closed. The fact that the account is closed does not mean that these items are no longer
       valid.
       6.12.4.3. Review old refund receivable accounts. Uncollected receivables will erode
       available fund balances required for upward adjustments. Follow collection actions in
       applicable accounting regulations.
       6.12.4.4. When you determine that a negative unliquidated obligation in the accounting
       system is invalid, report the release of individual or cumulative negative unliquidated
       obligations over $2,000,000 to SAF/FMBMM. Use the monthly report in paragraph
       6.16 to accomplish this task.
       6.12.4.5. If the release of an invalid negative unliquidated obligation puts the
       appropriation in a negative balance, contact the MAJCOM immediately for resolution.
       The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must contact SAF/FMBMM upon determining that sufficient
       funds are unavailable to correct the deficiency.
6.13. Charging Prior Year Obligated Due-Outs:
   6.13.1. Based on guidance from DFAS, charge obligated due-outs to a like year
   appropriation to comply with legislative requirements to maintain fiscal year identity.
   6.13.2. At the end of the five expired years, the Treasury will cancel and withdraw fund
   balances. Charge obligated due-outs to a like year current appropriation; do not exceed the
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 109


   one-percent limitation. Consider these carry over obligations along with other canceled
   expenses against the one-percent limitation.
6.14. Reprogramming. (Most guidance in this paragraph applies to Air Staff activities.)
   6.14.1. Changes in contract scope. Apply this guidance for using currently available
   appropriations to fund changes in contract scope.
       6.14.1.1. Apply normal reprogramming (DD Form 1415-1, Reprogramming Action
       (Prior Approval Action) procedures and thresholds.
       6.14.1.2. Fund the change from (and identify it to) the current corresponding line item,
       program element or program applicable to the program for which the change is being
       made.
       6.14.1.3. If an applicable corresponding line item no longer exists in the currently
       available appropriation for the program for which the change is being made, create a new
       line item for the program in question to reflect the change adjustment. Apply the same
       reprogramming threshold procedures for the newly created line that you would use in
       creating any other new line item.
       6.14.1.4. Any line item or program can be the funding source for changes financed from
       currently available funds. However, you must apply normal reprogramming thresholds to
       the funding source line item or program.
   6.14.2. Within-scope contract changes and upward obligation adjustments for canceled
   accounts. Follow these procedures for using currently available appropriations to fund
   upward obligation adjustments and within-scope contract changes for contracts funded by
   appropriations that have been closed.
       6.14.2.1. Charge the appropriation currently available for the same purpose. Apply these
       specific limitations:
          6.14.2.1.1. The sum of all such amounts funded from currently available
          appropriations may not exceed the lower of (1) one-percent of the originally
          appropriated amount of the current appropriation being charged or (2) the current
          unexpended balance of the closed account.
          6.14.2.1.2. The unexpended balance is the net of: (1) the sum of the unobligated
          balance plus the unliquidated obligated balance of the account at the time it was
          canceled, and, (2) less any and all obligations incurred and payments made
          subsequent to the cancellation of the original account when such obligations and
          payments would otherwise have been properly charged to the appropriation had the
          appropriation not been canceled.
       6.14.2.2. Do not apply normal reprogramming (DD Form 1415-1, Reprogramming
       Action (Prior Approval Action) procedures and thresholds when using currently available
       appropriations to fund obligations or adjustments to obligations which would otherwise
       have been funded from a canceled account before it was canceled. Reflect the charges in
       a line item entitled ―Canceled Account Adjustments‖ on DD Form 1416, Report of
       Programs.
 110                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


          6.14.2.2.1. Within an appropriation, you may exceed reprogramming thresholds in
          currently available appropriations for increases or sources used to finance the
          Canceled Account Adjustments line item.
          6.14.2.2.2. If you exceed reprogramming thresholds for increases or sources to
          finance these obligations or adjustments to obligations, footnote Column K, of the
          DD Form 1416, Report of Programs, to indicate that the threshold amount has been
          exceeded due to canceled account adjustments.
          6.14.2.2.3. Make the Canceled Account Adjustments line item a separate line item or
          program element and add it as an entry within a single budget activity.
          6.14.2.2.4. Congressional Special Interest restrictions annotated on the current year
          DD 1414, Appropriated Base for Reprogramming, apply.
   6.14.3. Within-scope contract changes and upward obligation adjustments using expired year
   funds. DoD Comptroller does not require the Military Departments to submit reprogramming
   actions for expired accounts. Fund upward obligation adjustments and within-scope contract
   changes from the appropriation that initially financed the contract.
6.15. Complying With Control Levels in Expired Accounts:
   6.15.1. MAJCOM and appropriation managers do not usually withdraw field-level funding
   (allocation, allotments, etc.) upon expiration of an appropriation (see Chapter 3) because
   expired appropriations continue to be available for obligation adjustments. Continue to
   comply with fund authorization guidance until the funds issuer revises the authorization or
   the appropriation is canceled. NOTE: These fund authorizations are not available for new
   obligations. You must apply obligations incurred, but not recorded until after the
   appropriation expired, against the availability in the administrative subdivision in effect at
   the time the obligations were actually incurred.
   6.15.2. Level of Detail in the Expired Years. For funding and accounting purposes, the
   level of detail in the accounting systems must remain the same in the expired years as is
   required for current year accounts. New for Procurement and RDT&E accounts,
   appropriation managers will be required to issue budget authority for expired appropriations
   at the line-item detail (see NOTE below). All congressional and legal restrictions continue
   during the expired period. Recipients will then be required to adhere to the line item detail, in
   accordance with the budget authorization document issued (this includes resolving all
   abnormal balance conditions). Military Construction and Military Family Housing
   Construction appropriations must maintain detail at the project level into the expired years.
   BRAC 88 must maintain detail at the budget project level. NOTE: as of the printing of this
   revised AFI, OUSD(C) is in the midst of changing DoD FMR 7000.14-R to reflect the
   following: Program value, obligations, unobligated balance, unexpended balance, and
   expenditure balance data integrity must be maintained by line item throughout an account's
   unexpired and expired availability periods. Expired account adjustments which move
   resources between budget line items must reflect the appropriate change to that line item's
   program value amount, unobligated balance, unexpended balance, and expenditure data on
   the Appropriation Status by FY Program and Subaccounts (Acct Rpt (M) 1002). Additional
   policy and implementation details will be issued by SAF/FMBM and SAF/FMBI
   respectively.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      111


6.16. Collections. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1552, requires that any collections received after the
appropriation cancels be deposited to Miscellaneous Receipts Account of the Treasury. Accounts
receivables are amounts due from others for goods furnished and services rendered. Refunds are
requested returns of advances or recoveries of erroneous disbursements that are directly related
to and reductions of previously recorded payments from the accounts.
   6.16.1. If the collections are received that are applicable to a canceled account, the collection
   must be deposited to receipt account 57 3200, Collection of Receivables from Canceled
   Accounts (Limit .0001 for Refunds and .0002 for Reimbursements).
   6.16.2. When writing off a refund receivable with type code 8 or 9 that is posted as a reverse
   undelivered order outstanding (UOO) or accrued expenditure unpaid (AEU) against an
   appropriation that is canceled, current year funds must be used to cover the write off.
   6.16.3. When a by-others collection is made on or prior to 30 September for a receivable
   recorded in a closing account, but not accepted by the accountable station until after year-end
   closeout or later, the accountable station will record the by-others in the appropriation
   canceled account.
   6.16.4. The status of both the direct and reimbursable program obligated and unobligated
   balances, even in an account that has canceled, must be continuously maintained. If
   obligations and/or expenditures are incurred against a reimbursable order, and if that
   reimbursable order is later found to be uncollectable, then a potential violation of the
   Antideficiency Act may occur to the extent that appropriated (direct program) resources
   existing in the canceled account are not sufficient to absorb these obligations and/or
   expenditures. The unobligated balance of the direct program of the canceled account is
   determined by subtracting all the adjustments made to the canceled account that were
   charged to a current appropriation both as to purpose and in amount.
   6.16.5. Both reimbursement authority and reimbursable obligations should be adjusted to
   accommodate valid upward obligation adjustments whenever possible. Prior to increasing the
   accounts receivable transaction, the performing activity must have written evidence from the
   requesting activity that the requesting activity has performed an upward obligation
   adjustment, AND understands that a billing action will take place in settlement of the upward
   obligation payment. Without this written consent and acknowledgement, the performing
   activity will have to settle the upward obligation adjustment with direct authority. The Air
   Staff strongly recommends that future, initial agreements between the performing activity
   and the requesting activity contain disclaimer clauses (in the MIPR, Project Order, MOA,
   etc.) that spell out the requesting activity‘s responsibilities in the event of expired/canceled
   upward obligation adjustments.
6.17. Monthly and Fiscal Year-end Reporting Requirements for Transactions under
$100,000.
   6.17.1. Monthly Reporting Requirements. Monthly reporting requirements are
   accomplished through the OARS for tracking limitations required by Title 31 U.S.C., Section
   1553:
       6.17.1.1. Program name, amount of the adjustment financed ($ in thousands), PE and
       Activity Group for 3400 adjustments, and cumulative totals.
112                                                        AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      6.17.1.2. Reason for adjustment (see paragraph 6.3 of this guidance for reportable
      within scope contract changes).
      6.17.1.3. Accounting classification (line item detail for all appropriations except O&M.
      For O&M, appropriation and fiscal year only).
      6.17.1.4. Funding Source.
  6.17.2. Fiscal Year-end Reporting Requirements:
      6.17.2.1. Fiscal year-end reporting requirements are accomplished through OARS for
      tracking limitations required by Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1553.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    113


                                             Chapter 7

                                   SUPPORT GUIDANCE

Section 7A—Overview

7.1. Applying This Chapter. Follow this financial management guidance to plan and execute
support transactions between component organizations of the Air Force and:
   7.1.1. Other Air Force activities (intraservice support - includes Air Force, Air Force
   Reserve, and Air National Guard).
       7.1.1.1. Combatant commands for which the Air Force is the Executive Agent are Air
       Force tenants for the purpose of host-tenant funding responsibilities. This also applies to
       their subordinate organizations. These commands are identified in DoDD 5100.03,
       Support of the Headquarters of Combatant and Subordinate Unified Commands.
   7.1.2. Component organizations of other DoD departments and agencies (interservice
   support).
   7.1.3. Component organizations of non-DoD departments and agencies (interagency
   support).
7.2. Complying with Statutory Authority. Air Force organizations that obtain materials,
work, or services from other DoD components and other government agencies (or provide the
same to non-Air Force activities) must do so under statutory authority. Usually, one or more of
the following applies:
   7.2.1. Project Orders (41 U. S. C. 23).
   7.2.2. Economy Act Orders (31 U. S. C. 1535).
   7.2.3. Orders for Procurement by Another DoD Component (10 U. S. C. 2308, 2309).
   7.2.4. Orders from Stock for Supplies, Materiel, or Equipment of another DoD Component.
   7.2.5. Orders Required by Law to be Placed with a Government Agency, e.g.:
       7.2.5.1. Federal Prison Industries (18 U.S.C. 4124).
       7.2.5.2. Government Printing Office (44 U.S.C. 501).
       7.2.5.3. Corps of Engineers (33 U.S.C. 576, 701b-10).
       7.2.5.4. General Services Administration (Federal Supply Schedule).
7.3. Responsibilities:
   7.3.1. Host vs tenant funding responsibility/determinations (including charging policy) for
   various categories of support are made by functional organizations. SAF/FMB financial
   management responsibilities align with the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, which are the types of
   costs that can be charged.
   7.3.2. MAJCOMs and bases should issue instructions to ensure that:
114                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      7.3.2.1. The originator or manager coordinates the support agreement with the office of
      the Director, Financial Management/Comptroller (FM).
      7.3.2.2. The FM activity maintains a file of agreements.
      7.3.2.3. The Comptroller, or designated representative, signs all agreements (see DoDI
      4000.19 and AFI 25-201).
      7.3.2.4. The FM activity ensures that appropriate costing of activities by the FM resource
      management is included in the budget process.
      7.3.2.5. The FM activity assists the SAM in providing support agreements training.
      7.3.2.6. The FM activity ensures the receivers reimbursable and non-reimbursable direct
      incremental cost requirements are included in the suppliers annual financial plan.
      7.3.2.7. The FM activity works with DFAS organizations to ensure the accomplishment
      of actual billing and collection for support provided, and to provide appropriate
      accounting services.
      7.3.2.8. The FM activity provides financial advice to all parties involved in the
      agreement process.
      7.3.2.9. Installation Financial Management Comptroller must annually perform a budget
      review of support agreement reimbursements.
         7.3.2.9.1. Compare total dollars collected via reimbursement from customer to the
         total estimated reimbursement for that customer. Keep in mind one customer may
         have been serviced through several agreements and that some agreements may be
         financed via direct cite instead of reimbursement.
         7.3.2.9.2. If the total amount collected for the customer is within +/- 5% of what the
         reimbursement estimate was and that dollar amount is within +/- $100,000, no further
         action is required.
         7.3.2.9.3. If the variance stated in paragraph 7.3.4.2 is exceeded, compare
         collections by EEIC and RC/CC to the services specified in the agreement(s).
         Determine reasons for the amount over 5% and propose changes to the agreement(s)
         as needed. For example, mission changes or estimating errors may have caused an
         overestimate or underestimate of requirements. This would require adjusting the
         budget annex. In some cases, no change may be necessary. For example, the support
         estimated, while a potential requirement may not have been used or needed during
         this specific time period. Document the reconciliation and adjust the annex via pen
         and ink changes. Notify the base Support Agreement Monitor (SAM) and customer of
         any changes needed to the annex. Depending on the number and degree of changes, a
         new agreement may need to be accomplished. If the changes are minor, a revised,
         coordinated budget annex is all that is required.
         7.3.2.9.4. There is no prescribed time period in which to perform the annual review.
         The optimum time period would be close to the timing of execution plans. This gives
         the customer ample time to adjust the dollars needed for next year‘s support if large
         errors were found.
  AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  115


  Section 7B—Intraservice Relationships (Within the Air Force)

  7.4. General Host-Tenant Responsibilities:
      7.4.1. When a tenant command asks, the host command:
          7.4.1.1. Provides administrative and logistical support to the tenant under AFI 25-201
          guidance. The tenant requirements must be consistent with the unit precedence in the
          USAF Program, Bases, Units, and Priorities Documents (PD).
          7.4.1.2. Administers funds made available by the tenant‘s parent command to support the
          tenant.
      7.4.2. The tenant command:
          7.4.2.1. Advises the host command of tenant requirements early enough to permit
          consideration when the host formulates its budget and execution plan and revisions.
          7.4.2.2. When the host command asks, furnishes program guidance and factors so the
          host can include tenant support requirements in host budget estimates and execution
          plans. The tenant provides similar guidance when the host base budget office provides
          budget support to the tenant under AFI 25-201.
          7.4.2.3. Will not change planning factors such as utilization rates and overall scope of
          activity (once tenant support requirements are agreed upon) without notifying the host
          command in advance.
      7.4.3. The parties jointly:
          7.4.3.1. Revise AFI 25-201 agreements depending on the size of the tenant‘s requested
          changes and their effect on the host‘s support capability.
          7.4.3.2. Follow procedures in AFI 25-201 when support agreements are required and
          commands can not agree.
          7.4.3.3. See Figure 7.1 below for specific funding responsibilities. For additional
          guidance contact HAF/A4LX for their engagement with the functional owners of the
          capability area.

prorated WATS service.
3. When the host can provide one of these services only through a contract, the off-base tenant
command funds the service.
        4. If service is provided by contract, the tenant command has funding responsibility. However, if the
host command contracts out the service after providing it in-house, the tenant command will assume funding
responsibility budget leadtime away.

  7.5. Handling Unfunded Requirements. The tenant must tell the host its requirements early
  enough to allow consideration during budget formulation. When the host is not informed budget
  leadtime away, the tenant may not ―demand‖ funding from the host. If funds are not available,
  the host submits an unfunded requirement to its next higher headquarters for funding
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    121


consideration. As a last resort, the tenant command may fund the specific unfunded tenant
requirement.
7.6. This paragraph intentionally left blank.
7.7. This paragraph intentionally left blank.
7.8. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF):
   7.8.1. Support agreements with DWCF activities must comply with DoDI 4000.19 and AFI
   25-201. Charge DWCF activities for incremental direct costs that are measurable and directly
   attributable to the receiver. Contact SAF/FMBOO for program element codes which define
   base support resources provided to DWCF activities. The following PEs are used to
   calculate TWCF G&A reimbursements to O&M: X1856, Environmental Compliance;
   X1879, Real Property Services; X1976, Facility Restoration & Modernization; X1978,
   Facility Sustainment; X8530, MWR; X8531, Lodging; X8532, Airfield Ops; X8534,
   Command Support; X8538, Installation Law Enforcement Ops; X8539, Physical Security
   Protection Services; X8540, Supply Logistics; X8541, Community Logistics; X8542,
   Transportation Logistics; X8550, Information Technology; X8560, MILPERS Services; and
   X8561, Civilian Personnel Services.
       7.8.1.1. Active DWCF business areas on Air Force installations include:
          7.8.1.1.1. Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS).
          7.8.1.1.2. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).
          7.8.1.1.3. Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).
          7.8.1.1.4. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS).
          7.8.1.1.5. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M).
          7.8.1.1.6. Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).
          7.8.1.1.7. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group - Supply (CSAG-Supply).
   7.8.2. This paragraph intentionally left blank.
   7.8.3. TDY of Aircrew Members Assigned to Attachment Units. In accordance with AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, paragraph 2.20.2, the attachment unit funds TDYs for aircrew
   members when they require additional formal aircrew training in order to meet the minimum
   training requirements prescribed in training instructions. For normal training requirements,
   the member‘s assigned primary unit funds any required TDY costs to travel to the attachment
   unit.
   7.8.4. Funding for Rotational Units and Deployments:
       7.8.4.1. Because members of rotational units and deployments are TDY and the host
       operationally controls assigned aircraft, these units are not bona fide tenants. Usually,
       each Air Force activity budgets and funds for civilian pay and TDY expenses of its
       personnel. Therefore, unless civilian spaces and personnel authorizations of these tenant
       units are transferred to the host activity, the activity to which members are assigned will
       fund civilian pay and TDY. The command to which these transient units are deployed
       funds all other costs.
 122                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       7.8.4.2. You should also apply funding guidance for rotational units, deployments, and
       JCS exercises to ANG and AFRC units assigned duties to support the active forces, other
       than for training. The command hosting the rotation, deployment, or JCS exercise will
       fund all costs, except civilian pay and TDY.
   7.8.5. TDY Deployments That Involve Transferring Units’ (Aircraft And Personnel)
   Operational Control. Apply these budgeting and funding responsibilities:
       7.8.5.1. The command to which personnel are assigned funds TDY and civilian pay.
       7.8.5.2. The command with operational control of the aircraft finances all other costs
       (including base and intermediate maintenance, and contract quarters).
   7.8.6. Air Force Special Operations Command. The Memorandum of Agreement
   between the Air Force and the United States Special Operations Command, as changed by
   later agreements, governs USAF support of Air Force Special Operations Forces.
   7.8.7. Government Support Provided Contractors:
       7.8.7.1. Finance the cost of repairing, modifying, or constructing buildings used by a
       contractor on government-owned or leased land from the appropriations available for
       such purposes. Charge the command that must accomplish the contract. (That is, from
       O&M, RDT&E, or military construction.) EXCEPTION: do not apply this guidance to
       contract field teams doing on-site maintenance under AFMC maintenance (DWCF), or
       O&M-funded contracts. The local base supply officer provides materiel support to these
       activities as prescribed by AFJMAN 23-210, Joint Service Manual (JSM) for Storage and
       Materials Handling.
   7.8.8. Payment for Official Mail. Each installation and geographically separated unit
   (GSU) must budget and fund for their own official mail requirements. Apply the following
   guidance:
       7.8.8.1. Charge all Air Force and non-Air Force tenants for all postage costs.
       7.8.8.2. A Host has the option to set a limit below which it is not cost effective to recoup
       postage reimbursement.
7.9. Disposing of Turn-in Credits:
   7.9.1. When one or more tenants deactivate or depart and have accrued Consolidated
   Sustainment Activity Group – Supply credits, any remaining tenant units funded by the same
   parent command will use the Supply Business Activity credits. If none of these units remain,
   the DWCF reimburses the parent command of the deactivated or departed tenant. Reimburse
   at the earliest possible date after deactivation or departure, but not later than 30 September of
   the fiscal year in which the credit was earned.
   7.9.2. Follow criteria in (DWCF) guidance to credit turn-ins of expense materiel.
7.10. Billing Tenants:
   7.10.1. Consider two or more tenants funded by the same parent command under a single
   fund allotment as a single tenant. Bill these tenants so you separately classify them and
   identify charges by cost center.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      123


   7.10.2. You may waive billings when the accumulated charges against a reimbursable tenant
   do not exceed $1,000.00 for any calendar quarter. However, no later than the end of the fiscal
   year, all suspended amounts must be billed even though the billed amount is less than
   $1,000.00. EXCEPTION: Do not apply this waiver to DWCF transactions or support.
   7.10.3. See DFAS-DE 7010.5-R, Chapter 9, for billing procedures on support rendered to a
   tenant.
   7.10.4. Thrift Shops operated by Wives/Spouses clubs on Air Force installations are exempt
   from reimbursing for utilities (SECAF 9 Apr 96 Policy Memorandum).
7.11. Making Jurisdictional Transfers. Gaining and losing commands should draft a transfer
agreement to transfer an installation or other activity between jurisdictions. The gaining
command should forward the agreement to HQ USAF for approval:
   7.11.1. Concurrent with submitting the agreement to HQ USAF, gaining and losing
   commands must forward revisions to their annual execution plans for the appropriations and
   funds affected by the transfer. Your justification should cover only the changes in mission
   because of the transfer. SAF/FMB will adjust the command budget authorizations and fund
   allocations as necessary.
   7.11.2. The commands must try to transfer all funds and funding responsibilities as of one
   date, preferably on the first day of the month or fiscal quarter. The date of transfer of funding
   responsibility should coincide with the date of transfer of civilian personnel authorizations.
   See also DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Part 4, for transfer of funding responsibilities.
7.12. Reimbursing Landing Fees and Base Maintenance for Transient Aircraft. See AFI
10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and specific agreements for current guidance and rates
for charging transient aircraft landing fees. Bill for base level maintenance on transient aircraft
(including fleet service) as follows:
   7.12.1. No reimbursement.
       7.12.1.1. ANG aircraft.
       7.12.1.2. AFRC aircraft.
       7.12.1.3. Other Air Force aircraft
   7.12.2. Reimbursement is not required because the above policies are reciprocal. In other
   words, Air Force installations will not bill ANG, AFRC, or TWCF aircraft for transient
   maintenance on their aircraft nor will those organizations bill the Air Force for transient
   maintenance on Air Force aircraft.
   7.12.3. Non-Air Force Aircraft. Reimbursement is required. Accumulate individual
   transactions of less than $1,000.00 for another DoD activity within a fiscal quarter. If they
   amount to less than $1,000.00 during the quarter, the provider may waive reimbursement.
   However, no later than the end of the fiscal year, all suspended amounts must be billed even
   though the billed amount is less than $1,000.00. The Air Force does not require
   reimbursement for routine parking and launching (Follow Me) service from transient aircraft
   owned and operated by the U.S. Government or from U.S. Air Force contract aircraft.
   7.12.4. Landing Fees. The FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (P.L.
   111-383) amends Chapter 159 of Title 10, U.S.C., by adding Section 2697 Acceptance and
 124                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   Use of Landing Fees Charged For Use of Domestic Military Airfields by Civil Aircraft. The
   Secretary of a military department may impose landing fees for the use by civil aircraft of
   domestic military airfields under the jurisdiction of that Secretary and may use any fees
   received under this section as a source of funding for the operation and maintenance of
   airfields of that department. Amounts received for a fiscal year in payment of landing fees
   imposed under this section for the use of a military airfield shall be credited to the
   appropriation that is available for that fiscal year for the operation and maintenance of that
   military airfield, shall be merged with amounts in the appropriation to which credited, and
   shall be available for that military airfield for the same period and purposes as the
   appropriation is available. Refer to the text of 10 U.S.C., Section 2697 for further detail.
   7.12.5. Johnston Atoll (Reimbursement for Support Provided to Civil Air
   Carriers). Title 10 U.S.C., Section 9783 authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force may,
   under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, require payment by a civil aircraft carrier for
   support provided by the United States to the carrier at Johnston Atoll that is either requested
   by the civil air carrier or determined under the regulations as being necessary to
   accommodate the civil air carrier‘s use of Johnston Atoll. Amounts collected from an air
   carrier shall be credited to appropriations available for the fiscal year in which collected as
   follows: (1) for support provided by the Air Force, to appropriations available for the Air
   Force for operation and maintenance and (2) for support provided by the Army, to
   appropriations available for the Army chemical demilitarization. Refer to the text of 10
   U.S.C. 9783 for greater detail.
7.13. Reserved for future use.
7.14. Investigating Aircraft Accidents, Including Remotely Piloted Aircraft, and
Environmental Cleanup. Provide funding support as follows:
   7.14.1. The host installation supporting the investigation funds for any in-house support.
   7.14.2. The convening command may pay TDY travel for board members and witnesses.
   7.14.3. The investigating command funds other support costs (for example, leasing of
   vehicles or special equipment, leased communications, and other contractual services).
   7.14.4. The major command or Air Reserve Component that possesses an aircraft at the time
   of the mishap funds the environmental cleanup of the mishap site.

Section 7C—Interservice Relationships

7.15. Overview. This section prescribes uniform guidance for interservice support (Air Force
and other DoD components), consistent with DoDI 4000.19.
7.16. Cross-Servicing:
   7.16.1. For budgeting and funding, cross-servicing divides into category one (reimbursable)
   and category two (direct cite).
   7.16.2. Under category one (reimbursable), Air Force activities acting as the:
       7.16.2.1. Ordering agency must budget and fund for the cost of the items or services
       ordered.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  125


       7.16.2.2. Procuring or performing agency must budget on a reimbursable basis. Fund the
       materiel or services for the ordering agency the same as for similar products or services
       for your own account.
   7.16.3. Under category two (direct cite):
       7.16.3.1. The contractor bills each ordering agency separately for articles delivered or
       services rendered, based on the ordering agency‘s instructions. But, when articles are
       delivered for storage to the procuring agency for the ordering agency‘s account, the
       agencies must make cross-disbursing arrangements so the procuring agency can pay
       vendor‘s invoices against funds cited by the ordering agency.
       7.16.3.2. Unless the departments otherwise agree, do not accept or issue Military
       Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) citing expiring appropriations (must be
       obligated by 30 September of that fiscal year) after 31 May.
       7.16.3.3. If you need to submit MIPRs citing expiring appropriations after the cutoff
       date, first contact the procuring department to find out if it can execute a contract or
       otherwise obligate the funds by fiscal year-end. Procuring departments must attempt to
       obligate funds for all such MIPRs accepted after the cutoff date, but accepting a late
       MIPR does not mean they will obligate all such funds.
       7.16.3.4. These instructions do not restrict processing MIPRs as long as the procuring
       department can execute contracts or otherwise obligate the funds before the end of the
       fiscal year.
   7.16.4. Only orders you place under the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) are subject to
   deobligation as prescribed in the statute and implemented by DFAS-DE 7000.4-R,
   Accounting for Obligations. 31 U.S.C. 1535(d) states, ―An order placed or agreement
   made under this section [the Economy Act] obligates an appropriation of the ordering
   agency or unit. The amount obligated is deobligated to the extent that the agency or
   unit filling the order has not incurred obligations, before the end of the period of
   availability of the appropriation, in (1) providing goods or services; or making an
   authorized contract with another person to provide the requested goods or service.‖
   Retain all other orders on the accounting records until liquidated, adjusted, or deobligated
   according to normal procedures.
   7.16.5. Supporting Commissaries. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) includes
   each Military Department‘s commissary system. As a DWCF activity, DeCA activities on or
   supported by Air Force installations will reimburse host bases for support costs under
   negotiated interservice support agreements, using the support categories and guidance in
   DoDI 4000.19 . Reimbursement includes direct, indirect, and general and administrative
   (G&A) support costs, but excludes depreciation of a host base‘s capital equipment and
   facilities and the cost of its military personnel. DoDD 5105.55, Defense Commissary Agency
   (DeCA), provides guidance on operating DeCA.
7.17. Determining Cross-Servicing Charges. Base charges for cross-servicing on the
guidance in this paragraph. Depending on your agreement, you may need to apply more than one
type of cross-servicing in one agreement.
 126                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   7.17.1. Refer to DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A and DFAS-DE 7010.5-R to determine
   reimbursable costs and amounts to collect for interservice support, unless another directive or
   instruction authorizes different reimbursements. Examples would be instructions governing
   major range and test facility bases, revolving fund (DWCF) operations, and foreign military
   sales.
   7.17.2. Compute charges for cross-servicing by activities operating an industrial fund cost
   accounting system according to Defense Working Capital Fund guidance and the business
   area‘s approved charter. DoD guidance on common service warehousing (that is,
   nonreimbursable) does not apply to industrial funds if they incur costs for services they
   provide.
   7.17.3. Air Force activities operating an industrial-type cost accounting system will include
   direct labor, direct materiel, and overhead, but not military pay and allowances, in cross-
   servicing charges.
   7.17.4. The furnishing department bills these items at cost: electricity, gas, steam, water, or
   other similar utilities furnished as a separate cross-service. They can not be incidental to
   another cross-service and can not be computed under 7.17.1 through 7.17.4 above.
   7.17.5. Air Force activities may not levy surcharges or other charges not authorized in this
   chapter.
7.18. Accepting Cross-Service Orders:
   7.18.1. The procuring agency will send a written acceptance or rejection with explanation,
   not later than 30 days after receiving a cross-service order. (The base activity that contracts
   or provides the ordered service or materiel, not Accounting and Finance, accepts MIPRs.)
       7.18.1.1. EXCEPTION: you do not need to accept in writing on orders for common use
       standard stock, if you can deliver the order (as requested by the ordering agency) within
       30 days.
       7.18.1.2. You must accept in writing in the case of delayed delivery of common use
       standard stock (usually within 60 days from date of agreement with the performing
       agency for the delayed delivery). In unusual, infrequent cases, if the accepting agency is
       not able to deliver within 60 days, it may agree with the ordering activity to delay
       delivery, but in no event beyond 120 days.
       7.18.1.3. If the procuring agency needs more than 30 days to coordinate the order, it
       should advise the ordering agency in writing of the anticipated acceptance date, within 30
       days of receiving the order. Do not change the financing method shown in the
       acceptance. You do not usually use ―Notifications of Rejection‖ for coordinated
       procurement when the procuring agency buys for the other services.
   7.18.2. Include in an acceptance at least:
       7.18.2.1. Identification of cross-service order (number and date, ordering agency, and
       address).
       7.18.2.2. Statement accepting the order. For accepting MIPRs, the statement must say:
       ―The terms of this MIPR are satisfactory and are accepted, subject to the corrections for
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     127


      consolidated reimbursable procurement stated herein. The items requested will be
      furnished as follows:‖.
      7.18.2.3. Statement of financing method you will use in filling the order:
          7.18.2.3.1. By reimbursement upon delivery (Category One).
          7.18.2.3.2. By direct citation of ordering agency funds (Category Two).
          7.18.2.3.3. List of line items under each category above, and total estimated price by
          line item, except that you may consolidate item numbers on the order which are
          subject to the same procurement method and budget account classification and accept
          them as a single-line entry.
      7.18.2.4. Date of acceptance.
      7.18.2.5. Signature, title, and address of officer or individual authorized to accept the
      order.
      7.18.2.6. If the procuring agency expects price revisions or variations in quantity
      contingencies under consolidated reimbursable procurement, the procuring agency
      representative who accepts the MIPR must note them in the acceptance statement.
      7.18.2.7. You may show the acceptance format on the cross-service order as a snap-out
      sheet or as a separate form. Include a heading in capital letters that reads:
      ―ACCEPTANCE OF CROSS-SERVICE ORDER‖. Provide enough space to include the
      required information.
   7.18.3. Treat amendments to an accepted order the same way as an initial order. Before
   accepting an amendment, find out whether or not the acceptance results in a loss to the Air
   Force. If a loss would result, the provider must evaluate the loss and qualify the acceptance to
   ensure enough funds will be available to reimburse the Air Force for the loss. The provider
   should waive losses under $100 resulting from complete cancellation of the order.
7.19. Financing Cross-Service Orders:
   7.19.1. Finance cross-servicing by the following methods only:
      7.19.1.1. Category One. By reimbursing upon delivery or performance or upon settling
      progress billings for orders placed with industrial funds.
      7.19.1.2. Category Two. By citing ordering agency funds. In this case, the contractor or
      supplier will bill and be paid by the requiring activity directly, or the performing activity
      will cite the funds of the requiring activity.
   7.19.2. If either category is appropriate, the procuring agency will decide how to finance
   cross-servicing.
   7.19.3. Cite the requiring department‘s funds when the Air Force acts as procuring agency
   for another department and the items being procured are unique to the other department (the
   Air Force has no known requirements for like items). When acting as the procuring agency
   for another department, the Air Force may determine the type of funding (direct citation or
   reimbursable) to use. Finance all items subject to consolidated procurement, in accepted
   cross-service orders, on a reimbursable basis. Use the reimbursement method of financing
   when an order is received for items that are Air Force procured, Air Force used, or which are
128                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


  normally carried in Air Force stock. Do not use separate contracts or separate delivery
  schedules to avoid sustaining reimbursable costs for another DoD agency.
  7.19.4. For consolidated-reimbursable procurement, Category One:
      7.19.4.1. When the procuring agency qualifies an acceptance because of anticipated
      contingencies, that agency will bill at the price determined later. In this case, the
      procuring agency will periodically advise the ordering agency of changes in the
      acceptance figure by publishing revised prices. The ordering agency will adjust the
      obligation recorded to show the current price. Air Force activities will review obligations
      at least monthly to make sure recorded amounts reflect the procuring agency‘s current
      prices.
      7.19.4.2. If the procuring agency does not qualify its acceptance for anticipated
      contingencies, the price in the acceptance is final. The procuring agency will bill at time
      of delivery.
  7.19.5. For direct citation procurement, Category Two:
      7.19.5.1. The ordering agency will administratively reserve funds for any contingencies
      indicated in the contract for which it is liable.
      7.19.5.2. On 1 August of each fiscal year, the procuring department will advise the
      requiring department of any Category Two MIPRs on hand citing expiring appropriations
      on which they will be unable to obligate the funds before the fund expiration date. If
      unforeseen situations after 1 August prevent executing a contract, the procuring
      department will notify the requiring department by the quickest means and return the
      MIPR with a transmittal letter stating why they could not accomplish the procurement.
  7.19.6. Under Category One (consolidated-reimbursable procurement):
      7.19.6.1. Air Force activities acting as the ordering agency must budget and fund under
      applicable appropriations for all requirements to support assigned mission
      responsibilities.
      7.19.6.2. If your Air Force activity is acting as the procuring or performing agency, you
      must:
         7.19.6.2.1. Include in budget estimates, annual execution plans, and procurement
         programs, estimated anticipated reimbursements based on known and forecasted
         requirements of the other military agencies and experience factors.
         7.19.6.2.2. Revise your procurement program to show the anticipated reimbursement
         changes in cases for which you are financing a procurement from Air Force
         procurement appropriations. Include more funds when required as well as any
         necessary reductions. In cases for which you would need to delay action on another
         military agency‘s order, fill the order and send a request for the increase in budget
         authorization and reimbursable authority to SAF/FMBI. Include amounts required for
         funding reimbursable transactions in command requests for allocation or allotment.
         7.19.6.2.3. Promptly bill and obtain reimbursement from the ordering agency upon
         delivery of the articles or performance of the service. When recurring charges are
         involved, bill the ordering agency at least once a month. Do the project order
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   129


          reimbursements by processing an SF 1080, Vouchers for Transfer Between
          Appropriations and Funds, completing both certificates, and charging funds
          provided in the project order. Reference reimbursement billings to the order number.
          7.19.6.2.4. Deposit reimbursements received as appropriation reimbursements.
   7.19.7. Under Category Two (direct citation procurement):
       7.19.7.1. Air Force activities acting as the ordering agency must:
          7.19.7.1.1. Budget and fund under applicable appropriations for requirements to
          support assigned mission responsibilities.
          7.19.7.1.2. Cite their funds on all orders you send to other military agencies which
          will be available to the procuring agency for citing on all obligating documents
          executed.
          7.19.7.1.3. Pay vendor‘s invoices against cited Air Force funds. EXCEPTION:
          When the articles ordered are to be delivered to the procuring agency for account of,
          and storage for, the Air Force activity and you arranged for cross disbursing, the
          procuring agency pays directly against the cited Air Force funds.
       7.19.7.2. Air Force activities acting as the procuring or performing agency must:
          7.19.7.2.1. Include funds citing the ordering agency‘s funds on all contracts and other
          documents the Air Force completes for the ordering agency.
          7.19.7.2.2. Cross-reference to the original order all subsidiary documents (contracts,
          delivery and payment documents, etc.) issued under an order received from another
          military agency. Make sure these documents have enough information to identify
          them, including MIPR number, contract number, and budget account classification.
          7.19.7.2.3. Promptly distribute all subsidiary documents issued under an order.
          7.19.7.2.4. Arrange for the contractor or supplier to bill the ordering agency direct.
          But, when the contractor or supplier will deliver articles to an Air Force activity for
          account of and storage for the ordering agency, the Air Force will receive the
          vendors‘ invoices and pay against funds which the ordering agency authorized the Air
          Force to cite (consistent with cross-disbursing agreements between the Air Force and
          the ordering agency).
   7.19.8. Transportation bills of lading incident to cross-servicing. Charge the ordering
   agency‘s appropriation directly. You must always show the agency to be billed and the
   chargeable appropriation or fund (as designated by the agency) in the bill of lading. Charge
   transportation costs for shipments by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as DLA prescribes
   for their appropriations.
7.20. Processing Commitments and Obligations. Follow DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
Accounting for Commitments and DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations.
7.21. Resolving Service Disagreements. In cases where the respective services disagree on
cross-servicing charges or financing, the MAJCOM should forward the disagreement through
appropriate channels for resolution. Include your recommendations and comments of all parties.
 130                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


7.22. Joint-Use Guidance. Sometimes units or activities of one military department (tenant)
reside on another military department‘s (host) installation. The host may provide facilities and
services for the tenant unit after completing a host-tenant agreement. Based on local agreements,
DoD installations also provide cross-servicing support to one service‘s units or activities next to
or near another service‘s installation. See DoDI 4000.19 for guidance on support for joint use
between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Agencies. See Chapter 16 of this instruction
for Air National Guard support.

Section 7D—Support of Non-DoD Departments and Agencies

7.23. Overview. The Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) authorizes government agencies to enter
into transactions with each other when it is in the government‘s best interest. Apply this section
solely to financing orders between Air Force activities and other United States government
departments or agencies outside DoD.
   7.23.1. Unless otherwise provided for in departmental agreements, determine charges for
   materiel, work, services and overhead according to paragraph 7.17 and Chapter 1 of DoD
   FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations Policy and Programs. Compute
   industrial fund charges according to DWCF guidance.
   7.23.2. DoD activities usually waive reimbursement, except for support provided by working
   capital funds, when the accumulated value of services, materiel, and supplies furnished a
   government agency is less than $1,000.00 during a calendar quarter. However, no later than
   the end of the fiscal year, all suspended amounts must be billed even though the billed
   amount is less than $1,000.00. But, you must obtain reimbursement for these smaller
   amounts from working capital funds.
   7.23.3. Economy Act orders issued outside the DoD require a Determination and
   Finding (D&F) from the contracting officer that documents, among other
   considerations, that the order is in the best interest of the government (FAR Subpart
   17. 5-Interagency Acquisition Under the Economy Act and DFAR Subpart 217.5).
   7.23.4. Support of U. S. Customs Service. The Air Force will provide support to the
   Federal Border Clearance Agencies (U.S. Customs Service, Department of Agriculture, and
   Immigration and Naturalization Service) at USAF Aerial Ports of entry without charge or
   reimbursement. If overtime costs are incurred by U.S. Customs Agents clearing USAF
   aircraft, the installation reimburses the Customs Service for those overtime costs. Reference
   DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part V, Department of Defense Customs
   and Border Clearance Policies and Procedures. The DTR is maintained by US
   TRANSCOM at http://www.transcom.mil/. USTRANSCOM (TCJ4-LTP) is the DoD
   Executive Agent.
   7.23.5. Exception to the Economy Act. The GSA Information Technology (GSA IT) Fund,
   authorized by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-106) (formerly known as the
   Information Technology Reform Act of 1996 (ITMRA), was exempted from the provisions
   of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535 and 1536. That is, funds, which expire at the end of a
   fiscal year, do not have to be returned to the requesting agency by the performing agency, in
   this instance the GSA IT Fund. However, there is still a binding legal requirement for an Air
   Force organization (requesting agency) to specify exactly what the funds are for and to
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  131


   comply with bona fide need and the purpose provisions of the appropriation being utilized to
   fund the effort requested. Notwithstanding any advice proffered by the GSA IT fund to the
   contrary, when funds for the specific requirement, as specified on the order, usually a MIPR,
   are excess to that requirement, they must be returned to the requesting Air Force
   organization. There is a legal prohibition on extending the life of an appropriation by
   utilizing funds, issued for a specific order, for other purposes.
7.24. Financing Economy Act Orders. (31 U.S.C. 1535) (Also see paragraph 7.16.4). Use
these methods.
   7.24.1. Reimbursement Method. By agreement, the performing agency finances the order
   using its own funds and is reimbursed later by the ordering agency. The ordering agency pays
   the performing agency upon completing the order or progressively as the order is completed.
   Usually the parties complete these financial transactions by using SF 1080, Voucher for
   Transfer Between Appropriations and/or Funds. See DFAS-DE 7010.5-R for billing and
   collection procedures.
   7.24.2. Direct Citation Method. Use this method when it‘s more feasible and more
   economical than the reimbursement method.
   7.24.3. Advance Payment Method. By agreement, the performing agency requires
   payment in advance from the ordering agency. The performing agency submits an SF 1080
   bill to the ordering activity that makes the advance payment. The performing agency deposits
   the advance payment in a Consolidated Working Fund or a Working Capital Fund that it then
   uses to accomplish the Economy Act order.
   7.24.4. Transfer Appropriation Method. By agreement, the ordering agency transfers its
   funds to the performing agency to finance Economy Act orders, usually for construction and
   major procurement. Departmental level only (HQ USAF, etc.) uses this method. HQ USAF
   processes an SF 1151, Non-Expenditure Transfer Authorization, through the Treasury
   Department. Under this method, the Air Force maintains the appropriation symbol from
   which funds were transferred, prefixed by the performing agency‘s symbol.
7.25. Executing Economy Act Orders. (31 U.S.C. 1535) (Also see paragraph 7.16.4.). To
the maximum extent possible, Air Force activities will finance Economy Act orders received
from or issued to government agencies outside the DoD using the direct citation or the
reimbursement method.
   7.25.1. In exceptional cases where you can not finance the order using these methods, advise
   SAF/FMBM through command channels. List the pertinent facts and explain why you can
   not finance the Economy Act order using these methods. SAF/FMB will determine the
   financing method and advise the command.
   7.25.2. The method you use to finance Economy Act orders issued to another government
   agency depends mainly on the policies of that agency. But, other government agencies
   presently furnishing goods or services to the Air Force have agreed to use the reimbursement
   method of financing, if possible, except agencies listed in paragraphs 7.25.3 and 7.25.4.
   7.25.3. Use advance payment to finance all Economy Act Orders issued to these agencies:
 132                                                        AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

National Technical Information Service, Department of Commerce.

Government Printing Office.

Transportation Systems Division, Department of Transportation.
   7.25.4. SAF/FMB uses the transfer appropriation method to finance Economy Act orders
   issued by HQ USAF to the Bureau of Public Roads, Department of Transportation, to
   construct access roads. HQ USAF will transfer the funds.
   7.25.5. Obtain HQ USAF approval prior to making advance payments to agencies other than
   those indicated in paragraph 7.25.3 If another agency requests an advance payment, forward
   the request through your MAJCOM to SAF/FMBM, 1130 Air Force Pentagon,Washington
   DC 20330-1130, for approval.
   7.25.6. Do not authorize or make advance payments from Air Force annual appropriations
   that exceed the estimated cost of goods or services to be furnished by the performing agency
   during the fiscal year (FY) in which you make the advance payment.
   7.25.7. The Air Force activity that makes an advance payment to agencies indicated in
   paragraph 7.25.3 above, or any others specifically approved by SAF/FMB, must complete
   and monitor all aspects of the advance payment. For advance payments made from Air Force
   appropriation accounts, you must require the performing agency to:
       7.25.7.1. Return estimated 30 September unobligated balances by 15 August of the FY in
       which you make the advance payment.
       7.25.7.2. Return unexpended balances upon completing the Economy Act order.
   7.25.8. In many instances, other government agencies that furnish goods or services to the
   Air Force operate on limited financial resources. Therefore, you must pay bills from these
   agencies promptly. Also, you must bill other government agencies promptly for goods or
   services the Air Force provides.
7.26. Economy Act Order Procedures:
   7.26.1. The ordering Air Force activity may make advance payments of Air Force funds for
   orders issued to agencies listed in paragraph 7.25.3 without further recourse to HQ USAF.
   Follow procedures in DFAS-DE 7010.5-R.
   7.26.2. HQ USAF makes the appropriation transfer to the Department of Transportation
   (paragraph 7.25.4) and any others specifically approved by HQ USAF.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   133


   7.26.3. In all other cases when other agencies do not agree to finance Air Force orders by the
   reimbursement or direct cite method, the ordering Air Force activity will submit, through
   command channels, a request for HQ USAF determination and approval of financing
   arrangements. Send the request to SAF/FMBM, 1130 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC
   20330-1130. Include:
      7.26.3.1. A statement that the performing agency will not accept and finance the
      Economy Act order by the reimbursement or direct cite method.
      7.26.3.2. A copy of the order sent to the performing agency, which must include a
      statement of purpose or nature of work, estimate of cost and time required to complete
      the work.
      7.26.3.3. A statement from the Air Force command that funds are available within
      existing allocations and that the requirement is included in the approved program,
      indicating appropriation, program year, and budget program.
      7.26.3.4. Other pertinent data to enable HQ USAF to evaluate the request.
   7.26.4. After receiving this information, HQ USAF will negotiate with the departmental
   headquarters of the performing agency to determine the financing method. If these
   negotiations result in the reimbursement method, direct cite method, or advance payment
   method, HQ USAF will return the case to the Air Force activity for processing. If the transfer
   appropriation method is agreed upon, HQ USAF will:
      7.26.4.1. Withdraw funds from the Air Force command or operating agency by issuing
      revised budget authorization and allocation documents or operating budget authority.
      7.26.4.2. Transfer Air Force funds to the performing agency by the transfer appropriation
      method.
      7.26.4.3. Notify the Air Force activity, through command channels, when the above
      actions are completed.
7.27. Other Methods of Funding. Some interagency transactions must comply with particular
statutory provisions, special regulations, or special arrangements.
   7.27.1. National Bureau of Standards. Air Force installations placing work order requests
   with that agency will finance them on an SF 1080 advance reimbursement basis. Conduct the
   negotiations and process the SF 1080 at installation level.
   7.27.2. United States Postal Service (USPS). Unless specifically approved by SAF/AAI,
   installations may not use ―Postage and Fees Paid‖ indicia in place of metering.
7.28. Transactions with GSA for Leased Facilities:
   7.28.1. The Air Force enters into and pays for leases ending in a current fiscal year,
   renewable from year-to-year at the option of the government, provided language to this effect
   is in the DoD Appropriations Act for that fiscal year. AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real
   Property, has procedures for acquiring and funding leased facilities.
   7.28.2. The General Services Administration (GSA) may make communications services in
   leased facilities available on a reimbursement basis in certain locations where office
   buildings are large enough to warrant joint-use switchboard and teletype facilities. Contact
 134                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   the local GSA office to obtain information on specific locations. Compute charges for
   communications according to GSA Circulars No. 42 and 93.
7.29. Air Transportation Provided to Non-Defense Agencies:
   7.29.1. Guidance on furnishing air transportation for non-defense personnel and cargo is in
   DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility.
   7.29.2. Procedures for processing and collecting charges for reimbursable non-defense
   traffic transported on DoD aircraft other than Air Mobility Command (TWCF) are in DoDD
   4500.56, DoD Policy on Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel. AMC determines
   reimbursement for traffic furnished by AMC (TWCF) aircraft.
7.30. Terms for Support Agreements. The support agreement must identify the categories of
support furnished and the method of funding. Normally, you furnish support on a reimbursable
basis except for insignificant support or services that are not readily identifiable or measurable.
Identify cross-servicing responsibilities in the terms of the agreement.

Section 7E—Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and Air Force Civil Air Patrol Liaison Offices

7.31. Overview. The CAP is a nonprofit corporation that is federally chartered under Section
40301 of Title 36. It has the authority to receive financial and other support from the DoD and
other departments and agencies of the Federal Government as described in 10 U.S.C. 9442, 10
U.S.C. 9443, and 10 U.S.C. 9444. Additional guidance on supporting the CAP is contained in
AFPD 10-8, Homeland Defense and Civil Support; AFPD 10-27, Civil Air Patrol and AFI 10-
2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol. The following CAP Reimbursable
Programs and Missions, while not all-inclusive, are the primary activities that CAP can be called
upon to execute on behalf of the Air Force and other DoD and Federal agencies: Search and
Rescue/Disaster Relief (SAR/DR), Counterdrug Programs, Drug Demand Reduction (DDR),
Homeland Security, Aerospace Education, Distance Learning, and Cadet Programs.
7.32. Supporting CAP with the use of Appropriated Funds. Since CAP is separate and
distinct from the Air Force, the Air Force funding support to CAP programs differs greatly from
the standard support of Air Force organizations. This list provides guidance to Air Force
agencies responsible for the authorizing, allocating, disbursing, and auditing funds to the CAP on
which activities are allowed support with appropriated funds. However, the decision to use Air
Force appropriated funds for all, some, or none of these activities rests with the CAP
management. Decisions are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
   7.32.1. Liability Insurance Premiums. The Air Force may provide CAP with funds for
   paying the cost of liability insurance to cover missions and activities carried out as a
   federally chartered nonprofit corporation IAW 10 U.S.C. 9443.
   7.32.2. Other Allowable and Allocable Mission and Program Related Expenses. The
   Air Force furnishes to the CAP equipment, supplies, and other resources, to include
   appropriated funds, to enable the CAP to fulfill its missions and programs. The CAP submits
   annual appropriated fund execution plans and budgets to the Air Force for approval. The
   CAP may use appropriated funds for the following types of expenses:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 135


     7.32.2.1. Supplies. The Air Force may furnish supplies (including fuel, lubricants, and
     other items required for vehicle and aircraft operations) or provide funds for the
     acquisition of supplies.
     7.32.2.2. Travel and Per Diem. The Air Force may pay travel expenses and
     allowances, at rates not to exceed those paid to employees of the United States under the
     Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), to members of the CAP while the members are carrying
     out programs or missions specifically assigned and approved by the Air Force. This
     includes, but is not limited to, actual and training missions for SAR/DR, Homeland
     Security, and Counterdrug missions. In addition, the Air Force may provide funds and
     approve travel expenses and allowances for programs such as DDR, and CAP
     Commander/Staff Education and Training. Inspector General programs may be funded to
     the extent they are determined to be in support of Air Force assigned missions or
     programs.
     7.32.2.3. National Headquarters. Air Force funds may be used for the National
     Headquarters and key staff (wing financial analysts, wing administrators, NTC personnel,
     etc.), at regional, state, or territorial headquarters of the CAP, including funds for the
     payment of staff compensation and benefits, administrative expenses, travel, per diem
     and allowances, rent and utilities, and other operational expenses. Air Force funds for
     staff at wing level may only be used for execution or support of Air Force assigned
     missions.
     7.32.2.4. Equipment Purchases. Air Force funds may be used for the purchase of
     major end items of equipment required by the CAP to carry out its missions and
     programs (including aircraft, motor vehicles, computers, and communications
     equipment). In the event any of this equipment is replaced, the proceeds from the sale of
     the equipment to be replaced will be used to offset the cost of acquiring new equipment
     IAW Department of Defense Grants and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS), OMB
     Circular cost principles, and other applicable laws and regulations. Aircraft procurement
     funds may be used to purchase new aircraft; initial spares and repair parts ordered at the
     time of purchase; common ground support equipment; simulators and training devices;
     special purpose ADPE, modification kits (to include installation), and other aircraft
     equipment.
     7.32.2.5. Equipment Maintenance. Air Force funds may be used for placing into
     serviceable condition, improving, and maintaining equipment (including aircraft, motor
     vehicles, computers, and communications equipment) owned or leased by the CAP.
     7.32.2.6. Equipment Lease. Air Force funds may be used for the lease of items of
     equipment only if specifically approved by the Air Force.
     7.32.2.7. CAP Cadet Program. Air Force funds may be used to support CAP cadet
     programs by providing funds, supplies, or equipment for:
        7.32.2.7.1. Articles of the Air Force uniform that CAP Cadets are authorized to wear.
        7.32.2.7.2. Orientation flights in powered or non-powered aircraft (gliders).
        7.32.2.7.3. CAP Demand Drug Reduction program as approved and funded by
        AF/SG with the 3400 appropriation (PE 88788F, Fund Code 30).
136                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


         7.32.2.7.4. International Air Cadet Exchange Program (IACE).
         7.32.2.7.5. Other activities IAW AFI 10-2701.
      7.32.2.8. Aerospace Education. The Air Force may provide funds to CAP for
      educational materials concerning aerospace education and STEM subjects (science,
      technology, engineering and math) for distribution to teachers and students in K-12
      classrooms and other youth development organizations. The Air Force may also provide
      funds to CAP to conduct K-12 teacher conferences and workshops in the fields of
      aerospace education and STEM subjects. SECAF delegates approval authority to
      AETC/ED to determine whether such expenditures further the fulfillment of the Air
      Force missions and objectives, is consistent with DoD Directive 5410.18, Public Affairs
      Community Relations Policy, and the AETC Community Outreach and Diversity in
      Operations program, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Section 9444(b)(12). This approval
      authority may be further delegated.
  7.32.3. Additional Reimbursement Guidance. Pursuant to the budget approval process
  outlined in AFI 10-2701, any expenditure of appropriated funds not included in section 7E of
  this AFI must be approved by the AETC/CC or his designee at AETC. The following
  instructions supplement the general guidance mentioned in previous paragraphs.
      7.32.3.1. Supplies, Consumables, and Fees. When performing missions or programs
      assigned and approved by the Air Force, including training, evaluations, and inspections,
      the Air Force may reimburse the CAP for expenses of supplies, consumables, and fees.
      This includes, but is not limited to, aviation/automotive fuel, lubricants, deice, aircraft
      preheat, mission specific/essential hanger fees, aircraft oxygen service, supplies used
      while enroute to/from and while performing the mission, and fuel for portable generators
      required for the mission.
      7.32.3.2. Aircraft and Specialized Equipment Maintenance – Corporate Owned
      Aircraft. The Air Force provides appropriated funds to ensure the CAP is reimbursed
      for all aircraft and specialized equipment maintenance expenses on all corporate owned
      aircraft. Fleet-wide reimbursement will not exceed actual fleet-wide expenses.
      Maintenance costs for corporate owned aircraft may be reimbursed based on HQ CAP-
      USAF approved flying hour reimbursement rates by aircraft type, actual reimbursement
      of maintenance actions, or a combination of these two methods.
      7.32.3.3. Aircraft Maintenance – Non-corporate Aircraft. Contingent on AFAMs and
      the non-availability of CAP aircraft, maintenance costs for non-corporate owned aircraft
      will be reimbursed based on HQ CAP-USAF approved flying hour reimbursement rates
      by aircraft type.
      7.32.3.4. Specialized Equipment. The CAP, with the approval of HQ CAP-USAF, may
      establish reimbursable flying hour rates for the use of specialized equipment to include,
      but not limited to Hyperspectral imaging, and Satellite Digital imaging systems.
      7.32.3.5. Program Income. With the approval of HQ CAP-USAF, the CAP may
      establish reimbursement of supplies and usage of equipment provided in support of
      approved mission requests. Proceeds will be recorded as program income and will only
      be used to further overall program objectives. In other words, program income may only
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   137


       be spent on those activities that would be authorized support with Air Force appropriated
       funds.
       7.32.3.6. Distance Learning. Air Force funds may be used for Distance Learning
       initiatives in support of CAP‘s education and training programs that enable CAP to fulfill
       the missions and programs assigned by the Air Force.
7.33. Non-Allowable Expenses. The Air Force does not have the authority to reimburse or
disburse funds to the CAP for expenses deemed non-allowable by any law, directive, or
regulation. Further restrictions are listed and identified in Department of Defense Grants and
Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) and OMB Circulars.
7.34. Supporting Air Force-CAP Liaison Offices. Air Force-CAP liaison offices, as opposed
to CAP organizations, are USAF ―special activities‖. HQ AU administers and accounts for funds
that finance the direct operating expenses of Air Force CAP liaison offices. Upon request of Air
Force CAP liaison offices, commanders of Air Force activities furnish administrative and
logistical support following procedures in this chapter.
   7.34.1. The Air Force furnishes Air Force CAP liaison offices and personnel at National
   Headquarters CAP the following administrative and logistical support without
   reimbursement:
       7.34.1.1. Routine office and administrative supplies and equipment required by Air
       Force personnel assigned to Air Force liaison offices.
       7.34.1.2. Special mission aircraft, automotive, and other Air Force equipment carried on
       current Air Force accountable records and assigned for use by Air Force personnel at
       National Headquarters CAP or the Air Force liaison offices. They receive maintenance
       and supply support from the nearest Air Force base responsible for logistical support.

Section 7F—Disaster Relief in the United States, Its Territories and Possessions

7.35. Overview:
   7.35.1. Air Force Participation. The military services have historically participated in
   emergency assistance to civil authorities during periods of disaster caused by natural
   phenomena. The applicable legal authority requires us to distinguish between assistance
   provided to (1) states, territories, and possessions of the United States and (2) foreign
   countries and areas. Air Force guidance is to provide the required emergency military
   assistance to civil authorities for a limited period in domestic emergencies, using resources
   not required to do essential Air Force military missions.
   7.35.2. Implementing Authorities:
       7.35.2.1. Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42 U.S.C. Chapter 58). Authorizes federal
       assistance to states and local governments in major disasters to alleviate damage and
       suffering. If directed by the President of the United States, Federal agencies may provide
       assistance to states and local governments in keeping with the act.
       7.35.2.2. Executive Orders 11575, 11725, and 13228 (Oct 8,2001: Establishing the
       Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council).
       7.35.2.3. DoD Directive 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); DoD
       Directive 3025.16, Military Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officer (EPLO) Program;
       DoD 3025.1-M, DoD Manual for Civil Emergencies (Chapter 9, Funding, Accounting,
       and Reimbursement); AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities.
7.36. Air Force Responsibilities:
   7.36.1. Domestic Emergencies:
       7.36.1.1. The Department of the Army is the DoD executive agent. Department of the
       Army coordinates and controls military support for civil authorities in the event of
       domestic emergencies.
       7.36.1.2. The Department of the Air Force assists the Department of the Army in
       executing domestic emergency operations consistent with the Air Force‘s primary
       mission:
       7.36.1.3. HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) is the planning agent for Air Force
       participation in domestic emergencies.
       7.36.1.4. Each Air Force commander, as directed, assists civil authorities for a limited
       period in domestic emergencies, provided resources used are not needed for essential
       military missions. Resources provided are subject to military command and (excepting
       consumable items such as fuel, food, and clothing) are subject to recall to meet Air Force
       operational requirements.
          7.36.1.4.1. Commanders develop plans and training programs to protect personnel
          and all other resources of their commands in the event of domestic emergencies (see
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       139


          AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
          Operations).
   7.36.2. Unified Commands. Commanders of unified commands who have within their
   geographic area the states of Alaska or Hawaii, or territories or possessions of the United
   States, are responsible for controlling and coordinating military support of disaster relief
   operations within their assigned area of responsibility.
7.37. Funding Procedures:
   7.37.1. Budget estimates, operating budgets, and execution plans do not include funds for
   disaster relief operations. The Air Force does not reserve funds for these purposes. The Air
   Force usually undertakes these operations on the basis that costs which are additive to normal
   operating expenses are reimbursed by the agency that requests Air Force participation.
   Usually, it is necessary for the Air Force activity providing disaster relief assistance to absorb
   such costs initially within existing fund availability. HQ USAF or MAJCOMs make funding
   adjustments for these unprogrammed expenditures later to the extent possible. SAF/FMB
   may establish an Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code to identify the support costs
   associated with disaster relief operations. When you provide support before SAF/FMB
   establishes an Air Force-wide ESP code, the MAJCOM or installation providing such
   support may create its own interim ESP code (see Chapter 4, paragraph 4.12).
   7.37.2. If an Air Force activity takes part in disaster relief, and reimbursement for the costs
   incurred is necessary, advise HQ USAF through command channels of the funds required to
   finance the relief activities.
   7.37.3. If Air Force participation in disaster relief results in expenses that are additive to
   normal operating expenses, the MAJCOM sends requests for reimbursement for major
   disaster support to DFAS for consolidation and forwarding to Commander, US Army Forces
   Command, Attn: AFCO-PBO, Ft McPherson GA 30330. If the disaster or other emergency is
   not declared a major disaster by Presidential Proclamation, the supporting Air Force activity
   sends requests for reimbursements to the recipients of the assistance on completing the relief
   operations for each specific disaster, or at the end of each fiscal quarter if the disaster is of
   extended duration. Requests for reimbursement must contain enough detail to identify and
   segregate:
       7.37.3.1. Personal services.
7.37.3.2. Travel and per diem.
       7.37.3.3. All other expenses including those that apply to emergency assistance rendered
       at the specific request of a Regional Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency
       (FEMA), before declaration of a major disaster.
       7.37.3.4. Such other costs or expenditures as the Administration, FEMA, and the
       Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may approve, based on the
       justification submitted. Requests for reimbursement must cite the specific request for
       assistance issued by a Regional Director, FEMA, under which costs were incurred and
       the state in which assistance was furnished.
   7.37.4. Expenses incurred for disaster relief participation may include:
 140                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       7.37.4.1. Pay of additional civilian personnel temporarily hired specifically for the
       disaster operation.
       7.37.4.2. Overtime pay of civilian personnel.
       7.37.4.3. Travel and per diem expenses of Air Force personnel (military and civilian).
       7.37.4.4. Consumable items of supply requisitioned for civilian disaster refugees.
       7.37.4.5. Transportation of personnel, supplies, and equipment.
       7.37.4.6. Repairing or reconditioning nonconsumable items returned.
       7.37.4.7. Repair parts used to repair end items located at the disaster area (excluding
       depot or field maintenance on a time-compliance basis).
       7.37.4.8. Packing and crating supplies and equipment.
       7.37.4.9. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL).
       7.37.4.10. Items of supplies and equipment lost, destroyed, or damaged beyond
       economical repair.
   7.37.5. FEMA bears the cost of any major rehabilitation or modification of real property
   under control of the Air Force that FEMA requires and which alters the property to an extent
   that affects its future use by the Air Force.
   7.37.6. The following items are not eligible for reimbursement in connection with disaster
   relief assistance, but are normal operating expenses:
       7.37.6.1. Regular pay and allowances of Air Force personnel (except travel and per diem
       costs).
       7.37.6.2. Administrative overhead costs.
       7.37.6.3. Annual and sick leave, retirement, and other military or civilian benefits.
       7.37.6.4. Cost of telephone, telegram, or other means of electrical transmission used to
       requisition items into a disaster area, or to replenish depot stocks.
   7.37.7. Major commanders must have a prior understanding with Regional Directors,
   FEMA; directors, American Red Cross area offices; and state and local government
   authorities regarding requisitioning and reimbursement responsibilities on the part of the
   requesting agency. Also, commanders should reach prior agreement on the validity of
   charges claimed by the Air Force under exceptional circumstances. For example, it may be
   necessary for components of other military services to furnish personnel, supplies, ground
   safety, equipment, etc., by means of airlift, airdrop, or other emergency means. In many
   instances, authorized representatives of the requesting agency are not at the disaster scene to
   certify delivery, performance, etc. Therefore, the agreements should provide that claims for
   costs of such supplies and services, as well as incidental costs, are valid and will constitute
   proper claims for reimbursement.

Section 7G—Disaster Relief in Foreign Countries

7.38. Overview. The Department of State, including the Agency for International Development
(AID), determines when emergency foreign disaster relief is to be provided as a humanitarian
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    141


service, consistent with United States foreign policy goals. The Department of State delegates
authority to the chiefs of diplomatic missions to obligate up to $25,000 for each disaster
emergency. It also provides timely information to the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense,
International Security Affairs (OASD/ISA) for requirements of specific disaster relief operations.
OASD/ISA informs the DoD Comptroller (OUSD(C)) of the contemplated use of funds or
resources for foreign disaster relief operations. Based on this information, OUSD(C) initiates
appropriate financial or funding actions.
7.39. Air Force Guidance. Subject to overriding military mission requirements, MAJCOMs
and operating units must respond rapidly to requests for assistance in specific foreign disaster
relief operations received from United States diplomatic missions, Department of State/U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), orders from Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), unified
or specified commands, or from HQ USAF.
   7.39.1. The Chief of the Diplomatic Mission or the Department of State/USAID must
   specify in advance the amount of funds authorized for expenditure for foreign disaster relief.
   Air Force activities can not exceed this specified amount unless the Department of
   State/USAID authorizes an additional amount.
   7.39.2. Air Force activities should undertake disaster relief operations expected to involve
   reimbursable costs that are not to be funded from, or which will exceed, the $25,000
   available to the Chief of the Diplomatic Mission only after Department of State/USAID
   furnishes OASD(ISA) the appropriate authorization for the funds required.
   7.39.3. But, an Air Force installation commander in the area of a foreign disaster undertakes
   prompt relief operations when humanitarian or mercy considerations make it advisable. Such
   disaster relief operations must be on the basis of the minimum essential required to preclude
   embarrassment to the United States. If such occurs, installation commanders must
   immediately advise the appropriate unified commander and MAJCOM of the action taken
   and request further guidance.
7.40. Funding Procedures. Air Force execution plans and appropriations do not provide for
foreign disaster relief operations. Therefore, costs incurred by Air Force activities to support
disaster relief operations are reimbursable from the Department of State or USAID. SAF/FMB
may establish an ESP code to identify these costs. If you incur costs before then, set up an
interim MAJCOM or installation ESP code (see Chapter 4, paragraph 4.12).
   7.40.1. Reimbursable Expenses.
       7.40.1.1. Reimbursable expenses include, but are not limited to:
           7.40.1.1.1. Pay of all regular employed civilian personnel, both United States citizens
           and foreign nationals, who take part in the relief operation. For United States citizen
           personnel, compute costs on basic salary plus appropriate percent (DFAS-DE 7010.5-
           R) to cover holidays, leave, and other benefits. For foreign national personnel,
           compute on the basis of total cost to the United States.
           7.40.1.1.2. All costs of additional civilian personnel employed specifically for the
           operation.
           7.40.1.1.3. Overtime pay of all civilian personnel attributable to participation in the
           operation.
 142                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


           7.40.1.1.4. Actual per diem, travel, and subsistence expenses for both military and
           civilian personnel.
           7.40.1.1.5. Pay and allowances of all military personnel participating in the relief
           operations (see Chapter 5, paragraph 5.4.4).
           7.40.1.1.6. Supplies and equipment from stock or special one-time purchases using
           standard prices used for issue to DoD activities, plus applicable accessorial costs for
           packing, crating, handling, and transportation.
           7.40.1.1.7. Transportation of personnel, equipment, and supplies.
           7.40.1.1.8. Accessorial costs and transportation cost associated with transferring
           excess items to Department of State/USAID without reimbursement for the actual
           items transferred.
           7.40.1.1.9. Packing, crating, and handling of equipment and supplies at actual cost.
           7.40.1.1.10. Use of equipment on a rate per mile or similar factor determined from
           the latest cost reports. The cost of equipment loaned and not returned is reimbursable.
           The cost of returned equipment in damaged condition is chargeable at repair cost.
           Consider the cost of processing equipment in and out of storage as well as
           maintenance requirements upon return of the equipment.
           7.40.1.1.11. Use of military aircraft is chargeable on the basis of hours flown as
           provided in applicable instructions. Rates include reimbursement for aircraft use,
           including normal crew per diem, fuel and oil, maintenance (including local purchase
           of spare parts and depot maintenance), and aircraft attrition. Additional expenses,
           such as for deicing, landing fees, parking fees, and other like expenses must be
           separately computed because they are not included in hourly rates.
       7.40.1.2. Price all other services or support rendered not specifically covered in
       paragraph 7.40.1 above on a mutually agreed to basis. When feasible, establish such
       prices before giving the support. Use prices charged other United States government
       agencies for similar services, if these rates are available. Otherwise, compute prices to
       fully reimburse Air Force appropriations for ―out-of pocket‖ expenses.
   7.40.2. Non-reimbursable expenses are normally limited to materials, supplies, and
   equipment determined to be excess and transferred to the Department of State/USAID.
   Accessorial costs and transportation associated with transferring excess property are
   reimbursable.
   7.40.3. Billing Procedures. Follow DFAS-DE 7010.5-R.
7.41. Documentation Requirements. Installation FSOs/FMA participating in disaster relief
operations must obtain documentation to support billings, set up accounts receivable, and obtain
reimbursement. Consider using daily cost progress reports because of the expenditure limitations
described in paragraph 7.39. Keep statistical data on military personnel expenses and other
non-reimbursable costs for informational and historical purposes.

Section 7H—International Military Activities

7.42. Overview:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      143


   7.42.1. This section contains Air Force guidance and responsibilities for budgeting and
   funding in support of international military headquarters (per DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume
   11A, Chapter 9) and other international military agencies of the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO), as referred to in paragraph 7.43. It applies to all Air Force activities
   that carry out responsibilities supporting the international military activities listed in
   paragraph 7.43.
   7.42.2. DoD directives establish the responsibility and methods for providing budgetary,
   financial, logistical, and administrative support to international military headquarters and
   other international military administrative activities. Basic authority and limitations are in 22
   U.S.C. 315 and in section 102(a) of Executive Order (EO) 10893.
   7.42.3. The appropriate organization at each Air Force echelon that performs budgetary and
   funding functions will enforce the provisions of this chapter. This includes:

      military organizations or headquarters located within CONUS.
      7.42.3.2. HQ USAFE for Air Force support to international headquarters or agencies
      within the geographical boundaries of USEUCOM.
7.43. Responsibility for National Support:
   7.43.1. DoD assigned the agencies shown in Figure 7.2 as the administrative agents for
   performing budgetary, financial, logistical, and administrative support of the national cost of
   United States military elements of the listed headquarters and agencies. Support these United
   States elements according to Air Force standards and directives. NOTE: ―United States
   Military Elements‖ include US military organizations on duty with and for the benefit of an

   which the cost arises will bear these costs.
      7.43.2.1. Finance national costs of the United States elements from the O&M
      appropriation except for:
          7.43.2.1.1. Personally assigned equipment provided by individual United States
          military departments. Note: ―Personally Assigned Equipment‖ includes any article
          assigned to an individual by name, for his or her exclusive use, and which moves with
          that individual. Excludes items assigned for exclusive use of an individual which
          attach to the functions of his or her office and which are included in appropriate
          organizational or other entitlement documents.

                                                                      Department of Navy
 *The Secretary of the military department charged with determining United States national
 requirements and providing logistical and administrative support to a United States element in
 a specific area.
7.44. Cross-Servicing. In carrying out the responsibilities indicated above, the designated
administrative agent will use interservice support to the maximum extent possible. Such
interservice support will be on a cross-servicing basis. Do not establish support activity where
such support can be rendered by an agency at an existing facility in the same general
geographical area or where the service can be economically performed from indigenous sources.
In areas where a unified command exercises jurisdiction, the unified command coordinates with
activities of the administrative agents concerned.
7.45. Reimbursable Support:
   7.45.1. The appropriate administrative agent is responsible for providing services (other than
   personal) or materiel to international military organizations, headquarters, or agencies, on an
 146                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   outright sale or lease basis. Limit the services and materiel to those normally used by United
   States forces and available to the administrative agent from overseas or domestic United
   States military sources, including those of other military departments. In order to ascertain
   the impact that international requests may have on its logistics operations, the administrative
   agent may coordinate directly with the international customer to obtain:
       7.45.1.1. Estimated United States fiscal year logistical support requirements.
       7.45.1.2. Estimated breakdown of requirements to indicate support which will be
       requested either on an outright sale or lease basis.
   7.45.2. The administrative agent should obtain written understanding regarding the items it
   will furnish under an outright sale or lease arrangement. Include a statement as to the agreed
   sale or rental value of the item and the approval of appropriate higher authority in the
   international organization.
   7.45.3. Except for organizational equipment of United States support units (which is desired
   for return to the United States), the administrative agent should encourage the international
   customer to purchase, rather than lease, the requisitioned materiel. If the life expectancy of
   the item is less than 3 years, or has a value less than $5,000, furnish it only under outright
   sales arrangement.
   7.45.4. For items priced $5,000 or more furnished under lease arrangements, charge rent on
   an indefinite basis according to paragraph 7.47.
   7.45.5. OSD will reimburse the appropriate military department in full for support furnished
   on an outright sale basis, as well as for annual rental of leased equipment.
   7.45.6. Make invoices for reimbursable issues on the basis of constructive delivery. When a
   military department other than that of the administrative agent supplies the international
   customer‘s requirement, the supplying department must bill the administrative agent on
   SF 1080 and be reimbursed without delay by the administrative agent. Subsequently, the
   administrative agent must obtain reimbursement under paragraph 7.46.
7.46. Reimbursement Procedure:
   7.46.1. The military department furnishing the materiel or services for which a
   reimbursement is due will originate an SF 1080, billing OSD, except as noted in paragraph
   7.46.3 below.
   7.46.2. The Comptroller of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) or the
   international organization concerned, after reviewing his or her copies of the SF 1080A, must
   notify OSD that the charge has been accepted and credit has been given to the United States
   government on the offset accounts for the amount approved. OSD will then execute and
   return the SF 1080, Vouchers for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds, to the
   billing office for payment and reimbursement.
   7.46.3. EXCEPTION: When furnishing materiel or services on a reimbursable basis to
   international military organizations or headquarters located in the CONUS and to which
   contributions are made in U.S. dollars for use in their normal operations, the military
   department furnishing the materiel or services will bill the international military organization,
   headquarters, or agency directly and obtain immediate reimbursement in U.S. dollars.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     147


7.47. DoD Guidance. DoD established specific guidance for reimbursable support provided
international military headquarters and other international agencies:
   7.47.1. Pricing Guidance and Accessorial Charges. See AFMAN 23-110 and section C,
   Chapter 5 of AFI 65-601.
   7.47.2. Leasing Guidance:
      7.47.2.1. Determine the annual lease rental price as follows:
          7.47.2.1.1. Price of equipment computed according to pricing guidance, plus
          accessorial charges divided by service life.
          7.47.2.1.2. Items priced at $5,000 or more: estimated service life following
          instructions of the administrative agent (including obsolescence considerations for
          specialized types of equipment). When life expectancy of the item is less than 3 years,
          furnish it only under a sales agreement.
          7.47.2.1.3. Pay equipment rental semiannually.
      7.47.2.2. Leases must contain provisions requiring the international headquarters or
      agency to assume all responsibility for liability suits resulting from international use of
      the property brought against the United States government by reason of the fact that the
      title to lease equipment is vested in the United States.
      7.47.2.3. Prepare equipment leases following departmental guidance of the
      administrative agent. (Note: establish a separate charge for the cost of all maintenance of
      leased equipment. This guidance also applies to equipment transferred under an outright
      or deferred sale arrangement.)
   7.47.3. Services:
      7.47.3.1. Price personal services at actual cost. For United States civilian employees, this
      is the cost of direct labor, plus appropriate percent (per DFAS-DE 7010.5-R) of direct
      labor to cover annual leave, holidays, sick leave, and contributions for group life
      insurance, civil service retirement, and health benefits. For indigenous employees,
      compute total cost to the United States. Civilian housing allowances in overseas areas are
      reimbursable at actual cost of current established rates.
      7.47.3.2. Charge for utility services at actual cost.
      7.47.3.3. Charge for transportation services on the basis of one of the following: actual
      cost; application of accessorial percentage appropriate to the area in which the
      transportation is furnished; Air Mobility Command (AMC) or Military Sealift Command
      (MSC) tariff rates under the DWCF.
      7.47.3.4. Service contract charges will include replacement factors based on average
      service life, costs for field maintenance, and accessorial charges where appropriate. Initial
      charges under a service contract must have the concurrence of the appropriate
      international comptroller.
7.48. Paying United States Personnel:
 148                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   7.48.1. Civilian employees of the United States government assigned or detailed to
   organizations listed in paragraph 7.50 retain their status as federal employees. Pay them
   from federal funds (usually, O&M) using the federal pay and allowance scale.
   7.48.2. If a United States military member fills the civilian position, budget and report as
   follows:
       7.48.2.1. Charge the military incumbent charge to the military personnel ceiling of the
       appropriate military department.
       7.48.2.2. Pay and allowances are at United States scales and are the responsibility of the
       individual‘s military service.
   7.48.3. The DoD Regional Office will periodically check the validity of amounts credited to
   the United States for pay and allowances of referenced organizations. NATO auditors
   provide a double verification during each annual audit.
7.49. Costs Included and Excluded from International Budgets. International military
headquarters and agencies approved for international financial support may include in their
international budget items shown in paragraph 7.48.1 and must exclude items shown in
paragraph 7.49.2 (national budget costs).

Section 7I—Use of Air Force Research and Test Facilities

7.50. Overview. This section prescribes funding procedures for using Air Force research and
test facilities. See paragraph 7.51 for budget and funding responsibilities for the Air Force
Research Laboratory (AFRL). See AFI 99-103 and paragraph 7.52. for guidance on major ranges
and test facilities.
7.51. Budgeting and Funding of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL):
   7.51.1. AFMC budgets and funds for the costs to develop, operate, and maintain AFRL in
   support of assigned development programs and associated test workload.
   7.51.2. The users of AFRL, as identified in paragraph 7.50, budget and fund for
   reimbursable costs incurred by AFMC in supporting user workloads according to the
   following criteria.
       7.51.2.1. Air Force organizations reimburse the performing Air Force Research
       Laboratory (AFRL) technical directorates for all RDT&E direct costs incurred in support
       of user workload, excluding military labor, which are directly attributable to direct job
       (customer) orders. In addition, AFRL technology directorates will reallocate funds and
       also charge to its internal Advanced Technology Development program non-military
       indirect and overhead costs related to the program.
   7.51.3. Direct costs are those expenses that can reasonably, economically, and consistently
   be immediately and directly identified to a customer (user) program or project and are
   documented on a job order. Direct costs may derive from contractor support or work
   performed in-house. Direct costs subject to reimbursement normally include, but are not
   necessarily limited to:
       7.51.3.1. Military labor costed at standard rates. (NOTE: Military labor is not
       reimbursable from DoD users).
       7.51.3.2. Civilian labor costs including the costs of related personnel benefits.
152                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      7.51.3.3. Materiel, supplies, and utilities.
      7.51.3.4. Equipment and its maintenance and repair due to usage. Installation of
      equipment and its removal, if it has no further base or factory use after the job order is
      completed.
      7.51.3.5. Miscellaneous contractual services, including T&E activity operation and
      maintenance contractual services.
      7.51.3.6. Printing, photos, and reproduction.
      7.51.3.7. Maintenance and depot level reparable costs of test support aircraft and ground
      support equipment to include a pro rata share of depot level maintenance.
      7.51.3.8. Travel and per diem to support customer user programs, after acceptance of a
      job order.
      7.51.3.9. Transportation and cost of supplies and equipment or other material identified
      as direct costs.
      7.51.3.10. Civil engineering work requirements established by a customer.
      7.51.3.11. Facility operations when the entire facility is dedicated to a specific user.
      7.51.3.12. Real property leases dedicated to a customer program.
      7.51.3.13. Automated data processing equipment (ADPE) support, including prorated
      rental and maintenance charges, billed to customers through product service rates.
      7.51.3.14. Additional communications, special electric power, or similar requirements.
  7.51.4. Other DoD components reimburse performing the AFRL for all direct and indirect
  costs incurred in support of user workload, excluding military labor.
  7.51.5. United States government agencies, other than DoD components, reimburse
  performing AFRL technical directorates for all direct and indirect costs incurred, including
  military labor.
  7.51.6. State and local government agencies, United States domestic commercial users and
  foreign governments reimburse performing AFRL technical directorates for all direct and
  indirect costs incurred, including military labor and full user charges according to DoD FMR
  7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapters 1 and 4.
  7.51.7. Where mutual benefit exists and joint participation is desirable, share total direct
  costs in direct ratio to the amount of benefit received by each participant, subject to
  negotiation between the laboratory and the user on a case-by-case basis.
  7.51.8. Directors of AFRL technical directorates may waive reimbursement from Air Force
  customers up to $20,000 on a case-by-case basis. This permits the laboratory directors to
  provide informal support, to assist O&M-funded commanders in performing vital Air Force
  activities (for example, accident investigation, assistance with an engine problem, analysis of
  a structural problem, etc.). Generally, informal support is effort the laboratory may provide
  on a quick-reaction basis to an Air Force customer who has not had an opportunity to
  program and budget for the requirement, in contrast to formal support, which is more long-
  term in nature and which the customer usually programs and budgets.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      153


7.52. Funding Responsibilities for Designated Major Range and Test Facility Base
(MRFTB) Activities. This section establishes the framework for Air Force activities to
uniformly and consistently charge customers for materials and services. The Secretary of
Defense designates the following Air Force activities as DoD major ranges and test facilities (see
AFI 99-103):

Table 7.2. Major Ranges and Test Facilities.
 45th Space Wing (Air Force Space Command Eastern Range), Patrick AFB
 30th Space Wing (Air Force Space Command Western Range), Vandenburg AFB
 Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB
 Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB
 Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), at Hill AFB
 46 Test Wing, Eglin AFB – Includes 46 Test Group (Holloman AFB)
 Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) at Nellis AFB
   7.52.1. Effective beginning 1 October 2005 (FY 2006), and in accordance with Section 232
   of the FY 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the institutional and overhead
   costs of facilities or resources within Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) program
   areas are to be funded through the major test and evaluation type/related budget accounts.
   MRTFB activities listed in Table 7.2 shall be funded in a uniform manner. The categories of
   goods and services charged to the MRTFB customers shall be applied consistently among all
   the MRTFB activities. MRTFB activities will establish procedures to ensure costs are
   uniformly and consistently charged to customers in accordance with this instruction.
   7.52.2. MRTFB Funding. MRTFB activities are funded with institutional funds, Direct
   Budget Authority (DBA) and customer funds, Reimbursable Authority (RBA). The type of
   customer determines the level of RBA charged to the customer and whether they are charged
   only direct costs or direct costs plus a level of indirect costs. The following describes the
   types of costs included in the direct and indirect costs categories:
       7.52.2.1. Direct Costs: Those costs that are directly attributable to the use of the facility
       or resource for testing under a particular program, over and above the institutional
       (appropriated) and overhead (indirect) costs with respect to the facility or resource.
           7.52.2.1.1. Examples of chargeable direct costs include labor, material, utilities,
           equipment, supplies, items damaged or consumed during testing, specific calibration
           of instrumentation when part of a range operation supporting a specific customer,
           maintenance, and operational costs directly attributable to a specific program.
           7.52.2.1.2. By mutual agreement, investments in new or existing T&E facilities may
           be funded, in whole or in part, by one or more DoD customers of a MRTFB activity.
           This agreement must delineate responsibilities for funding, staffing, operating, and
           maintaining the facility and must be approved by all parties prior to obligation of any
           funds for the project.
154                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      7.52.2.2. Indirect Costs:      The costs of maintaining, operating, upgrading and
      modernizing the facility or resource are indirect costs.
         7.52.2.2.1. Examples of indirect costs include time-based preventative maintenance
         and maintenance due to usage, the costs of leases except when the cost of said lease
         can be directly associated with a specific customer, operating, upgrading, and
         modernizing the facility or resource, general calibration of instrumentation,
         maintenance and repair of shop machinery, replacement of obsolete components, and
         purchase of spares.
  7.52.3. Institutionally funded (appropriated) and Overhead (indirect) costs will not be
  charged to DoD Component users, and will remain as costs fully borne by the Institutionally
  funded program element accounts comprising the MRTFB structure. Institutional and
  Overhead costs are defined as the jointly or commonly used costs of maintaining, operating,
  upgrading, and modernizing the facility or resource. Overhead (indirect) costs will not
  include any incremental cost directly attributable to the use of the facility or resource for
  testing under a particular program.
  7.52.4. DoD Component Users. DoD customers shall reimburse MRTFB activities for
  direct costs readily identifiable to use of the facility or resource for testing under a particular
  program, over and above the institutional and overhead costs with respect to the facility or
  resource.
  7.52.5. Non-DoD Component Users. This includes Federal, State or Local Government
  agencies, allied foreign governments, defense contractors, and when authorized, private
  organizations and U.S. commercial enterprise customers. MRTFB commanders shall charge
  all direct costs associated with a customer‘s order. Chargeable direct costs include labor,
  material, facilities, minor construction specifically performed for the customer, utilities,
  equipment, supplies and other resources damaged or consumed during testing or maintained
  for a particular user. Chargeable direct cost incurred by non-Working Capital Fund activities
  for other than DoD Components shall include all military personnel costs associated with a
  customer order.
      7.52.5.1. MRTFB commanders may charge indirect costs at their discretion. Any indirect
      costs incurred, but not billed to a customer, shall be billed to the activity‘s institutional
      funds. Institutional funding levels, however, shall not be increased to finance any
      additional indirect cost incurred due to sales to non-DoD activities.
         7.52.5.1.1. The commander of the MRTFB activity has been delegated the authority
         to determine appropriateness of the amount of indirect costs included in such a
         contract provision. Neither military retirement, unfunded civilian retirement, asset
         capitalization, nor depreciation shall be charged to the commercial customer.
         However, there are three exceptions to using provisions under P.L. 103-160.
         7.52.5.1.2. First, commercial space launch activity at the 30th and 45th Space Wings
         will be priced under provisions of the Commercial Launch Act of 1984 (amended in
         1988 and 1991).
         7.52.5.1.3. Second, when the use of a T&E activity has been included in a
         contractual agreement with a commercial user as government-furnished services, the
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    155


          commercial user will be charged based on the category of the contractual federal
          agency (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 12).
          7.52.5.1.4. Third, foreign governments will be billed full cost, unless a government
          agreement is in force (treaty, foreign military sales agreement, or other negotiated
          agreement). Reimbursable orders will indicate if the test effort is in support of FMS.
          Commercial users will meet the intent of the requirements in support of non-
          government test and evaluation. In some cases the direction in Domestic Technology
          Transfer may apply.
   7.52.6. Satisfy these criteria before using standard rates: (Note: ―standard rates‖ are
   computed cost rates that are set up for products and services and used to determine charges to
   the job order. By definition, standard rates are a proration of direct costs across the base to
   which they are applied. They are average costs that can be used in estimating and charging,
   and the use of such rates is encouraged).
      7.52.6.1. The rates must be applicable to the product or service. Costs of products and
      services that drastically change, or volume that cannot be easily identified will not be
      considered for standard rate computation.
      7.52.6.2. Major range and test facilities must use an approved accounting system or
      procedure to accumulate historical standard rate data providing for an audit trail.
      7.52.6.3. Major range and test facilities must validate standard rates at least annually.
      Adjust the rate if a rate cannot be validated within plus or minus five percent.

Section 7J—Support of Civil Disturbances

7.53. Funding Guidance:
   7.53.1. Follow this section when using military resources in civil disturbance control
   operations in the CONUS. Guidance for civil disturbance control operations in Alaska,
   Hawaii, and the territories and possessions of the United States is a responsibility of the
   commander of the unified command for the area involved. See USAF OPLAN 355-10.
   7.53.2. Air Force support provided in civil disturbance control operations will be on a
   reimbursable basis. The supporting Air Force activity will initially finance the cost involved
   from available resources.
   7.53.3. Reimbursable costs are those costs that would otherwise not have been incurred, that
   is, costs in excess of normal operating expenses.
   7.53.4. When applicable, civilian personnel services are reimbursable based on direct labor
   costs plus appropriate percent (per DFAS-DE 7010.5-R) for accrued leave and fringe
   benefits, additional hires, and overtime costs.
   7.53.5. Loan of protective items is on a reclaimable basis. The Air Force activity must
   request reimbursement for non-consumable Air Force property lost, damaged, or destroyed.
   In case of damaged property, reimbursement will be for reduced utility value. The lending
   agency determines reduced utility value.
   7.53.6. Usually, Air Force activities providing support for the civil disturbance control
   operation must absorb such costs initially within existing fund availability.
 156                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


Section 7K—Support of Civil Authorities in Airplane Hijacking Emergencies

7.54. Funding Guidance. It is DoD guidance to commit military resources in a support
capacity to other federal agencies in connection with airplane hijacking emergencies. Follow this
guidance:
   7.54.1. Reimbursement is required for expenses incident to chase aircraft.
   7.54.2. Cost of other support, including use of transport aircraft, helicopters, flares,
   parachutes, and communication equipment is also on a reimbursable basis. This includes cost
   of repairing or reconditioning non-consumable equipment that may be returned.
   7.54.3. Use MAJCOM or installation level ESP codes to identify these costs (see Chapter 4,
   paragraph 4.12).
   7.54.4. Bill the agencies requesting the service according to DFAS-DE 7010.5-R.

Section 7L—Support of the United States Secret Service

7.55. Statutory Basis and Implementing Directives:
   7.55.1. Public Laws 90-331 and 94-524 are the statutory basis for DoD support related to
   United States Secret Service protective responsibilities. The Presidential Protection Act of
   1976 (18 U.S.C. 3056), Public Law 94-524, is an express exception to the Posse Comitatus
   Act of 1976 (18 U.S.C. 1385).
   7.55.2. DoD Directive 3025.13, Employment of DoD Capabilities in Support of the U.S.
   Secret Service (USSS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), details types of support and
   the procedures to be used within DoD for support requested by the Secret Service. See
   DFAS-DE 7010.1-R and DFAS-DE 7010.5-R for specific accounting and reporting
   instructions.
7.56. Funding Guidance:
   7.56.1. Public Law 94-524 authorizes OSD support, on request by the Secret Service, to
   protect the President, Vice President, or other offices immediately next in order of succession
   to the Office of the President. The Air Force provides temporary support on a non-
   reimbursable basis, and permanent support on a reimbursable basis (see DFAS-DE 7010.5-R)
   for any Secret Service designated protectee.)
   7.56.2. Public Law 90-331, coupled with Public Law 94-524, Section 8, is the statutory basis
   for support to the Secret Service in protection of Presidential and Vice-Presidential
   candidates. This type of support is reimbursable, including temporary support, when
   requested by the Secret Service.

Section 7M—Joint-Use Facilities

7.57. Overview. This section provides uniform guidance on programming and financing joint-
use facilities at military installations. It implements DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter
6, Paragraph 060301 B.9. Apply these procedures when:
   7.57.1. Two or more DoD components jointly use any DoD installation and military
   construction is required.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    157


   7.57.2. Any military department uses facilities on DoD installations controlled by another
   department.
   7.57.3. Military departments and defense agencies occupy DoD installations under host-
   tenant relationships.
   7.57.4. Two or more DoD components directly or uniquely benefit from the provision of
   facilities in support of programs and operations (common-purpose facilities).
7.58. Responsibilities for Military Construction. Program and finance military construction
as follows:
   7.58.1. Single-use Facilities. The DoD component requiring military construction solely for
   its own use will program, obtain authorization when necessary, and finance the work
   involved.
   7.58.2. Joint-use Facilities. The military department which has jurisdiction over the host
   command will program, obtain authorization when necessary, and finance military
   construction which is planned for the joint use or joint occupancy of two or more DoD
   components.
   7.58.3. Common-purpose Facilities. The individual military departments, on a case-by-
   case basis, function as executive agents (i.e., Air Force for CENTCOM) for programs whose
   output directly and uniquely operate to the benefit of two or more DoD components.
       7.58.3.1. The affected DoD components sponsor requests for appropriate dedicated
       facilities for inclusion in the ―Military Construction Defense Agencies‖ program upon
       assignment or assumption of executive agency responsibility.
       7.58.3.2. The executive agent is responsible for: planning and programming all facilities;
       preparation of justification materials for incorporation in the Defense Agency books to be
       submitted to congressional committees; providing the lead witness for testimony before
       congressional committees; and military construction through use of the appropriate
       government construction agency upon receipt of authorization and funding.
   7.58.4. Required Facilities. The host military department programs, obtains authorization,
   and finances an extension, expansion, and/or increase of the capacity in the main utilities and
   communications or transportation systems in general accordance with the master plan of the
   installation, to support any required facilities, including those required by a tenant.
       7.58.4.1. The Secretary of Defense must approve deviations from this procedure for
       circumstances involving unusual conditions.
       7.58.4.2. The DoD components requiring the facility will program, obtain authorization,
       and finance transportation systems, communications, connecting utilities as an integral
       part of any single-use or common-purpose facility.
   7.58.5. Siting Facilities. The siting of any facility for a tenant DoD component must
   conform to the master plan of the installation or be in accordance with an agreed-upon
   location by the DoD components concerned.
       7.58.5.1. Standards of design and construction must conform to those of the host military
       department, as provided for in the master plan of subject base or installation.
 158                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       7.58.5.2. Exceptions are made in those instances where tactical or other operational
       considerations requiring limited duration of occupancy would not economically justify
       construction of facilities to higher standards.
   7.58.6. Utilization:
       7.58.6.1. The tenant DoD component or executive agent has exclusive use of any facility
       constructed for the duration of that DoD component‘s requirement. The facility will be
       made available to the host military department for utilization, without exchange of funds,
       upon termination of tenancy or use by the sponsoring military department.
       7.58.6.2. The host military department makes the facility, or an acceptable existing
       facility, available within a reasonable time period to the tenant DoD component or
       executive agent if the tenant DoD component has a requirement for use of the same
       facility at a later date.
       7.58.6.3. The host military department will not construct or acquire a new facility for the
       tenant DoD component or executive agent instead of returning the original facility or an
       acceptable existing substitute.
       7.58.6.4. The tenant DoD component or executive agent is responsible for obtaining a
       new facility if the host military department is unable to provide a facility to the tenant
       DoD component or executive agent without creating unacceptable conditions for the host
       military department.
7.59. Maintenance and Service Support. The DoD components concerned determine the
levels of maintenance and service support and the reimbursement therefore. These
determinations should be in consonance with existing agreements between two or more DoD
components, provided such agreements conform to DoD policies.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   159


                                          Chapter 8

 AIR FORCE PROCUREMENT APPROPRIATIONS (57*3010, 57*3011, 57*3020, AND
                           57*3080)

Section 8A—General Guidance

8.1. Scope and Availability of Appropriations:
   8.1.1. Use these appropriations to finance: (See AFMAN 65-604 for specific projects.)
      8.1.1.1. Weapons procurement
      8.1.1.2. Procurement of Aircraft
      8.1.1.3. Procurement of Space Systems (Air Force Space Command - AFSPC)
      8.1.1.4. Training devices
      8.1.1.5. Support equipment
      8.1.1.6. Munitions (see paragraph 8.1.4 below)
      8.1.1.7. Vehicular equipment
      8.1.1.8. Communications and electronic equipment
      8.1.1.9. Other organizational and base support equipment
      8.1.1.10. All services and materiel provided by contractors or the Defense Working
      Capital Funds (DWCF) for update kits and modification including installation, and for
      qualification and acceptance tests during the acquisition cycle. Exclude any temporary
      duty travel of participating operating commands.
      8.1.1.11. Program Management Administration (PMA) costs of mission essential
      program office operations – which include TDY (See paragraph 8.49 for limitations.)
      8.1.1.12. Transition planning for depot activation.
   8.1.2. Use these appropriations for new obligations only for the 3 fiscal years designated in
   the appropriation act and identified in the Treasury Department‘s official symbols and titles
   for federal accounts. For example, appropriation 570/23010 is available for obligation from 1
   October 1999 through 30 September 2002, after which it expires for new obligations. When
   the appropriation expires, use it only to liquidate obligations and make authorized obligation
   adjustments for 5 more years under its original Treasury symbol. (See Chapter 6,
   paragraph 6.4.2)
   8.1.3. If you cannot obligate specific programs within the period for which funds were
   justified and approved, you must budget any additional funding required to complete them in
   future years as new requirements.
   8.1.4. Expense/Investment Threshold. The expense/investment threshold, established by
   law (Annual Appropriations Act General Provisions), is currently $250,000. Equipment and
   items costing in excess of $250,000 shall be funded in the Procurement Appropriations
   only, not with O&M funds.
 160                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


8.2. Depot Level Reparables (DLR):
   8.2.1. Air Force item managers procure DLR parts, to include initial spares, from the
   Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG)
   - Supply. Air Force MAJCOMs will use local O&M funds to purchase "non-fly" DLRs from
   DWCF. Flying Hour DLRs will continue to be purchased from the DWCF. Fund Holders,
   to include AFRC, ANG, CAM (Active Duty), TWCF, and AFSOC will purchase those DLRs
   IAW flying hour billing procedures.
   8.2.2. Do not use the DWCF to pay for:
       8.2.2.1. Initial and replenishment spares for munitions coded and managed items
       financed from the 3010 (BP 1600), 3020 (BP 2600) and 3011(BP 3500) appropriations.
       Munitions initial spares are funded by the procurement appropriations, but CSAG-Supply
       (formerly MSD) acquires the initial items and the procurement appropriations reimburse
       CSAG-Supply upon delivery of the item into Air Force inventory. Replenishment of
       munitions-coded DLRs is handled per paragraph 8.2.1
       8.2.2.2. Non-stock listed items, e.g., classified and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)
       programs.
   8.2.3. Use the DWCF, Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group - Supply, (formerly
   Material Support Division) to acquire initial DLR spares.
       8.2.3.1. Initial spares are funded by the procurement appropriations, but the CSAG-
       Supply acquires the items and the procurement appropriations reimburse CSAG-Supply
       upon delivery of the initial stock into Air Force inventory. Once the initial level is
       stocked in the Air Force inventory, operational activities will requisition items as needed
       and CAM will reimburse CSAG-Supply from O&M to assure replenishment.
8.3. Full Funding. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2, for guidance on full funding, advance
procurement, multiyear procurement, advance Economic Order Quantity, and Engineering
Change Orders/Engineering Change Proposals.
   8.3.1. Award fee requirements are planned and budgeted for as part of the total weapon
   system cost. Award fees are a bona fide need of the same fiscal year and appropriation that
   finances the related effort on which the award fee is based. They are inherently inseparable
   from the work with which they are associated. Therefore, DoD full funding policy mandates
   award fee requirements be budgeted in and funded with the same appropriation and in the
   same fiscal year as the associated effort. Until the determination has been made that a
   contractor is due an award fee, the award fee funds are committed as a contingent
   liability, not obligated. (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter. 8, Paragraph
   080202.A.) However, if funds committed as a contingent liability expire or become expired
   when the award fee is decided, approval must be obtained for an upward obligation
   adjustment (per direction in Chapter 6 of this volume) before the funds may be obligated.
8.4. Weapon System Engineering. MAJCOMs, installations, Air Force Materiel Command
(AFMC Centers), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) for Space Systems, and program offices
must select the correct funding category for weapon system engineering. In general, funding
covers engineering for development, production, and maintenance.
   8.4.1. Development Engineering. Use the RDT&E appropriation.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     161


   8.4.2. Production Engineering. To fund production engineering for items in production,
   use the applicable budget program (weapon system, modification, support equipment, etc.)
   from the procurement account which funds production of the end item. The phrase ―items in
   production‖ means the end item in production is funded in the year the production
   engineering is to take place. Because weapon system development and production
   engineering often overlap, you must properly categorize development and production tasks.
   In general, development engineering tries to achieve or improve system performance;
   production engineering tries to correct deficiencies in the approved production baseline.
   Ultimately, you must apply this guidance case by case.
   8.4.3. Maintenance Engineering. Use the Operation and Maintenance appropriation which
   funds the operational support of the system or equipment.
      8.4.3.1. Maintenance engineering efforts may result in the need to redesign a product or
      substantially improve its performance (flight characteristics, mission performance
      parameters, reliability, capacity, etc.). The redesign would be a development engineering
      task because it improves system performance.
      8.4.3.2. You must carefully categorize production and maintenance tasks, which often
      overlap. In general, production engineering tries to correct deficiencies in a production
      baseline; maintenance engineering tries to identify deficiencies discovered in
      postproduction operational service. You will need to decide case by case.
8.5. Exceptions:
   8.5.1. Use RDT&E to fund all efforts to improve engine components (a combination of
   maintenance and development engineering) per Congressional direction (see Chapter 13).
   8.5.2. Use DWCF to fund development, production, and maintenance engineering services
   that support an operational commodity item managed by the DWCF Consolidated
   Sustainment Activity Group - Supply. But do not use the DWCF if the engineering effort
   results from a weapon system production or modification improvement. For example, charge
   the cost of the engineering effort to the DWCF if the commodity manager needs to reverse
   engineer the item to improve supportability or determine cause(s) of reported problems, or
   wants to improve the reliability or maintainability of the item itself. If engineering is
   necessary to do an improved configuration change, charge the engineering cost to the
   procurement account that bears the cost of the configuration change.
8.6. Modification Engineering. See Section 8G of this chapter.
Section 8B—Aircraft (57*3010)
8.7. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). To fund ASIP tasks for:
   8.7.1. Aircraft in Development, charge to RDT&E (57*3600).
   8.7.2. Aircraft in Production, charge to aircraft procurement if the engineering tries to ensure
   the aircraft performs or endures up to the specifications in the performance envelope. Aircraft
   procurement funds are also appropriate if the engineering tries to extend the aircraft‘s useful
   military life within the performance envelope. Use RDT&E for the ASIP if engineering
   intends to push the system outside the performance envelope.
 162                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   8.7.3. Aircraft Out of Production, charge to O&M. But use RDT&E if the engineering
   intends to push the aircraft‘s performance outside the envelope.
8.8. Retrofitting or Converting Aircraft:
   8.8.1. For retrofitting or converting test aircraft procured for test purposes to tactically
   configured aircraft.
       8.8.1.1. Charge the cost to the aircraft procurement appropriation (weapon system
       program-BPAC 10XXXX) if the model design and series (MDS) aircraft is being
       produced in the program year during which the retrofit or conversion is directed.
       8.8.1.2. Charge the cost to the aircraft procurement appropriation (modification program-
       BPAC 110000) if the MDS aircraft directed for reconfiguration is not in production and
       the reconfiguration is not in production.
   8.8.2. When aircraft are accepted into the Air Force inventory with deviations from the
   procurement contract requirements and corrections are necessary:
       8.8.2.1. Charge the costs of the corrections to BPAC 10XXXX funds cited on the
       procurement contract if the correction is to be accomplished before acceptance of the
       final item procured under the program contracting increment.
       8.8.2.2. Charge the cost to the modification program (BPAC 110000) if the corrections
       are made after the Air Force accepts the last item (aircraft) procured under that contract
       program increment.
   8.8.3. Use this guidance for aircraft accepted into the Air Force inventory with equipment
   installed as a substitute by amendment to the procurement contract. When the original
   specified item becomes available and is to be installed in the delivered aircraft to replace the
   substituted item, charge the cost of the retrofit or modification to the modification program.
   8.8.4. Use RDT&E to fund the cost of changing aircraft back to the original configuration,
   including hardware and labor, if the aircraft were for testing in research and development
   (R&D) programs.
8.9. Modifying Aircraft to Drone Configuration. Handle funding as follows for modifying an
aircraft to a drone configuration, modifying spare parts, directly supporting common support
equipment, and follow-on support after reconfiguration:
   8.9.1. Charge the 57*3600 appropriation for the cost of modifying aircraft to a drone
   configuration required solely for R&D. Charge the same appropriation for changes to spare
   components or direct support ground handling equipment, if these result from the aircraft
   modification.
   8.9.2. Charge the 57*3010 appropriation, BPAC 120000 or the CSAG-Supply of the
   Defense Working Capital Fund for the cost of modifying aircraft to a standard drone
   configuration for general purposes (including training, operations or R&D). Include changes
   to spare parts or ground handling equipment that directly support the modification.
   8.9.3. Charge the 57*3010 appropriation, BPAC 120000 or the CSAG-Supply of the DWCF
   for common follow-on support equipment of aircraft converted to a drone configuration,
   after the modification under paragraph 8.7 above.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    163


   8.9.4. Charge the 57*3600 appropriation for peculiar support if drone vehicles are used in
   R&D programs.
Section 8C—Weapons (57*3020)
8.10. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Force. Air Force Global Strike Command
(AFGSC) modernizes, integrates, and updates ICBM launch and launch control facilities while
they are in the acquisition phase, or after they return to the acquisition phase. AFGSC will
normally budget and fund for such changes based on the concept of procuring the total package,
to include the hardware, necessary installation, and other support costs. The assembly and
checkout contractor pays installation and support (except for hardware procurement). But
program managers may contract for selected tasks from separate contractors to work operational
schedules or gain an advantage for the government. In this case, charge the contracts to the
weapons procurement account.
8.11. Missile Site Updating. Charge changes to hardware and equipment in an update program
to the same appropriation that financed installing the equipment or hardware.
8.12. Logistic Support of Fixed Installed Missile Support Equipment. The weapons system
activation contractor‘s Air Force ―H‖ accounts at each site support supply for installation and
check, assembly and check out, and U.S. Strategic Command‘s operational requirements until 45
days after the final site acceptance. AFGSC will budget and fund to support investment items
during all three of these periods. After that, AFGSC is responsible for all centrally procured
investment items, and operating commands include in their budget estimates all requirements
coded for base procurement.
8.13. Missile Modification or Reconfiguration. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
will charge 57*3020, BP 2100 to modify or reconfigure a missile no longer in production if the
missile will meet a mission requirement other than that for which the last missile was first
procured. If modifying or reconfiguring the missile places it into an acquisition phase, AFMC
will program and budget for the modification. If a missile modified for space booster requires
removal of unnecessary hardware for reliability, the using organization will pay the costs.
8.14. Missile Propellants. Charge the missile procurement appropriation for the cost of solid
missile propellants used in producing or initially loading production missiles at the contractor‘s
plant during system acquisition and at the launch site during launch operations. Charge the same
appropriation to replace outdated propellants. Pay for liquid or gaseous propellants with O&M
funds.
Section 8D—Investment Equipment (57*3080)
8.15. Investment Equipment for Major Range and Test Facilities. Finance this equipment
from the Other Procurement appropriation (57*3080) (reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume
11A, Chapter 12, DoD Directive 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB); and
Chapter 7 of this instruction). EXCEPTION: Use RDT&E (57*3600) to purchase equipment
that mainly supports DT&E or IOT&E. This exception applies even though the equipment may
subsequently be used for other than DT&E or IOT&E.
8.16. Base Procured Investment Equipment (BPIE):
   8.16.1. Use appropriation 57*3080 (BPAC 84XXXX) to fund annual requirements for base-
   level procurement of authorized investment equipment items if these items exceed $250,000
 164                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   in cost and are not available through Air Force central procurement. Use the same
   appropriation for authorized related costs. If you are a host installation, include tenant
   requirements in your annual programs (see paragraph 7.5 for guidance and exception).
   8.16.2. Although appropriation 57*3080 funds are available by law for obligation for 3
   years, the Air Force finances the program requirements of the year for which the funds are
   appropriated. Therefore, MAJCOMs and installations should:
       8.16.2.1. Treat BPAC 84501X (base procured equipment) as an annual program.
       8.16.2.2. Fully commit this program by the end of the first fiscal year (FY).
       8.16.2.3. Obligate it no later than 3 months after the end of the first FY.
       8.16.2.4. Defer equipment requirements identified too late to be on contract within the 15
       months to a later FY for funding. If you have questions, ask SAF/FMBIZ or HQ AF/A4.
   8.16.3. Local Purchase of Centrally Procured Equipment Items. Local purchase of
   centrally managed items budgeted in the procurement accounts (3010, 3011, 3020, 3080
   procurement appropriations) with 3400 (O&M) funds is prohibited. Centrally managed items
   are budgeted by the Air Force and appropriated by Congress in the procurement
   appropriations. Units can be provided Air Force authorization to locally procure most items
   with item manager approval, however, procurement funds provided by the Inventory
   Manager (IM) must be used.
   8.16.4. There may be cases where an item that is coded for central procurement and
   management should more appropriately be coded for local procurement. If a unit deems an
   equipment item to be inappropriately coded, they may request recoding action through the
   AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action, process as detailed in AFMAN 23-110,
   Vol. I, Para two, Paragraph 6c(2).
   8.16.5. Standard Warranty. A standard warranty offered by a contractor on equipment is
   properly funded as part of the procurement. The standard warranty constitutes a bona fide
   need of the procurement. If the standard warranty of a vendor is 3 years and it is included in
   the price of the equipment, then it is funded in procurement. However, extended warranties
   added on as additional costs to the contract are not an integral part of the procurement of the
   equipment, do not constitute a bona fide need of the contract, and are to be treated as options
   to the standard warranty and funded with O&M in the option years.
8.17. Finance the Following Items with 57*3080, BPAC 84501X Funds: (Unless equipment
is being replaced as part of an O&M-type fund repair project) (See paragraph 8.2. for changes to
the 3080 BP 8400 program due to stock funding of Depot Level Reparables.)
   8.17.1. Investment equipment items with a source of supply from General Services
   Administration, Defense Logistics Agency, other services, or local purchase (including
   replacement Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE)).
   8.17.2. Non-stock-listed investment equipment items that are locally procured that are not
   part of a construction project (57*3300), O&M-funded construction (EEIC 529), O&M-
   funded repair (EEIC 522) (either in-house or by contract), or a stand-alone facility
   RPIE replacement if the unit cost is in excess of $250,000.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      165


   8.17.3. Installation costs of investment items dictated by technical considerations or
   warranty conditions, or if installation charges are included in the cost of equipment offered
   for public sale as quoted in manufacturers‘ or vendors‘ price lists. Installation includes
   unpacking, assembling components, placement, and connecting necessary utilities in a space
   previously prepared for operating the equipment.
   8.17.4. Relocatable buildings purchased as items of war reserve stock (see Chapter 9 of this
   volume).
   8.17.5. Portable buildings if their cost exceeds $250,000. (See Chapter 9 of this volume.)
   8.17.6. Fast pay back capital (FASCAP) investment items approved by AF/XPMR per AFI
   38-301.
8.18. Do Not Finance the Following Items with 57*3080, BPAC 84501X Funds: (See
paragraph 8.2 for changes to 3080 BP 8400 program due to stock funding of Depot Level
Reparables.)
   8.18.1. Equipment with a unit cost of $250,000 or less.
   8.18.2. Spares, components, assemblies, repair parts, and other materiel (expense or
   investment) that do not qualify as end items of equipment.
   8.18.3. Centrally managed equipment items or substitutes for such items, such as aircraft,
   vehicles, etc.
   8.18.4. Initial or replacement RPIE (including electric power generators) to be installed as
   part of a construction project (either in-house or by contract), except as shown in Figure
   4.1.
   8.18.5. Use O&M for replacement equipment (RPIE), either as part of an O&M funded
   repair project, an O&M-funded construction project, or a stand-alone RPIE replacement.
   8.18.6. Installation, erection, local fabrication, construction, checkout, or other service (done
   by organic work force or contract) connected to acquiring or purchasing equipment, except as
   provided in paragraph 8.17.
   8.18.7. Preparing a site for installation of leased, transferred, issued, or newly procured
   equipment.
   8.18.8. Support of RDT&E.
   8.18.9. Support of Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) activity groups.
   8.18.10. Information Processing Equipment, consisting of Automatic Data Processing
   Equipment and Word Processing Equipment, which are funded in the same manner and from
   the same line item in the Other Procurement (57*3080) appropriation BPAC 83401X. Do not
   fund Word Processing Equipment in the regular Base Procured Investment Equipment line
   item.
8.19. Turn-Key Procurement:
   8.19.1. The use of ―turn-key procurement‖ in a contracting action does not preclude or create
   any exception(s) to the legal use of appropriated funds.

Section 8E—Real Property Installed Equipment
 166                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


8.20. Procuring Real Property Installed Equipment and Portable Equipment:
   8.20.1. Use procedures in this paragraph to fund initial real property installed equipment
   (RPIE) procured and installed as part of a construction project (in-house Base Civil Engineer
   (BCE) or contract). Charge the costs to the appropriation financing the construction project
   (either 57*3300 or O&M-type funds--EEIC 529, depending on the cost).
       8.20.1.1. If the RPIE meets normal investment funding criteria, you may procure it
       through local purchase by directly citing the funds being used to finance the construction
       project.
       8.20.1.2. If the RPIE is stock listed in Air Force stock list publications and requisitioned
       from AFMC through normal equipment channels, you must reimburse the appropriation
       which initially financed funded project costs from the appropriation financing the
       construction. For investment items requisitioned from AFMC in minor construction
       projects, reimburse only the items identified in the civil engineer‘s cost accounting
       system.
       8.20.1.3. If the RPIE meets normal expense criteria, the installation must procure it
       through the WCF unless a contractor furnishes it. Use the appropriation financing the
       construction project to reimburse the DWCF.
   8.20.2. Replacement RPIE. If the item/equipment being replaced is integral to the facility
   and would have been funded by MILCON when the facility was constructed, the repair or
   replacement of the item/equipment should be funded with operation and maintenance (O&M)
   funds per 10 U.S.C. 2811 (OSD/GC July 15, 2003). This is applicable whether the
   item/equipment is being replaced as part of a larger repair project or as a stand-alone
   replacement project in the facility. If the item would initially have been funded with
   procurement funds (e.g., production or moveable equipment), then its replacement will be
   funded with procurement funds.
   8.20.3. All air-conditioning equipment, including window units located in real property, is
   classified RPIE. Generally, you would fund it according to procedures in 8.20.1 and 8.20.2
   above. But, do not apply RPIE funding procedures if the air-conditioning is installed in or on
   other than real property. For example, air-conditioning installed in or on a van-mounted piece
   of communications or electronics equipment is not real property. Finance this type of air-
   conditioning installation in personal property, based on normal investment or expense
   criteria.
   8.20.4. Fire-protection systems, excluding self-contained vehicle and portable systems and
   hand extinguishers, are RPIE; therefore, you fund them according to 8.20.1 and 8.20.2
   above.
   8.20.5. AFI 32-1063, Electric Power Systems, for guidance on programming and budgeting
   for replacement RPIE generators. Do not use the procedures in paragraphs 8.20.2 through
   8.20.4
   8.20.6. Use 57*3080 for initial and replacement requirements for all ground mobile (skid,
   wheel mounted, or portable) electric power generators, .5 to 200 KW, not designated as
   RPIE. These generators are centrally managed items.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  167


  8.20.7. AFMC finances initial and replacement requirements for portable equipment
  required operating a facility (excluding items designated for base procurement) from the
  57*3080 appropriation. Portable equipment includes such items as tooling, materiel handling
  equipment, etc.
  8.20.8. Do not apply RPIE procedures to fund aircraft arresting systems (runway barriers),
  equipment for static uninterruptible power supply, systems that provide fire protection only
  to non-RPIE or non-real property, and demountable sound suppressers. These items are
  nonreal property. Instead, follow this guidance:
     8.20.8.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems:
         8.20.8.1.1. Use 57*3080 for anchor chains, cables, drums, nets, erecting
         mechanisms, and the control devices associated with them (these are classed as
         common support equipment).
         8.20.8.1.2. Use military construction funds for the concrete foundations, or pits, and
         the connecting utilities (they are real property).
         8.20.8.1.3. Use 57*3080 for installation of the system if the prime contractor installs
         it as part of the total contract cost.
         8.20.8.1.4. Use O&M-type funds for the installation when contractual labor other
         than the prime contractor is required to install the system. For organic labor, use
         EEIC 11XXX to record these costs. This labor is not a construction cost.
     8.20.8.2. Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
         8.20.8.2.1. Use Other Procurement (57*3080) for the equipment.
         8.20.8.2.2. Use military construction for permanent pads or foundations (real
         property) and connecting utilities.
         8.20.8.2.3. Follow aircraft arresting systems procedures in paragraph 8.20.8.1 for
         installation charges.
     8.20.8.3. Fire Protection Systems. For self-contained vehicle and portable systems,
     including hand extinguishers and systems for the protection of non-RPIE or nonreal
     property:
         8.20.8.3.1. Use the major procurement appropriations for centrally procured
         equipment.
         8.20.8.3.2. Use the appropriation financing the systems acquisition if the centrally
         procured equipment is airborne equipment peculiar to one weapon system.
         8.20.8.3.3. Use 57*3080 funds if the centrally procured airborne equipment is
         common to more than one weapon system, or is purely ground equipment.
         8.20.8.3.4. Use 57*3080 funds for base-procured equipment with a unit cost in
         excess of $250,000.
         8.20.8.3.5. Use O&M for base-procured equipment with a unit cost $250,000 or less.
     8.20.8.4. Demountable Sound Suppression Equipment (―Hush House‖) for Ground Test
     of Aircraft and Engines:
 168                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


           8.20.8.4.1. Use the major procurement appropriations for demountable equipment
           that suppresses sound on power check pads and jet engine test stands (they are classed
           as common support equipment).
           8.20.8.4.2. Use appropriation 57*3010 BP1000 when the equipment is common to
           more than one weapon system or peculiar to one weapon system which is still in
           production.
           8.20.8.4.3. Use 57*3010 BP 1200 when the equipment is common to more than one
           weapon system or peculiar to one weapon system that is no longer in production.
           8.20.8.4.4. Use the major procurement appropriations for installation if the prime
           contractor installs the equipment as part of the total contract cost.
           8.20.8.4.5. Use O&M funds for installation by anyone other than the prime
           contractor.
           8.20.8.4.6. Use construction for permanent pads or foundations (real property) and
           connecting utilities.
8.21. Procuring and Installing Communications-Electronic Systems. This paragraph
explains when to use procurement and military construction appropriations for fixed, mobile, and
transportable communications-electronic (C-E) systems.
   8.21.1. The use of "turn-key procurement" in a contracting action does not preclude or create
   any exception(s) to the legal use of appropriated funds.
   8.21.2. Use the Other Procurement appropriation (57*3080) for the following C-E system
   items, if (1) they are incidental but integral to procuring and installing of C-E systems and
   have no other purposes and (2) they are an integral part of the prime contract (even if a
   subcontractor installs them). (Note: Use O&M funds if a contractor other than the prime
   contractor (or direct subcontractor) installs the system or modifies it as a result of state-of-art
   changes.)
       8.21.2.1. Foundations for equipment, self-contained equipment shelters, prefabricated
       buildings used solely for equipment shelters, antennas, and antenna towers.
       8.21.2.2. Temporary or permanent utilities required solely to operate C-E equipment.
       8.21.2.3. Unpaved access roads and walks needed for a contractor to access areas in
       order to install or erect equipment.
       8.21.2.4. Procuring and installing security fencing needed to protect areas or equipment
       during contractor operations.
       8.21.2.5. Engineering and design costs associated with the above items.
   8.21.3. Use construction funds (MILCON or O&M) for:
       8.21.3.1. Facilities for administration, logistics, housing, and other activities to support a
       C-E system.
       8.21.3.2. All other masonry buildings not used to house equipment only.
       8.21.3.3. All paved roads and walks as well as other access roads and walks not directly
       related to contractor requirements or not required solely to access equipment.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    169


      8.21.3.4. Common-use temporary and permanent utilities required to support a C-E
      system site.
      8.21.3.5. Other items of construction not covered above.
      8.21.3.6. Engineering and design associated with the above items.
   8.21.4. Use Other Procurement, Air Force (57*3080) or O&M to fund other requirements for
   fixed C-E facilities and equipment, such as modernizing, upgrading, expanding, or
   augmenting them.
   8.21.5. Procure Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) according to the expense/investment
   criteria. DWCF requirements are funded with DWCF.
8.22. Equipment (Other than Communications Systems) Procured on an Installed
Basis. (e.g., Radar, Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS), and Cryptographic Equipment).
   8.22.1. Use 57*3080 to procure equipment required for fixed facilities on an installed basis
   if dictated by technical considerations, warranty conditions, or if the cost of equipment
   offered for public sale includes installation charges. Charge procuring equipment on an
   installed basis to the program year in which it was directed.
   8.22.2. Installation includes unpacking, assembling components, placement, and connecting
   necessary utilities in a space previously prepared for the operation of the equipment. (NOTE:
   Do not include renovation or rearrangement of buildings or utility systems, construction
   foundations, strengthening floors or roofs, or excavation in your installation costs. These are
   base civil engineer (BCE) activities whether accomplished in-house or by separate contract,
   and you should finance them using the base‘s or command‘s normal funding procedures.)
   8.22.3. When you must construct, modify, alter, or rehabilitate buildings to install
   equipment, submit the requirement through MAJCOM channels for HQ USAF approval as a
   corollary to the equipment procurement. Charge these costs to the military construction
   program (MCP), O&M, or RDT&E appropriations, as appropriate.
   8.22.4. If specifically approved by HQ USAF, AFMC or Air Force Intelligence,
   Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) may procure equipment financed from
   the 57*3080 appropriation and required for a fixed operation on a system or a packaged
   basis.
   8.22.5. Procure computer-raised flooring for new production flight simulators as part of the
   simulator complex using the ―package procurement‖ approach. Include the costs to acquire
   and install this flooring in the procurement specification packages for all new production
   flight simulators using Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (57*3010) funds. This is an
   exception to Chapter 4 (Figure 4.1).

Section 8F—Production Activities

8.23. Government-furnished Expense Items to Production Contractors:
   8.23.1. Use the appropriate procurement appropriation to reimburse the DWCF for expense
   items furnished to production contractors in order to incorporate them into the manufacture
   or assembly of an investment item. Reimburse from the budget program that finances
   procurement of the investment item.
 170                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   8.23.2. These expense items also include DLA fuel consumed during production
   qualification and acceptance testing (predelivery) of aircraft and related fuel-consuming
   equipment. Charge the fuel to 57*3010, BP1000 account, on a current year basis; for
   example, you pay for FY 1998 fuel issues with FY 1998 3010 funds. This does not include
   fuel furnished for aircraft delivery from the contractor‘s plant to the military activity. Such
   delivery is first destination transportation (FDT); you fund it per Chapter 10.
8.24. Pilot Production. Use RDT&E funds for development or preproduction prototypes used
for DT&E and IOT&E.
   8.24.1. If the testing activity uses the prototypes for IOT&E, they must represent the
   expected production items well enough to get a valid estimate of the item‘s operational
   effectiveness and suitability. If acquiring a limited number of special pilot items from a pilot
   line is necessary to provide the needed representatives, use RDT&E to finance establishing
   the initial pilot line and for the IOT&E items. Prototypes produced with RDT&E funds must
   be adequate in number to fulfill both DT&E and IOT&E requirements.
   8.24.2. Charge a procurement appropriation for all subsequent costs to retain the initial pilot
   line capability for follow-on operational test and evaluation (FOT&E), as well as inventory.
   8.24.3. Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). For discussion of LRIP funding in
   Procurement and RDT&E, see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Paragraph
   010212.
8.25. Costs for Closing Down a Production Line. MAJCOMs, installations and program
offices fund closing down a production line from the last production buy for Air Force
requirements (BPAC 100000, 200000 etc.). Use BP1300 (Post Production Support) for
closedown costs if the last production aircraft has been delivered. If additional costs are incurred
to keep the line open for non-Air Force requirements (for example, foreign military sales
(FMS)), prorate and include the cost in the sales price of the item to non-Air Force customers.
   8.25.1. Charge the BPAC for industrial responsiveness/facilities (BPAC 140000, 240000,
   etc.) to remove and prepare machinery and equipment for shipment to reserve storage or to
   the Air Force contractor.
   8.25.2. Charge the O&M funds of the requesting base or depot for packing, crating, handling
   and transportation, as well as storage, of production tooling they request to satisfy their
   future maintenance requirements. These costs are not integral to normal closedown.
   Charge transportation to the transportation (SDT) account of the requesting base‘s or depot‘s
   major command.

Section 8G—Guidance for Funding Maintenance and Modification

8.26. Financing Maintenance and Modifications:
   8.26.1. Use O&M for maintenance (labor, expense materials, DLR).
   8.26.2. Use RDT&E for:
       8.26.2.1. Development engineering for modifications.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       171


       8.26.2.2. Engineering required to integrate and test commercially available end items
       (including ADP equipment and software), for which the overall configuration is not
       commercially available.
   8.26.3. Use the procurement appropriations for modification engineering and engineering
   changes except as stated in the following paragraphs of this section.
   8.26.4. Use the procurement appropriations to buy and install modification kits. Procurement
   will normally not begin until a modification has a configuration baseline which is fully
   qualified and operational. Expense and investment material items required to install
   modification kits are normally included in the Group A and B kits and should be funded with
   procurement appropriations in accordance with full funding policy. With rare exception, you
   will budget an equal number of Group A and Group B kits in the same fiscal year. The
   exception is when an equal number is not required to accomplish the mission - ―part time‖
   Group B kits rotated to Group A kits installed in several different aircraft. When preparing
   budget justification materials, the program office should budget installation of modification
   kits in the fiscal year in which the installation is to be accomplished. On occasion, Congress
   may add funds for a modification and include the installation funds in the same year as the
   kits. In such instances, the program will be executed as directed by Congress. Also use the
   procurement appropriations (modification programs) for:
       8.26.4.1. Installation engineering data, technical data, and special tools required to install
       mod kits.
       8.26.4.2. Buying support equipment and peculiar test equipment required to support the
       modified configuration item(s) as a direct result of the modification program.
       8.26.4.3. Modifying spare components or support equipment when modification
       programs directly require it.
       8.26.4.4. If a modification is being done in conjunction with a Programmed Depot
       Maintenance (PDM), the modification will pay for the installation and materiel costs that
       are over and above those required for the PDM. The PDM will pay for common tasks or
       immaterial costs that are not cost effective to separate.
       8.26.4.5. Equipment Scheduled for Retirement or Disposal: Limitation on
       Expenditures for Modifications. Prohibition - Title 10, U.S.C., Section 2244a directs
       the Secretary of a military department may not carry out a modification of an aircraft,
       weapon, vessel, or other item of equipment that the Secretary plans to retire or otherwise
       dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification, if carried out, would
       be completed. The Secretary concerned may waive the aforementioned prohibition in the
       case of any modification otherwise subject to that subsection, if the Secretary determines
       carrying out the modification is in the national security interest of the United States.
       Whenever the Secretary issues such a waiver, the Secretary shall notify the congressional
       defense committees in writing.
8.26.4.5.1. There are three exceptions to the aforementioned prohibition: a) does not apply to a
modification for which the cost is less than $100,000.00; b) does not apply to a modification in a
case where the reusable items of value, as determined by the Secretary, installed on the item of
equipment as part of such modification will, upon the retirement or disposal of the item to be
modified, be removed from such item of equipment, refurbished, and installed on another item of
 172                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


equipment and – the cost of such modification (including the cost of the removal and
refurbishment of reusable items of value) is less than $1,000,000.00; and c) does not apply to a
safety modification.
   8.26.5. Use O&M funds for expense materials that are not part of a mod kit, but are
   determined to require replacement during inspection and modification.
   8.26.6. Charge installation to RDT&E if the modification supports an RDT&E effort or
   project, or if an RDT&E funded organization owns the equipment being modified.
   Otherwise, charge the installation to the procurement accounts. (Note: The use of
   procurement funds for installation costs became effective in FY 1991 (except for Other
   Procurement, which was FY 1992)).
   8.26.7. Use the procedures in paragraphs 8.26.1 through 8.26.5 to correct deficiencies in an
   end item of equipment in production except as follows. Some production contracts include a
   clause providing for a contractor to take all actions necessary to correct deficiencies in
   equipment revealed during production. The contractor must do so for a specified time with
   no change in contract target cost or ceiling. In this case, charge procuring and installing of
   kits for the modifications to the appropriation used to buy the equipment end item. (For
   example, procuring and installing deficiency or compatibility update mod kits for aircraft in
   production would be chargeable to the applicable weapon system budget program (BPAC) of
   the Aircraft Procurement Appropriation.) If the mod kits needed to correct the deficiency are
   no longer covered by the terms of the contract, fund them according to the preceding
   paragraphs.
   8.26.8. Use the following guidance for ―P‖ (permanent) and ―P-S‖ (permanent-safety)
   modifications:
       8.26.8.1. Charge the trial installation work to the procurement appropriations. It is
       considered modification engineering. (Modification engineering, including engineering
       of Group A hardware (and associated software) and mod kit installation instructions,
       normally occurs during trial installation of a qualified, first-production Group B kit. The
       trial installation results in the first-production configuration item.) Also, use procurement
       appropriations to pay for fuel used in predelivery test of a trial installation.
       8.26.8.2. Use the procurement appropriations to fund engineering efforts (modification
       engineering) to make minor changes to a fully developed and qualified modification kit
       (either hardware or software) in order to adapt it for modifying another end item or
       system. An example would be an aircraft system of another MDS. ―Minor engineering
       effort‖ requires less than 25 percent of the engineering manhours involved in developing
       the initial or previous operation‘s configuration baseline (hardware and software).
   8.26.9. For Engineering Change Proposals/Engineering Change Orders (ECP/ECO):
       8.26.9.1. When conducting engineering studies to determine if an ECP/ECO should
       proceed to the modification production phase:
           8.26.9.1.1. Use O&M (3400) if the program is a reliability/maintainability effort.
           8.26.9.1.2. Use R&D (3600) if the program requires development efforts.
           8.26.9.1.3. Do not use modification production funds to make this determination.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     173


       8.26.9.2. When an ECP/ECO generates after an item is on contract:
           8.26.9.2.1. Use funds that financed the production item on the contract to finance the
           ECP/ ECO; i.e., if 3600 paid for a development item, then 3600 pays for the change
           order; if 3010 paid for a production item, then 3010 pays for the change proposal.
           8.26.9.2.2. Do not use procurement funds to procure engineering contract services in
           order to review an ECP/ECO for sufficiency.
   8.26.10. Charge the budget program funding the equipment end item for modification
   engineering for mod kits to be installed on equipment end items in production. Use
   modification program funds only for ―difference engineering‖ required to install the mod kits
   on equipment end items already produced. (―Difference engineering‖ is the additional
   engineering needed to cover the different installation requirements (hardware and software)
   between in-production items and those already procured.)
   8.26.11. Suppose modifying a weapon system requires modifying a training device (for
   example, a simulator) which supports the weapon system. In this case, use the same funding
   (such as RDT&E) for designing and modifying the system and the training device (RDT&E).
   If modifications of the training device do not stem from modifying the weapon system, fund
   engineering efforts in the same manner as other end item modifications (see previous
   paragraphs). The guidance in Chapter 4, Section 4B applies to designing and developing
   training devices, and software changes not associated with hardware modifications.
8.27. Intentionally left blank.

Section 8H—Value Analysis and Engineering

8.28. Value Analysis of Spare Parts:
   8.28.1. Use the guidance in Table 8.1 to determine the source of funding for value analysis
   of spare parts: (NOTE: value analysis is a detailed and exhaustive pricing investigation to
   determine the likely competitive price or market price of spare parts.)

Table 8.1. Appropriations to Charge for Value Analysis of Spare Parts.
 If the Principal Benefiting Program Is In   Charge the Contractual Costs To
 Aircraft Procurement (3010)                 Budget Programs (BP) 16 or BP 19, as appropriate
 Missile Procurement (3020)                  BP 25, 26 or the CSAG-Supply, DWCF, as
                                             appropriate; or BP 29 if neither 25, 26 nor the
                                             CSAG-Supply is the benefiting program

                                             a value analysis contract that contains a separate
 Two or more appropriations                  line item for each benefiting appropriation and the
                                             cost of the contract prorated accordingly
   8.28.2. Charge in-house value analysis, without a contract, to the normal O&M-type funds
   of the activity doing the analysis.
 174                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


8.29. Guidance for Funding Value Engineering (VE). MAJCOMs, installations and program
managers should include the amounts required to pay for Value Engineering Proposals (VEP),
Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECP), testing, and other costs arising from the VE
program in all budget estimates.
   8.29.1. Charge the cost arising from VE actions to the appropriation financing the prime
   benefiting program, except as specified below.
   8.29.2. Use RDT&E to fund VE (internal or contractor) performed during design and
   development.
   8.29.3. Pay for VE performed according to either a program requirements clause or an
   incentive clause on major end items in production or in the operational inventory (such as
   weapons, military equipment, and components as well as minor items) as follows: (1) charge
   the VE cost to RDT&E if the VE requires redesign that entails related development, test, and
   evaluation work which increases the performance envelope, and (2) charge the account
   financing the prime benefiting program for VE actions other than those in the preceding
   subparagraph.
   8.29.4. Finance VE by a contractor under a value engineering requirements clause as a
   separate line item in the contract and from the same appropriation cited in the contract.
8.30. Sharing VE Incentive and Program Requirement Clauses:
   8.30.1. Financing Instant Contract:
       8.30.1.1. Contractors share in the cost savings on contracts if they propose a VE change
       that the Air Force accepts. Sharing is limited to the instant contract and the quantity of
       the item procured under the contract. To compensate the contractor, the Air Force
       reduces the contract price only by its share of savings and includes in the contract price
       the contractor‘s share of the savings.
       8.30.1.2. Use the appropriation cited in the instant contract to finance the contractor‘s
       share of the savings because this share is included as a part of the payment to the
       contractor at the reduced contract price.
          8.30.1.2.1. Prorate the savings in the same proportion as the quantity procured for the
          different appropriations when the instant contract includes more than one fund
          citation.
          8.30.1.2.2. Prorate the savings based on the quantities procured when the instant
          contract includes a fund citation that results from a consolidated order from two or
          more customers.
   8.30.2. Financing Lump Sum Payments on Future Acquisition Savings:
       8.30.2.1. If the Air Force buys more of the same item with the VE change incorporated,
       the contractor may also be paid a share of the VE savings in the added items. Determine
       the contractor‘s share per unit as you did under the instant contract. This share per unit
       extends to the estimated number of units to be procured later. The provision in the instant
       contract that authorizes the lump sum payment on future acquisition savings specifies this
       number. The Air Force compensates the contractor by a lump sum, one-time payment
       under the instant contract.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    175


     8.30.2.2. Air Force users may initially charge the contractor‘s share of the savings to the
     appropriation cited in the instant contract and, when determined appropriate, transfer
     these amounts to the applicable account using the funding principles in paragraph 8.29
     above. Before accepting the VECP, you must determine that funds are available in the
     account that will ultimately bear the charge.
  8.30.3. Financing Royalty Payments on Future Acquisition Savings:
     8.30.3.1. In addition to sharing savings under the instant contract (but always in lieu of
     any sharing by lump sum payments), the Air Force may agree in the contract to pay the
     contractor a ―royalty‖. (The royalty payment is based on actual future procurements,
     within a stated time period, of the same item that incorporate the instant VE change.)
     Also, the Air Force may agree in the instant contract to pay the contractor a ―royalty‖ on
     future overhaul and maintenance work by an ―in-house‖ defense facility that uses the
     instant VE changes. Agreement in the instant contract to pay royalties based on actual
     future procurement does not commit or obligate funds. Also, the agreement to pay
     royalties does not extend either to procurements of the item by any other DoD component
     (even though the instant VE change is incorporated in such procurements) or overhaul
     and maintenance work.
     8.30.3.2. Generally, you should determine the contractor‘s share per unit as you do for
     lump sum payments. The Air Force pays contractors under the future contract in
     reasonable increments of not more than 6 months. The payments depend on quantities
     purchased, or in-house work done, in which they hold a contractual right to share in the
     savings.
     8.30.3.3. Charge the contractor‘s share of savings under the royalty method to the
     appropriation account cited in the subsequent procurement or construction contract,
     regardless of whether that contract is with the instant contractor. For overhaul and
     maintenance work in a defense facility, pay the contractor‘s share of savings either
     directly from the customer appropriation financing the order or from the fund financing
     the defense facility. You may pay this share whether the defense facility is operated as a
     DWCF or other fund activity.
     8.30.3.4. When the Air Force later buys for another DoD component under a MIPR,
     include royalty payment amounts in your funding citation for the procurement or
     construction. If the responsibility for procurement or construction transfers to another
     DoD component under logistical transfer procedures, the Air Force transfers
     responsibility for making royalty payments to the gaining component, and that
     component must accept this responsibility.
  8.30.4. Financing Payments for Collateral Savings:
     8.30.4.1. As a result of accepting a VE change under the instant contract, the Air Force
     may compensate the contractor for a share in collateral savings expected from the change.
     Examples of these savings would be fewer requirements for government-furnished
     property, reduced cost of operating the contract item, or lower costs for logistical support.
     This compensation is always a one-time lump sum payment under the instant contract.
     Do not pay collateral savings for any subsequent purchases of the same item by the Air
     Force or any other DoD component.
 176                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       8.30.4.2. Initially, you may charge the lump-sum payment for collateral savings to the
       appropriation cited in the instant contract and, after determining the proper allocation,
       transfer these amounts to the proper account under 8.29 above. Before accepting the
       VECP, you must determine that funds are available in the account that will ultimately
       bear the charge.
   8.30.5. VE Program Requirements Clause. This clause requires a stated level of VE effort
   by the contractor and is a separate contract line item. Fund according to the guidance in
   paragraph 8.29.
   8.30.6. Testing. The Air Force must conduct appropriate tests before determining that a
   VEP and VECP are acceptable. Tests are usually required before the contractor accepts the
   proposals. Typically, the Air Force command that benefits from the VEP or VECP tests as
   part of operations. So MAJCOMs must include these costs in their execution plans for O&M-
   type appropriations.
   8.30.7. Unsolicited Proposals. If the Air Force accepts an unsolicited proposal to save
   money from someone other than the contractor, charge for it according to the guidance in
   paragraphs 8.29.1 through 8.29.4. The payment to the unsolicited source will be either a
   lump sum or a royalty. An example would be saving money on supplies or services under
   contract or furnished in-house within a Defense facility.

Section 8I—Other Investment Procurement Policies

8.31. Funding Test and Evaluation. See Chapter 14.
8.32. Purchasing Information Technology Equipment (ITE). See Chapter 4, Section 4B.
8.33. Funding the Local Manufacture of Investment Items. Charge the cost for emergency
local manufacture of investment items required by a repair activity to the procurement
appropriation to which the item is identifiable. Installations may not use local manufacture to
stock items for inventory.
8.34. Funding Support Equipment. Determine the budget program activity codes (BPAC) for
peculiar support equipment and common support equipment as follows:
   8.34.1. Initial. For in-production weapon systems, the System Program Manager (SPM) is
   responsible for programming, budgeting, and funding all support equipment (SE) required
   for initial lay-in. The SPM will use weapon system procurement funds (3010, BP 10; 3020,
   BP 20). Procurement funds (3010, 3020, or 3080) will be used for initial SE, whether for in-
   production or post-production weapon systems. Initial SE includes both common and
   peculiar SE that support the mission design series (all blocks and subindentures) in-
   production and its engine which the Air Force acquires for the following reasons:
       8.34.1.1. To support deliveries of new principal items (aircraft and missiles),
       8.34.1.2. As a result of basis of issue (BOI) changes during production of the weapon
       system,
       8.34.1.3. To provide additional quantities of support equipment to support force structure
       changes that increase the number of bases requiring SE during the production of the
       weapon system, e.g., conversion from active to Guard/Reserve forces.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    177


   8.34.2. Replacement. For out of production systems, the Item Manager (IM) whether
   resident in the SPM, Product Group Manager, or Material Group Manager office, is
   responsible for budgeting and funding for replacement of organizational and intermediate
   level support equipment, both common and peculiar. MAJCOMs that use the equipment
   shall program sufficient funding for specific replacement support equipment programs in
   excess of $15 million per year or $50 million total program cost. The IM will use equipment
   procurement funds (3010, BP12; 3020, BP22). Replacement SE is that which the Air force
   acquires for the following reasons:
      8.34.2.1. To replace losses of existing SE, e.g., condemnations,
      8.34.2.2. As part of changeout program where one item of SE will replace another,
      8.34.2.3. As a result of BOI changes that occur during the post production support period
      of the weapon system.
   8.34.3. Appropriation 3010, BP 1300 is used to provide additional quantities of SE to
   support force structure changes that increase the number of bases requiring SE during the
   post production period of the weapon system, e.g., conversion from active to Guard/Reserve
   forces.
   8.34.4. Modification. Use BP 1100 (modifications) for all peculiar SE required because of
   a modification. This includes peculiar SE required to support a system that applies to more
   than one aircraft. Also follow this guidance for changes in modification quantities or items
   during the course of the modification funding.
   8.34.5. See chart in AFMAN 65-604 under 57X3010 Fund code 11, BP 1200, Common
   Support Equipment.
8.35. Funding Technical and Engineering Data. See Chapter 4, Section 4E.
8.36. Training:
   8.36.1. Training Films. The Air Force procures some special training films as part of the
   contract for procuring an end item. Charge the initial supply of a stated number of the films
   to the procurement appropriation and BPAC under which you procure the specific weapons
   system or end item of equipment.
      8.36.1.1. Follow the above guidance for aircraft, missiles, and direct support equipment
      as long as you are procuring the initial squadron equipment by model type. Do not apply
      the guidance to operational tests and follow-on operational tests.
      8.36.1.2. Follow the above guidance for equipment procured under the 57*3080
      appropriation until the last item in the procurement contract is accepted into the inventory
      from the production program.
      8.36.1.3. Sometimes the requirement for special training films results from, and
      procurement is accomplished with, the modification of a weapon system or end item of
      equipment. When this occurs, charge producing a stated number of films to the same
      procurement appropriation and BPAC that covers the modification.
      8.36.1.4. If the requirement for special training films results from maintenance
      operational requirements, technical order changes, etc., charge the cost to O&M-type
      appropriations.
 178                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       8.36.1.5. Charge the cost of producing films to O&M-type appropriations if the
       requirement for special training films is: (1) to increase the number available for
       distribution (in addition to the original number authorized for procurement under the
       procurement appropriation); (2) to replace worn-out film; (3) to produce prints from an
       Air Force negative; or (4) not eligible for procurement under other provisions of this
       paragraph.
   8.36.2. Funding Type 1 Factory Training. See Chapter 10, Section 10L.
8.37. Repairing Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM). Because of malfunction or damage
(in transit or in storage), some GFM items procured for initial installation into a major end item
of equipment in production may have to be returned to the producing GFM contractor or Air
Force depot for repair or rework before they can be installed. Fund the repair of such GFM items
as follows:
   8.37.1. Charge the repair of associated GFM items (including parts or components and
   contract services required) for undelivered end items of equipment (those in contractor‘s
   facilities) to the same budget program and program year as the end item of equipment into
   which it will be installed.
   8.37.2. After Air Force acceptance of the end item, charge the repair of GFM components to
   O&M type appropriations. Include those not procured or required for initial installation into
   an in-production end item.
8.38. Industrial Responsiveness/Facilities and Equipment. Aircraft control and warning
(AC&W) and distant early warning (DEW) line sites, whether contractor or government-
operated, are considered command installations, not industrial responsiveness facilities. Compute
modification and maintenance of related equipment according to established Air Force
procedures and fund their costs under either the O&M or Other Procurement appropriations.
8.39. Funding Supplies and Equipment for the National Air and Space Intelligence Center
(NASIC) and the Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC):
   8.39.1. Procurement under BPAC 84XXXX for NASIC and AFTAC includes all items of
   centrally procured equipment and supplies normally chargeable to 57*3080 (as described in
   AFMAN 65-604). Use the following subparagraphs to determine fund requirements by
   appropriation for NASIC and AFTAC financial plans and budget estimates.
   8.39.2. Develop requirements for RDT&E (57*3600) using AFMAN 65-604, budget codes.
   8.39.3. Apply the following for procurement appropriation requirements:
       8.39.3.1. Use 57*3010 or the 57*3020 for end items of equipment and systems to be
       initially installed in, and become a part of, an aircraft or missile, and items of an airborne
       nature used in an aircraft or missile used exclusively for NASIC or AFTAC mission
       requirements.
       8.39.3.2. Use 57*3080 for end items of equipment and systems used in ground
       operations exclusively for NASIC or AFTAC mission requirements.
       8.39.3.3. Charge components and maintenance spare parts required to support a
       particular end item of equipment or system to the same appropriation that funded the end
       item (except Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procured items that are O&M-funded).
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   179


       But, if you cannot specifically identify maintenance spare parts, other than DLA items, to
       a single end item of equipment, apply the predominance of use concept. For example,
       when the known or estimated use of a spare part predominates for a particular type of
       equipment, charge the total requirement to the same appropriation that funded the
       particular equipment.
   8.39.4. Charge equipment and components required for NASIC and AFTAC operational
   support (including supplies and materiel normally provided for under several 57*3080
   program codes) to BPAC 84XXXX only. In addition, use BPAC 87XXXX to reimburse for
   contractual labor and depot installation or modifications of equipment that are required in
   connection with Permanent Modifications of 57*3080 equipment.
   8.39.5. Charge contractual or depot labor (including TDY) required installing 57*3080
   equipment to the applicable O&M appropriation program, unless such equipment is
   authorized for procurement on an installed basis. Charge TDY costs to O&M even for
   procurements on an installed basis. Do not use BPAC 87XXXX to reimburse 57*3400 for
   contractual or depot labor (including TDY) required to install NASIC and AFTAC
   equipment.
8.40. Production-Related Travel.
   8.40.1. Use RDT&E to fund travel that supports Research, Development, Test, and
   Evaluation efforts and activities.
   8.40.2. Use production funds (see paragraph 8.49 PMA) for travel that directly supports
   production-related activities where you have completed RDT&E or where there was no
   RDT&E.
   8.40.3. Use RDT&E if the travel supports both RDT&E and production-related activities;
   that is, resolve gray areas in favor of RDT&E.
8.41. First Destination Transportation (FDT). Charge FDT for items procured either FOB
Origin or FOB Destination to the procuring appropriations and the program procuring the
equipment/item in that appropriation (3010, 3011, 3020, and 3080). Charge the FDT for depot
level reparables to the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group - Supply (Defense Working
Capital Fund). Charge FDT (FOB origin) for O&M-funded materiel to the O&M Appropriation.
See Chapter 10, Section 10E, for specific transportation financial guidance.
8.42. General Use Vehicles for Research and Development (R&D) Activities:
   8.42.1. Use Other Procurement (3080) to pay for general use vehicles (defined as common
   equipment used in the day-to-day support of RDT&E base operation and maintenance
   activities).
   8.42.2. Use RDT&E for vehicles required solely for R&D projects, test and evaluation and
   government furnished equipment (GFE) to R&D contractors. This includes vehicles
   authorized specifically to support RDT&E projects, vehicles for targets, vehicles unique to a
   test effort, and vehicles operated by an RDT&E contractor. EXCEPTION: use 57*3080 for
   vehicles required for in-house contractors and base civil engineers responsible for road
   maintenance and debris clearance.
8.43. Buying Back Materiel an FMS Customer Offers for Return. When an AFMC Air
Logistic Complex (ALC) learns that an FMS customer offers to return material that satisfies a
 180                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


valid Air Force requirement for serviceable or unserviceable materiel, it will procure this
materiel as a separate transaction from the original USAF procurement for FMS. Returned
serviceable or unserviceable assets represent a new procurement by the AFMC ALC to meet Air
Force operational needs through the buy operating period. Use DWCF obligation authority,
rather than BPs 1500, 2500, 8300, and 8400 for such procurements. When needed, Air Force
customers will buy these items from the DWCF using O&M funds.
8.44. Funding for Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW). Table 8.2 tells how to fund
RIW included in modification and production contracts and transitioning to either organic or
contractor support upon completing RIW coverage.
     8.44.1. Peculiar support equipment, even when procured late in the acquisition cycle, is (by
     definition) a part of the cost for acquiring the weapon system. Charge it to the weapon
     system line.
     8.44.2. Include RIW costs as part of the unit cost of installed items, although warranty
     coverage is provided for both installed and spare parts.

 NOTE: When a buy of items covered by RIW is for both retrofit and production line
 installation, prorate the RIW cost between modification and production funds based on number
 of units for each purpose. Also, if you use organic labor for follow-on support, use the same
 method to prorate funding for peculiar support equipment related to the split buy.
8.45. Procedures for Replacement and Deposits to the General Fund of the Treasury. See
Volume 2A, Chapter 1, of DoD FMR 7000.14-R, for guidance on replacement, replacement-in-
kind, and free assets.
     8.45.1. Replacement Guidance--Weapon Systems or Principal Items:
          8.45.1.1. Replacement in Kind. The program manager must include reimbursement
          from the sale in reimbursable financing and the buy-back of the item in the reimbursable
          program. Do not show this transaction in the direct budget plan. (NOTE: ―Replacement
          in Kind‖ refers to an item sold that requires replacement with an item of the identical
          type, model, and series of ―mod‖ designation. EXAMPLE: Sale of a C-130E aircraft and
          purchase of a C-130E aircraft.
          8.45.1.2. Replacement. Include the reimbursement from the sale under reimbursable
          financing, but show the buy-back of the replacement item under the direct budget plan
          and comply with DoD reprogramming requirements, if applicable. (NOTE:
          ―Replacement‖ refers to an item sold that requires replacement to compensate Air Force
          inventories for the resultant loss of capability or readiness. But, because of
          circumstances, the replacement item will not be identical to the item sold. It must,
          however, be a later series of ―mod‖ designation of the same basic model (for example,
          sale of an F-4D and purchase of an F-4E) or an acceptable substitute item used for the
          same inventory objective or authorized acquisition objective in requirement computations
          (for example, sale of a CBU-58 fuse and purchase of an FMU-81 fuse).)
          8.45.1.3. MAJCOMs that want to replace a principal item with a later series or ―mod‖
          designation, or an acceptable substitute item, must submit a request for financing to
          SAF/FMBI. Include these items, as a minimum, in your request:
             8.45.1.3.1. FMS case designation.
             8.45.1.3.2. Item and number sold.
             8.45.1.3.3. Sale price of item (or items).
             8.45.1.3.4. Replacement item, number to be procured, cost per item, and total
             required.
             8.45.1.3.5. Inventory and authorized acquisition objective and on-hand status; and
             8.45.1.3.6. Date funds are required.       (NOTE: SAF/FMB will use the above
             information to prepare appropriate reprogramming requests, for submission to OSD
 182                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


             and the Congress or inclusion in the subsequent year‘s budget. SAF/FMB requires at
             least 120 days to obtain approval of reprogramming requests.)
         8.45.1.4. Replacement Guidance--Secondary Items. MAJCOMs may apply proceeds
         from the sale of a secondary item from inventory to buy any required secondary item in
         the same appropriation (for example, resources from sale of a 57*3010 item must be used
         to purchase a 57*3010 item). MAJCOMs must record reimbursable obligations for
         secondary items against specific FMS cases when applicable.
      8.45.2. Deposits to the General Fund of the Treasury (Miscellaneous Receipts):
         8.45.2.1. MAJCOMs must identify and account for free assets to report them on an ―as
         needed‖ basis to HQ USAF. Free assets are funds derived from the sale of an item of
         materiel (weapon system/principal item) and which do not require replacement.
         8.45.2.2. Program managers must identify free assets from the sale of principal items at
         the time of price and availability, and in the FMS letter of offer and acceptance (LOA)
         and the case directive.
         8.45.2.3. Program managers must annotate the LOA with this statement: ―Funds
         collected in payment for this sale will be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts account
         of the Treasury.‖
         8.45.2.4. The case directive will include this statement: ―Principal item not to be
         replaced in the inventory. Funds collected in payment for this sale will be deposited in the
         miscellaneous receipts account of the Treasury.‖
8.46. Small Weapons Procurement. All small weapons and arms, such as the M-16 rifle,
9MM Compact Pistol, M-9 Pistol, grenade launchers, etc. are centrally procured in the 3011
Procurement of Ammunition Appropriation.
8.47. Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
      8.47.1. Charge PCCIE procured as an embedded or integral part of the system it supports to
      the same P-1 line as the system itself.
      8.47.2. Use RDT&E (3600) for PCCIE procured to support RDT&E requirements.

Table 8.3. Test Program Sets (TPS) Follow these procedures for funding:
 IF                                               PAY FOR THE TEST PROGRAM SETS

8.48. Bid Sample Testing for Non-Development Items (NDI). Fund bid sample testing for
NDI either in procurement or O&M based on applying the expense/investment criteria to the cost
of the NDI if it were being procured. Use RDT&E to modify an NDI bid sample. Use O&M for
related military or civil servant travel.
8.49. Investment Funded Acquisition Costs: Note: This section does not apply to FMS funds.
The following sources provide guidance on the appropriate use of FMS funds: DoD FMR
7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7; DoD 5105.38M, Security Assistance Management Manual
(SAMM); AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management; and the
―FMS Administrative/Logistics Support Expense Budget Execution Plan, Specific Costs to be
Included or Excluded‖, matrix provided by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
      8.49.1. Direct Mission Support (DMS) Costs. Costs to provide an end item or operational
      capability for a weapon system or common item (other than payroll costs for government
      personnel), These include costs such as technical orders, sustaining engineering, contractor
      logistics support, and equipment installation, A&AS and FFRDC contractor support is also
      DMS if it provides for an end item operational capability for a weapon system or common
      item.
      8.49.2. Program Management Administration (PMA) Application. Procurement
      appropriations will be used to fund PMA costs that directly support production program
      activities for any program designated as a Program Executive Officer (PEO) program
      regardless of Acquisition Category (ACAT), appropriation or Budget Program (BP). In
      addition, modification programs designated as acquisition programs which are managed at
      the Air Logistic Complexs (ALC) may use the procurement appropriations to fund PMA. All
      other acquisition programs, including all acquisition programs of the ANG and Air Force
      Reserve, will continue to fund PMA costs in RDT&E or O&M. Due to its nature, PMA
      should be budgeted on an annual basis and reflected in the fiscal year during which the
      requirement is projected to execute. The appropriation used to fund PMA should be
      consistent with the work being performed and not determined simply by prorating between
      available appropriations. During execution, emergent PMA requirements may be paid from
      any fiscal year currently available for new obligation provided the appropriation cited is
      consistent with the task being supported. Shortfalls in budgeted PMA requirements need to
      be paid from the same appropriation as originally budgeted for the effort.
         8.49.2.1. PMA Allowable Costs. PMA costs are defined as those direct, unique
         program costs, other than payroll costs for government personnel, which are required for
         the operation of a program office in its management and oversight role. These include
         costs such as travel, printing, supplies, equipment, program office unique computer and
         communication costs, and pre-litigation, to include Alternate Disputes Resolution (ADR)
         process (before contractor files appeal with ASBCA or initiates action in court) costs
184                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      such as evaluation of claims. Advisory and Assistance Service (A&AS) and FFRDC
      contractor support to a program office is also PMA if it supports the functions of
      government personnel in managing a weapon system or common item. These program
      unique requirements should be budgeted in the weapon system PEC in either the RDT&E
      or procurement appropriation, and advocated by the using MAJCOM since these costs
      are reasonably considered part of the acquisition cost of the weapon system. For non-
      PMA costs, O&M is programmed and budgeted by AFMC and AFSPC in their respective
      PEs -- PE 72804 for AFSPC, PE 72806 for AFMC product centers and PE 78070 for the
      logistic centers See Table 8.4 for a matrix of allowable costs.
         8.49.2.1.1. Alternative Dispute Resolution. Unique program office costs associated
         with pre-litigation activities, including ADR, are legitimate PMA costs. However,
         once litigation begins (e.g., a contractor files an appeal with the Armed Services
         Board of Contract Appeals or initiates an action in court), litigation support costs,
         such as expert evaluation, are funded in O&M. NOTE: At its discretion, SAF/GCD
         may assist in the ADR process. As a HQ USAF function and the focal point for
         ADR issues, O&M (3400) funds are specifically appropriated to finance expenses
         incurred by that office for whatever ADR activities they choose to undertake.
         The involvement of SAF/GCD in any ADR process is at the sole discretion of
         that office.
      8.49.2.2. PMA Non-Allowable Costs. While PMA costs are legitimately included in
      the acquisition costs of weapon systems, it is critical that the Air Force avoid
      augmentation of the O&M appropriation by the RDT&E and procurement appropriations.
      As a result, PMA costs do not include civilian pay or overtime pay, base or installation
      operating support, or costs associated with headquarters level support. Consequently,
      AFMC and AFSPC must consistently apply their definition of standard support elements
      (i.e. telephone service to a desk, computers at a workstation, etc.) that are O&M funded,
      regardless of whether the location is a product center, logistics center, headquarters, or
      operating location. RDT&E and procurement funding is allowed only for those discrete
      program PMA requirements driven by unique program needs above the Command
      standard. These PMA cost exclusions are funded consistent with existing policy
      guidance contained in AFI 65-601, Volume I, and Air Staff direction. Excluded costs
      include base operating support (BOS), Indirect Mission Support or Direct Mission
      Support.
         8.49.2.2.1. BOS Costs. These are base O&M-type costs to provide common
         infrastructure support required by all installation offices regardless of mission. This
         includes the cost of standard furniture for a general purpose administrative office
         building in which program offices reside.
      8.49.2.2.2. Indirect Mission Support (IMS). Costs to provide the Product Support
      Business Area infrastructure at a center (other than payroll costs for government
      personnel) These tasks allow the center to perform its primary product support mission
      (e.g. general support, business area management, and product line management). IMS
      costs include travel, printing, supplies, equipment, staff office unique computer and
      communication costs, and other functional home office support costs. A&AS and FFRDC
      contractor support to a staff office is also IMS if it supports the functions of the
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  185


      government personnel in managing these cross-cutting activities. IMS is advocated by
      AFMC and AFSPC.

                   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS

Section 9A—Planning and Programming, Authorizations and Appropriations

9.1. Composition of Program. The Military Construction (MILCON) Program consists of the
appropriations below. See AFMAN 65-604 for specific project codes.

Table 9.1. Military Construction Appropriations.
 57*/*3300 Military Construction, Air Force.
 57*/*3730 Military Construction, Air Force Reserve.
 57*/*3830 Military Construction, Air National Guard.
 57*/*0740 Family Housing Construction.

 97X0510, DoD Base Closure and Realignment Account
 97X0512, DoD Base Closure and Realignment Account, Part V
   9.1.1. The Air Force MILCON program contains the following:
      9.1.1.1. All land acquisition.
      9.1.1.2. Acquiring and constructing facilities.
      9.1.1.3. Adding to, expanding, extending, converting, altering, or replacing existing
      facilities.
      9.1.1.4. Relocating facilities.
      9.1.1.5. Planning and Design.
      9.1.1.6. Construction overhead, supervision, and inspection.
      9.1.1.7. Equipment installed in and made a part of real property structures and
      improvements (real property installed equipment - RPIE).
      9.1.1.8. Demolition required to allow construction.
   9.1.2. Exclude all production and movable equipment. However, in presenting construction
   programs and budgets, disclose the source and cost of all production and movable equipment
   directly associated with these programs. Also, reimburse funded project costs initially
   financed from other appropriations.
9.2. Obtaining Congressional Authorizations:
   9.2.1. Air Force and other Defense organizations must obtain specific Congressional
   authorization for work under major construction programs (note special process requirements
   for Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities, 10 USC Section 2854,
   and for Emergency Construction, 10 USC Section 2803). If authorization expires, the Air
   Force must seek reauthorization. Record obligations against the fiscal year in which the
   construction project was appropriated, not the year authorization was extended. NOTE:
 188                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   Legislative authorization for an active DoD component‘s projects that have not started (no
   obligations incurred) expires at the later of these two dates:
       9.2.1.1. At the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year which authorized
       the project. (For example, a project authorized in FY10 expires at the end of FY12).
       9.2.1.2. Upon enactment of the Authorization Act for the third fiscal year (FY13 in the
       previous example) following the fiscal year which authorized the project, whichever is
       later. Congressional committees must approve extension of the authorization in that third
       year act or the authorization expires.
   9.2.2. The Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard MILCON programs require
   separate congressional authorizations.
   9.2.3. The Air Force must present and justify MILCON programs through established
   MAJCOM and staff channels. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Office
   of Management and Budget (OMB) then must approve these programs before they go to
   Congress for legislative authorization.
   9.2.4. MAJCOMs must support MILCON programs with data on proposed physical capacity
   or units of measurement, as well as estimated costs, for projects subject to the new
   authorization request. Arrange data for such projects by State and installation. Include
   comparative data on the existing real property inventory, previously authorized construction,
   and projects expected to be subject to future requests for authorization. MAJCOMs must also
   provide basic related data for new or changed missions and projected strength of forces. This
   information allows the Air Staff and OSD to determine how to assign parts of programs
   either to a request for immediate authorization or to a future request.
9.3. Obtaining Congressional Appropriations. To carry out military construction (MILCON)
projects, you must have authorization and appropriation of funds.If an authorized project is not in
an approved ―appropriation act‖, you must include it in a subsequent annual MILCON
appropriation act or do an approved reprogramming. Requests for reprogrammings shall not be
submitted when any of the following conditions exist: For any project or effort that has not been
authorized, with the following exceptions: 1. Projects constructed under 10 U.S.C, sections
2803,2854, 2663(d), or 2827. 2. Reserve component projects that receive ―lump-sum‖
authorizations (see DoD FMR 070303). Do not try to reprogram a project for which Congress
denied appropriations, unless congressional reports state the Air Force should do so.
9.4. Relating Budget:
   9.4.1. The congressional appropriations committees approve individual projects, but the
   amounts appropriated may be less than their estimated cost. Do not start an approved project
   unless you can finance it to completion from appropriated funds available at the time the
   project starts. But you may start a large project if OMB has approved incremental funding
   and the Air Force has obtained special legislative arrangements for full authorization and
   incremental appropriations.
   9.4.2. Use the funds in each annual appropriation act for:
       9.4.2.1. Cumulative adjustments (in light of balances of funds previously made
       available) needed to finance to completion projects already approved and started.
       9.4.2.2. Projects you expect to start during the current fiscal year.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 189


     9.4.2.3. Projects that still represent valid requirements for the budget year.
     9.4.2.4. Amounts previously appropriated above actual cost to cover cost overruns or
     adjustments to other projects.
  9.4.3. Handling Changes in Scope and Cost. AF/A7C and SAF/IEI will determine if they
  must request approval in advance for major changes to approved projects. Requests must go
  through DoD, OMB, and the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees of Congress.
  Also, under 10 U.S.C. 2853 and congressional committee reports, SAF/IEI must notify
  Congress when a project‘s scope decreases more than 25 percent or when its cost increases or
  decreases more than 200 percent of the minor construction project ceiling or 25 percent of
  the amount appropriated, whichever is less.
     9.4.3.1. Scope Changes. The DD Forms 1391 submitted to Congress show the scope of
     a facility in units of measure such as square feet of building space, square yards of
     pavement, etc. When Congress approves a project, they establish its scope.
         9.4.3.1.1. The scope of work for a project may not be increased above the amount
         specified in the justification data provided to Congress.
         9.4.3.1.2. Do not decrease the approved scope by more than 25 percent without prior
         approval of AF/A7C and completion of congressional notification action.
     9.4.3.2. Cost Increases. Adjust project financing consistent with congressional
     authorization and the reprogramming criteria in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, , Volume 3,
     Chapter 7. Chapter 7 of DoD FMR 7000.14-R has the complete details on all
     reprogramming requirements and restrictions for Military Construction and
     Military Family Housing. Stay within total amounts appropriated in each annual
     appropriation act and follow restrictions in the following bullets. You may adjust
     financing to complete projects approved and started, to cover projects you expect to start
     during the current fiscal year, and to meet other project costs that represent valid
     unfinanced requirements for the budget year.
         9.4.3.2.1. Congress has authorized increased or decreased project costs from the
         appropriated amount, without a formal reprogramming request, up to 25 percent of
         the amount appropriated for such project or 200% of the minor construction ceiling,
         whichever is less (see 10 USC 2853)., . The Congress, in P.L. 107-107 (FY 02
         NDAA, Sec. 2802 amended 10 U.S.C. 2853) provided that ―the costs associated with
         the required remediation of an environmental hazard in connection with a military
         construction project or military housing project, such as asbestos removal, radon
         abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, or any other legally required
         environmental hazard remediation, if the required remediation could not have
         reasonably been anticipated at the time the project was approved originally by
         Congress‖ may be excluded from the military construction reprogramming threshold.
         However, it is Air Force policy that no increase is authorized without AF/A7C
         prior approval.
         9.4.3.2.2. Use projects authorized and appropriated by the Congress as offsets to
         cover cost increases for others previously approved by the appropriations committees
         under major construction programs. But first clear your actions with AF/A7C. Often
 190                                                            AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


           DoD , OMB, and Congressional Committee approval is required. See DoD FMR Vol
           3, Ch 7 for specific guidance.

Section 9B—Funding Relocatable Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters, Aircraft Sun Shades
and other modular structures

9.5. Relocatable Buildings. AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction
(MILCON) Projects, explains how to acquire, manage, and use relocatable buildings. It also
addresses approval levels for using relocatables on an installation. If an organization or activity
procures a relocatable or portable building through the base supply system or has it assembled by
the Base Civil Engineer, that organization or activity will pay for the purchase or assembly.
Charge costs for relocatablebuildings in accordance with Table 9.2.
   9.5.1. Stress Tension Shelters. Stress tension shelters (STS) (for example, Portomods)
   usually have a fabric membrane in tension over a rigid frame. Charge costs for Stress
   Tension Shelters in accordance with Table 9.2.
   9.5.2. Aircraft Sun Shades. Aircraft sun shades are modular structures with a maximum of
   two sides and the sole purpose of providing minimal shelter from the elements (sun, wind,
   rain, snow, etc.). Charge costs for Aircraft Sunshades in accordance with Table 9.2.
9.6. Funding Relocatable Buildings, STSs and Aircraft Sunshades.
   9.6.1. Include the cost of relocating a relocatable building, STS or aircraft sunshade from
   one installation to another and the fair market value of the STS as part of the total costs of the
   new project.
   9.6.2. If a relocatable building, STS, or aircraft sunshade procured and erected on an existing
   foundation or pad (no MILCON required), it is procured as an equipment item in either Other
   Procurement (3080) or O&M (3400), depending on application of the current
   expense/investment threshold.
   9.6.3. Should construction of a foundation/pad be necessary for support/installation/erection
   of a aircraft sun shade(s) or STS(s), procurement and installation/erection of the shade(s) or
   STS(s) is funded as part of the construction cost. Relocatable buildings are included on the
   Form 1391 as an unfunded cost. If construction of the foundation/pad supports multiple
   relocatable building, sunshades or STSs, then supporting all of those relocatable buildings,
   sunshades or STSs is a single requirement, therefore, the construction is a single project. The
   cost of the construction cannot be sub-divided into the number of relocatable buildings,
   sunshades or STSs being supported in order to avoid project thresholds.
   9.6.4. Allied Support. Allied support is the provision of power, water, etc. provided to a
   relocatable building, STS, or aircraft sunshade up to a connection point at the structure.
   Allied support funding requirements will be prioritized along with other facility and
   infrastructure requirements through the installation‘s Financial Management Board, financial
   working groups, and facility working groups. Providing allied support where it doesn‘t
   currently exist is considered construction. A project may be executed in complete and usable
   phases, but all phases must be considered for project approval thresholds. When adding
   allied support, the cost of the allied support cannot be sub-divided into the number of
   relocatable structures being supported in order to avoid project thresholds.

9.7. Prewired Work Stations, Systems Furniture, Communications Prewiring:
   9.7.1. Prewired Work Stations. Charge the cost of prewired work stations to O&M. Do
   not charge the cost of prewired work stations as a part of a MILCON project (3300) when
   constructing a new facility or altering a facility (FY 97 PBD 376, 4 Dec 95). For MILCON
   projects, include the cost of the stations on the DD 1391, Military Construction Project
   Data, as a non-add entry in Block 9 for ―Equipment Provided from Other Appropriations.‖ In
   block 12b, list the equipment as an O&M funded item, the fiscal year in which the funds will
   be requested, and the line item cost. The O&M funds for prewired work stations must be
   identified separately in bidding documents for obligating and audit purposes. As excluded
   costs, the systems are retained as unit personal property and are not picked up on real
   property records.
   9.7.2. Systems Furniture. This term describes prewired work stations procured for a
   facility without MILCON additions or alterations. Use O&M-type funds (not O&M-type
   construction funds). If you are procuring the systems furniture as part of an O&M-funded
   minor construction project, do not count the furniture against the $750,000 statutory
   limitation for construction.
   9.7.3. Communications Prewiring of Buildings to Support Information Systems and
   Services:
       9.7.3.1. When constructing, adding to, or altering a new facility, with MILCON funds or
       P341 Minor Construction funds, include:
           9.7.3.1.1. All basic communications support required for information services and
           local area networking, including voice, data, facsimile, video, alarms, sensors, etc.
           9.7.3.1.2. All work within the building for telephone wiring, conduits, cable ducts,
           raceways, and modular jacks and outlets. (The wiring will not become real property.)
           9.7.3.1.3. All wiring, cabling, fiber optic cables (FOC), conduits, ducts, manholes,
           and pathways from the customer‘s jacks to the point where the new facility will
           receive network services (dial tone and Internet protocol access).
       9.7.3.2. Exclude from communications prewiring:
           9.7.3.2.1. End instruments and equipment such as telephones, work stations, data
           terminals, switchboards, computers, etc.
           9.7.3.2.2. Any prewiring that is part of a minor construction project using O&M
           funds.
       9.7.3.3. See AFCESA Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 02-12 for further details.
9.8. Unspecified Minor Construction (P-341): An unspecified minor military construction
project is a military construction project that has an approved cost equal to or less than
$2,000,000. However, if the military construction project is intended solely to correct a
deficiency that is life-threatening, health-threatening, or safety-threatening, an unspecified minor
military construction project may have an approved cost equal to or less than $3,000,000. When
a decision is made to carry out an unspecified minor military construction project, SAF/IEI wll
notify in writing the appropriate committees of Congress of that decision, of the justification for
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     193


the project, and of the estimated cost of the project. The project may then be carried out only
after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by the
committees or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of
the notification is provided in an electronic medium.
   9.8.1. Apply Table 9.3 for project approval and reporting requirements:

Table 9.3. Unspecified Minor Construction Approval and Reporting.
 FOR THESE PROJECTS                                THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES


 Projects costing between $750,000 and             SAF approves.
 $3,000,000                                        Must satisfy congressional notification
                                                   requirements.*

 All projects over $750,000                        SAF approves
                                                   Must satisfy congressional notification
                                                   requirements.*
                                                   *Air Force must notify Congress in writing 21
                                                   days before obligating funds.

   9.8.2. AF/A7C manages unspecified minor construction MILCON funds. MAJCOM
   requests for these funds must meet the requirements of AFI 32-1021. AF/A7C reserves funds
   in the amount of the current working estimate when notified by the MAJCOM that an
   approved minor construction project is fully designed and is ready for procurement action.
   9.8.3. MAJCOMs must advise AF/A7C by message of the amount of the lowest acceptable
   bid, plus contingency. Funding will be on a project basis. MAJCOMs may not transfer funds
   to another project. The Guard and Reserve manage their own P-341 funds.
9.9. O&M Minor Construction. Use O&M to cover projects with funded cost of $750,000 or
less. If the project will cost more than $750,000, submit it to A7 for further processing as either
an unspecified minor construction or as a major construction project. You must use MILCON
major or unspecified minor construction to reimburse the O&M type construction funds for
expenses incurred to that date. Reference AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming
Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects.
   9.9.1. The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GCA) made a legal determination that when the
   threshold for O&M minor military construction is increased by Congress amending 10
   U.S.C. 2805(c) (1)(B), the new threshold is applicable, retroactively, to minor military
   construction projects placed on contract prior to the date of the enactment of the law
   increasing the threshold. That means, any legitimate within scope cost increases, which may
   occur after enactment, will be subject to the newly enacted threshold and not the threshold in
   the law at the time the contract was executed.
9.10. Acquiring Air Conditioning Systems for New Construction or Additions. Use either
military construction (3300) or O&M minor construction (3400) funds (depending on current
 194                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


funding threshold when you procure or install air conditioning systems as RPIE, for either
computer operations or human comfort (see paragraph 8.20).

Section 9C—Financial Management for Military Construction Projects

9.11. Financial Management Guidance. This section applies to acquiring and or constructing
of real property, including:
   9.11.1. Costs charged to appropriations available for military construction (funded costs).
   9.11.2. Costs financed by appropriations or funds other than those available for a specific
   construction project (unfunded costs). Capitalize these costs as part of the real property
   investment.
   9.11.3. Obligation and expenditure restrictions and limitations for military construction
   projects.
   9.11.4. Other related functions.
9.12. Funding for Planning and Design:
   9.12.1. You may fund planning and design to develop cost estimates for a project without
   specific congressional authorization, as long as you stay within amounts otherwise
   appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2807). If the estimated design costs are more than $1,000,000, the
   Secretary of the Air Force notifies the appropriate congressional committees at least 21 days
   (14 days for electronic notifications) before the initial obligation of funds for these services.
   (Note: Only active DoD Components must notify the committees.)
   9.12.2. Use MILCON planning and design funds for the following:
       9.12.2.1. Architectural and engineering services and construction design required for site
       investigation, survey, mapping, or sketches.
       9.12.2.2. Preparing cost estimates for construction and land acquisition projects.
       9.12.2.3. Preparing plans, specifications, value engineering studies and construction
       contract documents.
       9.12.2.4. Managing construction projects chargeable to foreign governments if United
       States Armed Forces elements are the main users.
9.13. Under the authority of planning and design, the Military Departments may also:
   9.13.1. Develop and update design criteria and manuals.
   9.13.2. Prepare standard designs and definitive drawings used on military construction
   projects.
   9.13.3. Manage design of military construction programs and contract administrative
   services for design.
   9.13.4. Certify project cost.
   9.13.5. Administer architectural and engineering service contracts to design construction and
   land acquisition projects.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    195


  9.13.6. Print and reproduce bid documents, prepare pre-bid government estimates, and
  establish liaison with prospective bidders prior to award of a construction contract.
  9.13.7. Do not use design funding to formulate a project. See paragraph 9.15.5 below for
  advance planning. Also, limit direct architectural engineering fees to six percent of the
  predetermined estimated construction cost of a project or part of a project to which
  architectural work applies (10 U.S.C. 9540).
  9.13.8. Funding Major Construction:
     9.13.8.1. Major military construction projects include all acquisition and construction,
     additions, expansions, extensions, conversions, alterations, or replacements of facilities
     with (a) costs above the amount specified by law as the maximum amount for a minor
     construction project or (b) any project, regardless of cost, approved as a specific line item
     in the Military Construction budget request.
     9.13.8.2. When determining the costs of a major construction project, include:
         9.13.8.2.1. Surveys and site preparation.
         9.13.8.2.2. Acquiring, converting, rehabilitating, and installing facilities.
         9.13.8.2.3. Acquiring and installing real property installed equipment and
         appurtenances.
         9.13.8.2.4. Acquiring and installing supporting facilities (including utilities) and
         appurtenances.
         9.13.8.2.5. Supervising, inspection, and overhead (SIOH).
         9.13.8.2.6. Developing and supporting design for construction projects after
         construction award (includes change orders, value engineering proposals, and as-built
         drawings).
     9.13.8.3. Exclude from major construction those costs identified as minor construction,
     planning and design, or supporting activities.
  9.13.9. Funding Emergency Construction (10 U. S.C. 2803):
     9.13.9.1. Follow these general guidelines for emergency construction -- construction
     without authorization and appropriation. The Military Departments may do emergency
     construction if the requirement is so urgent that the project deferral for inclusion in the
     next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent with national
     security requirements, health, safety, or environmental quality. Note: Reserve
     Components cannot request emergency construction.
     9.13.9.2. SAF/IEI notifies, in writing, the appropriate committees of Congress of the
     decision to carry out a project under Sec 2803 including the following::
         9.13.9.2.1. Justify and estimate the project cost.
         9.13.9.2.2. Justify as emergency construction.
         9.13.9.2.3. State the source of funds for the project.
         9.13.9.2.4. After Section 2803 10 U.S.C. notification, SAF/FM will request a
         reprogramming in accordance with DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 7.
196                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      9.13.9.3. The Air Force must finance emergency construction projects within amounts
      appropriated for military construction that have not been obligated for other purposes.
      The maximum amount that each Service may obligate in any fiscal year is established by
      law (currently $50 million).
      9.13.9.4. Construction may not start until the Congressional notification is made, the
      notification period has expired, and the reprogramming of funds has received approval of
      the appropriate Congressional committees.
      9.13.9.5. Except as otherwise specified, follow the same restrictions and limitations for
      emergency construction projects as for major construction projects. Also, identify and
      treat costs for emergency construction projects in the same way as those for major
      construction projects.
  9.13.10. Funding Contingency Construction:
      9.13.10.1. Before using Contingency Construction authority (10 U.S.C. 2804), the Air
      Force must:
      9.13.10.2. Determine for each project financed under this authority that waiting to
      include it in the next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent with
      national security or national interest.
      9.13.10.3. Obtain the Secretary of Defense approval.
      9.13.10.4. Notify the House and the Senate Committees on Armed Services and
      Appropriations.
      9.13.10.5. Wait 30 days after notifying Congress before obligating funds.
      9.13.10.6. The individual Services seldom use this authority. The Secretary of Defense
      will approve a project only if it directly supports a Defense-wide effort and the Service
      can justify why it can not use its own emergency authority.
  9.13.11. Facilities for Operational Requirements (10 U. S.C. 101(a)(13)(A)) (See AFI
  32-1032, IC 2002-1, Chapter 7).
      9.13.11.1. The fund source for facilities under this authority is the Air Force O&M
      (3400) Appropriation. Section 2808 of the FY04 National Defense Authorization Act
      (NDAA) (P.L. 108-136) initially established this authority but it has never been
      codified and must be renewed each year by the current NDAA to remain in effect.
      The construction is required for operations in support of a declaration of war, the
      declaration by the President of a national emergency under section 201 of the
      National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621), or a contingency operation. The only
      location in which this authority may be exercised is the geographical area for which the
      combatant command conducting the contingency operation is responsible and then, only
      in the area where actual operations are being conducted. The requirement for projects
      carried out under this authority should be in immediate and direct support of combat
      operations or force protection for those engaged in combat operations. It is particularly
      applicable in countries, friendly or not, where the United States does not currently have a
      significant permanent military presence. The construction is not to be carried out at a
      military installation where the United States is reasonably expected to have a long-term
      presence. It does not apply to a rear echelon even if that echelon provides support to
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   197


     the front-line troops. NOTE: The FY 2004 NDAA Section 2808 states, ―The
     temporary authority provided by this section, and the limited authority provided by
     section 2805(c) 10, United States Code, to use appropriated funds available for
     operation and maintenance to carry out a construction project are the only authorities
     available to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments
     to use operation and maintenance to carryout construction projects.‖
     9.13.11.2. The application of the stated authority does not apply to any facility
     requirements costing less than $750,000, as they are provided for under other available
     authority, such as 10 U.S.C. 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction.
     9.13.11.3. The facilities to be constructed under this authority will be for an urgent
     military operational requirement the need for which is not expected to exceed two years,
     but is so pressing that the use of other authorities would not allow the requirement to be
     met. Hence, without regard to standard Air Force or Department of Defense facility
     construction standards, any facility provided under this authority will be designed and
     built as temporary construction -the minimum necessary to meet the temporary
     operational requirements. The applied construction standard will recognize that the
     facility is only being provided to meet a temporary need and will be abandoned at the
     termination of operational requirements. Projects to which this authority may be applied
     include erection of facilities, acquisition of temporary interests in land, and design. Such
     projects may combine work typically considered as construction with work considered as
     services and may include repair of pre-existing facilities. Use relocatable or semi-
     permanent construction to the maximum, extent possible. For further detail, see AFI
     32-1032, Interim Change (IC) 2002-1, Chapter 7, Paragraph 7.2).
     9.13.11.4. Approval Authorities. OUSD(C) February 27, 2003, memorandum,
     SUBJECT: Availability of Operation and Maintenance Appropriations for Construction,
     directs that OUSD(C) must approve ―any proposals to expend operation and
     maintenance appropriations for construction necessary to meet temporary military
     operational exigencies‖
     9.13.11.5. Certification and Reporting. The Air Force component commander will
     recertify the operational requirement for the facility for continued use beyond the original
     approved time. SAF/IEI must approve continued use beyond two years. The request must
     include the original DD Form 1391 and operational justification for continued use of the
     facility. Requests for SAF/IEI approval will be submitted through the MAJCOM to
     AF/A7CR for staffing. Both MAJCOM commanders and operational commanders using
     this authority shall submit a monthly report listing all projects approved under this
     authority during the previous six months. An operational commander will submit the
     report through the appropriate MAJCOM Civil Engineer. These reports shall be
     submitted by the 15th of each month to SAF/IEI with a copy to AF/A7CR for review.
     SAF/IEI will make appropriate notification to congress no less than once a quarter.
     9.13.11.6. For additional detail on the use of the authority under 10 U. S.C.
     101(a)(13)(A) and documentation required, refer to AFI 32-1032, IC 2002-1,
     Chapter 7 .
     9.13.11.7. Funding for Construction Authority in Event of Declaration of War or
     National Emergency (10 U. S.C. 2808). In the event of a declaration of war or the
198                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      declaration by the President of a national emergency, the Secretary of Defense may
      authorize the Service Secretaries to undertake military construction projects not otherwise
      authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. The source
      of funds must come from funds already appropriated for military construction, including
      funds appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.
      9.13.11.8. AF/A7C submits a request to the Secretary of Defense through USD(AT&L),
      following procedures outlined in DoDD 4270.5.
      9.13.11.9. The authority to carry out projects under 10 U.S.C. 2808 will terminate at the
      end of the war or national emergency.
  9.13.12. Funding Unspecified Minor Construction. Minor construction projects include
  all acquisition (except land), new construction, addition, expansion, extension, alteration,
  conversion, replacement, or installation of permanent or temporary facilities (except family
  quarters). Follow this guidance:
      9.13.12.1. The funded cost of the project may not exceed the amount specified by 10
      U.S.C. 2805 for the Active components and 10 U.S.C. 18233a. for the Reserve
      components.
      9.13.12.2. Do not include the project in the budget request as a specific line item.
      9.13.12.3. Make sure each minor construction authority project results in a complete real
      property facility or improvement. As much as possible, keep projects consistent with the
      installation master plan. In your request for approval, clearly show project's relation to
      the master plan and detail further planned construction to the same or closely related
      facilities.
      9.13.12.4. Notify appropriate congressional committees before starting a minor
      construction project costing more than $750,000 for Active components, or $750,000 for
      Reserve components. Per 10 USC Section 2805: The project may then be carried out
      only after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received
      by the committees or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the dateon
      which a copy of the the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to
      section 480 of this title.
      9.13.12.5. Do not use, on a nonreimbursable basis, materials, supplies, or installed
      capital equipment items on minor construction projects.
      9.13.12.6. Identify a project's end result and relate it to the installation's master plan
      before you establish it as a minor construction project.
      9.13.12.7. See details in AFI 32-1021 for a minor construction project's scope of work
      under 10 U.S.C. 2805 authority.
      9.13.12.8. Do not start incremental-type construction projects. Do not acquire or improve
      a real property facility through a series of minor construction projects.
      9.13.12.9. Notwithstanding any other provisions for approval of minor construction
      projects, the Air Force cannot propose to complete a project under minor construction
      authority that Congress previously deleted from proposed military construction
      authorization legislation or otherwise disapproved.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     199


  9.13.13. Funding Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities (10
  U. S.C. 2854):
     9.13.13.1. The Service Secretary may fund projects without previous legislative
     authorization and appropriation to repair, restore, or replace a damaged or destroyed
     facility.
     9.13.13.2. The Service Secretary, or his/her designated representative, notifies the
     appropriate committees of Congress of the decision to restore or replace damaged or
     destroyed facilities requiring military construction. If military construction is required for
     restoration or replacement, a military construction reprogramming request is transmitted
     to the Appropriations Committees according to 10 U.S.C. 2854 and DoD FMR 7000.14-
     R, Vol. 3, Chapter 7. Include the project justification, the current cost estimate, and the
     source of funds.
     9.13.13.3. Restoration or replacement requiring military construction may be financed
     from unobligated amounts within Air Force MILCON appropriations.
     9.13.13.4. The project may then be carried out only after:
  9.13.13.4.1. (1) the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is
  received by such committees or the end of the seven-day period beginning on the date on
  which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium and
         9.13.13.4.2. (2) written approval of the reprogramming by the appropriations
         committees
  9.13.14. Funding Supporting Activities (23 U. S.C. 210). This section covers access roads
  the Air Force requires in conjunction with construction, expansion, improvement,
  replacement, or relocation of DoD facilities.
     9.13.14.1. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command must approve
     prior to including the project in the President‘s Budget  9.13.11.2. Do not use these
     funds to finance roads within the boundaries of a military reservation. (Charge these
     highways to major construction, emergency construction, or minor construction
     programs, as applicable.) Normally you cannot use these funds to finance projects in the
     regular Federal Aid Primary Systems.
         9.13.14.1.1. Finance these projects by either:
         9.13.14.1.2. Providing "Defense access roads funds" to the Department of
         Transportation by a SF 1151, Nonexpenditure Transfer Authorization,
         nonexpenditure cash transfer, or;
         9.13.14.1.3. Reimbursing the Department of Transportation for work completed.
  9.13.15. Scope of a Military Construction Project. Include the following in the project's
  scope:
     9.13.15.1. All land acquisitions, regardless of cost.
     9.13.15.2. All construction efforts or any contribution authorized by law, as specifically
     authorized by law, necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or improve an
     existing facility.
 200                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       9.13.15.3. Real property installed equipment (RPIE) installed in and made part of real
       property structures or improvements. But, you must (1) exclude all production and
       moveable equipment, and (2) Disclose the source and cost of all directly associated
       production and movable equipment when presenting construction programs and budgets.
       9.13.15.4. Cost of acquiring or leasing a temporary building to house displaced functions
       while altering the facility.
       9.13.15.5. Construction applicable to a real property facility.
9.14. Costs Financed with Military Construction Appropriations. See paragraph 9.15.1 for
capitalized unfunded costs not financed by MILCON appropriations.
   9.14.1. Charge all military construction program costs to the military construction
   appropriations. Include design (Project 313), major construction projects, minor construction
   projects, supporting activities, military construction overhead, and projects authorized by the

          obtain authorization of the specific project before incurring costs.
9.15. Financing Efforts by Other than Military Construction Appropriations:
   9.15.1. Unfunded costs are those that (a) contribute to a military construction project, (b) are
   chargeable to appropriations other than military construction, and (c) are not reimbursed by
   appropriations available for military construction. You must capitalize unfunded costs as
   part of the real property investment. Include these costs:

      9.15.3.1. Charge costs of installing or placing movable equipment (including ancillary
      equipment associated solely with the major items) to Other Procurement (57*3080) or
      O&M type funds using current expense or investment criteria.
      9.15.3.2. The use of "turn-key procurement" in a contracting action does not preclude or
      create any exception(s) to the legal use of appropriated funds.
      9.15.3.3. An upgrade, alteration, conversion, or expansion of an entire existing facility is
      funded as construction. The movable and detachable equipment (non-RPIE) is still
      funded according to guidance above.
   9.15.4. Do not charge construction for installation or relocation costs of moveable or
   detachable operational equipment items. Charge such costs to O&M appropriations; RDT&E
   appropriations; procurement appropriations; or DWCF resources as appropriate:
      9.15.4.1. Prefabricated screens, partitions, special foundations, false floors, platforms,
      shielding for electromagnetic radiating services, and prefabricated clean rooms.

  9.16.1. Program Restrictions:
      9.16.1.1. You must have specific authorization for work performed under major
      construction programs unless the project is under:
         9.16.1.1.1. One of the authorities provided by Title 10, U.S.C., sections 2233a, 2672,
         2672a, 2675, 2803, 2904, 2805, 2808, 2810, 2854, or
         9.16.1.1.2. Other authorities used to carry out a project not otherwise specifically
         authorized.
      9.16.1.2. The Authorization Act contains the authorization and, usually, a limitation on
      total project costs. Do not exceed the total amount authorized for any appropriation. But,
      in certain circumstances, individual cost limitations authorize overruns, within stated
      percentages.
  9.16.2. Handling Obligation and Expenditure Restrictions. All levels of command must:
      9.16.2.1. Comply with DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, Administrative Control of
      Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations, and the Antideficiency Act.
      9.16.2.2. Establish adequate funds control according to DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4
      to ensure that the Air Force completes individual projects consistent with authorized
      purposes and within authorized and available funds.
  9.16.3. Unless otherwise specifically provided for, the cost estimate for each project
  approved by the Congress is not a separate statutory cost limitation. Report scope or financial
  changes in previously approved individual projects, through Air Staff channels, in advance,
  to appropriate Congressional Committees for their approval in accordance with Title 10
  requirements. First, obtain proper clearance within DoD and OMB as necessary.
  9.16.4. Apply limitations at the project level for major construction and at the budget activity
  level for minor construction, planning and design, etc.
  9.16.5. The Air Force may realign resources between projects consistent with DoD FMR
  7000.14-R, Volume 3.
  9.16.6. SAF/FMB issues funding authorizations (subdivisions of appropriated funds) to incur
  obligations to MAJCOMs, Design Agents, or Construction Agents responsible for
  construction, and to MAJCOMs responsible for MFH O&M. SAF/FMB will issue only one
  construction appropriation funding allocation to any operating agency. Operating agencies
  will issue only one fund allotment from any allocation to each operating unit.
  9.16.7. SAF/FMB and each operating agency must include on each allocation or allotment
  only the additional obligation limitations established by OMB or the Secretary of Defense, or
  as otherwise required by the Congress or the President. Every level of command must
  comply with separate limitations imposed on total costs by legislative authorizations and by
  administrative action connected with all budgetary and funding actions as well as with
  program execution.
  9.16.8. When you do construction work or services for another Military Department,
  Defense Agency, or another Federal agency, do so on a reimbursable basis based on the
  orders to be reimbursed to your construction appropriation. (There is one exception: Army

AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      205


   may do work or services for the Department of the Air Force and the Federal Emergency
   Management Agency under allocations or allotments.)
       9.16.8.1. Do not establish transfer appropriation accounts for any such work.
       9.16.8.2. Do not provide funding advances to finance orders given for work or services.
       9.16.8.3. Do not do work or services under a direct "citation of funds", (i.e., direct charge
       by the performing unit and or activity to the funds of the ordering unit and or activity).
   9.16.9. When doing reimbursable work or services under a construction appropriation,
   MAJCOMs and operating units must limit costs according to the terms of the orders
   received. Include estimates of reimbursable orders received or anticipated in your operating
   budgets.
   9.16.10. Do not spend more than 6 percent of the estimated project cost on producing and
   delivering designs, plans, drawings, and specifications for any public works or utilities
   project according to Title 10, U.S.C. Sections 4540, 7212, and 9540. Exclude these indirect
   costs from the 6 percent threshold:

   9.16.11. Handling Certifications of Costs:
       9.16.11.1. As directed in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 17, Subparagraph
       170403, MAJCOMs and operating units responsible for construction projects must
       prepare the certification of incurred costs.
           9.16.11.1.1. These certifications include statements of total cost incurred on the
           project, the funded and unfunded part of total costs, and a statement that funded costs
           incurred do not exceed authorized amounts.
           9.16.11.1.2. Disclose authorized amounts and the approving authority with the
           statement of total and funded costs.
       9.16.11.2. Prepare the certification within 60 days after the project's completion. The
       installation commander, the responsible civil engineering official, and the responsible
       fiscal official sign the certification.

                                            Chapter 10

         OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AIR FORCE, APPROPRIATION

Section 10A—Scope

10.1. Purpose. This chapter applies to all levels of command that use these appropriations:
   10.1.1. Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Air Force, 57*3400.
   10.1.2. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) 57*3600, appropriation for
   AFMC-controlled installations Management and Support Funds and AFSPC.
   10.1.3. Statutory Prohibition. O&M (3400) funds are not to be used for the operation,
   repair, and maintenance of Military Family Housing. The Military Construction
   Appropriations Act of FY 2000 (P.L. 106-52, Sec. 128) directs that ―funds appropriated
   in the Military Construction Appropriations Acts for operation and maintenance of
   family housing shall be the exclusive source of funds for repair and maintenance of all
   family housing units, including flag and general officer quarters‖ (See AFI 32-6002,
   Family Housing Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction).
   10.1.4. Transportation Subsidy. Consistent with OMB Circular A-11, agencies are to
   report the costs of this program in Object Class 12.1, Civilian Personnel Benefits, and 12.2,
   Military Personnel Benefits. Transportation subsidy costs for the affected individuals will be
   budgeted in the same appropriation/fund that pays compensation costs. Therefore, civilian
   personnel transportation subsidy benefit should be budgeted in the appropriation/fund which
   finances their compensation and the military personnel transportation subsidy benefit will be
   budgeted in the appropriate military personnel appropriation. Compensation costs are those
   that are reported in Object Class 11, Personnel Compensation, for the appropriation.‖ (OSD
   Comptroller Sep 12, 2000 Memo, Subject: Fiscal Year (FY) 2002/2003 Defense Budget
   Review – Additional Guidance)
   10.1.5. Parking Expense Reimbursement for Certain Members and Civilians. See JFTR
   (U3550) and the JTR (C2600). This authority does not permit contracting for parking.

Section 10B—Temporary Duty Travel (TDY)

10.2. Funding TDY Costs:
   10.2.1. As a rule, each Air Force activity must pay for its personnel‘s TDY expenses using
   regular administrative or operating funds. AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, shows how
   to curtail official travel and reduce costs. This section assigns funding responsibilities for
   special TDY categories. Use only EEIC 409 for all TDY expenses.
   10.2.2. When travel overlaps two fiscal years, make sure the orders-issuing activity cites
   the accounting classification codes for both fiscal years on the travel request or order.
   Specific direction in the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 9, Chapter 2, Subparagraph 020601
   states, ―In the event of a trip that is initiated using currently available fiscal year funding, but
   which requires new fiscal year funding to continue or complete the travel, the traveler shall
   return to his or her official duty station if no appropriation act has been signed or no
   continuing resolution has been passed to make available new fiscal year funds‖. It concludes,
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   207


  ―Expenses incurred in returning to the traveler‘s duty station will be posted in the new fiscal
  year as necessary costs to close down operations‖.
  10.2.3. Supervisors should strongly encourage military members and civilian employees to
  use government quarters when they are TDY to a military installation where adequate on
  base quarters (as defined in AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program) are available. Follow
  government quarters use/availability guidance in JFTR, Volume II, U1045 for military and
  JTR, Volume 2, C1055 for civilians. But do not apply this rule to civilian employees whose
  duties require official travel for more than 50 percent of their basic administrative
  workweeks during a fiscal year (JTR, Volume II, Paragraph C1055). For TDY, anywhere
  other than a military installation, do not require anyone to commute to the nearest military
  installation to occupy government quarters. If members voluntarily use quarters at a nearby
  military installation, do not require them to use available messing facilities. MAJCOMs may
  encourage members or employees to use government facilities when it is economical and
  consistent with mission requirements.
  10.2.4. Retention of Promotional Items on TDY. A traveler on official business traveling
  at Government expense on the funds of an agency may keep promotional material (including
  frequent traveler benefits such as points or miles, upgrades or access to carrier clubs or
  facilities for personal use. (See FY 02 NDAA, Sec. 1116; JFTR, Chapter 1, Part B, Paragraph
  U1200; JTR Chapter 1, Part D, Paragraph C1200.)
  10.2.5. Conferences/Approval Authorities. SAF/AA is the final approval authority. A
  guidance memorandum is forthcoming.
  10.2.6. The requesting organization will fund manning assistance TDY. This does not alter
  existing funding responsibilities for mission related travel.
  10.2.7. To comply with OUSD(C) and DFAS policy on simplified travel accounting, all
  TDY costs (transportation, per diem, incidentals, excess baggage, lodging, vehicle
  rental, or any other expense authorized to be paid on the travel voucher) will be
  accounted for only with EEIC 409. Do not use any other 40X EEIC to record TDY costs.
  Additionally, do not use a 2-digit shred of EEIC 409 unless specifically authorized by your
  command to capture specific travel program data information.
  10.2.8. 179-Day Rule. Air Force members who are TDY in excess of 179 days (to include
  travel days, training days and days at the final destination) may not require a Secretarial
  waiver to receive travel payments for TDY/TAD assignments in excess of six months at any
  one location, as stated in the JFTR Paragraph U2145. The six-month limitation does not
  apply to ―personnel assigned to periods of TDY at more than one location that total more
  than six months if the period of duty at each location is six months or less.‖ Travel time and
  time at an enroute location should not be combined with time at the final destination when
  determining compliance with the 179-day rule. Because this time is cumulative and not time
  at one location, a Secretarial waiver is not required to make the travel payment to the
  member.
  10.2.9. TDY for PME Graduation. As part of a commander‘s, First Sergeant‘s, and
  command CMSgt‘s duty requirement to represent the squadron or the Command at PME
  Graduations, funded TDYs are authorized for them or their designated representative. Per
 208                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, Table 7, Item 34 and Paragraph 12.8. (12.8.5.),
   permissive TDY (PTDY) is authorized for the individual‘s supervisor or their representative.
   10.2.10. TDY for Retirement Ceremonies. Appropriated funds may be authorized by the
   travel approval authority for the unit or organization hosting a retirement ceremony for TDY
   travel to the retirement ceremony by an active duty military member or current Federal
   civilian employee who will officiate or otherwise substantially participate in the ceremony.
   Funding must be sourced from within existing funds at the local or MAJCOM level. Travel
   funded using this authority is available to Guard or Reserve members only when they are on
   Active Duty status. Appropriated funds are not authorized for funding of TDY travel by
   other individuals (including retired or former military members, or retired or former civilian
   employees) to preside or participate in a retirement ceremony. Participation means more
   than mere attendance, it means actual participation, for example, presenting an award or
   decoration to the retiree or doing the invocation at the beginning of the retirement ceremony.
   Prior to approval, travel approval authorities must determine that the trip is necessary official
   business in order to accomplish the Air Force mission effectively and economically.
   10.2.11. TDY to Attend Funeral Services of Deceased Military Members. As part of a
   commander‘s Air Force duty to represent the unit at funerals for a military member within
   their organization, funded TDY is authorized for the commander or designated representative
   when the funeral is conducted away from the member‘s home station. See AFI 36-3003 and
   AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, for additional information.
10.3. Funding Travel Related to Training Courses. Follow these rules to finance travel
expenses for attending USAF Formal Training and other training courses:
   10.3.1. Civilian Employees. The Employee Development Manager (EDM) within the local
   Central Civilian Personnel Office (CCPO) normally manages and funds TDY to USAF
   formal schools or other training, per AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development. The
   EDM centrally budgets and manages training funds.
   10.3.2. Air Reserve Forces (ARF). The student‘s assigned organization pays the TDY to
   schools or other instructional courses for ARF members (Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
   Force Reserve (AFRC)). But, when ordering the student to active duty to fulfill an Air Force
   mission requirement, apply the funding rules for active duty military personnel (see
   paragraph 10.3.3).
   10.3.3. Active Duty Military Personnel. In general, if the Education and Training Course
   Announcement (ETCA) (https://etca.randolph.af.mil) does not provide an AETC or
   AFMC funding guidance or if it does not list the course, the member‘s unit of assignment
   will pay the TDY cost unless this instruction or other Air Force instructions say otherwise.
       10.3.3.1. AETC-Funded USAF Formal Training Courses. AETC or AFMC, as
       appropriate, pays TDY expenses to attend schools in this category, including travel and
       per diem from overseas to the Continental United States (CONUS), Air Force point of
       debarkation (AFPOD), and CONUS Air Force point of embarkation (AFPOE). The
       Education & Training Course Announcement (ETCA) provides the AETC or AFMC
       funding guidance for these travel orders as well as the conditions a TDY must meet for
       funding.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   209


     10.3.3.2. Other than AETC-Funded USAF Formal Training Courses. The member‘s
     unit of assignment pays TDY and other expenses to attend schools or other courses of
     instruction in this category.
     10.3.3.3. Command Operated Schools. The individual student‘s or instructor‘s
     assigned Air Force activity pays expenses of travel and per diem for students or
     instructors at command courses.
  10.3.4. TDY for Formal Training Incident to Permanent Change of Station
  (PCS). Apply the following guidance whether a member returns to the current duty station
  before the PCS or goes directly to the new duty station after completing a TDY.
     10.3.4.1. AETC or AFMC pays for TDY to USAF formal training courses along with, or
     incident to, a military PCS, when:
         10.3.4.1.1. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) imposes the training requirement
         in the assignment instructions or
         10.3.4.1.2. When the gaining command receives a training quota from AETC or
         AFMC and properly notifies the losing Military Personnel Flight (MPF).
     10.3.4.2. When the gaining command levies formal training requirements, or non-formal
     training, without the appropriate AETC or AFMC quota, it must pay for the TDY, and
     provide a proper fund citation to the losing MPF.
     10.3.4.3. Charge to PCS movement funds any transoceanic travel costs for directed TDY
     to CONUS incident to PCS. These costs are a PCS expense. Pay for TDY costs within
     CONUS as discussed above. Transoceanic travel costs include travel from an overseas
     assignment (includes Alaska and Hawaii) to the CONUS port of entry. When the losing
     and gaining commands are both non-CONUS, the travel expenses to the CONUS port of
     entry, and from the CONUS port of debarkation to the gaining command, are a PCS
     expense. Orders directing the transoceanic TDY must:
         10.3.4.3.1. State that the TDY is along with or incident to a PCS.
         10.3.4.3.2. Identify the command funding the TDY. Guidance for getting fund cites
         is    in      the     Education   &      Training   Course      Announcement:
         https://etca.randolph.af.mil
         10.3.4.3.3. Reference the PCS assignment instructions that established the
         requirement.
     10.3.4.4. Charge TDY-Enroute-PCS to attend a command-operated school to the
     command which operates the school.
     10.3.4.5. TDYs en route to PCS are the responsibility of the gaining units for courses
     that are not identified as AETC funded USAF Formal Training courses and are a
     requirement of the gaining unit. If the required training is a requirement of the losing
     unit, then the losing unit must bear the cost. Cost not covered by the PCS for a course not
     identified as an AETC funded USAF Formal Training Course is the responsibility of the
     gaining unit.
  10.3.5. Screening School Candidates. Make sure candidates scheduled for TDY to school
  qualify to enter the training program. If the training activity finds a person unqualified, the
 210                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   person‘s unit of current duty assignment will pay all costs for the TDY. If necessary, before
   settling the member‘s travel claim, the issuing activity will amend the orders to show that the
   unqualified person‘s unit pays for the TDY.
   10.3.6. Guest Lecturers. The command that directs or makes the invitation will pay travel
   expenses of all guest lecturers.
   10.3.7. TDY-Enroute-PCS for Security Assistance Organizations (SAO). The Air Force
   funds military specialty training refresher training and language, advisor, management
   (except for DISAM funding of DISAM courses), and other training required to qualify
   people for SAOs. The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) will budget and fund for
   TDY-Enroute-PCS required for this purpose in PEC A1010F. Charge orientation training and
   briefings at unified commands and Washington, DC to appropriate security assistance funds.
10.4. Funding TDY for Special Technical and Flying Training. Charge to AETC training
established by AETC under AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program . Otherwise, unless
otherwise directed, charge these costs to the MAJCOM to which the individual is assigned.
10.5. Funding TDY for Field and Mobile Training (AF1 36-2201). Apply these rules to fund
TDY travel of students and instructors to field training detachments (FTD) or to attend training
conducted by mobile training teams (MTT):
   10.5.1. The organization of the parent command to which a person is assigned funds students
   trained by FTDs or MTTs attached to their parent command.
   10.5.2. AETC funds students trained by FTDs or MTTs attached to other than their parent
   command only if AETC has allocated training quotas. Otherwise, the student‘s parent
   command funds the TDY.
   10.5.3. The instructor‘s assigned FTD or MTT funds intracommand travel of FTD or MTT
   instructors ordered by that command.
   10.5.4. AETC funds intercommand travel of FTD or MTT instructors.
   10.5.5. AETC funds for the TDY of MTT instructors to and from technical training centers.
10.6. Funding Travel of Air Force Military Applicants for the United States Air Force
Academy (USAFA). Use the applicant‘s assigned unit‘s O&M funds to pay TDY of Air Force
military applicants for the USAFA under AFI 36-2019, Appointment To The United States Air
Force Academy. The military member concerned bears the cost of travel for examination to
compete for congressional nomination.
10.7. Funding Travel to Support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) or
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation
Center (AFOTEC) will use RDT&E to pay the costs of TDY travel for people assigned to
commands and operational units that provide collateral support to the IOT&E effort. See Chapter
14 for TDY funding connected with RDT&E.
10.8. Not Used.
10.9. Funding Travel for Air Force Recruiters. AETC funds these costs.
10.10. Funding Travel Related to Ferrying Aircraft. See AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft
Delivery for related guidance. Pay for deliveries as follows:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       211

     10.11. Funding Travel of Escorts for Dependents of Deceased or Missing Air Force
     Military Personnel. Charge escort TDY to the operating funds of the order issuing activity
     except when an AFMC passenger-control agency issues the order at an overseas commander‘s
     request. In this case, cite the requesting agency‘s O&M funds. The base mortuary officer
     certifies fund availability, then prepares and approves payment vouchers (AFI 34-242).
     10.12. Funding Travel to Attend Meetings of Technical, Professional, Scientific, and Other
     Similar Organizations. If approved by proper authority, charge TDY expenses to the O&M-
     type funds of the attendee‘s organization of assignment.
     10.13. Funding Attendance at National Rifle and Pistol Matches by Air Force
     Personnel. MAJCOMs may authorize people to take part in matches sponsored by the National
     Rifle Association. Charge a participant‘s TDY to the command‘s O&M funds. AFPC/DPASF
     pays the TDY for teams sponsored by HQ USAF.
     10.14. Funding Travel Related to Logistics Evaluation of Independent Research and
     Development (LEIR&D). The Air Force Coordinating Office for Logistics Research
     (AFCOLR) budgets and funds travel related to LEIR&D, upon mutual agreement between
     AFCOLR and the traveler‘s unit of assignment.
     10.15. Funding Travel Related to Disability Retirement Processing Under AFI 36-3212,
     Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation. For TDY of military members
     directed to meet medical or physical disability boards to determine eligibility for retention,
     disability retirement, or separation, charge O&M funds of the medical facility that directed the
     action. Charge TDY travel of temporary retired military personnel to take physical examinations
     to funds made available to AFPC.
     10.16. Funding Witness Travel. Table 10.2 defines travel funding responsibilities for
     witnesses required for boards, investigations, and courts-martial. The type of travel is
     ―intercommand‖ when the individual requested is assigned to a different MAJCOM than the
     convening authority exercising jurisdiction over the case at the time of the request. It is
     ―intracommand‖ when the individual requested is assigned to the same MAJCOM as the
     convening authority exercising jurisdiction over the case at the time of the request. When a
     convening authority is identified as the funding authority, the convening authority at the time the
     travel is required provides the funding. For example, a special court-martial convening authority
     who orders an Article 32 investigation funds applicable travel for the investigation. See AFI 51-
     201, Administration of Military Justice, for guidance when AFLOA/JAJM is identified as the
     funding authority.

     NOTES:
     1. The JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Part O, covers travel of members for disciplinary action.
     The TDY orders for members traveling as an Accused must include a statement ―member not
     entitled to per diem expenses in connection with disciplinary action‖.
     2. Funding by USAF Judiciary circuit to which assigned ONLY for USAF Judiciary Members.
     The Convening Authority funds costs for other individuals.
     3. The USAF Judiciary Circuit to which assigned when the attorney-client relationship was
     formed.
     4. AFLOA/JAJM will fund if the IMDC is not assigned to the USAF Judiciary at the time the
     IMDC request is made and had no prior attorney-client relationship with the requestor on the
     matter in issue.
     5. The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7060 directs that travel expenses of members summoned
     as witnesses shall be paid from funds of the requesting Service.
     6. Submit requests through local AFOSI detachments. Fund according to the status of the person
     requested (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table).
     7. AFOSI agents assigned as defense investigators to an accused and defense counsel are funded
     by the Convening Authority.
     8. For expert witnesses in urinalysis cases, request AFLOA/JAJM funding in accordance with
     AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. All fees in excess of AFLOA/JAJM established
     fee limits shall be paid by the convening authority. The Convening Authority funds civilian
     expert consultants and lab technicians in urinalysis cases.
     9. Funding for testimony of Federal civilian employees belonging to non-DoD Agencies is a
     Convening Authority responsibility. However, if a non-DoD Federal civilian employee is being
     called to present testimony in a case that involves an activity in connection with which he or she
     is employed, funding from the employing agency may be possible. See 5 U.S.C. 5751 and 28
     CFR, Part 21, Section 21.2(d). The Comptroller General has defined the extent to which the case
     must be related to the agency‘s activity as a condition to the agency‘s responsibility for payment
     in 23 Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943) which states, ―the employing agency is required to pay….the
     traveling expenses incurred by the employee witness only where the information or facts
     ascertained by the employee as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where
     the proceeding is predicated upon law that that agency is required to administer‖. Funding from
     other agencies under 5 U.S.C. 5751 should only be sought in situations where the other agency‘s
     funding responsibility can be clearly established under the law. Furthermore, if the employing
     agency is not forthcoming with the funds, ultimate responsibility for funding to ensure the
     presence of necessary witnesses remains with the Convening Authority.
     10. AFLOA/JAJM will fund ANG members who are in Title 10 status at the time travel is
     required if it involves intercommand travel between the Title 10 duty station and the location of
     the UCMJ proceeding.
     11. The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7451 and AFI 31-205 cover funding of prisoners and
     prisoner escorts. The prisoner‘s travel will be funded according to the status of the prisoner (e.g.,
     AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table). The Convening Authority
      216                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

     10.17. Funding Travel Related to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
     Complaints. Apply this following guidance to fund expenses for individual complaints as well
     as class complaints of discrimination, (AFI 36-1201):
        10.17.1. The DoD Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS), Office of Complaint
        Investigation (OCI) investigates formal EEO complaints for DoD Components. Effective 1
        Oct 06, there is a flat fee of $325.00 for each investigation. The activity where the
        discrimination allegedly occurred will fund the fee using the Government Purchase Card.
            10.17.1.1. The activity will also fund expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity
            Commission (EEOC) examiner (as billed by EEOC) and payment for court reporters and
            attorneys, as well as, travel expenses when a hearing examiner or other authorized
            official requires travel of non-Air Force people (complainants, representatives, or
            witnesses) and authorized under JFTR, Volume II, Chapters 4 or 6.
        10.17.2. Apply the following guidance for these other situations:
            10.17.2.1. The Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Office (AFCARO/AED) pays travel
            expenses of EEO complaint AFCARO investigations.
            10.17.2.2. When a class complaint alleges discrimination at more than one activity, the
            class agent‘s permanently assigned activity pays expenses of the EEOC examiner, court
            reporters, and attorneys (AFI 36-1201).
            10.17.2.3. When a hearing examiner or other authorized official requires Air Force
            people (complainants, representatives, or witnesses) to participate, charge the travel to the
            Air Force participant‘s unit of assignment. The activity where the discrimination
            allegedly occurred pays travel expenses for AFCARO personnel called as witnesses.
            10.17.2.4. When a class complaint alleges discrimination at more than one activity,
            charge authorized expenses of non-Air Force people to the permanently assigned class
            agent‘s activity.
            10.17.2.5. If a complaint of discrimination is filed against a tenant organization, the
            tenant pays the hearing costs and attorney fees and costs unless otherwise provided for in
            a host-tenant agreement (see AFI 25-201). Refer problems between the host and tenant to
            the parent MAJCOM, Attn: EO Director, for resolution.
            10.17.2.6. When the complaint involves a nonappropriated fund (NAF) activity, the host
            activity bears the costs. The host activity‘s commander may recoup costs from the NAF
            instrumentality in cases where a NAF employee is the discriminating official.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     217


10.18. Funding Travel Related to Emergency Leave. If a member is authorized emergency
leave that requires movement from overseas to CONUS or from CONUS to overseas, and he or
she is:
   10.18.1. Permanently assigned to an overseas or CONUS Air Force installation, charge the
   cost of TWCF airlift to the O&M type funds of the member‘s unit of assignment.
   10.18.2. Permanently assigned to duty on a non-Air Force installation, charge the TWCF
   airlift cost to the O&M type funds of the member‘s permanently assigned unit.
   10.18.3. Performing TDY, charge the airlift to the same funds that put the member on TDY.
   You do not need prior concurrence of the financial services officer administering the funds.
   However, the base or activity issuing the emergency leave order must immediately send a
   message to the financial services officer containing the emergency leave special order
   number, date, name and social security number (SSN) of member, accounting classification
   cited, and estimated amount of the TWCF airlift cost chargeable to the funds. Forward a copy
   of the orders within 24 hours to the financial services officer who administers the funds cited.
10.19. Funding Dependent Student Travel. When dependent students travel on annual trips
from schools in the United States to and from your overseas area, including Alaska and Hawaii,
charge these costs to the permanently assigned student‘s sponsor organization‘s operating funds.
Do not pay this transportation allowance for members assigned to a permanent duty station in
Alaska or Hawaii and the child attends school in that state. These costs apply against any
limitation which Congress might apply for such travel.
10.20. Funding Medical Related Travel. See this Chapter, Section 10C.
10.21. Funding Travel for the USAF Occupational Measurement Center
(USAFOMC). The USAFOMC budgets and funds for travel requirements of subject matter
experts from other units who must help the USAFOMC rewrite promotion tests.
10.22. Financing Contract Quarters for Air Force and DoD Employees in a Travel Status
(Includes Members of the Active and Reserve Forces). To reduce appropriated fund
expenditures for per diem, base billeting offices must arrange contract quarters agreements with
commercial motels and hotels to lodge official travelers when on base quarters are not available.
   10.22.1. When planning travel, each organization and each unit of the Air Reserve Forces
   that schedules active duty tours must tell the duty base or bases in advance the number of
   rooms it needs and for how long.
   10.22.2. In general, the traveler will pay the charges for contract quarters. Under the JTR,
   the traveler gets reimbursed for lodging costs, subject to ceilings for each geographic area.
   Record the cost against EEIC 409. Use the applicable valid EEIC when the government pays
   the hotel or motel by check, whether using a separate service contract, blocking a number of
   rooms under an existing contract (BPA), or other agreement.
   10.22.3. For special categories of travel (e.g., formal training, exercises), commands and
   subordinate activities may continue to acquire contract quarters using procedures where the
   government pays the hotel directly. When using this method, installations may acquire the
   quarters through a separate service contract or by blocking a number of rooms under an
   existing local contract quarters agreement. Refer questions regarding the appropriate use of
   this method for financing contract quarters through command channels to SAF/FMBMM.
 218                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   The contract cost daily rate may not exceed the lodging rate, under the lodging-plus concept,
   for the local area as specified by the Joint Federal Travel Regulations or the Joint Travel
   Regulations.
   10.22.4. This paragraph intentionally left blank.
   10.22.5. IMA Reserve personnel in a travel status performing inactive duty training period(s)
   are to pay for contract quarters. IMA Reservists, assigned to PAS Code 96XXXXXX, may
   use on-base government quarters or off-base government-contracted quarters during inactive
   duty for training (IDT). Lodging charges are reimbursed on the SF 1164 and submitted to the
   IMA travel office at Dobbins AFB for payment. A member in an inactive duty training status
   is to pay for contract quarters. IMA Reservists, assigned to PAS Code 96XXXXXX, may use
   on-base government quarters or off-base government-contracted quarters during inactive
   duty for training (IDT). For on-base quarters, the base billeting officer will process an SF
   1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, for the necessary
   costs and forward to the AFO at Dobbins AFB, GA, for reimbursement. For contract
   quarters, the IMA will pay for the quarters and send required documentation to HQ ARPC/
   DROX for reimbursement through the Dobbins FSO/FMA. In both cases, HQ ARPC will
   provide the funding using EEIC 409. DFAS-DE 7010.5-R and AFI 34-246 contain
   procedures.
   10.22.6. AFI 34-246, Table 1.1. provides specific billeting procedures; Rule 12 for IMAs
   and Rules 13, 14, and 15 apply to Unit assigned Reserve members. AFI 34-246, Paragraph
   1.17.3. covers housing for Reserve and ANG members during emergency and wartime
   operations.
   10.22.7. TWCF Aircrew Lodging. Air Force lodging offices administer no fund-type
   contracts with commercial hotels to support TDY personnel when on-base lodging facilities
   are not available or inadequate. AMCI (Air Mobility Command Instruction) 65-602, TWCF
   Budget Guidance and Procedures identifies those applicable Air Force CONUS and overseas
   locations where TWCF funded aircrews may charge their on-base or contract lodging costs to
   local TWCF funds (Appn 97X4930.FD40). The Government-wide Purchase Card (GPC) is
   the payment mechanism used to charge the lodging costs of TWCF aircrews who fly airlift
   missions to/through these locations. Use the applicable valid EEIC to record TWCF aircrew
   lodging costs.

Section 10C—Medical Support

10.23. Financing Medical Support:
   10.23.1. Use the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation (97*0130) to finance

           POC travel to obtain medical care within the local PDS area is reimbursable only
           when a member is ordered (see note below) to a medical facility within the local area
           to take a required physical examination, or obtain a medical diagnosis and/or
           treatment. When ordered, members are considered to be on official business and
           must be reimbursed for the transportation, unless government transportation is
           available (see JFTR U3500). NOTE: ―Ordered‖ in this context is defined as an
           order/command that could result in disciplinary action if not obeyed (e.g.
           commander-directed urinalysis).
           10.25.2.1.2. Medical Referral Travel at the Member‘s Expense. Travel to medical
           appointments within the PDS other than as described in above paragraph 10.25.2.1.1

         10.25.2.1.3. Medical Referral Travel Outside the PDS. Members on official travel
         orders are authorized travel and transportation allowances in accordance with the
         JFTR. Travel must be authorized by proper medical authority.
         10.25.2.1.4. Medical Referral Travel for Government Employees Overseas and Their
         Family Members. When local medical facilities (military or civilian) at a foreign
         OCONUS area are not able to accommodate an employee‘s needs, transportation to
         another location may be authorized for appropriate medical/dental care. Health care
         travel expenses are charged to the operating funds of the employee‘s organization.
         Travel and transportation is authorized in accordance with the JTR.
         10.25.2.1.5. Travel to Specialty Care Over 100 Miles. When MTF TRICARE Prime
         enrollees (family members or retirees) are referred by the primary care manager
         (PCM) for medically necessary non-emergency specialty care more than 100 miles
         from the PCM‘s office, the patient must be reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses
         in accordance with the JFTR (U7960). Travel expenses are charged to the MTF.
      10.25.2.2. Military Medical Consultants. AFI 44-104, Military and Civilian
      Consultant Program and Medical Enlisted Career Field Manager Program, identifies
      budgeting and funding responsibilities for travel of military medical consultants. Use
      medical O&M funds of the consultants‘ supporting facility (such as the regional hospital
      or area medical center) to pay for all travel and per diem expenses for consultant visits.
      10.25.2.3. Non-medical Attendant Travel. Non-medical attendants (NMA) are

     10.25.3.1. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Airlift in Support of Contingency
     Operations. In the event that a major contingency operation is declared by the President
     and SECDEF, AF/SG DHP funds will pay only those AE contingency airlift costs billed
     by TWCF from the first overseas fixed medical treatment facility (MTF) to the CONUS.
     When the President and SECDEF have formally withdrawn the contingency designation,
     entitlement to hostile fire pay ceases, military assignments are no longer based on
     rotational deployment taskings, and fixed MTFs are available, AF/SG DHP funds will
     reimburse the TWCF for AE airlift costs from those former contingency areas. See
     paragraph 10.26.12 on Air Force (AMC) O&M funding responsibility for AE
     contingency airlift costs.‖

  maintenance costs for WRM storage. But if the space, facility, installation, or complex is
  solely for the medical program, charge the DHP.
  10.25.10. Autopsies. Autopsies are funded as follows:
     10.25.10.1. Autopsies performed in an MTF are funded with DHP funds.
     10.25.10.2. Autopsies performed by civilian pathologists, not employed by the Air
     Force, are funded with the O&M funds of the organization to which the deceased was
     assigned. If the deceased member was assigned to the MTF, DHP O&M would fund the
     autopsy.
     10.25.10.3. Autopsies performed on victims of a military aircraft accident, regardless of
     who performs the autopsy, will be funded with DHP funds.
  10.25.11. Blood Donation Incentive Items. DHP O&M funds are authorized to provide
  low cost incentive items such as T-shirts, coffee mugs, or pens to volunteer donors at Air
  Force blood donor centers for the purpose of maintaining an adequate military blood supply.
  The use of these funds for that purpose is at the sole discretion of the MTF Commander.
  (AF/SG 27 Jan 2004 Memo, Use of Defense Health Plan (DHP) Operation and Maintenance
  (O&M) Funds for Blood Donation Incentive Items).
  10.25.12. TDY expenses of Medical personnel who are appointed as board members on
  Accident Investigation Boards (AIB) and Safety Investigation Boards (SIB).
  10.25.13. Health Promotion Incentive Items. Purchase of items of low intrinsic value,
  such as pens, coffee mugs, water bottles, key chains, luggage tags, buttons, badges, balloons,
  Frisbees, or toothbrushes may be purchased if the item conveys an appropriate promotional
  message intended to educate or reinforce health/wellness programs. For example, such
  messages may relate to programs such as breast cancer screening, smoking cessation, and
  dental hygiene for children. Items may not be personalized. Coins may not be procured.
  10.25.14. Professional Licenses for Healthcare Providers. Ordinarily, the cost of
  obtaining professional licenses is considered a personal expense. However, in any case in
  which it is necessary for a member of the uniformed services to pay a professional license fee
  imposed by a government in order to provide healthcare services at a facility of a civilian
  healthcare provider pursuant to a Resource Sharing Agreement entered into by the MTF, the
  member may be reimbursed up to $500 of the amount of the license fee (10 U.S.C. 1096d).
  While the license is usually obtained in the name of the member, the primary interest in
  obtaining the license lies with the Air Force. Any personal benefit that Air Force members
  receive from the acquisition of the license is incidental to the performance of their official
  duties. This guidance does not apply to civil service employees and contractors who are
  required to be in compliance with local licensure requirements at the time of employment,
  nor does it apply to healthcare providers whose sole purpose in obtaining the additional
  license is to engage in off-duty employment. Refer to AFI 44-119, Medical Quality
  Operations.

   coordinated by the host MTF via the appropriate Contracting, Legal, and Civil Engineering
   organizations.
   10.25.17. Publication of GME Research Articles in Professional Journals. Per OMB
   Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, use of appropriated funds for
   publishing fees are allowable as a necessary part of research costs. As such, use of DHP
   RDT&E funds are allowed when:
       10.25.17.1. The research papers report work supported by the Federal Government, and
       the page/publishing charges are levied impartially on all research papers published by the
       journal, whether or not by federally-sponsored authors.
       10.25.17.2. Publication costs include the costs of printing (including the processes of
       composition, plate-making, press work, binding, and the end products produced by such
       processes), distribution, promotion, mailing, and general handling. Publication costs also
       include page charges in professional journal publications.
       10.25.17.3. Publishing fees for articles or research not sanctioned by DHP are not
       chargeable to any DHP funds.

   Clinics (ATC) and Aeromedical staging facilities. Expenses of tactical medical facilities
   operated separately from hospitals including Air Transportable Field Hospitals, Air
   Transportable Field Clinics, and Tactical/Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facilities. All
   biological and chemical warfare (BW/CW) medical supplies deployed with base personnel
   should not be charged to the DHP. Any expenses attributed to the contingency pre-
   deployment, employment, and redeployment of medical combat support personnel,
   equipment, and supplies requested by the combatant commander and approved by proper
   authority, as well as medical BW/CW items supporting deploying personnel, will be paid by
   Line (3400) funds. Bases should establish a line Project Funds Management Record (PFMR)
   and RC/CC for the MTF to use to record these expenses. Use the appropriate ESP code for
   all transactions.
   10.26.3. Common base administrative functions.
       10.26.3.1. The MTF is not a tenant on Air Force installations. Therefore, it is
       inappropriate to charge for services such as use of the chapel, finance office, civilian
       personnel office, military personnel office, legal services, contracting, security police
       services, fire protection, gymnasium, records management, lodging, safety, mail service
       (postage is chargeable to DHP), etc. These services are construed as common base
       services.

  10.26.7. O&M costs for mortuary facilities. Charge these costs to the primary O&M budget
  activity of the host command providing the service (e.g., AMC funds mortuary services at
  Dover AFB, DE). (See AFI 34-242).
  10.26.8. Funding for Medical Care at Deployed Locations During Exercises and
  Contingencies. Charge to primary Line O&M or JCS exercise/contingency funds, medical
  care provided to members at local indigenous medical facilities. Care in the indigenous
  facility  includes referral care by military medical staff, medical supplies (i.e.,
  pharmaceuticals, orthopedic braces), and urgent/emergency care.
  10.26.9. Funding for Medical Participation in Exercises. Charge primary Line O&M
  (3400) or JCS exercise funds for the deployment of the Expeditionary Medical Support
  (EMEDS). Also, charge the cost of deploying medical personnel TDY expenses (UTC or
  notional), the cost of supplies used during deployment and the cost of supplies needed for
  resupply upon return. Additionally, A and B bags for medical personnel are funded from
  O&M (3400). Medical funds should be used for anything done in the medical facility (i.e.,
  manning assistance, force protection) and reimbursement sought through DHP channels.
  10.26.10. Immunizations/Inoculations for Exercises. These costs are chargeable to Line
  O&M or JCS Exercise funds, as appropriate.
  10.26.11. Leasing of vehicles, including ambulances and ambulance buses. This is

  airlift missions from (1) declared contingency areas of operation to the first fixed MTF, and
  (2) non-stop or one-stop refueling AE contingency airlift missions from the contingency
  location to the CONUS, in the event a patient requires specialized medical care that
  necessitates bypassing the nearest theater fixed MTF.
  10.26.13. Automated Extended Defibrillators (AED) procured by base organizations for
  emergency use.
  10.26.14. Non-prescription items. Generally, with the exception of Health Promotion items
  intended to educate or reinforce health/wellness programs, non-prescription items (i.e.,
  prevention items such as sunscreen, hand sanitizers, athletic braces/eye protection, etc.) are
  not procured with the DHP appropriation.
  10.26.15. Do not charge Transportation of Human Remains to the DHP. Costs are covered
  by Mortuary Affairs (see AFI 34-242).
 226                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

   medical surveillance examinations shall be performed through an AF designated healthcare
   provider (HCP) at no cost to the employee (5 CFR 339.303 & 339.304; 29 CFR 1910).
   When the local MTF does not have the capability to provide an examination (or a portion of
   the exam), the AF MTF may arrange to have the examination (lab tests, etc.) in the civilian
   sector (non-DoD) healthcare community after receiving authorization from the employee‘s
   unit commander. The employee‘s unit commander must also authorize payment for the
   examination. Payment is made from the same appropriation that funds the employee‘s
   salary. In addition to 5 CFR 339, see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 10, Chapter 11,
   Paragraph 110218.C., Civilian Personnel, which provides (excerpt): the appropriation is
   chargeable to the operating funds of the DoD activity requiring the physical examination.
10.27. Sales of Subsistence at Medical Facilities. This guidance is per DFAS-DE 7010.5-R,
paragraph C9.1.2.2.7.2.
   10.27.1. Collections for the Discount Meal Rate. The food services officer deposits
   collections to the MPA, 57*3500 32* 48 56201 C93A 525725.
   10.27.2. Collections for Meal Surcharges, Non-contractor Operated Dining Facilities. Food
   services officer collections for surcharges are credited to the financing appropriation(s), i.e.,
   DHP O&M, Base O&M and/or the Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA), based on the
   percentage of local MTF dining hall‘s military and civilian Full-Time Equivalents (FTE)
   assigned. For example, if 3 out of 10 MTF dining hall employees are military personnel and
   the other 7 are DHP funded civil service employees, then 30 percent of surcharge collections
   should be deposited into the MPA, and 70 percent of the surcharge should be deposited into
   the DHP O&M.
       10.27.2.1. For DHP funded civilian employees, deposit the DHP portion of collections to
       the DHP O&M (97*0130) using EEIC 599XX and sales code C93A.
       10.27.2.2. For all military employees (regardless of whether or not they are DHP
       authorizations), deposit the MPA portion of collections to the MPA (see 10.27.1.) using
       Project 562 and sales code C93A.
   10.27.3. Collections for Meal Surcharges, Contractor (DHP funded) Operated Dining
   Facilities. If the MTF (DHP) funds the contract employees, then food service officer
   surcharge collections are deposited 100 percent to the DHP O&M appropriation.
10.28. Sales of Medical Services. AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care
Benefits in the Military Health Services System (MHSS) describes the categories and the rates of
charges for treating patients for whom the Air Force gets reimbursed for medical services.
Reimburse local collections to the program element and appropriation that first bore the cost of
the services. Record central collections as appropriation reimbursements by HQ USAF
(Operating Agency Code 43).
10.29. Third Party Payers. The DHP has the right to collect from third party payers for
medical care provided by MTFs (10 U.S.C. 1095). Credit collections to the medical facility‘s
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      227


DHP O&M account. Funds collected are used to provide enhanced health care services at the
treatment facility.

       10.31.1.3. DoD 6010.15-M, Military Treatment Facility Uniform Business Office (UBO)
       Manual, provides guidelines for the operation of the MTF business office. It prescribes
       uniform procedures and accounting systems for the management and follow up of
       accounts, including recovery, depositing, posting, and reconciliation. It also incorporates
       procedures for third party collection activities, such as identification of beneficiaries who
       have other health insurance, coordination of benefits, and recovery of claims.
   10.31.2. HQ USAF will:
       10.31.2.1. Provide funds in operating budgets to reimburse nonmilitary medical activities
       for subsistence furnished military personnel authorized subsistence-in-kind.
       10.31.2.2. Reimburse the DHP O&M appropriation from collections made centrally from
       other government agencies (as outlined in AFI 41-115) for medical services and
       subsistence furnished to beneficiaries of these agencies.
10.32. Health and Wellness Centers (HAWC). Installations operate an integrated health and
wellness mission. See Programming Guidance Letter (PGL) 94-8 for a funding breakout by
expense element to determine DHP or Base APF responsibility.
   10.32.1. Medical Supplies for First Responders.
   10.32.2. Per AFI 41-209, para 3.23, the MTF will utilize DHP O&M funds for procurement
   of expendable supplies for civil engineering (CE) first responders.
   10.32.3. Items to be purchased out of this account will be limited to expendable supplies
   used for on-base response to medical emergencies. Durable supplies (electronic
   thermometers, etc.), equipment, vehicles or manpower will be funded with CE O&M funds,
   not DHP. In addition, items procured with DHP funds will not be utilized for training or
   exercises, including Home Station Medical Response to Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
   Nuclear and High-Yield Explosives (HSMR to CBRNE) events or exercises.
   10.32.4. RC/CC 5890 will be used to issue medical supplies to CE first responders.

       and sale of forest products, (2) not designated as reimbursable by the support agreement,
       and (3) reimbursable at departmental level according to the general provisions of DoD
       appropriations acts. These expenses relate to demilitarization, reclamation, forest
       products, and certain administrative expenses (for example, TDY, communications, and
       the cost of printing forms the Air Force prescribes for turning in disposable property to
       the DRMO).
10.34. Foreign Equity Property. When a foreign country or international organization offers
property for disposal sale and then sells through a DoD activity, the DoD activity that sells the
property may deposit 20 percent of the gross sales proceeds to their O&M type appropriation.
The foreign country or international organization receives the other 80 percent.
10.35. Information Technology Equipment (ITE) owned by General Services
Administration (GSA). Net proceeds from sales of GSA owned ITE (also when previously
leased by DoD) belong to GSA.
10.36. Funding for Sale of Forest Products. This category includes sawed timber, veneer
logs, pulpwood, Christmas trees, post poles, pine straw, stumpwood, bark and other mulch,
cones, seeds, mistletoe, firewood, and woodchips.
   10.36.1. DLA or another service may serve as the agent for sales of forest products. The
   agent deposits 100 percent of the sales proceeds to the Air Force‘s deposit fund account.
   10.36.2. DFAS maintains a central deposit fund account for authorized program expenses
   incurred in the production and sale of forest products. See paragraphs 5.4.3 and 5.4.3.1 of
   this instruction and DFAS-DE 7010.5-R Paragraph 29-30. Include in your reimbursable
   program all related expenses normally funded in the O&M, or Other Procurement (57*3080)
   appropriations, including minor construction, and the acquisition costs of equipment items
   used solely for forest operations. Program managers must prepare an economic justification
   for the equipment. When you employ general-use equipment in forest operations, the O&M
   or Other Procurement costs are reimbursable program expenses. You may also reimburse for:
       10.36.2.1. Timber Stand Improvement. Planting, seeding, or natural thinning, pruning,
       and control of undesirable vegetation is improvement of an existing timber stand.

   for other purposes, such as the military mission, recreation, training, general area
   improvement, and beautification. Also, do not reimburse expenses for protecting forests that
   can not economically produce forest products.
   10.36.4. Do not retain sales proceeds in your base operating budget account. DFAS will
   distribute 40 percent of the net proceeds at each installation to the installation‘s state and the
   balance to 21X5285, Department of Defense, Forest Products Program, Army.
10.37. Precious Metal Recovery Program (PMRP). DLA is the DoD‘s single manager for the
PMRP. The program promotes economical recovery of precious metal from all sources, and
provides the reclaimed metals, as needed, to DoD components at recovery cost for use as
government-furnished material (GFM) to support of defense contracts. If your installation
contributes to the PMRP, charge for:
   10.37.1. All readily identifiable incremental recovery costs, including acquiring and
   replacing silver recovery equipment, plus major maintenance on it.
   10.37.2. Transportation costs incurred for authorized shipping of materials from generating
   activities directly to a collection recovery office or to the DRMO‘s office for recovering
   precious metals. Examples of these materials are precious metal scrap such as silver obtained
   from electrolytic units, or shipment of sludge in silver recovery cartridges.
   10.37.3. Costs incurred to turn in excess scrap including film, hypo solution, silver recovery
   cartridges or sludge containing precious metals are the responsibility of the generating
   activity.
10.38. Funding Responsibilities for the Qualified Recycling Program (QRP) (10 U. S.C.
2577). Air Force Accounts Receivable Standard Operating Procedures for Base Level Use,
specifically the QRP section contains accounting procedures and guidance for distributing
proceeds.
   10.38.1. Installations that establish a qualified QRP may use net proceeds from QRP sales
   for local projects as defined in paragraph 10.38.3 Net proceeds are gross QRP sales less
   operating expenses for the QRP appropriated fund. The installation commander or designee
   is the QRP manager. The Financial Management Board (FMB) should help the program
 230                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

       original purposes without special processing.
       10.38.2.2. Ships, planes, or weapons that must be demilitarized or mutilated before sale.
       10.38.2.3. Scrap generated by a DoD industrial fund (IF)(DWCF) activity. The industrial
       fund accounts for the net proceeds from selling scrap (short ends, machinings, spoiled
       materials, etc.) generated from industrial fund operations.
       10.38.2.4. Bones, fats, and meat trimmings generated by a commissary store or
       exchange.
   10.38.3. Use proceeds from selling recyclable material first to reimburse the installation‘s
   appropriated fund costs (O&M-type) for operating the recyclable program, incurred in the
   same fiscal year as the proceeds are earned. Use up to 50% of remaining sale proceeds for
   pollution abatement, energy conservation, and occupational safety and health activities. A
   project may not be carried out under the preceding sentence for an amount greater than 50
   percent of the amount established by law as the maximum amount for a minor construction
   project, per 10 U.S.C. 2577.
   10.38.4. Installations must reimburse recycling cost in the FY earned. Along with BCE, the
   program manager, the comptroller, and the local FMB will monitor the QRP net proceeds in
   57F3875.8900.
   10.38.5. After applying the rules in paragraph 10.38.3 and 10.38.4 of this AFI, any unused
   balances of QRP proceeds (up to $2 million) are available until expended (i.e., may be
   carried over into subsequent fiscal years), HOWEVER THIS IS NOT AUTOMATIC EACH
   FISCAL YEAR; it is subject to a recurring annual provision in an applicable appropriation
   law. You must confirm with AF/A7CR and SAF/FMBO annually to ensure the annual
   provision has been extended and enacted.

Section 10E—Transportation of Property

10.39. Funding First Destination Transportation (FDT):
   10.39.1. First destination transportation (FDT) may take the form of either free-on-board
   (FOB) Destination or FOB Origin. Charge FDT to the O&M, RDT&E, or procurement
   appropriation that finances the item. FOB Destination charges will be an integral to the
   item‘s purchase price. FOB Origin charges will be a separate line item in the applicable
   appropriation and not a part of the item‘s purchase price.
   10.39.2. Charge aviation fuel used to deliver aircraft from a contractor‘s facility to the Air
   Force receiving activity to the O&M appropriation as FDT.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    231


   10.39.3. Transportation of less than major end items is integral to the major end item‘s
   acquisition cost. Charge the FDT to the procurement appropriation that financed the
   acquisition of the item. Examples are components, subassemblies, materiel and vendor parts
   that support the acquisition of a major end item.
       10.39.3.1. Charge transportation of government furnished equipment (GFE) and
       government furnished materiel (GFM) prior to installing it in a major end item to the

   other AS 016 uniforms not considered as regularly issued uniforms or paid for with an
   individual‘s annual clothing allowance), as directed by their commanders or other competent
   authority. However, restrictions may apply. For example, flight suits are limited per AFI
   36-2903, Chapter 3 which provides (excerpt only): Flight Dress Uniforms (FDU)/ Desert
   Flight Dress Uniforms (DFDU) are authorized functional clothing for those authorized
   individuals performing flying, parachutist, space and missile crew duties. These uniforms
   and the matching stripes and accouterments are ―optional items directed wear.‖ The cost of

   using appropriated funds. Initial issue provides all military personnel the clothing resources
   generally needed to meet occupational requirements. Enlisted service members receive
   annual clothing allowances for uniform replacement due to normal wear and tear. While
   appearance is a vital part of a competition, military standards must be met for all military
   operational readiness and deployment exercises without the benefit of new clothing
   packages, excluding authorized special uniform requirements addressed in paragraph
   10.56.7 above. Personnel are entitled to replacement of military clothing damaged in
   competition per AFMAN 23-110.
   10.56.10. Athletic/Exercise Clothing. Refer to Allowance Standard (AS) 016 available
   through the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). NOTE: The new Air
   Force physical training uniform is not authorized for purchase with organizational O&M-

   authorized only for those members assigned to specific functions/categories listed under AS
   016. For prescription sunglasses refer to AFJI 44-117, Ophthalmic Services, paragraphs 2.7
   and 2.8.
   10.56.12. Cold Weather Clothing. See AS 016 (Special Purpose Clothing and Personal
   Equipment) for special instructions that apply to the issue of cold weather clothing. Before
   organizational O&M-type funds are used to purchase cold weather clothing, the requirement
   must meet the criteria established for each designated location in AS 016.
10.57. Other Military Clothing. Military clothing is a complex area with many exceptions and
criteria. This section provides limited general information only, and does not attempt to address
every situation. Questions should be directed to MAJCOM HQ (A4, A1 and FM offices), and

Section 10J—Funding Responsibilities for Organizational Clothing
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     239


10.58. Funding Distinctive Uniforms and Functional Clothing. Commanders may approve
these items for issue as organizational clothing if the functions of an organization or group
require the wear of these items (as authorized in AFI 36-2903). The Commander must put in
writing the justification for the uniform or clothing necessitating the expenditure of the
appropriated funds. Charge the cost of the distinctive uniforms, functional clothing and
authorized alterations to the unit of assignment‘s O&M-type funds. For the Air Force Reserve,
pay the expense from the Reserve Personnel, Air Force Appropriation. (Note: purchase of
organizational clothing is optional – commander‘s discretion.)
10.59. Civilian Uniforms. IAW 5 USC 5901 and 10 USC 1593, the Air Force must either
furnish a uniform or provide a uniform allowance to civilian employees required to wear a
uniform. The uniform provided or uniform allowance, may not exceed the limits established by
DoD IAW 5 CFR 591.103-104. Organizations may use funds appropriated to pay civilian
salaries to pay for the uniform or uniform allowance. The individual is responsible for costs
associated with cleaning and upkeep; these costs may not be paid by unit funds. Further, and
IAW 5 USC 7903 and Comptroller General decisions (i.e., CG B-288828 and B-289683), the Air
Force must also furnish personal protective clothing or equipment to civilian employees when
the wear of the clothing/equipment is required for the safe and successful performance of
officially assigned tasks, the item is not part of the ordinary and usual furnishings an employee
would reasonably be expected to provide for himself/herself, and the employee is engaged in
hazardous duty. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and related
Air Force Instructions (AFI) must be followed. Organizations may use funds appropriated for
the procurement of supplies and material or equipment for the purchase and maintenance of
special clothing and equipment. Organizations must maintain accountability when items, such as
outer layers of cold weather ensembles, are turned in and re-issued.
10.60. Financing the Introduction of New Clothing Items. The organization that originates
the requirement must provide initial funding, including any resources needed for sustainment
requirements, for new clothing and textile items. For new items that replace/modify existing
assets, a review of inventories, contractual obligations and costs related to residual inventories
must have an identified source of funding prior to any fielding actions of a new item. A Military
Department with a new clothing item requirement must provide a funded order to the Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) to cover the cost of acquisition of a balanced procurement cycle
quantity of the item. DLA will not order the item until the Air Force provides funds. ―New
items‖ include initial introductions, a change in use, or use by a new Military Service. Charge the
Military Personnel appropriation for new (initial issue) clothing bag items. Charge operating
appropriations for new organizational clothing items.

Section 10K—Unaccompanied Personnel Housing

10.61. Leasing Unaccompanied Personnel Housing. Charge lease to O&M funds when you
provide quarters (AFI 32-6005)
   10.61.1. Financing Non-Military in Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH). Credit
   the O&M appropriation when non-military personnel rent Air Force UPH.

Section 10L—Type 1 Factory Training

10.62. Funding of Factory Training.
 240                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   10.62.1. Charge factory training costs to the investment appropriation and program used to
   procure the development, acquisition or modification of the related end item. This includes
   contractor-provided curriculum development, course materials and initial cadre instruction.
   Apply this rule when the associated end item is in production or undergoing modification,
   and training is embedded in the production contract. (Use of investment accounts for factory
   training is effective in FY 1994.) Charge associated TDY costs for personnel attending this
   training to the O&M appropriation of the command to which the personnel are assigned.
   10.62.2. Charge the O&M appropriation for:
       10.62.2.1. TDY of military members or civilian employees attending factory training
       courses.
       10.62.2.2. Factory training courses acquired by separate contract for end items no longer
       in production.
       10.62.2.3. Follow-on factory training.
   10.62.3. The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is the sole procuring agency for
   factory training and will budget and fund for all TDY and contract costs for factory training
   that is chargeable to O&M.
   10.62.4. The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command
   (AFSPC) for space related systems will budget and fund for contractor factory training and
   related TDY requirements supporting development, test, and evaluation (DT&E).
   10.62.5. All OT&E related Type 1 factory training shall be funded by the Acquisition
   Agency in accordance with AFI 36-2201.

Section 10M—Lease or Rental of Equipment

10.63. Leasing or Renting Equipment. Air Force activities needing equipment should use the
contracting method (purchase, lease, rental) with the lowest life cycle cost. Use a method other
than lowest cost only in emergencies. Charge the lease or rental expense to O&M type funds
(O&M, MFH Operations, etc.). If a basic lease contract (i.e. simply conveys the right to use
equipment for 12 months or less) contains an option to renew, you may exercise the option
annually, for up to 12 months at a time. As with other lease arrangements, title (and risk of loss)
must remain with the lessor until the end of the final annual lease period. Be sure to follow DoD
Financial Management Regulation (FMR) guidance specific to expenses and investments,
Volume 2A, Chapter 1, General Information, in order to determine the correct appropriations to
be used, and Volume 4, Chapter 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment for accounting policy and
procedures for various types of leases. Note that leases are also governed by OMB Circular A-
11 (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a11_current_year_a11_toc).

Section 10N—Land Purchases

10.64. Funding Minor Land Purchases. Use O&M-type funds to buy land (under 10 U.S.C.
2663(c) Acquisition of Low-Cost Interests in Land). The land must cost $750,000 and cannot be
associated with a specific MILCON project (P.L. 98-212, Section 707).
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      241


10.65. Funding Environmental Surveys of Land Interests Prior to Acquisition or
Disposal. The acquiring or disposing command will use its O&M-type funds (Environmental
Compliance, DERA or Base Closure accounts when applicable) to pay for initial environmental
surveys of land interests that the Air Force is considering disposing of or acquiring. Use project
funds when the environmental surveys relate to a funded MILCON project.
10.66. Funding Environmental Non-Compliance Fines and Penalties (Federal Facility
Compliance Act (FFCA)). Any civil penalty or fine levied against Air Force installations is the
funding responsibility of that installation. Commanders will determine the specific internal
funding realignments necessary to fund these costs. For accounting purposes, record payments
for any fines or penalties to PE ***56f, EEIC 68410, 68420, 68440, and 68450 of the
appropriation that bears responsibility (in accordance with Host/Tenant Support Agreements) at
the affected installation. There is no withhold account to cover these costs – the bill will have to
be paid out of existing current year resources. For additional guidance from Civil Engineering
(AF/ILE), see AF/ILE 10 May 01 memorandum, Subject: Payment of Fines, Penalties, and
Supplemental Environmental Projects.

Section 10O—Air Force Claims

10.67. Claims Payable From O&M Funds. Pay for claims (personnel, torts, admiralty, other)

91212F,DODEE 18, and EEIC 672XX. (AFIs 51-501, Tort Claims, and 51-502, Personnel and
Government Recovery Claims, provide details of the programs.) These claims include:
   10.67.1. Damages to personal property incurred during shipment or storage under contract
   with civilian carriers or warehouses.
   10.67.2. Repayment of erroneously collected amounts as determined by the Secretary
   concerned (or designated representatives) to military members and civilian personnel or to
   states, territories and the District of Columbia, or members of National Guard units.
   10.67.3. Payments for damages to persons or property caused by DoD personnel or
   activities.
10.68. Carrier Recoveries. Carrier recoveries will be credited to the O&M-type appropriation
current at the time of collection and be available for the same time period and purposes as that
appropriation (FY 99 Authorization Act, Section 1010 (P.L. 105-261) Codified in 10 U.S.C.
2739).

Section 10P—The Subsistence Program

10.69. Funding the Subsistence Program. Charge subsistence in kind (including meals ready
to eat (MRE)) for Air Force active duty personnel to the Military Personnel (57*3500)
Appropriation. Charge subsistence in kind for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
personnel to the Air National Guard personnel (57*3850) and the Air Force Reserve personnel

10.70. Counternarcotics Programs and Reprogramming Process.
   10.70.1. Counternarcotics Programs (including the Drug Demand Reduction Program) are
   funded through the Central Transfer Account from OSD. An A40 limitation (floor) is placed
   on these funds, which means funds cannot be subtracted from the amount provided by
   SAF/FMBO. At the beginning of each fiscal year MAJCOMs may need to cashflow
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                243


   programs in order to maintain program continuity. AF/A3/5 serves as executive agent for
   Air Force Counternarcotics. SAF/FMBOO is the financial POC.
      10.70.1.1. Counternarcotics programs have the authority to receive financial and other
      support from the DoD, and other departments and agencies of the Federal Government as
      described in a variety of references. These include provisions of law (Title 10 U.S.C.),
      Air Force publications (AFI 44-159, AFI 13-101, etc.) and DoD Directives and
      Instructions (DoD Directive 5111.1, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P);
      DoD Instruction 5525.10, Using Military Working Dog Teams (MWDTS) To Support
      Law Enforcement Agencies in Counter-Drug Missions, etc.).          Quarterly reports are
      submitted to SAF/FMBOO for consolidation to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
      for Counternarcotics (DASD-CN).
10.70.2 Process for Counternarcotics Reprogramming. The Program Manager of the
Initiating Command FMA must forward a request for reprogramming through SAF/FMBO to the
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics (DASD-CN) for approval. The
steps are as follows:
      10.70.2.1. Step 1. DASD(CN) initiates the reprogramming action, coordinating with
      Military Departments and Defense Agencies. DASD(CN) forwards the DD 1415-3
      document to OUSD(C).
      10.70.2.2. Step 2. OUSD(C) staffs the document for coordination with OUSD(C)
      Operations, OUSD(C) Investments, Office of General Counsel, OSD C3I, and other
      offices as appropriate.
      10.70.2.3. Step 3. DoD Comptroller (Operations) forwards the document to DoD
      Comptroller (Program and Financial Control) who packages and forwards for the DoD
      Comptroller signature. The signed reprogramming is then forwarded to OMB.
      10.70.2.4. Step 4. DFAS is directed by DoD Comptroller (Program and Financial
      Control) to initiate the Treasury transfer document (Form 1151). DFAS prepares Form
      1151 and forwards to the Treasury for signature. Completed Treasury documents are
      provided to each Military Department or Defense Agency receiving funds.
      10.70.2.5. Step 5. Apportionment documents (DD Form 1105) are forwarded to OMB
      for review and signature to constitute apportionment.
      10.70.2.6. Step 6. Completed 1105‘s are returned to DoD Comptroller (Program and
      Financial Control) and are then forwarded to the appropriate analysts within the DoD
      Comptroller and funding documents and Obligation Authority letters are issued.
      10.70.2.7. SAF/FMBO will notify commands if/when approved.
10.70.3. Drug Demand Reduction Budget and Execution Review Process. Drug Reduction
Program Managers (DRPM) prepare and submit budgets for their Demand Reduction Programs
as required.
      10.70.3.1. Budgets will be prepared in accordance with the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, AFI

                                            Chapter 11

                                   MANAGEMENT FUNDS

11.1. Purpose of Management Funds. A Management Fund is an account authorized by law
to credit collections from two or more appropriations or funds to finance an activity not
involving a continuing cycle of business-type operations. These accounts generally do not own a
significant amount of assets nor do they have a specified amount of capital provided (a corpus of
the fund). A management fund provides a means of interim financing and accounting for the
following:
   11.1.1. An operation or project that is financed by more than one appropriation or fund and
   whose costs cannot be distributed and charged to the financing appropriations or funds
   immediately; or
   11.1.2. An operation or project that is established pursuant to a transfer of functions
   involving two or more appropriations or funds under authority of law.
11.2. Purpose. A Management Fund:
   11.2.1. Is used only to finance operations whose costs are chargeable to appropriations or
   funds of the Air Force. Projects may encompass participation by organizational units of the
   Air Force only, or units of the Air Force and other DoD Components.
   11.2.2. May not be used to finance any activity that involves a continuing cycle of business-
   type operations, such as industrial or commercial type activities, or to purchase materiel for
   stock. The DoD uses revolving funds (now under the Defense Working Capital Fund,
   DWCF) to finance industrial or commercial type activities, and stock funds (now DWCF) to
   finance the acquisition of consumable (expense-type) materiel for stock. It may be used,
   however, to finance the purchase of materiel for use of an operation or project financed with
   a management fund.
   11.2.3. Will not be used to finance a new operation or project, even though eligible under
   paragraph 11.2.1, above, if other effective and efficient financing techniques are available.
   Charges are permitted to be made against an appropriation temporarily, if necessary, with an
   accounting adjustment to the appropriation or fund finally to be charged. (See P.L. 89-473
   and OMB Circular A-34).
   11.2.4. Is subject to periodic audits.
11.3. Responsibilities:
   11.3.1. SAF/FM shall:
       11.3.1.1. Ensure that a management fund is established or continued only when there is
       no other effective and efficient financing technique available to accomplish the proposed
       operation or project.
       11.3.1.2. Review and evaluate proposed management fund charters or amendments and
       recommend to the OUSD(C) the establishment or continuance of a management fund
       account.
   11.3.2. The Secretary of the Air Force shall:
 246                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       11.3.2.1. Propose use of a management fund as a financing technique, when considered
       appropriate, per guidance contained in this chapter.
       11.3.2.2. Oversee compliance with these instructions regarding its provision for
       budgeting, financing, accounting, and reporting for management fund accounts in use by
       the Air Force.
11.4. Procedures:
   11.4.1. Approval of Charters and Management Fund Accounts. Management Funds
   shall have a separate administrative account, called a management fund account, for each
   operation or project that it finances. SAF/FM submits a proposed charter to the OUSD(C) for
   final approval (see Figure 11.1), with an explanation of the reasons for the use of the
   management fund as the means of financing the operation or project.
       11.4.1.1. SAF/FM prepares the proposed charter in the uniform format shown in Figure
       11.1, with an original and three copies over the signature of the Secretary, Under
       Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. When appropriations or funds of
       more than one DoD Component are to share in the financing of a proposed account, each
       Component comptroller (or an equivalent official) must provide his or her concurrence.
       11.4.1.2. Using activities shall not exceed the scope of operations of a management fund
       account, as prescribed in the charter. However, the DoD Component can seek to revise
       basic provisions of a charter by submitting a proposed charter amendment in the same
       manner as an original charter application.
   11.4.2. Discontinuance of a Management Fund Account. When a management fund
   account is to be discontinued, SAF/FM submits a termination notice to the OUSD(C) stating
   the reason for discontinuing the account and the estimated date of final liquidation.
   11.4.3. Budgeting, Financing, Accounting, and Reporting:
       11.4.3.1. Budgets and Execution Plans:
          11.4.3.1.1. The Air Force, through SAF/FMB, prepares annual budget estimates for
          each management fund per DoD 7000.14–R.
          11.4.3.1.2. The managing activity for each management fund account prepares an
          annual operating budget or execution plan and updates it quarterly in a format
          appropriate for management planning and control purposes. The managing activity
          submits a copy of the operating budget or execution plan for an operation or project
          with the request for approval of an account charter. The managing activity also
          furnishes copies of operating budgets or execution plans to participating DoD
          Components or their organizational subdivisions when required for purposes of
          obtaining advances or for guidance in estimating appropriation or fund requirements.
       11.4.3.2. Financing and Administrative Control of Funds:
          11.4.3.2.1. Reimbursable orders, either with or without advances, whichever may be
          appropriate, provide the basis for obligation authority for the conduct of operations
          under a management fund account. The reimbursable orders may be issued in
          periodic increments to lessen the administrative workload and they will specify the
          accounting classifications to be used for billing purposes.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  247


           11.4.3.2.2. For fiscal control, the management fund is subject to DoD FMR 7000.14-
           R, Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations.
           Obligations may not be incurred against a management fund that is not chargeable to
           a specific order and the appropriation or fund supporting that order.
       11.4.3.3. Billing and Payment:
           11.4.3.3.1. Management fund outlays are charged to appropriations or funds as
           prescribed in the account charter and specified in the reimbursable order.
           11.4.3.3.2. Accomplish billings and payments by use of SF 1081, Voucher and
           Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits. When financing is by means of advances, the
           advances are made by SF 1081 prepared and processed as of the beginning of the
           period covered by the advance. In all cases, however, the Air Force activity
           responsible for the management fund account shall submit monthly bills to
           participating organizations to permit them to charge appropriate accounts and record
           the reduction in the advance accounts, as well as to permit the managing Air Force
           activity or other DoD Component to adjust its own accounts.
       11.4.3.4. Accounting and Reporting. The supporting financial management office will
       classify financial transactions under each management fund account in enough detail to
       meet management planning and control requirements. The principles, standards, and
       requirements in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4 apply to the accounting and reporting
       systems. This manual provides for the recording and reporting of the source, application,
       and status of funds. The management fund account charters must contain additional
       financial reporting needed by participating organizations for management purposes; the
       financial reporting must conform to DoD 8910.1-M, DoD Procedures for Management of
       Information Requirements.

       appropriate official obligation of MILPERS PCS funds for the movements associated
       with those assignments.
12.4. Complying with Statutory Entitlements. The MILPERS appropriation is basically a
statutory entitlement appropriation. Most costs borne by the MILPERS appropriation can not be
avoided or deferred as long as the member continues in service. See the e DoD FMR, Vol 7A for
 252                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 253


         12.5.2.2.3. You may only cite the HQ USAF-directed CMA funds for personnel
         actually assigned or to be assigned to authorized positions in the unit to be moved
         before the movement date. Reference the HQ USAF unit move directive in the orders
         you issue for fund citation. Exclude:
            12.5.2.2.3.1. Personnel filling vacancies at the new location as a result of
            requisition and levy procedures.

            12.5.2.2.3.5. Cite command-directed CMA funds for moves after the effective
            date of the unit move.
            12.5.2.2.3.6. In programming unit moves, AF/A1PF (Director of Personnel Force
            Management) must estimate the number of individuals involved in the move,
            including those needed to support units at new locations. Show this data in the
            program document's (PD) summary of unit movements. Command requests to
            issue movement directives must not include personnel moves exceeding those
            authorized. For move requirements exceeding the number programmed,
            commands must provide detailed justification in the movement request and
            execution plans.
     12.5.2.3. Notification. The command must notify SAF/FMBOP, 1130 Air Force
     Pentagon,Washington DC 20330-1130 (info to AFPC/DSH/DPAPA, Randolph AFB,
     Texas 78150-6001) of the number of individual officer and enlisted moves accomplished
     within 15 days after completing a unit move. SAF/FMBOP uses this data to validate
     obligations.
  12.5.3. Delayed Movement of Dependents or Household Goods (HHG). Movement of
  dependents or HHG may occur after another PCS order has been issued. (See JFTR, Volume
  1, Paragraphs U5222 Con D.) When this occurs, determine the chargeable fiscal year by the
  transfer effective date (TED) shown in the PCS orders.
     12.5.3.1. When assignment is to an overseas area where dependents may accompany
     sponsor, but movement of dependents is delayed until after new PCS orders are issued
     reassigning the sponsor to another overseas location, charge the PCS to the funds cited in
     the PCS orders covering the sponsor's first overseas assignment.
     12.5.3.2. When assignment is to an overseas area where dependents may not accompany
     the sponsor, and the sponsor is later reassigned to another overseas location where
     dependents are permitted, charge the costs related to moving the dependents to the new
     location to the funds cited in the PCS orders covering the sponsor's latest assignment.
     12.5.3.3. When military members, civilian employees, and other persons travel under
     competent orders as escorts or attendants for dependents of members of the service, cite
     the O&M appropriation for travel and transportation allowances. (Reference JFTR, part
     Q, U7550, U7551, U7552, and U7553.) Pay the dependents' travel and transportation
254                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      allowances from the Military Personnel Appropriation's PCS account, using the member's
      PCS fund cite.
  12.5.4. Advance Return of Dependents to Continental United States (CONUS). When
  orders authorize the advance return of dependents, and the member does not have a pending
  assignment, cite the funds that are on the current PCS order (PCS orders remain in effect
  until replaced). When orders authorize the advance return of dependents and the member has
  a pending assignment, cite the funds that would be cited on the members PCS orders. For
  example, if the actual transfer effective date (TED) of the member is a different fiscal year
  (FY) than the dependents' relocation date, you should code the subproject code of the fund
  cite to link the dependents' travel back to the member's TED. Do this by using a ".9" instead
  of ".0" in the subproject element of the fund cite (see MILPERS appropriation guidance in
  AFMAN 65-604). To determine the fund citation, see guidance on directing PCS moves in
  AFI 36-2110.
  12.5.5. Rules for PCS Moves that Overlap More than One Project or
  Subproject. Project and subproject codes distinguish among the major types of PCS moves
  and generally coincide with the categories used for PCS move programming. When PCS
  moves fall under more than one budget project, or subproject, apply these rules:
      12.5.5.1. The centrally managed allotment (CMA) for travel to and from overseas takes
      precedence over the CMA for training, PCS moves. For example, you charge a PCS from
      an Air Force school to an overseas assignment to CMA "travel to and from overseas"
      rather than "training travel."
      12.5.5.2. The CMA for PCS moves to or from formal training schools takes precedence
      over the CMA for reassigning PCS moves within CONUS.
      12.5.5.3. For PCS costs for individuals separating from the service, cite the CMA for
      separation travel:
      12.5.5.4. When an individual serving in a CONUS station is ordered to another station
      for processing incident to separation prior to issuing the PCS order, charge the resulting
      TDY costs to the operation and maintenance (O&M) funds supporting the command of
      assignment.
      12.5.5.5. When the last permanent duty station is overseas and the member is returned to
      CONUS for separation, charge all travel, transportation, and nontemporary storage costs
      to separation travel.
      12.5.5.6. Charge costs associated with members accompanied by dependents to the
      United States between consecutive overseas tour (COT) areas to the MILPERS
      (57*3500) appropriation whenever new PCS orders are written and a move ensues. Also,
      charge the MILPERS (57*3500) appropriation when the member stays at the present duty
      station and there is no physical move.
  12.5.6. Transporting Passengers, Unaccompanied Baggage and HHG, on Aircraft
  Operated by Air Mobility Command Under the Transportation Working Capital Fund
  (TWCF). SAF/FMB manages the CMA accounts that cover the TWCF airlift part of PCS
  travel expenses.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 255


  12.5.7. Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) Charge the appropriate
  CMA accounts for TWCF transportation services, and overseas port terminals. This includes:
     12.5.7.1. All costs of transportation services furnished by SDDC for military personnel
     on Air Force duty, their dependents, HHG, personal baggage, and privately owned
     automobiles (POV).
     12.5.7.2. Transportation Services furnished by Army Port Terminals (CONUS) and
     overseas port terminals, including baggage handling charges for passengers embarking or
     debarking from SDDC vessels, port handling charges for HHG, and port handling
     charges connected with shipment of POVs. See DFAS Interim Guidance on Accounting
     for Obligation (formerly DFAS-DE 7000.4-R and AFR 170-8) Paragraph 13, for
     recording PCS travel obligations.
  12.5.8. Household Goods (HHG) Shipments. The transportation officer initiating the
  shipment is responsible for determining the mode of shipment. Charge the CMA account
  cited in the PCS orders authorizing the shipment for all costs incident to shipping HHG,
  including contract packing and crating and other accessorial services. Except: follow
  paragraphs 12.5.6 and 12.5.7 for transportation services furnished by MSC, Army port
  terminals, overseas port terminals or Air Mobility Command.
  12.5.9. Nontemporary Storage of HHG. Costs of nontemporary storage include linehaul
  charges to the storage facility, charges for accessorial services connected with the storage
  (see JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U5380-A), actual storage, and handling out charges to the
  warehouse docks.
     12.5.9.1. Charge storage expenses to the appropriation current in the fiscal year when
     services are provided.
     12.5.9.2. Charge the cost of nontemporary storage of HHG in commercial facilities
     resulting from PCS movement of military personnel (see JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph
     U5380) to the CMA account prescribed for this purpose.
     12.5.9.3. When HHG are at an overseas location and are returned to CONUS for storage,
     charge the cost of overseas shipment and storage to the CMA for rotation moves from
     overseas.
  12.5.10. Dislocation Allowance. Charge the cost to the CMA account cited in the PCS
  movement orders. (A dislocation allowance is authorized to partially reimburse a member for
  expenses incurred in relocating HHG upon a PCS (see JFTR, Volume 1, U5600). The cost of
  dislocation allowance is part of the total PCS movement.)
  12.5.11. Mobile Home Allowance. Charge the cost to the CMA account cited in the PCS
  movement orders. (A mobile home allowance is authorized to reimburse a member for the
  cost of transporting a mobile home (JFTR, Volume 1, U5500).
  12.5.12. Reimbursable Transportation Expenses:
     12.5.12.1. Some PCS moves result from requests of other federal agencies, governments,
     or international organizations under agreements requiring reimbursement for all or part of
     the travel and transportation costs to the MILPERS appropriation. Charge these costs to
     budget project accounts covering reimbursable PCS expenses (does not apply to Foreign
     Military Sales reimbursable costs).
256                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      12.5.12.2. To determine whether military PCS costs are reimbursable, orders issuing
      activities must consider agreements with other federal agencies, governments, or
      international organizations. For example, only the travel expenses of the military member
      are reimbursable upon assignment to a United Nations mission. Therefore, travel orders
      directing these moves must cite the Air Force reimbursable budget account for travel of
      the member only. Charge the cost of travel of dependents and shipment of HHG to and
      from overseas to the Air Force allotment that applies (see DFAS-DE Regulation 177-29).
      12.5.12.3. Under the Mansfield Amendments, payments for wages are paid directly to
      the United States Government. Credit these collections to the MILPERS appropriation.
      Charge PCS costs of persons being reassigned for this duty to the CMA for movements to
      and from overseas. If the host country pays for PCS costs of mission members, travel of
      dependents, and shipment of HHG, credit the collections to the MILPERS appropriation.
      12.5.12.4. Follow DFAS-DE Regulation 177-29 to identify reimbursable costs and
      collect for items included in MSC billings.
      12.5.12.5. Follow this paragraph for PCS costs related to FMS programs.
         12.5.12.5.1. Military personnel PCS costs related to FMS cases are reimbursable.
         Effective FY 2005, military personnel services supporting FMS must be priced using
         the composite rates that already include the PCS expense and must no longer use the
         actual PCS expense for PCS moves to support a PCS case.(DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
         Volume 15, Subparagraph 070203 C.
         12.5.12.5.2. Composite standard pay rates include PCS costs and are subject to
         acceleration factors. Reimbursable FMS positions receive payment for PCS moves as
         a component of this composite standard pay rate. When military personnel must make
         a PCS move to support an FMS case, delete the PCS rate from the composite rate and
         charge the actual PCS cost to the case. In the latter situation, the actual PCS cost is
         not subject to acceleration.
  12.5.13. PCS to Air Force Academy (USAFA) Preparatory School. Charge the PCS cost
  of Air Force personnel selected to attend the USAFA Preparatory School, Army Military
  Academy Preparatory School, or Naval Academy Preparatory School to the MILPERS
  appropriation (57*3500). Army and Navy appropriations must pay associated PCS costs for
  Army and Navy enlisted personnel selected to attend the USAFA Preparatory School.
  Include this guidance in any instructions you issue to Army and Navy installations .
  12.5.14. Travel From Overseas to CONUS in Connection With Emergency Leave. PCS
  moves may arise as the result of emergency leave granted under AFMAN 65-116 Volume 2,
  Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO, and AFI 36-
  3003. Treat these PCS moves as command-directed if the reassignment to the CONUS unit
  would otherwise have been command-directed. See paragraph 10.18 for funds to cite when a
  member is placed on TDY for return to CONUS on TWCF flights on a space required basis.
  12.5.15. TDY Travel in Connection With PCS Movement:
      12.5.15.1. TDY Costs Chargeable to the MILPERS Appropriation. Temporary duty
      travel (other than TDY Hold) is the responsibility of the requiring unit or command
      unless it is training funded by AETC or other commands or TDY other than training
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    257


      funded by non-PCS sources. Charge TDY for briefings, de-briefings and special
      instructions to the requiring command‘s O&M funds. Charge TDY travel costs directly
      related and integral to PCS moves to the MILPERS PCS account only if the following
      condition(s) apply:
          12.5.15.1.1. TDY does not exceed 15 days and is performed enroute to and for the
          purpose of supporting the follow-on position at the new permanent duty station.
          12.5.15.1.2. TDY is for medical examinations, M-16 rifle training, obtaining
          passports and in-processing at host base when required under host/tenant agreement.
          No training other than M-16 is authorized in TDY status. Charge TDY for briefings,
          debriefings, and special instructions to the requiring command's O&M-type funds.
          Member noncurrent escort travel is not a PCS entitlement.
          12.5.15.1.3. USAF (AFPC, AF/DPG, or AF/DPO), AF/HC or AF/JA authorizes.
          Authorization must be cited in PCS orders.
      12.5.15.2. TDY Costs Not Chargeable to the MILPERS Appropriation:
          12.5.15.2.1. Charge TDY requirements, other than those in paragraph 12.5.15.1 to
          O&M-type funds according to paragraph 10.3.4 Include the fund citation in the PCS
          order. This includes TDY travel for formal or informal training conducted by the Air
          University, MAJCOMs, HQ USAF staff agencies, or other government agencies.
          12.5.15.2.2. But, transoceanic travel costs associated with directed TDY to CONUS
          incident to PCS are considered a PCS expense. Charge the cost to the applicable PCS
          funds (see paragraph 10.3 for details). Use the military personnel appropriation
          current on the transfer effective date to finance the cost of the military member's
          travel from the TDY station to a new permanent station and the cost of a dependent's
          travel from the old to the new permanent station.
      12.5.15.3. Movement on Indefinite/Indeterminate TDY. HQ USAF specifically
      authorizes movements of individuals or organizations to overseas commands on
      indefinite TDY. Charge expenses to the budget subproject of the MILPERS
      appropriation. When authorized by HQ USAF, you will also charge the travel of
      dependents and transportation of HHG within the United States. Refer to JFTR V1, par.
      U4605.
   12.5.16. Fiscal Year (FY) Chargeable for PCS Moves. At the time permanent change of
   station orders are issued for military personnel, obligations shall be recorded against current
   appropriations for all authorized reimbursable expenses incidental to relocation at the request
   of the US Government, and for transportation requests and bills of lading expected to be
   issued. The only exception is the obligation of costs for non-temporary contract commercial
   storage of household goods, which shall be obligated either in the period in which the service
   is rendered or to the appropriation current at the contract award.
12.6. Travel of Indigent Army, Navy, and Air Force Enlisted Personnel:
   12.6.1. Enlisted Personnel Not Traveling Under Official Orders. Army, Navy, and Air
   Force enlisted personnel not traveling under official orders and not entitled to transportation
   at government expense may be issued meal tickets and transportation requests (TR)
   according to applicable directives. Charge appropriations as follows:
 258                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       12.6.1.1. Army Enlisted Personnel. Army enlisted personnel may be advanced cash in
       an amount equivalent to the meal tickets. Charge the project that applies under the
       MILPERS appropriation, Army, for TRs, meal tickets, and cash advance. Army
       authorities will obtain reimbursement from the individual for these expenses.
       12.6.1.2. Navy Enlisted Personnel. The Navy Department does not desire to have their
       personnel advanced cash in place of meal tickets. Charge the MILPERS appropriation,
       Navy, for TRs and meal tickets. Navy authorities obtain reimbursement from the
       individual for these expenses.
       12.6.1.3. Air Force Enlisted Personnel. Air Force enlisted personnel may be advanced
       cash in amount equivalent to the meal tickets. Obtain reimbursement from the individual
       for these expenses according to AFI 24-101, Passenger Travel.
   12.6.2. Enlisted Personnel Traveling Under Official Orders. Enlisted personnel (when
   traveling under official orders issued by their respective services) may be eligible for TRs
   and meal tickets. Cite the appropriation of the respective military service, as shown on the
   travel orders, for the TRs and meal tickets.
12.7. Other Military Personnel Costs. Charge the Air Force CMA Account (P-591.XX) for:
   12.7.1. Return of absentees, deserters or escaped prisoners.
   12.7.2. Payment of rewards and reimbursement for apprehension, detention and delivery of
   absentees, deserters, and escaped prisoners.
   12.7.3. Travel of guards after the member is identified as a deserter by the parent
   organization.
   12.7.4. Return of Absentees, Deserters, or Escaped Military Prisoners. The Air Force
   may furnish military personnel who are in an absent-without-leave, desertion, or escaped
   military prisoner status (under apprehension) the necessary transportation and meal tickets to
   return to their duty station or another place directed by competent authority. The travel and
   expenses of the apprehended member are funded by the Military Personnel CMA account (P-
   591.02). The travel and expenses of an escort to bring the apprehended member to a military
   installation is funded IAW with paragraph 12.8 below. See paragraph 12.7.5 for the payment
   of rewards and reimbursements for the return of apprehended members. If transportation and
   meal tickets are furnished for an apprehended member from another military department,
   charge the cost to the appropriation of the appropriate military department (that is,
   MILPERS, Army, Navy, or Marines). After a military member has been initially
   apprehended and returned to a military installation, further travel is funded IAW AFI 31-205,
   The Air Force Corrections System, Chapter 9, Paragraph 9.9.
   12.7.5. Payment of Rewards and Reimbursements for Apprehension, Detention and
   Delivery of Absentees, Deserters, Parole Violators, and Escaped Prisoners. Per AFI 36-
   2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence, Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.5., any authorized
   communication, oral or written, from a military or federal law enforcement official or
   agency, requesting active cooperation in apprehending or delivering to military control an
   absentee or deserter wanted by a military department constitutes the basis for a reward. After
   this communication, the Air Force rewards or reimburses (but not both) persons or agencies
   apprehending, detaining or delivering absentees, deserters, escaped military prisoners, or
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  259


   parole violators to military control under Air Force CMA account 591.01 (Rewards) and
   591.02 (Reimbursements and expenses other than rewards and Escort travel). . If a non-Air
   Force military absentee/deserter/escapee is brought to an Air Force installation and a reward
   or reimbursement is due, the apprehendee‘s parent military department military personnel
   account pays, not the Air Force CMA. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 10, Contract
   Payment Policy and Procedures, Chapter 12, Paragraph 120110.D.
   12.7.6. Confinement in a Civilian Jail Pending Movement to a Military Confinement
   Facility. If confinement in a local civilian jail is required because there are no military
   confinement facilities on an installation, the cost of confinement is chargeable to the
   operating funds of that installation. It is NOT chargeable to the MILPERS (3500)
   appropriation.
12.8. Travel of Guards:
   12.8.1. Charge transportation requests (TR) and meal tickets furnished to Air Force
   personnel acting as escorts of Air Force absentees, deserters, parole violators, and escaped
   military prisoners to the Air Force CMA account P-591.03. Do not charge these expenses
   against the pay of the Air Force returned member.
   12.8.2. When Air Force escorts return Army personnel from an Air Force installation, charge
   the TRs and meal tickets furnished to the escorts to the MILPERS appropriation, Army.
   Obtain the full Department of Army accounting classification from Army fiscal codes, the
   nearest Army installation, Army headquarters, or the home organization of the Army
   absentees, deserters, or escapees.
12.9. Participation of USAFR and ANG Units in Regular Air Force Exercises (MPA Man-
Day Program). To determine whether to finance charges for personnel participation from the
Air Force MILPERS appropriation or from Reserve Personnel, Air Force, or the National Guard
Personnel, Air Force appropriations, apply the following rules:
   12.9.1. If the purpose is to fulfill active duty Air Force requirements, charge the pay and
   allowances to the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation. Charge travel and per diem costs to
   the O&M-type funds of the active duty Air Force organization being supported.
   12.9.2. If the purpose is to fulfill ANG or USAFR training requirements, charge the costs to
   the reserve component personnel appropriation. For example, early commissioning of
   medical and dental officers is a program to fulfill training requirements of the USAFR, and
   you would charge pay and allowances and other costs to the USAFR appropriation.
12.10. Nontemporary Storage Charges. Pay nontemporary storage charges incident to PCS
from annual appropriations and from the fiscal year when the storage services are rendered. See
the Air Force PCS orders for the CMA fund citation.
12.11. Reimbursements for Military Personnel Services. See paragraph 5.4.4 and Chapter
18, DWCF.
12.12. The Subsistence Program. Charge the cost of basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) to
the MILPERS Appropriation. Finance subsistence-in-kind for Air Force active duty personnel
from the Military Personnel (57*3500) Appropriation. Finance subsistence-in-kind for Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel from the Air National Guard personnel
 260                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


(57*3850) and the Air Force Reserve personnel (57*3700) accounts. See Chapter 10, Section
10P, for further details.
12.13. Emergency Evacuation Allowances. 37 U.S.C. 405a authorizes the payment of
emergency evacuation allowances when the Secretary of the Air Force, a designee, or other
competent authority directs or approves the evacuation of dependents. Charge all authorized
allowances to the MILPERS appropriation. For specific entitlements and rates, see the Joint
Federal Travel Regulations. See AFMAN 65-604, PCS budget projects 5710 and 5810, for
correct subproject coding.
12.14. Consecutive Overseas Tours. See paragraph 4.41 for guidance on paying round-trip
travel expenses for military personnel and their dependents from overseas to the CONUS
between consecutive overseas tours (COT).
12.15. Housing Moves at a Permanent Duty Station (PDS) for Government
Convenience. A Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA) must be paid to a member who is
ordered to occupy/ vacate Government family-type quarters due to: a) privatization, b)
renovation, (c) any reason other than PCS (See JFTR , Paragraph U5630-B15 for current rate).
Payment is made from the Military Personnel (3500) Appropriation, Budget Project 599.04. If an
AF Form 150 is completed by the Housing Office for a move and the Government pays for that
move, the member is entitled to a PDLA payment. The one DLA per fiscal year limitation does
not apply to partial DLA.
   12.15.1. Expenses for Reconnection of Phones and Cable in Unaccompanied
   Housing. Members who are directed to move from one unaccompanied billet to another for
   the convenience of the Government will receive reimbursement for reconnection of
   telephones and cable TV. This reimbursement will be paid from O&M (3400). PDLA is
   NOT authorized for moves between unaccompanied housing billets.
   12.15.2. Additionally, military members temporarily displaced from base housing as a result
   of programmed renovations/upgrades or emergency situations which require occupants to
   vacate quarters as determined by the installation commander, receive reimbursement for
   temporary lodging expenses that exceed BAH rates. Upon submission of SF 1164, Claims for
   Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, base O&M (3400) funds should be
   used to reimburse the occupants for housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement
   amount (AF/ILE Memo 9 Jul 02, Reimbursement for Costs Incurred by Personnel Displaced
   from Family Housing) (Comptroller General Decisions B-213293 and B-225205).
12.16. Program 780, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). This program provides for:
   12.16.1. Senior and Junior ROTC Programs.
       12.16.1.1. Senior ROTC Program: For students enrolled in ROTC at the college or
       university level. Institutions participating in this program may have a 4-year program, a
       2-year program or both. The two components of the senior ROTC program are the
       General Military Course (GMC) and the Professional Officer Course (POC). GMC
       members are frshmen and sophomore students who have successfully completed field
       training and entered into a ―contract‖ with the Air Force. The mission of the senior
       ROTC program is to commission second lieutenants based on Air Force production
       requirements.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     261


   12.16.1.2. Junior ROTC Program: For students enrolled at public and private secondary
   schools. JROTC is a congressionally mandated citizenship-building program designed to
   acquaint secondary school students with the aerospace age, develop inforemed citizens,
   strengthen character, promote an understanding of the role of the citizen soldier in a
   democratic society, and motivate students for careers in the Air Force.
   12.16.2. Senior ROTC Institutional Program (Subproject 781). The institutional
   program provides several entitlement programs for senior ROTC cadets enrolled at the
   college or university level. Entitlment programs include a monthly stipend (contract cadets
   only);uniforms (issue-in-kind and commutation), meals, and foreign language skill
   proficiency bonus pay (contract cadets only).
12.16.3. Senior ROTC Field Training (FT) Program (Subproject 782). The objectives of FT
are to evaluate military leadership and discipline, determine potential for entry into the POC and
to stratify candidate performance. These objectives orient officer candidates to the standards of a
structured military environment, provide key Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) training and teach
participants how an AF base and AEF operates. Funding for FT includes: training pay, meals,
and uniforms.
   12.16.4. Junior ROTC Program (Subproject 783). Provides funding to procure uniforms
   for newly activated units as well as replacement items in current units. Covers the cost of
   student meals during Curriculum-In-Action (CIA) field trips, Summer Leadership Schools
   (SLS), and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) camps.
   12.16.5. Professional Development Training (PDT) Program (Subproject 784). Selected
   GMC and POC cadets spend 1 to 10 weeks in job related orientation at designated training
   locations. Entitlements include: training pay, meals and uniforms.

                       APPROPRIATION (57*3600)

Section 13A—General Guidance

13.1. Applying the Uniform Budget Structure. MAJCOM and program offices will prepare
budgets by program element. SAF/AQ and FM use the budget structure prescribed by the Office
of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for the President's Budget:

Table 13.1. RDT&E Budget Structure.


                Budget         Title
                Activity
                1              Basic Research
                2              Applied Research
                3              Advance Technology Development (ATD)
                4              Advanced Component Development and Prototype
                               (ACD&P)
                5              System Development and Demonstration (SDD)
                6              RDT&E Management Support
                7              Operational Systems Development

13.2. Managing RDT&E Funds. The Air Force manages RDT&E funds by program elements
(which are also the baseline for reprogramming) for the current and expired fiscal years. In cases
involving statutory or other congressional limitations, SAF/FMB may control funds for projects
or subprojects. New obligation authority expires after 2 fiscal years. You may continue to apply
available RDT&E funds for valid obligation adjustments and expenditures for 5 years after
expiration under the original appropriation symbol. Manage and maintain the same level of detail
for expired accounts as for current accounts. See Chapter 6 for guidance on using expired and
canceled accounts. Chapter 3 contains specific guidance on budget authorizations, allocations,
and allotments.
13.3. Applying Incremental Programming and Financing for RDT&E. Follow the guidance
in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1.
   13.3.1. Commands should identify funds that are above programmed requirements to
   SAF/FMBIZ and SAF/AQXR, so the Air Force can reapply funds to other priority programs.
   13.3.2. Program offices will document the justification for exceptions to incremental funding
   and retain such justification as part of the contract file.
   13.3.3. Award fee requirements are planned and budgeted for as a part of the total weapon
   system cost. Award fees are a bona fide need of the same fiscal year and appropriation that
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    263


   finances the related effort on which the award fee is based. To comply with RDT&E
   incremental funding policy, award fee requirements must be budgeted for and funded with
   the same fiscal year funds as the increment of associated effort. Until the determination has
   been made that a contractor is due an award fee, the award fee funds are committed as
   a contingent liability, not obligated. (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 8,
   Paragraph 080202)
13.4. Delineating    Funding     Responsibility    Between      RDT&E       and    Procurement
Appropriations:
   13.4.1. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1 for guidance on the types of costs
   RDT&E and related appropriations finance. Also see Chapter 8 of this AFI.
   13.4.2. Specify separate tasks in the contract (contract line items) so you will have
   documentation on contract accounts and voucher payments tied to specific appropriations.
   13.4.3. General Criteria: When, after consideration of the following criteria, there is doubt
   as to the proper assignment of costs between appropriations, the issue should be resolved in
   favor of using RDT&E funding (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Paragraph
   010212.B).
13.5. Family Housing. Do not use RDT&E to construct, operate, or maintain family housing at
R&D installations or activities.
13.6. Tenant Activities. See Chapter 7.
13.7. Managing Uncommitted and Unobligated Balances in RDT&E. Apply the following
to make sure approved R&D programs are timely and effective.
   13.7.1. HQ USAF may withdraw uncommitted balances at the end of the first year of
   availability.
   13.7.2. Finance validated current and first prior fiscal year cost increases within the program
   element of the approved program. If the approved program is insufficient, then request
   reprogramming within Air Force approval authority.
   13.7.3. Finance validated cost increases for an expired year within the allocation for the
   multiple-year period. If funds are not available, the MAJCOM will ask SAF/FM for more
   money to cover the deficit. Follow procedures in Chapter 6.
   13.7.4. The RDT&E appropriation is legally available for up to 2 years for a new obligation
   and you may incur obligations at any time during the 2 years. However, due to its nature,
   PMA should be budgeted on an annual basis and reflected in the fiscal year during which the
   requirement is projected to execute. The appropriation used to fund PMA should be
   consistent with the work being performed and not determined simply by prorating between
   available appropriations. During execution, emergent PMA requirements may be paid from
   any fiscal year currently available for new obligation provided the appropriation cited is
   consistent with the task being supported. Shortfalls in budgeted PMA requirements need to
   be paid from the same appropriation as originally budgeted for the effort. In addition, when
   termination of a program is directed by Congress, initiated by the Air Force, or directed by
   OSD, the most recent funds appropriated for that program shall be used first to fund those
   day-to-day operating requirements necessary to execute termination. If no current year funds
 264                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   were appropriated, prior year unexpired RDT&E funds shall be used for executing
   termination. This action does not require a waiver from SAF/FMBIZ.
13.8. Charging Cost Increases for Incrementally-funded R&D Contracts:
   13.8.1. Incrementally-funded RDT&E contracts are:
       13.8.1.1. Multiyear contracts that provide for requirements beyond one year, even
       though all funds to be obligated are not available at the time you sign the contract. In this
       case, the contract scope includes total requirements performed over a number of fiscal
       years. You initially obligate only the first year's requirements. In succeeding years, you
       fund and obligate succeeding annual contract requirements.
       13.8.1.2. Contracts that provide only for the requirements of the current fiscal year. In
       this case, the contract scope describes only the annual requirements. You amend these
       contracts each year by changing the scope to include requirements for later fiscal years.
       You obligate current year funds for each annual change in scope.
   13.8.2. Charge cost increases as follows:
       13.8.2.1. If the cost increase occurs within the scope of the basic contract or contract
       amendments, charge the cost to the same appropriation and fiscal year cited on the basic
       contract or amendment (even if expired).
       13.8.2.2. If the contract was incrementally funded and the increase is traceable to more
       than 1 fiscal year, prorate it accordingly. Base your proration among fiscal years on the
       relationship of the cost increase to the performance required under the basic contract,
       change order, or contract amendment -- either individually or in total. For example, a cost
       increase could relate to a specific amendment or accrue over the total period of
       performance. Evaluate each increase to determine the extent and need for proration. If the
       contractor's performance report provides this data, you may use it to do the proration.
13.9. Aircraft Engine Component Improvement. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2A,
Chapter 1.
13.10. Information Technology Equipment (ITE). See Chapter 4, Section 4B.
13.11. Value Engineering. See Chapter 8.
13.12. Factory Training. See Chapter 10, Section 10L.
13.13. General Use Vehicles for Research and Development (R&D) Activities. See Chapter
8.
Section 13B—Funding to Acquire Research and Development (R&D) Facilities and Install
R&D Equipment
13.14. Acquiring Facilities with RDT&E Funds. Generally, you must use MILCON to
acquire facilities at government-operated R&D installations and activities. Do not use authorities
for constructing with RDT&E to substitute for authorization of military construction projects or
for authorization and appropriation of military construction funds. In particular, do not use
RDT&E funds to produce facilities on military installations primarily for long term military use.
You may use RDT&E funds for the following categories of construction.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       265


  13.14.1. Test Facility. A structure or improvement that is itself the subject of a test or is at
  least partially destroyed or consumed during testing (i.e., the facility is itself a test article).
  An example would be an aircraft shelter being tested for its ability to withstand bomb
  impacts.
  13.14.2. Prototype Facility. A structure that is the first of its kind in terms of materials,
  application, and design. It may be either a small-scale model or a full-size structure or
  demonstration project, built solely to establish criteria for constructing follow-on facilities.
  13.14.3. Temporary Facility. A specialized structure used to support a specific RDT&E
  project of limited duration. Such facilities must be clearly temporary in construction (non-
  permanent, provisional, and easily dismantled) with few decorative treatments or facades.
  The cost of all such exterior treatments may not exceed 5% of the total acquisition cost for
  the structure. You must follow AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6, Relocatable Facilities, in acquiring
  offices and warehouse space, facilities readily adaptable to such uses, and other structures
  having "general utility". You may only approve an RDT&E-funded temporary facility on a
  military installation for up to three years; remove it at the end of the project. MAJCOMs
  must obtain SAF/IEI approval (through A7C and SAF/FMBI) of any waivers to the three-
  year removal policy .
  13.14.4. Unspecified Minor Construction (10 U. S.C. 2805). Use RDT&E for unspecified
  minor construction projects costing $750,000 or less. All unspecified minor construction
  must result in a complete and usable facility. Do not use incremental construction, which is
  the planned acquisition of or improvement to, for a real-property facility through a series of
  minor construction projects. See AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032.
  13.14.5. Facilities for Contractors. You may use RDT&E to acquire industrial and R&D
  facilities that contractors need to fulfill R&D contracts (as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2353 and
  DoD Directive 4275.5, Acquisition and Management of Industrial Resources). Submit each
  project through A7C to SAF/ IE for approval. Follow guidance in AFI 63-609, the Defense
  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, DFARS 245.302-1, and HQ USAF supplements
  to the FAR. Do not use this authority to acquire facilities with general utility. ("General
  utility" means adaptable for uses other than the original purpose without alterations costing
  over $750,000. All offices and warehouse buildings have general utility.) You do not have to
  treat test and prototype facilities as having general utility simply because they may be used as
  warehouse space with only minor alterations.
     13.14.5.1. The contractor alone operates and maintains complex.
         13.14.5.1.1. Convenience of the government and unusual circumstances dictate using
         RDT&E funding instead of MILCON funding.
         13.14.5.1.2. The construction or improvement does not have general utility.
     13.14.5.2. The Air Force must comply with Congressional reporting requirements (10
     U.S.C. 2662) for facility projects submitted under 10 U.S.C. 2353 that involve real
     property acquisitions with a price or estimated value more than $750,000. Wait 30 days
     after Congressional notification before entering into these transactions.
266                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      13.14.5.3. If the project is not in the President's Budget, submit it out-of-cycle to
      Congressional committees using the complete DD Form 1391 package, Military
      Construction Project Data, coordinated with AF/A7C and SAF/IE.
      13.14.5.4. Use military construction funds for any other type of on-base building for
      contractor use. Except as stated in paragraph 13.15.3 above, remove all buildings erected
      for contractor use with RDT&E funds when the contractor has no further use for them,
      unless continued use is authorized under guidance for Test and Prototype Facilities.
      13.14.5.5. Lease the military installation land on which a contractor's buildings
      (including relocatables) will rest to the contractor for five years under 10 U.S.C. 2667.
      You may write a longer lease if it will promote national defense or is in the public
      interest. Charge a nominal rent when the land will help someone carry out a government
      contract. Charge a pro-rata ground rent for any non-government use. Base the ground rent
      on fair market value at the time non-government use begins. Under the lease, the
      government will retain the right to approve non-government use. When the facility costs
      more than $2 million, report to the Congress under 10 U.S.C 2662 before signing the
      lease, whether or not the fair-market ground rent exceeds the reporting threshold (now
      $750,000). The Air Force must always submit the report when the fair-market ground
      rent (regardless of the rent actually charged) exceeds the reporting threshold.
      13.14.5.6. Report real property facilities leased from a contractor(s) to Congress 30 days
      before signing the lease if the fair-market rental value of the property exceeds $750,000.
      Include a report on the facts concerning the proposed transactions.
      13.14.5.7. When you lease real property, report the lease to the Armed Services
      Committees under 10 U.S.C. 2662 if the fair-market value of the real property is more
      than $750,000, even though the purchase price may be less. If the contract charges
      nothing or less than fair-market value, you must get authority to acquire the property
      under current construction guidelines using fair-market value rather than price (see AFI
      32-9001).
      13.14.5.8. Do not use facilities constructed on base for use by contractors to house
      government activities (other than those funded out of military construction or minor
      construction funds). If the senior Air Force official responsible for the contract
      determines government people must occupy the contractor's facility to monitor contract
      performance and protect government interests, they can not occupy more than 25% of the
      available space. To exceed this 25% limit, you must get a waiver from SAF/IEI, or get
      minor construction funds or MILCON authorization and appropriations to pay a pro rata
      share of the cost of the facility, based on the space occupied.
      13.14.5.9. Under 10 U.S.C. 2353, the Air Force may enter into an R&D contract that
      furnishes the contractor (or allows the contractor to acquire or construct) RDT&E
      facilities and equipment on property not owned by the government. The facilities must be
      necessary to carry out the contract. Do not install or construct facilities that would not be
      readily available or separable without unreasonable expense (on property not owned by
      the government) unless the contract contains:
         13.14.5.9.1. A provision to reimburse the government for the fair value of the
         facilities.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                        267


           13.14.5.9.2. An option for the government to acquire the underlying land.
           13.14.5.9.3. Or an alternative provision that protects the interests of the United
           States.
   13.14.6. Relocatable Building. You may use a relocatable building to satisfy a temporary
   requirement for RDT&E. (A relocatable building is designed and packaged to be readily
   moved, erected, disassembled, stored, and reused. Prefabricated buildings consisting of pre-
   cut, formed, and drilled materials that permit easy assembly, but which are not designed for
   disassembly and relocation are not relocatable buildings.) Do not use a relocatable structure
   bought with RDT&E funds longer than the project requires or three years, whichever is less.
   For use beyond three years, you must obtain a waiver from SAF/IEI, submitted through
   AF/A7C and coordinated with SAF/FMBI. Fund site preparation, foundations, utilities, and
   other supporting construction costs under $750,000 (according to paragraph 13.14.4) to
   EEIC 529. Include in your justification why the requirement is temporary and how you will
   meet it after three years. Return the relocatable building to stock when no longer needed or
   after 3 years, whichever is less. Follow approval levels in AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6.
   13.14.7. SAF/FMBI approves, as an exception, projects not identified in the budget request
   with an installation, test or prototype cost up to $750,000 if you identify justification for their
   urgency (cost penalties, program delays, etc.), subject to New Start rules. Show these projects
   in the next budget submission.
13.15. Installing R&D Equipment. The cost of installing equipment as an integral part of a
new RDT&E facility is construction. You must fund it as construction, except for motor
generator sets, security systems, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), which always fall
under RDT&E or O&M. Equipment not readily severable from the facility is considered part of
the facility. Fund it from the appropriation used to construct the building. (Readily severable
means equipment which can be removed without destroying the equipment or changing the
building's basic structure or purpose.) However, in existing facilities, you may use RDT&E
funds to install, change, or relocate movable equipment for RDT&E activities. Do this only if the
action does not expand the facilities outer dimensions and is for one or more of these specific
requirements:
   13.15.1. Installing and relocating prefabricated interior screens, partitions, and dividers,
   mostly unattached; movable screens or detachable panels held in place by light braces, and
   screws readily removed without impairing either the panels, floors, walls, or ceilings. These
   devices, used to install equipment, do not go on the real property records. For cost categories
   and additional guidance, see AFI 32-9005.
   13.15.2. Installing false floors and platforms required only to support operating equipment.
   Use Chapter 4, Section 4B, Paragraph 4.5 for cost definition and additional guidance.
   13.15.3. Installing required shielding for electromagnetic radiating devices. (However,
   structural modifications, including new permanent partitions incident to the installation of
   shielding, are construction. Also, you must budget and fund all anechoic chambers, whose
   cost exceeds the statutory dollar limit for minor construction (now $750,000), from the
   MILCON appropriation.
 268                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   13.15.4. Temporarily removing and reinstalling parts of existing walls, roofs, utility systems,
   and appurtenances, to permit installation of equipment. This may involve rerouting or
   relocating systems and appurtenances but may not increase the physical outer dimensions.
   13.15.5. Installing special foundations, pits, pads, or slab-on-grade in facilities. Limit
   installations on floors other than slab-on-grade to bases needed to spread the load and secure
   equipment. Increasing the load-bearing capacity of these floors by additional or larger
   structural components is construction.
   13.15.6. Secondary utility work, needed to connect the equipment to utilities services
   already in the facility. This work lies between the utilities' primary entry or source within the
   structure and the equipment to be served; for example, from the existing main electrical
   service panel, or for equipment requiring primary voltage from the building primary bus.
   Include structural provisions (conduit or cavity runs) for known requirements in the project
   design to avoid later structural damage during installation after the fact.
13.16. Installing Air Conditioning. Use RDT&E:
   13.16.1. Only for equipment spaces directly related to the equipment and not in associated
   administrative or other work spaces. Projects for air conditioning of administrative or other
   work space are construction. When possible, use an extension or expansion of a central plant
   to provide air conditioning under these circumstances. This may include extending the duct
   work, direct expansion systems, or the chilled water systems by installing new water lines
   and new air handling units.
   13.16.2. For equipment that the manufacturer states must be operating in an air-conditioned
   or humidity-controlled space.
   13.16.3. For prefabricated clean rooms installed in non-air conditioned space or when the
   building's central system can not keep the clean room at the right temperature and humidity.
   13.16.4. For operator comfort when the equipment to be installed will make the nearby
   temperature or humidity unreasonably high.
   13.16.5. Mechanical ventilation and separate exhaust systems, when needed to keep people
   safe or equipment operating to the manufacturer's specifications.
13.17. Funding Criteria. Before authorizing the type of work specified in paragraphs 13.15
through 13.17 using RDT&E funds, make sure the project meets all these criteria:
   13.17.1. The equipment or facility project must support an approved RDT&E effort.
   13.17.2. Resources must be available.
   13.17.3. Preliminary engineering must be complete.
   13.17.4. The Air Force must submit and the Congress approve a DD Form 1391, FY 20__
   Military Construction Project Data, (appropriate funds). For forms 1391 showing you
   expect to use prior-year funding (fallout money), include Congressional advisory notices:
   "We expect to construct this building with FY ___ (prior year) funding, starting 30 days after
   submittal of this budget request unless the subcommittee disapproves in writing."
13.18. Approving RDT&E Funds:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   269


   13.18.1. Unspecified Minor Construction. Usually, you acquire or modify facilities at an
   R&D installation using programming procedures in AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032. The
   threshold is $750,000. For projects above this threshold, submit appropriate DD 1391s for
   approval and funding using P-341 or MILCON procedures. Follow AFI 32-1021, 1032, and
   1023. If you are planning to construct a building and install specialized RDT&E equipment
   acquired with RDT&E funds at the same time, include the construction and equipment on the
   same DD Form 1391, according to AFI 32-1021. For budget estimate submissions, you may
   consolidate and submit all unspecified minor construction on a single DD Form 1391.
   13.18.2. Contractor Research and Development on Plant Property. Get approval for
   industrial and R&D facilities needed by contractors to perform R&D contacts as specified in
   AFI 63-609. SAF/AQXR is the HQ USAF office of primary responsibility (OPR) for all
   industrial and R&D facilities supporting contractor operations except for the Lincoln
   Laboratory. Process equipment installation projects for the Lincoln Laboratory according to
   this instruction.
   13.18.3. Acquiring and installing RDT&E Equipment. (See paragraph 13.16)
   13.18.4. The Commander of AFMC may:
       13.18.4.1. Approve a project clearly within the intent of paragraphs 13.15.1 and 13.16
       provided the construction cost is $750,000 or less.
       13.18.4.2. Approve any project described in paragraphs 13.15.2, 13.15.3 or 13.15.6
       with a cost of $750,000 or less for construction.
       13.18.4.3. Delegate in writing all or part of the approval to particular senior staff
       officers, intermediate commanders, and laboratory directors.
   13.18.5. SAF/FMBI must approve any project not clearly within the intent of paragraphs
   13.15 and 13.16
13.19. Responsibilities of SAF/IEI. Authorize the transmission to the appropriate
congressional committees of the Title 10 real property acquisition reports, as prescribed by 10
U.S.C. 2662. Approve all facility leases including non-excess Air Force controlled real property,
as well as the consideration or rental to be charged for leases.
13.20. Responsibilities of HQ AFMC and HQ AFSPC:
   13.20.1. Implement this instruction.
   13.20.2. Oversee projects authorized under this instruction to make sure they comply with
   Air Force guidance. The civil engineer must be involved with the users (laboratories, center,
   divisions, etc.).
   13.20.3. Review, validate, and approve (or obtain SAF/FMBI approval for) using RDT&E
   funds within the intent of this instruction. Make sure a DD Form 1391, Military
   Construction Project Data, is prepared for each project not within the $750,000 threshold or
   not within local approval authority. You may consolidate unspecified minor construction less
   than $750,000 on one Form 1391. You may approve projects costing less than $15,000 on
   other auditable documents.
 270                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   13.20.4. Submit DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, to AF/A7CC. Submit
   annually on 15 June unless directed otherwise. For construction planned on an incremental
   funding basis, you must justify less than full funding.
   13.20.5. Advise the Air Staff Program Element Monitor (PEM) of the construction
   requirements for the PEM's program and recommend appropriate funding (MILCON or
   RDT&E) under this instruction. If you recommend RDT&E for construction exceeding
   $750,000, document the unusual circumstances and convenience of the Government, which
   warrant using RDT&E.
13.21. Accounting Records:
   13.21.1. Account for work done under this instruction that becomes real property on real
   property records. Refer to AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting.
   13.21.2. In the real property account, do not include the cost to install and replace R&D
   equipment; to build structures that are to be destroyed or consumed in a test; or to acquire
   relocatable facilities. AFI 32-9005 tells how to account for real property records.
   13.21.3. Show technical operating equipment on the Chief of Supply accountable records. It
   is considered collateral equipment. At the time a facility is transferred to the real property
   records, transfer all collateral equipment to the Chief of Supply, who, in turn, reissues the
   equipment to the property custodian. For guidance, see AFI 32-9005 and AFMAN 23-110.
13.22. Disposing of Records. Maintain records of past and projected use of RDT&E funds to
inform OSD and Congress. HQ AFMC will record all uses above local approval of RDT&E
funds for construction and equipment installation, broken out by program elements if possible.
―For disposition of these records, follow the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
13.23. Environmental Certification:
   13.23.1. You must consider environment impact in planning and designing each. See AFI
   32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
   13.23.2. You must have a completed EIAP action on all projects, regardless of approval
   authority, before starting work. For all projects above local (Product, Test and Air Logistic
   Complex Commander) approval authority, submit an environmental certificate of compliance
   (DD Form 1391c) to HQ AFMC/CEP or HQ AFSPC/CEP before beginning work.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    271


                                          Chapter 14

                                 TEST AND EVALUATION

14.1. Applying This Chapter. This chapter provides additional guidance to DoD FMR
7000.14-R, , Volume 2A, Chapter 1 and DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base
(MRTFB). The procedures in this chapter take precedence over others in this instruction for test
and evaluation. Follow Chapter 13 for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E),
incremental programming and budgeting rules. Determination of proper funding for Test and
Evaluation activities is dependent upon the purpose of the test.
14.2. Funding Test and Evaluation (T&E) Costs.
   14.2.1. Finance development prototypes, pilot line production, and test articles based on the
   purpose of the test as follows:
       14.2.1.1. Use RDT&E to fund for development (preproduction) prototypes for
       Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and operational testing that support or result
       in full-rate production (FRP) or acceptance for operational use (i.e., fielding). Note: The
       types of operational testing and all derivatives are defined in AFI 99-103 and
       Attachment 1).
       14.2.1.2. Use RDT&E to pay for initial pilot line production if the testing activity
       requires special pilot items for DT&E and operational testing that supports or results in a
       FRP or acceptance for operational use. See paragraph 8.24 for pilot production
       guidance.
       14.2.1.3. Use Procurement funds to acquire test articles for any type of operational
       testing that does not support FRP or fielding.
       14.2.1.4. Use Procurement and O&M-type funds to reconfigure RDT&E-financed
       preproduction articles reassigned for operations or inventory after the test program is
       complete (see paragraph 8.8).
   14.2.2. Pay for special support costs needed for an approved DT&E, QT&E, qualification
   test, PAT&E, or operational test for a different military end item as follows: ("Special
   support" costs consist of major end items not included in the Consolidated Sustainment
   Activity Group – Supply of the Air Force WCF, such as weapons, test vehicles, equipment,
   or their major components.)
       14.2.2.1. Generally, use RDT&E to buy test articles and test support. Include costs for
       "special support" and "command support" for all tests before and leading to acceptance
       for operational use.
       14.2.2.2. Items reassigned from inventory to support T&E shall be paid as follows:
       (Items otherwise approved for procurement for operational use and not consumed in
       testing.)
           14.2.2.2.1. Use program or test funds to reimburse for such items (excluding items
           within the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply) of the Air Force
           WCF.
272                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


         14.2.2.2.2. If an operational requirement develops during the loan period, the item
         must be returned to inventory or a replacement bought with program funds.
         14.2.2.2.3. The test director provides for maintenance (other than Permanent
         Modification changes) without interfering with the test purposes.
         14.2.2.2.4. Use RDT&E funds to pay for restoring these items to their original form
         and condition when they go back to operational inventory after completing the DT&E
         or operational testing that supports a FRP or acceptance for operational use.
         14.2.2.2.5. Then, use Procurement or O&M-type funds to update the items to
         operating form.
      14.2.2.3. Items consumed in DT&E or operational testing that supports a FRP or
      acceptance for operational use shall be paid with RDT&E funds; however, do not
      reimburse for consumable rounds of ammunition or tactical missiles (items bought in
      quantity for inventory under existing procedures and issued based on priority for testing),
      unless DWCF funds paid for them.
      14.2.2.4. Use RDT&E for items requiring engineering, design, integration, test, or
      evaluation before FRP, fielding, or acceptance for operational use.
  14.2.3. Implementing commands must use RDT&E funds to acquire major test vehicles,
  such as ballistic boosters or upper stages (either ―standardized‖ as test vehicles or bought
  centrally for operational use or inventory). These vehicles must support an approved
  program for developmental testing which RDT&E is paying for.
  14.2.4. Pay for flying hours as follows:
      14.2.4.1. The owning command pays for aircraft flying hours and support (see exception
      below). (The program document for the command that ―owns‖ the aircraft shows
      authorized test and evaluation flying hours.)
      14.2.4.2. Use program or test funds to reimburse maintenance costs per flying hour at the
      base-level.
      14.2.4.3. Exception: Follow the guidance in DoDD 3200.11 for flying-hour support
      provided by designated DoD major ranges and test facilities. Follow paragraph 14.3.5.1
      for Air Mobility Command (AMC) TWCF aircraft not used as the primary test vehicle.
  14.2.5. Reimburse direct costs for support from designated RDT&E and test activities (See
  Chapter 7, Section 7I), regardless of the other provisions of this chapter. (See guidance on
  designated support activities for test and evaluation in DoDD 3200.11 and AFI 99-103.)
  14.2.6. Use Procurement or O&M funds, as appropriate, to pay for testing not associated
  with RDT&E, such as:
      14.2.6.1. Acceptance, quality control, WSEP, tactics development and evaluation
      (TD&E), and surveillance testing of articles obtained for purposes other than RDT&E.
      14.2.6.2. Routine testing for logistic support.
      14.2.6.3. Testing related to operating and maintaining equipment and material bought
      under appropriations other than RDT&E.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 273


      14.2.6.4. Testing needed to show a plant can produce items approved for production
      (charge to Procurement as part of the initial acquisition cost).
   14.2.7. Use O&M or Procurement funds (based upon Expense/Investment criteria) to fund
   commercial and non-developmental items which do not require RDT&E engineering, design
   or integration. Pay for personnel and command support costs from O&M when field units
   test and evaluate operation of commercial items for doctrine, operations, or organization.
   14.2.8. Apply guidance in paragraph 14.2.6 for all operational testing conducted after
   accepting an item for operational use. Also apply it for operational tests showing how the
   item operates or to develop operational tactics.
      14.2.8.1. Use O&M or Procurement funds (based on expense/investment criteria) to
      acquire test articles.
      14.2.8.2. Use O&M for personnel and command support.
   14.2.9. Use Procurement funds (subject to expense/investment criteria) to buy off-the-shelf
   equipment. But use RDT&E if the equipment supports RDT&E-funded T&E. Also, use
   RDT&E for items, including special purpose software, that require engineering design,
   integration, testing, or evaluation.
   14.2.10. Use RDT&E for DT&E and operational testing of special-purpose equipment and
   software for automatic data processing (equipment or software) prior to FRP or acceptance
   for operational use:
      14.2.10.1. Specially designed to meet a military operational requirement or to do only a
      predetermined set or series of computations.
      14.2.10.2. Which may need to meet specific physical or environmental conditions.
      14.2.10.3. Which may physically or functionally integral to a higher order system.
      14.2.10.4. Use O&M or Procurement funds (based on expense/investment criteria) to
      buy and test these items after acceptance for operational use.
   14.2.11. See Chapter 4, Section 4B, for funding general-purpose equipment and software
   used in automatic data processing.
14.3. Funding for Operational Testing.
   14.3.1. Types of Funds. Except when this chapter states otherwise, tests conducted by
   operational test organizations (i.e., the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
   (AFOTEC) and MAJCOM operational test organizations) in support of FRP or fielding are
   paid with RDT&E. QOT&E is funded with O&M or Procurement funds through regular
   O&M or Procurement channels. (See Chapters 1 and 5 of DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2.)
   14.3.2. Test Items:
      14.3.2.1. The developing or owning command pays the cost of procuring the test item
      and its direct support based on the purpose of the test. Direct support, funded either by
      the operational or implementing command, includes maintaining the test item (including
      contractor support), supply items to keep the test item serviceable, and POL for the test
      item.
 274                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   14.3.3. Operational Test Organization Support of Operational Testing. Operational test
   organizations (i.e., AFOTEC and MAJCOM operational testers) will use O&M to support the
   following operational test activities:
       14.3.3.1. Administering operational test organization policies and programs.
       14.3.3.2. Analyzing test results not related to specific programs.
       14.3.3.3. Supporting scientific, technical, planning, or analytical work under contract but
       not related to specific programs.
   14.3.4. Implementing Command Support to Operational Testing. The implementing
   command uses O&M or RDT&E funds to pay its own travel, per diem, overtime, and other
   support costs. This does not apply to AFMC or AFSPC organizations involved with the
   program office or acquisition process that provide technical support to the test, such as the
   Air Force Human Resource Laboratory (AFHRL).
   14.3.5. Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF) Support to T&E.
       14.3.5.1. Use as a Test Vehicle. If one of AMC‘s TWCF aircraft is required for a
       dedicated test role, AMC, as owning command, will provide the aircraft without
       reimbursement from test funds based on the purpose of the test. An example would be an
       aircraft required to airdrop test material or fly approaches to a test navigational aid
       (NAVAID). HQ AMC budgets and funds for flying hours dedicated to T&E (i.e., SAAM
       missions).
       14.3.5.2. Use to Transport Test Articles or People. Pay transportation costs from
       appropriate funds when airlift must move test articles or people. Request support through
       the airlift validator command or agency.
   14.3.6. Post-test Costs. When AFOTEC-conducted IOT&E or OUE is over, AFOTEC will
   continue to use RDT&E funds for any additional operational testing (i.e., FOT&E) that
   occurs as a result of test reports and decision briefings. After AFOTEC involvement ends,
   the operating or supporting command conducts and finances operational testing based on the
   purpose of the test.
   14.3.7. Personnel Pay Costs. Use RDT&E or O&M (based on the nature of the test) to
   reimburse overtime and pay temporary overhires directly supporting the test for operations,
   such as ranges. Do not use RDT&E or O&M to reimburse supporting commands regular
   base pay (base and benefits) of permanently authorized personnel.
14.4. Funding Qualification Tests and PAT&E Tests. Use Procurement appropriations to pay
for these tests (including verification of technical data) performed during the production cycle
(or when you do not have RDT&E funding). The implementing command pays TDY costs with
O&M funds.
14.5. Budgeting and Funding DT&E. The implementing command budgets and funds DT&E
requirements with RDT&E funds as part of the total development budget for weapon system.
QT&E is funded with Procurement funds if the item is still in production, or O&M funds if the
item is no longer in production.
14.6. Budgeting and Funding for Operational Testing:
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   275


  14.6.1. AFOTEC and MAJCOM operational test organizations will fund operational test
  requirements for assigned programs via the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and
  budget submissions. There are two exceptions: a) AFOTEC identifies requirements for MFP
  XI funded operational testing to USSOCOM, who is responsible for POM and budget
  submissions; and b) case-by-case exceptions where large operational test programs
  (approximately $8M) are concerned. In the year of execution, if the test organization has not
  programmed and/or budgeted for the test activity, program funding may be used to conduct
  and/or support testing as required by the test organization. Program funding will further be
  available to conduct and/or support testing of block upgrades and major modifications to
  fielded systems when such testing is assigned to MAJCOMs and the upgrades and
  modifications are managed by the acquisition or sustainment program offices. In these cases,
  the test organizations will submit funding estimates to the respective program offices when
  test requirements are levied. This shall not become the standard practice and does not
  alleviate Test Organization responsibility to POM for resources to support their known
  requirements.
  14.6.2. For large operational test programs only: HQ USAF/TER, SAF/AQX, SAF/FMB,
  AFOTEC, and program office representatives will review each large operational test program
  during POM development. AFOTEC will bring the issue into the Air Force Corporate
  Process in their POM. The outcome of this effort will result in programming of operational
  test funding requirements, lead-time away, into the correct Program Element (PE). The final
  independent assessment for determining the organization responsible for funding the test
  program will reside with SAF/FMB. For remaining programs, operational test funding
  requirements will be identified budget lead-time away to the operational test organization to
  be included in their POM submission. Otherwise, funding must accompany the test program
  for the operational test organization to conduct the testing. Additionally, if there are
  additional operational testing costs as a result of program slippage or deferments, the
  customer must provide additional funding as appropriate. HQ USAF/TER will confirm that
  operational test funding levels in the POM and Budget Estimate Submission exercises are
  adequate, and identify any shortfalls to SAF/AQXR to ensure proper programming.
  14.6.3. If an operational test team member requires Type I factory training (as defined in
  AFI 36-2201, Volume 2, Training Development, Delivery and Evaluation) to meet test team
  requirements, the acquisition or development agency will provide funding to Air Education
  and Training Command (AETC) irrespective of any follow-on benefits the training might
  provide. This includes the contract cost itself and related TDY. Type I training will be
  funded with O&M appropriations for QOT&E and MAJCOM-operational testing in support
  of O&M-funded activities. If a separate training contract is impractical, the program
  manager may include Type I training as a line item in the acquisition contract, as provided in
  AFI 36-2201.
  14.6.4. When combining DT&E and operational testing, the implementing command
  programs and budgets the DT&E portion. The operational test organization will program and
  budget net additive costs for operational testing that support those activities assigned to the
  operational tester in the T&E Master Plan (TEMP) and associated Test Resource Plan (TRP).
  14.6.5. In determining the type(s) of funding for operational testing for budget formulation,
  use the scheduled major production or acceptance for operational use date directed when
  preparing field budget submissions. In general, use RDT&E funds prior to acceptance for
 276                                                        AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   operational use, to include block upgrades and major modifications managed by the
   acquisition or sustainment program office, and use O&M or Procurement funds after
   acceptance for operational use. For programs using an EA strategy (i.e., fielding increments
   of capability), fund test costs based on the purpose of the test(s) for each increment. For
   programs that do not have major production or acceptance for operational use decisions, use
   the net additive costs for operational testing as determined by the operational test
   organization(s) for planning, budgeting and funding.

   This includes (but is not limited to) using:
       15.4.1.1. Air Force procurement appropriations to fund investment type items.
       (Examples are aircraft spares, vehicular equipment, base support equipment, etc.)
       15.4.1.2. Military Personnel, Air Force appropriation (57*3500) to fund pay and
       allowances of active Air Force personnel assigned to support the Air Force Reserve.
       15.4.1.3. Air Force O&M (57*3400) to fund Environmental Restoration Account (ERA)
       support for Air Force Reserve units.
   15.4.2. The Air Force finances without reimbursement O&M costs associated with Air Force
   centrally controlled education and training courses provided by Air University and Air
   Education and Training Command. Reimburse organizational equipment issued to
   individuals or units (for example, field jackets).
15.5. Preparing Budget Estimates and Financial Plans. The Chief of Air Force Reserve will
develop, justify, and present annual budget estimates and execution plans for budget program
720 within the Reserve Personnel, Air Force appropriation, and all budget programs within the
O&M USAFR, and military construction, USAFR appropriations. The Directorate of Personnel
 280                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


Programs (AF/A1G) and Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SGHP) will perform these functions for
budget program 780 of the Reserve Personnel appropriation.
15.6. Supporting AFRC Conversions. The active Air Force gaining command funds TDY
costs for Air Force augmentees who support USAFR conversions.
15.7. Funding Call-up to Active Duty (10 U.S.C. 12302):
   15.7.1. Accession, Separation Travel, and Per Diem. Charge the cost of officer and

                 AIR NATIONAL GUARD (ANG) APPROPRIATIONS

16.1. Supporting the ANG. Three major funding sources support the ANG:
   16.1.1. Funds appropriated by Congress for the ANG: National Guard Personnel, Air Force
   (57*3850); Operation and Maintenance, ANG (57*3840); and the Military Construction,
   ANG (57*3830) appropriations.
   16.1.2. Other Air Force appropriations, which support the ANG on either a reimbursable or
   nonreimbursable basis. If the active Air Force and ANG activities disagree whether Air Force
   support costs are reimbursable or nonreimbursable, SAF/FMB will make the final decision.
   16.1.3. Resources provided by the sovereign states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the
   Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia for their respective ANG activities.
16.2. Using National Guard Personnel, Air Force Appropriation (57*3850):
   16.2.1. Use 57*3850 to fund pay, allowances, clothing, subsistence, gratuities, and travel.
   You also use this appropriation for expenses of ANG personnel on duty under 10 U.S.C.
   12301(d); for expenses under 32 U.S.C. 708; and for expenses of personnel undergoing
   active duty training or performing inactive duty training as authorized by law.
   16.2.2. The Air Force provides personnel support by assigning active duty personnel to
   ANG activities. Charge the pay and allowances of these active duty Air Force personnel to
   the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation (57*3500).
   16.2.3. To determine whether to finance ANG training costs from the National Guard
   Personnel, Air Force (57*3850) or MILPERS, Air Force (57*3500) appropriation, apply
   these rules:
      16.2.3.1. If the purpose of ANG participation is to meet Air National Guard personnel
      training requirements, charge the costs to the National Guard Personnel, Air Force,
      appropriation.
      16.2.3.2. If the purpose of the participation is to support active Air Force mission
      requirements, charge the costs to the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation. But, you should
      charge any per diem entitlements at the principal duty station, (as well as travel costs
      incurred in the performance of TDY away from the principal duty station) to the O&M,
      Air Force, funds of the active duty Air Force activity being supported.
      16.2.3.3. Deleted.    16.2.3.4. The Air Force finances O&M costs associated with Air

          from funds transferred from the trust fund.
   16.2.5. Use applicable fund citations in active duty or training orders for pay and
   allowances, travel, and transportation costs. The general rule is that you charge expenses to
   the fiscal year (FY) appropriation current when the government incurs the expenses.
   Therefore, if services or travel and transportation cover parts of 2 fiscal years, you charge the
   total costs in part to both appropriations (see DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for
   Obligations for criteria and DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel
   Accounting Operations for using dual citations).

          16.3.2.2.12. Support of ANG units performing Air Force missions as governed by
          Chapter 7.
16.4. Basis for Reimbursing for Depot Maintenance. This paragraph explains how the ANG
reimburses the Air Force for depot maintenance support.
   16.4.1. The ANG O&M appropriation reimburses the CSAG-Mx Division of the Defense
   Working Capital Fund (DWCF) for depot-level support in these areas:
       16.4.1.1. Aircraft maintenance.
       16.4.1.2. Engine overhaul.
       16.4.1.3. Other major end items repair.
       16.4.1.4. Area support.
       16.4.1.5. Service engineering.
   16.4.2. Accomplish reimbursement for the items shown above as follows:
       16.4.2.1. Aircraft maintenance, other major end item repair (except generators), and area
       support are funded by direct cite. Therefore, the ANG issues funds by RC/CC, PEC,
       EEIC, and program control number (PCN) to the Air National Guard Readiness Center
       (ANGRC), ADSN 415300, Stop 18, Andrews AFB DC 20331-6008. ANGRC, in turn,
       issues AF Forms 185, Project Order, to the Air Logistic Complexs (ALC), who then
       signs and return them to ANGRC. These signed project orders obligate the ANG funds.
       The ANGRC then disburses the direct cite funds upon receipt of the SF 1080 billings,
       providing sufficient funds have been obligated by RC/CC or PCN. For backup
       information, when work is ordered through the ALC, ANG funds are reflected by the Air
       Force Materiel Command (AFMC) on AFMC Form 181, Project Orders, and on AFMC
       Form 194, Annual Customer Orders. The ALC will forward information copies of these
       forms (annotated by PCN) to ANGRC as evidence of actions taken toward accomplishing
       the work orders.
       16.4.2.2. The ANG reimburses the DWCF for engine overhaul, generators, exchangeable
       repairs, and service engineering. Therefore, the ANG issues funds directly to the ALC
       using an ANG assigned OAC/OBAN. Specific instructions for each area follow:
          16.4.2.2.1. Engine Overhaul. On a monthly basis, OC-ALC/ACFSA furnishes engine
          managers at Oklahoma City ALC (OC-ALC) the reimbursable customer engine input
          report that provides quantities, by type/model/series, of the engines scheduled into
          work, by customer. OC-ALC/ACFSA will charge monthly for the standard
          reimbursable unit cost for each engine input against funding received from the ANG.
          This standard cost is composed of the current DWCF engine unit sales price plus the
          repair cost of its related exchange material.
          16.4.2.2.2. Generators. The annual requirement, as estimated by AFMC, is made
          available at the beginning of the fiscal year. Accept bills as the work is performed.
          16.4.2.2.3. Sustaining Engineering. The ANG budgets for its pro rata share of the
          total sustaining engineering cost based on data provided by AFMC. HQ AFMC
          identifies to the ALCs reimbursable line items and planning costs for the ANG, at the
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                             287


         beginning of the FY, based on the estimated annual requirement. The ANG issues
         funding directly for all Sustaining Engineering costs.
         16.4.2.2.4. The Air Directorate, National Guard Bureau, prepares, submits and
         justifies budget estimates to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Office of
         Management and Budget.
16.5. Supporting ANG Conversions. The active Air Force gaining command will fund TDY
costs for Air Force augmentees who support ANG conversions.
 288                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012

                           SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

17.1. The Security Assistance (SA) program is composed of six major components: Foreign
Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS),
International Military Education and Training (IMET), Economic Support Fund (ESF), and
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). Other related SA programs are leases to friendly governments,
selling defense articles declared to be excess to foreign nations, emergency drawdowns, and
third-country transfers. For additional information, see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 15,
Security Assistance Policy and Procedures.
   17.1.1. FMS is a non-appropriated program through which eligible foreign governments
   purchase defense articles, services, and training from the U.S. Government. FMS are made
   under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended.
   17.1.2. FMF consists of congressionally appropriated grants and loans, which enable foreign
   governments to purchase U.S. defense articles, services, and training through either FMS or
   DCS. FMS are made under the authority of the Arms Export control Act of 1976, as
   amended.
   17.1.3. DCS are sales made by U.S. industry directly to a foreign buyer. DCS are licensed by
   the Department of State. The Department of Defense does not administer the DCS program.
   17.1.4. IMET provides training of selected foreign military and related civilian personnel in
   the U.S. and, in some cases, in overseas U.S. military facilities. The training is accomplished
   on a grant basis. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, authorizes IMET.
   17.1.5. ESF promotes economic and political stability in foreign areas where the U.S. has
   political and security interests. The Department of Defense does not administer the ESF
   program.
   17.1.6. PKO provides funds for Multinational Forces and Observers. The Department of
   Defense does not administer the PKO program.
17.2. FMS Trust Fund and Antideficiency Act. The Secretary of the Air Force General
Counsel (SAF/GC) has determined that FMS trust funds are appropriated, at least as far as the
application of the Antideficiency Act is concerned. The determination stated that ". . . .
appropriated funds are not limited to those appropriated by Congress to federal agencies from the
general fund of the Treasury. Rather, funds available to agencies are considered appropriated, if
made available for collection and expenditure pursuant to specific statutory authority.
Transactions which involve FMS trust funds can constitute violations of the Antideficiency Act."
Issues involving FMS monies need to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into
account all relevant aspects of each case for application of the Antideficiency Act. DoDFMR
7000.14-R, Vol 15, Ch 3 031101 states "appropriated funds are not limited to those funds
specifically appropriated by the Congress to federal agencies from the general fund of the U.S.
Treasury. Funds available to agencies are considered appropriated, regardless of their source, if
made available for collection and expenditure pursuant to specific statutory authority. In
applying the Anti-Deficiency Act, the FMS Trust Fund is considered to be, and is to be treated
as, appropriated funds."

                    DEFENSE WORKING CAPITAL FUND (DWCF)

Section 18A—General Guidance

18.1. Defense Working Capital Funds (DWCF) Overview:
   18.1.1. Purpose of DWCF:
      18.1.1.1. DoD expanded the use of businesslike financial management practices through
      the creation of the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) on 1 October 1991 (FY
      92). Defense Management Report Decision (DMRD) 971, DoD Financial Systems,
      established the DBOF and provided the foundation for operational policies and
      procedures. The Defense Working Capital Funds (DWCF) were established in 1996 and
      built on the DBOF foundation. DWCF operates with financial principles that provide
      improved cost visibility and accountability to enhance business management and improve
      the decision making process. The DWCF builds on revolving fund principles previously
      used for industrial and commercial-type activities. Successful implementation of the
      DWCF is essential to achievement of the following DMR initiatives: 1) consolidating like
      functions, 2) increasing cost visibility, and 3) realizing significant monetary savings
      through better business practices.
      18.1.1.2. The establishment of the DWCF does not change previous organizational
      reporting structures or command authority relationships. Combining business activities
      under a single Treasury Code (97*4930) allows consolidation of cash management, while
      functional and cost management responsibilities remain with the Military Departments
      and Defense Agencies.
      18.1.1.3. The primary purpose of the DWCF is to provide a business management
      structure that encourages managers and employees of DoD support organizations to
      provide quality products and services at the lowest cost. A major feature of this business
      management structure is increased emphasis on business operations. This business
      operations structure identifies each business area, the products or services, and the total
      cost of operations within that business area.
      18.1.1.4. Under this structure, customers establish requirements and are charged, through
      the rate structure, for the cost of industrial and commercial-type services and products
      provided. Providers, in turn, produce quality goods and services which satisfy customer
      requirements at the lowest cost. Support organizations incur costs based on customer
      orders. This linkage of support costs to customer funding ensures better communication
      between the customer and the provider. By making the producing organization
      responsible for all costs associated with delivering the good or service, those managers
      will identify cost drivers and can focus their management improvement efforts
      accordingly. Better cost visibility enables managers at all levels to make informed
      decisions.
   18.1.2. Additional guidance on DWCF and the former AF Stock/Industrial Funds is in:

      18.1.2.3. DoDI 4000.19.
  18.1.3. Concept of Operations. The DWCF is an expansion of the existing commercial or
  business operations that were previously managed as a revolving fund. The expansion
  included some activities which were not previously financed on a revolving fund basis by
  making them separate business areas. These areas are accounting and finance services,
  industrial plant equipment maintenance and repair, printing services, reutilization and
  marketing services and technical information services. The DWCF eliminates direct
  appropriations for many elements of cost in existing funds. Sales to customers must reflect
  total costs not just direct costs. Replacement of DBOF with DWCF returned cash
  management responsibilities to the Components. Although the Military Departments retain
  control of their respective business areas, the Service's focus is supposed to be on cost
  management. A DWCF Financial Policies Board, chaired by USD(C), has been created, with
  representation from defense agency comptrollers and Service Assistant Secretaries for
  Financial Management. The policy board reviews new procedures to improve operating
  control and identifies new areas for eventual inclusion in the DWCF.
  18.1.4. New Business Areas. Criteria for inclusion of a business area in the DWCF are:
  outputs of the business have been identified; costs of the business area can be related to the
  outputs; and the customers of the business area have been identified. Secretaries of the
  Military Departments may submit applications and supporting justification to authorize new
  DWCF activities or to rescind the authorization of existing DWCF activities. The DoD
  Comptroller authorizes or approves specific DWCF business areas and/or activities and the
  terms under which such business areas and/or activities shall be operated
  18.1.5. DWCF Budgeting.
      18.1.5.1. Operating Budget. The operating budget contains the annual operating costs
      of an activity or Component, including depreciation or amortization expenses. To
      minimize costs within activity groups, all goods and services should be purchased,
      whenever possible, from the source that provides them at least cost, unless there are some
      other considerations such as mobilization or readiness that prohibit this flexibility.
      Direct, indirect and overhead costs are to be included in the evaluation when comparing
      costs of organic or commercial sources.
      18.1.5.2. Capital Budget. A Capital Budget is that portion of the DWCF Budget that
      supports and justifies the purchase of capital assets. Starting in April 2007, the Capital
      Budget includes all items purchased by a revolving fund with a unit cost that equals or
      exceeds the expense/investment threshold established by the Congress, $250,000, and has
      a useful life of more than two years. Public Law 111-383, Section 1403 modified certain
      working capital fund requirements by amending Title 10 U.S.C Section 2208 (refer to
      paragraph 18.6.2.1 of this AFI), including increasing the threshold for unspecified minor
      military construction under Title 10 U.S.C Section 2805 (c)(1) from $100,000 to
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    291


      $250,000. The Capital budget shall not be used to establish a new or to expand organic
      capability except as specifically approved in a capital budget.

Section 18B—Financial Administration of the DWCF

18.2. Issuing and Complying with Budget Authority Documents.
   18.2.1. Unit Cost Goals:
      18.2.1.1. The Office of Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD(C)) uses Unit
      Cost Resourcing (UCR) for DWCF financial management, including cost measurement,
      cost control, and funding allocation. OUSD(C), Air Force and AFMC issue Annual
      Operating Budget (AOB) Documents in the form of unit cost goals, based on approved
      operating and capital budgets.
      18.2.1.2. Some DWCF business areas, such as supply operations, are authorized to incur
      costs while anticipating customer orders.
      18.2.1.3. For other DWCF business areas, such as depot maintenance, costs are
      authorized only after receiving a customer order. The AOB document provides the
      overall cost goal. The total costs you can incur depend on the cost goals applied to the
      actual customer-funded workload.
      18.2.1.4. The Air Force and commands may issue activity goals that vary from the total
      goal for an Activity Group. But, the Air Force may not exceed the sum of its activity
      goals (total cost authority). Cost authority, or the amount "earned", equals the actual
      workload times the individual cost goals for each Activity Group. Individual activities
      and Activity Groups can continue to incur costs as long as the total costs for all Air Force
      Activity Groups do not exceed the total cost authority for that Component as of fiscal
      year end.
   18.2.2. Fiscal Control. Do not exceed the Total Capital Cost limitation in your Cost
   Authority Document, based on Section 1517 of Title 31, United States Code (Antideficiency
   Act). The "Limitations and Guidance" section of your Cost Authority Document identifies
   special limitations, goals and other guidance for each Activity Group.
   18.2.3. Reprogramming:
      18.2.3.1. Operating Budget. The Air Force may reprogram within business areas as
      long as it does not exceed its overall unit cost goal.
      18.2.3.2. Capital Budget:
          18.2.3.2.1. The total annual capital budget approved for each Component by the
          Congress during review of the Fund may only be exceeded to the extent that projects
          which were included in the operating budget based on approved expense/investment
          criteria must be executed as capital budget items due to revised cost estimates.
          Transfer of projects from the operating budget reduces the amount earned in the
          operating budget. Prior approval from OUSD(C) Director of Revolving Funds and
          Office of Management and Budget is required for transfers from Operating Budget to
          Capital Budget. Exceeding the capital budget (the total includes amounts
292                                                      AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      reprogrammed) is an Antideficiency Act violation. (DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume
      2B, Chapter 9, Paragraph 090103.C.7)
      18.2.3.2.2. The Air Force may reprogram capital funds between business areas, but
      the maximum annual increase in any one Activity Group cannot exceed $10 million
      for each type of capital approved in the President's Budget. Except as noted below in
      paragraphs 18.2.3.2.3.2, 18.2.3.2.3.3 and 18.2.3.2.3.4, capital reprogramming requires
      the written approval of the OUSD(C) Director of Revolving Funds. The types of
      capital consist of ADP equipment and telecommunications, non-ADP equipment and
      telecommunications, minor construction, and software development. Reprogramming
      into an Activity Group‘s capital budget from the operating budget does not count
      against the $10 million threshold.
      18.2.3.2.3. Only those capital asset projects that have been included in the Air Force
      President‘s Budget may be financed through the Capital Purchase Program (CPP).
      However, in the year of execution, project substitutions may be made when contracts
      on approved projects are delayed or when operational necessity warrants. The
      following approval levels and dollar threshold apply to changes to projects approved
      in the capital budget section of the AOB, including re-programming, substitutions,
      cancellations and additions:
         18.2.3.2.3.1. All current year adjustments or changes to information technology
         capital projects that are greater than $999,999 must be endorsed by the Defense
         Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC) and approved by the
         Director of Revolving Funds. Requests for changes must be submitted to
         SAF/FMBMR who will determine whether to request approval from the OSD
         Director of Revolving Fund. Do not submit changes or adjustments for these
         projects without certification from the approval authority as directed in the
         guidance and instructions displayed in the ―system compliance‖ section of the
         DBSMC website, http://www.defenselink.mil/dbt/tools_certification.html.
         18.2.3.2.3.2. For each Business Activity Group, all current year adjustment or
         changes to capital projects that are equal to, or greater than by a cumulative
         amount of $3,000,000 during a fiscal year (FY) requires approval from the Office
         of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Director for Revolving Funds.
         18.2.3.2.3.3. For each Business Activity Group, all current year adjustment or
         changes between categories of capital projects (i.e., minor construction,
         equipment, ADP equipment and telecommunications, non-ADP equipment and
         software development) or activity groups that increase a category by a cumulative
         amount equal to, or greater than $3,000,000, within a program year, requires
         approval from the OSD Director of Revolving Funds. If either of these thresholds
         is breached, the OSD Director of Revolving Funds must approve project
         substitutions prior to their initiation. Subdividing of projects is not allowed.
         18.2.3.2.3.4. SAF/FMBMR may approve transfers between categories or among
         their activity groups if the change is less than $3,000,000. However, Activity
         Groups are required to receive SAF/FMBMR approval for transfers between
         categories or among activity groups if the change is equal to, or greater than
         $2,000,000. Additionally, Activity Groups are required to notify SAF/FMBMR
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    293


              of changes less than $2,000,000. This action is required so that SAF/FMBMR
              complies with the requirement to notify the OUSD(C) Director for Revolving
              Funds so that these changes may be documented in the activity group‘s Annual
              Operating Budget document.
              18.2.3.2.3.5. Capital obligation adjustments must be charged to the program year
              cited in the President‘s Budget for the original project. The prior year capital
              investment program limitation is equal to actual obligations at September 30 of
              that fiscal year plus adjustments approved by the Director for Revolving Funds to
              the prior year program. Prior to the end of the fiscal year, fund managers may
              request approval to carryover authority for any unobligated capital projects.
              18.2.3.2.3.6. Capital obligation authority can be adjusted automatically for prior
              year within-scope increases of less than $100,000 provided the unobligated
              balance in the prior fiscal year capital program is sufficient to finance the
              increase. Prior year within-scope increases greater than $100,000 must be
              approved by the OSD(C) Directorate for Revolving Funds. The request should
              propose, when possible, equal offsetting reductions to the current year capital
              authority to finance the prior year increase.
      18.2.3.3. Revisions. You may revise annual budgets whenever circumstances permit
      and your command approves.
18.3. Recovering Full Costs and Setting Prices:
   18.3.1. All Activity Groups in the Fund must set prices to recover full costs, including all
   direct costs, indirect costs, general and administrative support provided by others,
   depreciation expenses, and amortization. Include all costs in the Activity Group's operating
   budget. The budget process will fix prices for the year of execution. All levels of command
   will:
      18.3.1.1. Evaluate actual costs against revenue generated by workload at established
      prices.
      18.3.1.2. Determine profits or losses at the end of the year and use them to evaluate
      operating (financial execution) efficiency.
      18.3.1.3. Some DWCF areas may still have some Imputed (Unfunded) costs, e.g. kits to
      the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M). Imputed costs
      will be tracked, but not in the AF rates. FMS customers will be billed the imputed costs
      per the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 15. Other non-AF customers will be billed per the
      DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A.
   18.3.2. Activity Groups will set prices for the budget year(s) to recover costs over the long
   run. This means you set prices to achieve an Accumulated Operating Result (AOR) in the
   budget year of zero. While carrying out the budget, you will have either a positive or
   negative Net Operating Result (NOR). So, you set prices in the budget year either to make up
   actual or projected losses, or to give back actual or projected gains in the budget year, based
   on such factors as cash position, projected savings initiatives, or other known impact.
   Activity Group prices must match the rate changes approved by OUSD(C) during the budget
   review.
 294                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


18.4. Setting Rates:
   18.4.1. During budgeting, OUSD(C) reviews and approves stable rates to fully recover costs
   in all business areas during that fiscal year. (NOTE: The stabilized rate is the cost per direct
   labor hour (or other output measure) that the depot or business area charges customers for its
   products and services. The stabilized rate is determined by taking the approved Direct Labor
   Hour rate (or other cost per output measure) for the budget year and adjusting it for both
   intra- and inter-Fund transactions to reflect changes in the cost of purchases between Activity
   Groups within the Fund, for prior-year gains or losses shown by the AOR and for other
   approved funding objectives, such as a cash or a capital surcharge.) To set rates, the Fund
   places business areas into two groups:
       18.4.1.1. Supply Management. Use commodity costs with a surcharge to establish
       customer rates. (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2, Chapter 9.)
       18.4.1.2. Non-Supply Management. Use unit cost rates based on identified output
       measures which establish fully cost-burdened rates per output, such as a cost per direct
       labor hour, cost per product, cost per item received, or cost per item shipped, etc. These
       Activity Groups establish their output rates and the stabilized customer rates in generally
       the same way.
   18.4.2. Charge the annual stabilized rate for all new Consolidated Sustainment Activity
   Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M) customer orders received and accepted during that specific
   fiscal year, regardless of the fiscal year you actually do and bill the work. CSAG-Mx
   establishes fixed prices (stabilized rate times standard hours) for planned work.
   Unprogrammed work is priced at stabilized rates times actual direct hours.
   18.4.3. When submitting your budget estimate, develop customer rates to recoup all costs for
   your operating and capital budgets, including all labor and non-labor, direct, indirect, and
   general and administrative overhead costs. After determining required costs and proposed
   rate structures to recover them, the Air Force will adjust budgets for appropriated customer
   accounts so that customer and DWCF business budgets are in balance.
   18.4.4. The Air Force must propose cost, program levels, and rate changes by Activity
   Groups in the budget estimate submission to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
   (OUSD). (Note: the annual published rate change for Activity Groups is the percentage
   change in the stabilized rate or price between fiscal years. For example, for organic Depot
   Maintenance you determine the Budget Year rate by dividing the approved Direct Labor
   Hour rate proposed for the Budget Year by the stabilized Direct Labor Hour rate effective for
   the previous year. That value, expressed as a percentage (plus or minus from a base of one),
   is the composite price-change rate customers will use in their appropriated fund
   submissions.)
       18.4.4.1. AFMC should establish rates and prices for Business Area budgets:
          18.4.4.1.1. Carefully review all projected operational costs for the fiscal year, and
          propose the least expensive operations possible.
          18.4.4.1.2. Project customer requirements including anticipated workloads
          programmed for the budget year, based on identified outputs such as direct labor
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    295


          hours by project, tons shipped, line items received, and all other approved output
          measures for each business area.
          18.4.4.1.3. In developing proposed rates, conform to OSD and OMB guidance on the
          impact of inflation, projected pay changes, and other programmatic and policy
          changes.
       18.4.4.2. OUSD(C) will establish final approved costs, program levels, and rate changes
       for each Activity Group by Resource Management Decision (RMD) documents. First,
       they will reconcile customer account program levels with anticipated Fund costs, inter-
       Fund sales, and transactions. Then, they will adjust for NOR to bring Accumulated
       Operating Results to zero for the Budget Year.
18.5. Applying Depreciation:
   18.5.1. Under the total-cost concept, DWCF activities must track capital investment
   purchases, depreciate them, and pass the charges on to their customers as part of the price of
   goods and services sold. This is done by including the depreciation cost in the sales rate and
   then being recovered like all other costs. Here, a capital investment means anything costing
   in excess of $100,000 that has an expected life of more than two years. Exclude aircraft and
   missile procurement accounts (3010 and 3020) and major construction (3300). (Depreciation
   measures how much of a given resource is consumed in a single year and is part of the total
   cost of producing an output. Depreciation shows that capital assets are useful after the first
   year and often after they are fully depreciated as well.)
   18.5.2. Include assets acquired through the Capital Purchases Program, Asset Capitalization
   Program (ACP), and donated assets, such as those provided as support equipment in
   conjunction with weapon system acquisition or modifications in your depreciation costs.
   18.5.3. Apply straight-line depreciation based on capitalized amount less residual value,
   including installation and related costs. WCF will use the depreciation schedule in the DoD
   FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6. Use this schedule for:
       18.5.3.1. Facilities Construction Projects (including minor construction) – 20 years
       18.5.3.2. Equipment , other than ADPE – 10 years
       18.5.3.3. ADPE, Telecommunications and Software – < 5, 5, or 10 years - depending on
       the actual estimated useful life as used in the acquisition justification.
18.6. Including Costs in the DWCF. Reflect the total cost of production in pricing goods and
services. Total Cost of Production includes all direct costs, overhead costs, and general &
administrative (G&A) costs, and depreciation expenses and amortization (i.e. absorption
accounting). In addition, apply this special guidance.
   18.6.1. Capability Based Budgeting. Capability Based Budgeting is a means to set
   requirements that need to be met rather than precisely specifying the means to meet the
   requirements. It allows for a degree of uncertainty that is to be resolved later in the design
   process. It is particularly pertinent to information technology equipment and software.
   Current information technology control processes involve defining the architecture of the
   required function or product, with defined requirements, but without overly specific detail of
   how the function or process will be done. Budgeting for capabilities differs from the
   standard specific budgeting historically performed by the Department. DoD FMR 7000.14-
296                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


  RVolume 2B, Chapter 9 authorizes the use of Capability Based Budgeting in Defense
  Working Capital Fund Capital programs. The application of Capability Based Budgeting
  must receive prior approval from SAF/FMBMR.
  18.6.2. Capital Budget:
      18.6.2.1. You must separately identify budgetary resources for capital investments in an
      approved capital budget and amortize or depreciate their costs over a predetermined
      period. Capital investments include all items purchased by a revolving fund with a unit
      cost that equals or exceeds the expense/investment threshold established by Congress and
      has a useful life of more than two years, per DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter
      9. Categories include: Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), Non-ADPE
      Equipment, Automated Data Processing Software, and Minor Construction. You must
      fully reflect depreciation of capital equipment in the operating costs and rates of Fund
      businesses. Public Law 111-383, Section 1403 modified certain working capital fund
      requirements by amending Title 10 U.S.C Section 2208, including increasing the
      threshold for unspecified minor military construction under Title 10 U.S.C Section 2805
      (c)(1) from $100,000 to $250,000. Title 10 U.S.C Section 2208 (k)(2) addresses the
      following capital assets (A) unspecified minor military construction project under Title
      10 U.S.C Section 2805 (c)(1), (B) automatic data processing equipment or software, (C)
      any other equipment, and (D) any other capital improvement.
      18.6.2.2. Depreciate software development and modernization costs incurred by Fund
      activities for projects installed and operational after October 1 of a specific fiscal year.
      Start depreciation in the month the project is installed and operational (even though it
      may not be used in operations that month). Depreciate incremental deliveries of these
      projects if the cost of the delivery exceeds $100,000. Usually, a central design activity
      (CDA) improves software based on a reimbursable order from the individual activity,
      functional Activity Group, or corporate level. Whether accomplished by an in-house or
      contractor CDA, you must fully fund the order placed with the design activity; i.e., the
      order must reflect the total cost of the improvement included in the funded order, rather
      than incremental funding over a number of years. Apply the full funding rule to any
      orders to or from a DWCF activity.
      18.6.2.3. Improvements to Real Property which are greater than or equal to $20,000 will
      be capitalized. Improvements to Real Property are funded by either the operating budget
      or capital budget depending upon the classification of work and amount. Efforts
      classified as construction projects and costing from $20,000 but less than $250,000 will
      be funded with operating funds; and $750,000 and above will be funded with MILCON.
      Depreciate them according to paragraph 18.5
      18.6.2.4. See paragraph 18.7 for appropriation-funded capital assets.
      18.6.2.5. Do not use the capital budget to establish a new (or to expand) organic
      capability except as approved in a capital budget. NOTE: If the new or expanded organic
      capability is due to a new or expanded weapon system/capability, refer to paragraph
      18.7.9
      18.6.2.6. DWCF activities must derive resources needed for new capital assets mainly
      from depreciating DWCF assets. With OUSD(C) approval, and when necessary to fund
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  297


     the approved capital investment, you may include a capital-purchase surcharge to pay for
     whatever depreciation does not cover.
  18.6.3. Civilian Labor. Include compensation and benefits for civilians assigned to a
  DWCF activity. Also include payments to the Department of Labor for injuries and damages
  to DWCF employees.
  18.6.4. Incentive Program for Voluntary Separation of Civilians. Finance and include in
  stabilized rates the cost of incentives for assigned civilian employees to separate unless you
  must offer them because of directed base realignment and closure. If the offering results from
  a base realignment and closure, pay the civilian separation incentive from the appropriate
  Base Realignment and Closure Account.
  18.6.5. Costs for Military Personnel:
     18.6.5.1. You must reimburse Military Personnel's centrally managed account (CMA)
     for military people assigned to DWCF. Use the civilian equivalency rates provided by
     OUSD Comptroller. NOTE: This is not applicable to the Transportation Working Capital
     Fund (TWCF).
  18.6.6. Temporary Duty (TDY) and Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel and
  Transportation. Finance the cost of civilian and military TDY for people assigned to the
  DWCF. The gaining DWCF business area pays for PCS transportation civilian employees,
  their dependents, and household goods. Pay PCS costs resulting from a directed base
  realignment and closure action from the appropriate Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
  Account.
  18.6.7. Transportation. Finance transportation costs (FDT and SDT) for DWCF property
  in the DWCF. Follow Table 18.1 through Table 18.3
  18.6.8. Materiel and Supplies. Include the cost of expense materiel consumed in the
  performance of the DWCF activity's mission (both in-house and government furnished
  materiel (GFM) to contractors). Charge the DWCF operating account for expense materiel
  (non-procurement funded materiel). This includes inventory adjustments, price revisions, and
  noncreditable returns.
  18.6.9. Tools and Equipment. For organic depot maintenance, you will charge and
  expense the costs of tools and equipment having a unit value less than $250,000, regardless
  of life expectancy, to the applicable DWCF accounting classification. When the unit cost of
  tools and equipment is $250,000 or more and their useful life is more than 2 years, the
  DWCF will pay for, capitalize, and depreciate the item.
  18.6.10. Contractual Services:
     18.6.10.1. In-House. Include the cost of work done under contract to accomplish
     mission projects, and other services procured on a reimbursable basis from other
     government activities. Include G&A costs, equipment rental, communications, utilities,
     training, printing and reproduction, custodial services, and other contractual service the
     DWCF activity requires.
     18.6.10.2. Contracts or Services From Other Government Agencies. This includes
     work agreed to by an authorized official of a private firm or another government agency
     that can do the DWCF work. Use the appropriate government contracting process.
 298                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       18.6.10.3. Contractual Service Requirements. When CSAG-Mx facilities cannot
       accept a job, a commercial contract may be utilized for that job and its related services.
       However, the cost of these jobs may not be charged against the CSAG-Mx. Rather
       customer funds will be directly cited on commercial contract documents.
       18.6.10.4. Type 1 Factory Training. DoD activities will budget and fund for initial
       factory training course costs (excluding TDY) from the investment account (appropriated
       fund or DWCF capital budget) that finances the related equipment or system. Continue
       to fund TDY costs for personnel attending this training with the O&M appropriation of
       the command to which the personnel are assigned. See Chapter 10, Section 10L for
       funding associated with Factory Training costs.
   18.6.11. Management Headquarters accounts include: major command, subordinate
   commands, major claimants (for the Navy), and Defense Agency Headquarters (DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, Paragraph 090102N).
   18.6.12. Base Support. Support costs, which are measurable and directly attributable to
   support provided to a DWCF entity, must be reimbursed to the host base. Other support costs
   not in the foregoing category (―measurable and directly attributable‖) may be waived if the
   support provided does not appreciably increase the host installation‘s cost (DoDI 4000.19,
   Paragraph 4.6).
18.7. Excluding Costs from the DWCF:
   18.7.1. Mobilization and Surge Costs. You must use direct appropriations to reimburse all
   DWCF costs related to maintaining a capacity to meet mobilization requirements. Do not
   finance these costs through customer rates. Prices of DWCF outputs should reflect peacetime
   operating costs only. Although you finance these mobilization costs as non-fund direct
   appropriations, they are elements of business area costs and you must fully justify them in
   DWCF budget estimates.
   18.7.2. Removal and Salvage of Plant and Equipment. Do not use DWCF to pay for
   plant closing, layaway and preservation, redistribution of residual inventories (packing,
   crating, handling, and transportation), and operation and maintenance expenses of facilities
   and equipment in standby or pending disposition.
   18.7.3. Maintenance of Totally Idle Plant, Equipment, and Real Property. Do not pay
   for these costs from the DWCF. If DWCF operations use these items intermittently,
   maintenance is a proper DWCF expense.
   18.7.4. Operating and Maintaining Activities Located in the DWCF Activity but Not
   Helping to Produce or Sell Goods and Services. Do not use DWCF.
   18.7.5. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Costs. Use the appropriate BRAC
   account to pay for costs of implementing BRAC Commission recommendations. Do not
   include in DWCF rates and costs. Base Realignment and Closure Program expenses may be
   incurred prior to receiving an allocation of BRAC funding. However, all costs properly
   charged against the BRAC account must be reimbursed with BRAC funds. DWCF funds
   may not be expended prior to complying with the notification requirements imposed by law
   with respect to the obligation of BRAC funds. All costs incurred by DWCF activities to
   carry out BRAC must be reimbursed from the BRAC account prior to the end of the fiscal
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  299


  year in which costs were incurred. (Reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9,
  Paragraph 090103.H.1).
  18.7.6. Claims for Damage to or Loss of Real or Personal Property Caused by Base or
  Contractor Personnel. Do not use DWCF for these costs.
  18.7.7. Any Major Catastrophe or Act of God. Do not use DWCF when the cost of repair
  or damage to DWCF assets is in excess of $750,000. Repairs in excess of $750,000 are
  funded with appropriated funds. Each repair project should reflect the restoration of a
  complete capability, i.e. repair of a hangar must include roofing, duct work, air conditioning
  repair, etc. These individual repairs shall not be separately evaluated against the $750,000
  threshold.
  18.7.8. War Reserve Materiel. DoD activities procure and maintain war reserves to meet
  wartime requirements as determined by the Defense Planning Guidance. Finance the initial
  procurement of war reserve material from a direct appropriation to the Fund, not through
  customer rates. However, because supply management businesses manage WRM, you must
  describe and justify war reserve requirements in DWCF budget estimates.
  18.7.9. Capital Assets Financed by Appropriations. Finance the following directly from
  appropriated funds rather than from DWCF resources.
     18.7.9.1. Fund military construction projects of $750,000 and over from the Military
     Construction appropriation.
     18.7.9.2. Exclude equipment in the following categories from the DWCF:
         18.7.9.2.1. Aircraft, ships, barges, and general-purpose passenger-type vehicles.
         Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M) purchases other
         support equipment.
         18.7.9.2.2. Equipment and minor construction projects purchased to meet
         mobilization requirements but not used during peacetime operations.
         18.7.9.2.3. Equipment normally provided as government-furnished equipment.
         18.7.9.2.4. Initial Lay-In of Depot Maintenance Capital Equipment. Continue to use
         the appropriate procurement Budget Program to finance the purchase and installation
         costs for initial procurement of depot maintenance capital equipment required to
         support newly introduced platforms or weapon systems, or modification programs.
         The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance Division (CSAG-Mx)
         cannot satisfy new depot support requirements with existing equipment. The
         procurement Budget Program will provide equipment for a capability which the WCF
         cannot support. For example, a depot may have paint booths, but if there is not
         enough excess capacity in the existing paint booths, then the procurement Budget
         Program will furnish the needed paint booths. The platform or weapon system
         program manager must ensure that the equipment and installation are programmed
         and budgeted in the proper appropriation for coordinating equipment requirements,
         specification, and delivery with the depot. Once transferred to or capitalized by the
         depot, the capital equipment becomes the depot's property. The depot will treat the
         equipment as a capital asset, depreciate the equipment, and fund subsequent
         replacement and maintenance of the equipment in its capital and operating budgets.
 300                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


           18.7.9.2.5. Items that meet the DoD capitalization criteria for use by major ranges
           and test facility bases operating under the Defense Working Capital Fund
           18.7.9.2.6. Others as described in DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume 2B, Chapter 9,
           Paragraph 090103.C.5.
       18.7.9.3. Exception to the self-insurance rule. Normally, when an asset is damaged, the
       owner of the asset will pay for the repairs or replacement of the damaged asset. However,
       when an asset is in Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-
       Mx) for repairs, CSAG-Mx is responsible for the asset and will repair the asset unless
       paragraph 18.7.7 applies.
   18.7.10. Military Costs. Reimbursement from DWCF to APF is not required for military
   labor, which is not assigned to a DWCF billet, performing work for a DWCF activity, i.e.,
   military civil engineering craftsmen accomplishing work on a DWCF assigned facility.
18.8. Recognizing Revenue. To ensure consistency of "revenue recognition" in the
Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M) for DoD end-products and
to guarantee that business areas' operating results are comparable:
   18.8.1. Use the percentage-of-completion method (cost to cost method) to recognize
   revenue.
   18.8.2. In all instances, you must transfer the portion of work in process associated with the
   revenue recognition to cost of goods sold. Bill the customer funding the order for the revenue
   recognized; or, when you have previously billed progress payments, record those payments
   to the appropriate revenue account.
   18.8.3. Bill customers and recognize revenue monthly.
   18.8.4. Do not allow the total amount of revenue recognized and billed to exceed the order
   amount.
18.9. Paying for Military Personnel. Use a consolidated DWCF payment to pay costs incurred
in common by multiple business areas or activities. An example is reimbursing the Military
Personnel appropriation for the cost of military people assigned to DWCF activities. Accumulate
and pay these costs at the corporate level but make sure each activity records them. They are as
much a cost of doing business as any local obligation. NOTE: Military personnel pricing
decision is that MILPERS costs will be priced at the civilian equivalent rates for the numbers of
budgeted military workyears. The amount included in the budget for DWCF activities will be the
amount of expenses in execution and the amount reimbursed to the military personnel
appropriation. This is not applicable to the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).
18.10. Acquiring Capital Assets:
   18.10.1. Review each proposed acquisition of a capital asset to make sure it:
       18.10.1.1. Makes economic sense to buy rather than lease. Although leasing is not part of
       the Capital Purchases Program, it may be appropriate for fast-changing technology or
       when workloads are expected to cease before the end of the program or payback period.
       You may also use leasing to improve productivity near-term until you can develop
       enough data to verify the benefits of procurement.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  301


     18.10.1.2. Meets the Department's long-range planning and programming objectives and
     satisfies a documented need for capability to perform valid operations, function, or
     services that existing equipment and facilities or a contract can not do as well or as
     cheaply.
     18.10.1.3. Complies with policies governing acquiring and managing facilities, special
     tooling, and special test equipment (DoDD 4275.5), as well as other policies on leasing
     and acquiring equipment and facilities.
  18.10.2. When you use workload projections to justify capital purchases, you must consider:
     18.10.2.1. Results of interservice decisions
     18.10.2.2. Workload posture planning decisions
     18.10.2.3. Readily available commercial alternatives
     18.10.2.4. Other reasonable options available for accomplishing applicable work load.
  18.10.3. The capital assets you recommend for acquisition must be the best alternative
  available to accomplish the objective for which you justify them. The criteria are:
     18.10.3.1. Improved efficiency (savings) or effectiveness.
     18.10.3.2. Required new capability and capacity that current equipment and facilities can
     not meet.
     18.10.3.3. Replacement of unsafe (locally determined), beyond economical repair, or
     inoperative unusable assets.
     18.10.3.4. Environmental, hazardous waste reduction, or regulatory agency (state, local,
     or Federal) mandated requirements.
  18.10.4. You must document the reasons (see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9)
  for a planned capital investment purchase and its expected benefits. Keep the documentation
  so it is readily available for review, audit, or evaluation. Use an economic analysis for
  projects with a total cost (funded and unfunded) of $1 million or more and use a cost analysis
  for projects with a total cost (funded and unfounded) of less than $1 million. This pre-
  investment analysis must be completed prior to inclusion of the capital asset in the capital
  budget submission, accomplishment of a reprogramming action, or a project substitution.
  These analyses shall be maintained by the originating office of the DoD Component as
  project documentation support for the Capital Budget submission as well as program
  execution.
     18.10.4.1. Analyze each Capital Purchases Program category with an expected cost of
     $250,000 or more for improved productivity and for replacement items that can greatly
     outperform an existing item. EXCEPTION: environmental, hazardous waste reduction,
     or requirements mandated by a regulatory agency (state, local or Federal) including
     directed action by higher DoD or Component authority which does not allow a choice.
     18.10.4.2. Show your workload projections and the source or rationale for them. To
     show greater efficiency or effectiveness, you must analyze capital purchase based on
     present value. If you mainly intend to save money consider potential investments with the
     shortest payback period but balance savings against usefulness to the mission.
 302                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   18.10.5. Capital investments in the categories of software and minor construction require
   analysis and documentation that differ from the other categories. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
   Volume 2B, Chapter 9 for specific guidance on software and minor construction.
   18.10.6. Analyze results within 1 to 2 years after buying a capital item expected to cost
   $250,000 or more when you said the item would improve productivity or perform better than
   an item it replaced. You must finish the analysis within 3 years after completing the job order
   and installing the equipment, developing the software, completing the construction, etc. Keep
   a copy of this analysis of results with the pre-investment analysis. Include at least:
       18.10.6.1. The fiscal year of the President's Budget submission when the equipment,
       project, or reserve was approved, and the date when the equipment was installed.
       18.10.6.2. The equipment cost estimated in the initial President's Budget submission and
       the actual investment cost.
       18.10.6.3. The savings or cost avoidance estimated in the initial President's Budget
       submission and the actual savings (including unfunded costs) to date. Clearly
       differentiate between estimated and actual data.
       18.10.6.4. The estimated and actual number of months to amortize the investment cost
       (pay-back period); i.e., the time required for the accumulated saving or cost avoidance to
       equal the equipment cost.
       18.10.6.5. A brief narrative describing:
          18.10.6.5.1. The basis for determining the savings or cost avoidance, such as fewer
          people, reduced maintenance, equipment, works faster, more accurately, etc.
          18.10.6.5.2. When net savings or cost avoidance is expected to begin.
          18.10.6.5.3. Why actual savings or annual costs differ (show how much) from those
          estimated.
          18.10.6.5.4. A brief narrative providing, where applicable, the ways in which the new
          equipment met the intended objective -- improved the safety, quality or timeliness of
          the repair process; reduced the hazardous waste generated in a process; or improved
          morale (possibly verified by survey).

Section 18C—Guidance for Specific Business Areas

18.11. Depot Maintenance:
   18.11.1. Bill the Air National Guard (ANG), the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC),
   operational MAJCOMs, US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Force Materiel
   Command (AFMC), Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and other customers for depot
   maintenance services.
   18.11.2. Depot maintenance will develop rates and prices to charge customers the full cost of
   work performed, including recovery of accumulated profits and losses and any surcharge.
   18.11.3. Ensure the full cost of all work produced, including any adjustments needed to meet
   cash or capital budget requirements, are included in customer rates and prices.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                        303


        18.11.3.1. For each type of repair or service, such as exchangeables, AFMC develops a
        cost factor or uses other techniques equitable to all customers and recovers full costs of
        providing the repair or service.
        18.11.3.2. Sign an interservice support agreement (ISSA) with each customer. Document
        the basis of reimbursement (such as cost factors, etc.). Review the agreement annually to
        make sure the reimbursement factors are adequate. Follow procedures in DoDI 4000.19
        and AFI 25-201.
18.12. Supply Management:
     18.12.1. The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply Division (formerly
     Materiel Support Division) repairs and buys materiel items from commercial or other
     government sources. The CSAG-Supply Division primarily finances the repair and purchase
     of reparable items. Also, consumable items that did not transfer to the Defense Logistics
     Agency are managed under CSAG-Supply Division. Supply Management customers will
     obligate their funds when they place orders with the DWCF. Customers will place orders
     only for supplies or equipment needed in the current fiscal year, or for supplies and
     equipment whose lead time requires obligation of current year funds to ensure they are
     available when needed.
     18.12.2. Apply this guidance for the Air Force Academy's (USAFA) Cadet Store Division:
        18.12.2.1. If the USAFA Superintendent considers it in the Air Force's interest to
        authorize the return of any item for which there is a future requirement, establish the
        amount of credit allowed, following general guidance on DWCF return credit. Instruct
        staff to apply the credit as a refund to cash purchases, to the individual's pay record, or to
        the returning appropriation, as appropriate.
        18.12.2.2. Do not use guidance on "distribution of inventories" for this division's
        operation.
     18.12.3. Current General Support Division (GSD) policy involves the Comptroller
     Community in the receipt, distribution, and control of funding documents. Specific guidance
     on Comptroller involvement in GSD and delegation of fund loading authority to base level
     supply personnel is contained in AFMAN 23-110.

                                          Chapter 19

                OFFICIAL VISITS CONCERNING BUDGET MATTERS

19.1. Conducting Budget Liaison. SAF/FMB is official liaison on all budget matters between
the Air Force and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD), the Congressional Budget Office, or the Appropriations and Budget Committees
of the Congress. Follow this guidance for reporting to the Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary
(Budget) (SAF/FMB) official visits by representatives of these organizations to Air Force
commands, installations, and activities.
   19.1.1. For visits by members of Congress, see AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With
   Congress.
   19.1.2. For visits by the Government Accountability Office (GAO, formally the General
   Accounting Office) officials, see AFI 65-401, Relations with the Government Accounting
   Office (GAO).
19.2. Notifying Budget Officials about Visits:
   19.2.1. Visits by Representatives of Congressional Appropriations and Budget
   Committees. SAF/FMBL (Congressional Budget & Appropriations Liaison Directorate)
   will announce visits to Directors of Financial Management and Comptroller, and others who
   need to know at command, installation, or activity. When representatives plan to visit
   activities below major command, (MAJCOM) SAF/FMBL will send an e-mail to the
   MAJCOM's comptroller. If time is short, SAF/FMBL will telephone the Comptroller liaison
   at the HQ MAJCOM and confirm later in writing. Provide SAF/FMBL the name of your
   point of contact by e-mail or telephone.
   19.2.2. Visits by House Appropriations Committee (HAC) Survey and Investigation
   (S&I) Staff. The headquarters Team Chief appointed by SAF/FMBL will notify commands
   of visits by members of the HAC S&I Staff. When visits are to activities below MAJCOM,
   send a copy of the notice to the MAJCOM's Comptroller and functional area. If time does not
   allow a message, telephone the MAJCOM and confirm later in writing.
   19.2.3. Visits by Representatives of OMB or OSD. The SAF/FMB directorate that
   handles the visit's subject matter will e-mail the Comptroller of the appropriate command,
   installation or activity. When visits are to activities below MAJCOM, the directorate will
   send an e-mail to the MAJCOM headquarters (Comptroller). If time does not allow an e-
   mail, they will telephone the Comptroller liaison at MAJCOM, then confirm later in writing.
   Tell the SAF/FMB directorate (by e-mail or telephone) of your point of contact for the visit.
19.3. Reporting Official Visits Concerning Budget Matters:
   19.3.1. Reporting HAC S&I Staff Visits. Within 1 duty day after visit ends, or
   periodically if the S&I team is working on location, the main contact at the location should
   send a visit report to the Team Chief. If you are the contact, coordinate the report with your
   local comptroller. Send SAF/FMBL an information copy if an action affects the budget or
   includes something controversial.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   317


   19.3.2. Reporting Visits by Representatives of OMB, OSD, or Congressional
   Appropriation and Budget Committees. Information discussed with or data provided to
   visitors that is considered to be of importance in current or future budget matters should be
   provided by fax, phone, or e-mail to SAF/FMBL. Providing this information enables the Air
   Staff to correct problems during apportionment reviews, to discuss deficiencies or corrections
   with higher authorities. Present your information clearly and accurately. Information should
   show the source of information, time covered by data, and where relevant, how it applies to
   your requested, approved, or revised execution plans. Follow this same approach when citing
   any program or activity, such as flying hours, maintenance, or people programs.
   19.3.3. Reporting Additional Information. Send any requested additional information,
   within 5 days after submitting the report, to SAF/FMB. (Use a cover letter, refer to the
   original report of visit, and send it through channels.) Address HAC S&I's to the Team Chief.
19.4. Command Actions. Major and intermediate commands will review the reports and other
information for accuracy and completeness. In your Command's forwarding letter:
   19.4.1. Correct errors in the basic report.
   19.4.2. Clarify unusual problems or conditions.
   19.4.3. State corrective action being taken or recommended, or deficiencies found during the
   visits.
   19.4.4. Supplemental data or recommendations that help SAF/FM understand the basic
   report.

                             (57X5095)

20.1. Using Wildlife Conservation Funds. Use these permanent, indefinite, special funds only
to carry out programs for wildlife, fish and game conservation, and rehabilitation (P.L. 86-797,
amended by 16 U.S.C. 670). Be sure you execute each fiscal years funding as an annual account.
Unexecuted apportionment/funding is withdrawn at the end of each fiscal year. You may use
both appropriated and nonappropriated funds. Note: use of nonappropriated funds for these
conservation programs are limited to Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and Lodging

   details).
20.2. Sourcing Funds. Installation commanders sell hunting and fishing permits. FSOs/FMAs
collect the proceeds into Receipt Account 575095. SAF/FMBO will allocate funds to designated
commands under account 57X5095 after the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
apportions funds to the Air Force.
20.3. Budgeting for Funds. Commands identify requirements for Fish and Wildlife funds and
supporting Air Force funds (O&M and RDT&E) using AF Form 2639, Fish/Wildlife/Outdoor
Recreation Resources Program. (See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources
Management.)

NOTES:
1. Charge any TDY costs for direct support to the project through an individual Work Order.
2. Calculate allowable In-House hours for this item by dividing budgeted amount by appropriate
shop rate. Monitor the hours charged; if you go over, ask for more obligation authority through
channels.
3. Do not do a Work Order for In-House inspection if In-House forces do the construction. The
shop supervisor or superintendent, as necessary, will inspect.
4. Base the RRI code to use on the PAC as follows: 72262=RA; 72271=RG; 72292=RN;
72266=RC; 72281=RK; 72296=RQ; 72267=RD; 72291=RM; 72297=RR


   21.2.6. Record these Project Costs:
        21.2.6.1. The Architect Engineer's (A-E) services and construction contracts.
        21.2.6.2. The Air Force BCE's direct labor hours for people who help design, manage the
        design, or manage construction of the project. Include people in support jobs, such as
        clerical and drafting. If the appropriate shop rate includes military costs, subtract it from
        the shop-rate cost to get reimbursable costs. Include the unfunded military cost in
        nonreimbursable project costs even though military people are not actually used on the
        project.

       21.2.6.3. Government vehicles that directly support the housing project; leased vehicles;
       or mileage costs for civilian (privately-owned) vehicles where authorized and used
       instead of government vehicles.
           21.2.6.3.1. Include and reimburse costs for government vehicles under the shop-rate
           distribution; do not record costs elsewhere.
           21.2.6.3.2. Directly cite project construction (P-71X) funds when civilian mileage
           costs are authorized. Establish a BCE work order to account for funds paid.
           21.2.6.3.3. Directly cite project construction funds (P-71X) when government
           vehicles are not available and you are authorized to lease vehicles for direct support
           of housing projects. Establish a BCE work order number and include it in the
           procurement documentation.
       21.2.6.4. Printing and reproduction charges directly related to the project.
       21.2.6.5. TDY expenses directly related to the project for military personnel or civilian
       employees.
       21.2.6.6. All direct and non-BCE costs shown in Figure 21.2
       21.2.6.7. Government-furnished material and equipment.
21.2.6.8. Figure 21.2 shows budget projects, account codes and types of costs for MFH
construction.

  21.2.7. Exclude These Costs:
     21.2.7.1. The time of commanders who mainly command and supervise base activities.
     (The Air Force would incur these costs whether or not the Air Force or another
     construction agent designed or constructed the housing).
     21.2.7.2. The time of base staff for planning contracts, determining policy, or discussing
     other matters.
  21.2.8. Identifying Project Costs. Classify construction and improvement project costs
  (paragraph 21.2.6) as funded or unfunded.
     21.2.8.1. Funded Project Costs. Count these toward the statutory limit on the project's
     programmed amount. Funded costs include:
         21.2.8.1.1. Construction Contract Costs. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.
         21.2.8.1.2. Installed Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE). Reimburse the
         appropriate Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group - Supply (DWCF) from P-711
         or P-713 funds.
         21.2.8.1.3. Contingency. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.
         21.2.8.1.4. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) Costs. Reimburse
         from P-711 or P-713 funds.
     21.2.8.2. Unfunded Project Costs. Count these costs toward the total project cost.
     However, do not count unfunded costs toward the statutory limit on the project's
     programmed amount.
         21.2.8.2.1. BCE's direct SIOH (nonreimbursable) costs for managing construction
         (labor and materiel). For funded labor costs, use the shop rate(s) less the military cost.
         21.2.8.2.2. Title I - A&E Design Service Fee. Directly cite P-714 funds.
         21.2.8.2.3. Title II - A&E Fee. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.
         21.2.8.2.4. BCE's direct costs for in-service design (labor and materiel). Use the shop
         rate cost less the military cost.
         21.2.8.2.5. Base-level TDY expenses directly related to the MFH project for military
         personnel and civilian employees.
         21.2.8.2.6. Direct, non-BCE, costs of procurement, accounting and finance, and legal
         functions directly related to the MFH project. (Note: do not reimburse military labor.)
         21.2.8.2.7. Printing and reproduction.
  21.2.9. Establishing and Administering Work Orders:
 326                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       21.2.9.1. Civil Engineering Financial Management will establish separate work orders
       for design and construction to record costs of BCE and non-BCE functions. If you have a
       base operating instruction for project management, show how non-BCE people will get
       complete, accurate data for time and other costs to the BCE. If available, use actual costs
       for all BCE and non-BCE functions.
       21.2.9.2. Design costs start when you have received a design instruction from HQ Air
       Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) or HQ USAF. Write work orders to
       collect all design costs, as shown below. Close them when design is complete and
       approved.
          21.2.9.2.1. Contract work order for A&E design services.
          21.2.9.2.2. In-house work order for BCE's direct (in-house) design and Supervision
          Inspection Overhead (SIOH).
          21.2.9.2.3. Non-BCE work order for non-BCE direct costs.
       21.2.9.3. Start work orders for construction when you receive procurement directives
       from MAJCOM or HQ USAF. Collect all costs for construction management (inspection,
       etc.) and close them when you receive final payment and reporting of all in-house labor.
       The BCE will determine how often to submit non-BCE and other costs. You may use the
       Schedule of Reimbursements and Refunds to charge accumulated BCE and non-BCE
       costs to the MFH appropriation. Maintain the integrity of codes for Budget Authorization
       Account Numbers (BAAN) from the beginning of design through final close-out. Apply
       these requirements to:
          21.2.9.3.1. Contract work order for the construction contract and Title II Inspection.
          21.2.9.3.2. BCE's direct and SIOH costs for In-house work orders.
          21.2.9.3.3. Non-BCE work order for non-BCE direct costs.
          21.2.9.3.4. Government-furnished material work order.
Section 21C—Military Family Housing Operation and Maintenance Account (MFH O&M,
57*0745
21.3. Charging Costs to MFH O&M:
   21.3.1. Include these costs:
       21.3.1.1. Civilian Personnel Costs. All civilian pay charges directly supporting the
       MFH property account and MFH management offices are reimbursable; civilian pay will
       be paid by FC 30 and reimbursed by FC 3Y. To compute federal labor costs for civilians
       use actual payroll costs, plus actual cost of benefits, or WIMS shop rates. If WIMS shop
       rates include military pay, do not charge the military pay cost to MFH O&M. Military
       pay is not reimbursable.
          21.3.1.1.1. Limit administrative and supervisory costs to those incurred at installation
          level.
          21.3.1.1.2. Compute labor costs, (both direct and indirect hire) for foreign nationals
          using local wage rates and total cost to the federal government. Total cost includes
          government contributions for employee benefits.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    327


        21.3.1.1.3. Charge civilian labor costs based on the actual work effort applied to
        MFH units, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, or housing areas. When WIMS is in
        operation, charge the labor costs to MFH using WIMS shop rates. (Examples of
        chargeable civilian labor are: Quality Assurance Evaluators; Special offices for
        managing GOQ; managing offices for MFH; Planning and Design Costs; In-house
        maintenance, repair, and minor alteration or improvement costs.)
        21.3.1.1.4. Organizations other than civil engineering (for example, Security Forces
        or Contracting) charge indirect costs for labor that supports Family Housing (FH)
        only when FH activities earn manpower authorizations on the Unit Manning
        Document. Charge such costs only if multiples of one or more personnel are earned
        and not a fraction thereof.
     21.3.1.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Include all travel costs incurred at an
     installation for operating, administering, and supervising MFH activities. Usually, you
     will directly cite rather than reimburse these costs to MFH funds. SAF/FMB Sep 7, 1995
     memo, Subject: Use of Military Family Housing Funds for Support Personnel Travel and
     Training, states, ―the Air Force will use the MFH Operations & Maintenance 0745
     account as the sole account to fund MFH travel and training activities in direct support of
     the family housing program.‖ This is applicable to MAJCOMs, as well as, installations.
     Additionally, it states, ―The O&M 3400 account will no longer be utilized for these
     costs.‖ This prohibition on the use of the O&M 3400 account is to avoid a violation of the
     election rule in The Principles of Federal Appropriations Law that could result in an
     ADA violation.
     21.3.1.3. Transportation. Either directly cite MFH funds or reimburse the account you
     first charged. Use the direct citation for MFH funds when you can separately identify
     contracts. Apply the reimbursable method when you use in-house resources to perform
     services. Pay for the following types of transportation costs from MFH:
        21.3.1.3.1. Moving and handling costs for MFH furniture, furnishings, and
        appliances.
        21.3.1.3.2. General Services Administration surcharge for overseas packing and
        crating when MFH requisitions items directly from GSA (i.e., when the order is not
        placed through the stock fund).
     21.3.1.4. Vehicle Costs. Charge for direct support only. For government-owned
     vehicles, use cost data from the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System cost
     data and charge as a reimbursable. Directly cite MFH funds for contract-vehicle rentals.
     21.3.1.5. Leases. Usually, you should directly cite lease costs. Include rental of dwelling
     units and other structures that support only MFH activities. When MFH and other base
     activities share leased facilities, determine a fair share of the leased cost based on square
     feet used by each activity. Compute the shared rate (expressed as a percent of the total
     lease cost) before the beginning of each fiscal year (FY), to cover 1 October through 30
     September. Charge the MFH share to MFH O&M. When shared use changes
     significantly, you may negotiate a new agreement for the balance of the FY.
     21.3.1.6. Utility Services. Use either direct citation or reimbursements to administer
     costs. Use direct citation when you can identify costs separately. Base charges on meter
328                                                             AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


      readings or engineering analysis (see AFI 32-1061). Whenever sewage metering or
      contract terms do not permit direct measurement, use 70 percent of water consumed to
      determine sewage quantity. If the resulting figure (i.e., 70 percent of the water consumed
      within military family housing, compared with total base sewage disposed of) is illogical,
      use the ratio of water MFH consumes to the total water consumed by the sewage-disposal
      plant.
      21.3.1.7. Contractual Services. Costs may include any service contracts or
      maintenance and repair contracts applicable to MFH property. Directly cite funds
      whenever you can separately identify contracts. When you can not, charge MFH as a
      reimbursable. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2829, contracts can be made for periods
      of up to four years for supplies and services for the management, maintenance, and
      operation of military family housing and may pay for the costs of each year out of annual
      appropriations for that year. In other words, the entire contract (2, 3, or 4 years) may not
      be funded using the fiscal year funds available when the contract is signed. The funds in
      each of the fiscal years in which the supplies or services are provided must be used to pay
      that fiscal year‘s bill.
      21.3.1.8. Facility Projects. Directly cite these costs.
      21.3.1.9. Expense Materiel, Equipment, and Appliances. Directly cite MFH funds
      whenever possible. Base MFH costs on purchase price, standard price, or shop rates, as
      appropriate. Directly cite MFH funds for contract rentals of equipment that directly
      supports MFH.
      21.3.1.10. Procurement of Flags for Military Family Housing Units. MFH Operation
      and Maintenance (O&M)) funds may be used to purchase and install flags for military
      family housing units. However, ONLY U.S. (American), combatant command, Service,
      and host nation flags may be procured and installed using MFH O&M funds, and ONLY
      two flags total per unit. For example, a U.S. flag (American) and an Army flag may be
      procured and installed on a MFH unit with MFH O&M, but NOT also a combatant
      command flag. Purchase of General Officer flags for MFH units is not authorized
      because General Officers are entitled to one flag at promotion. Purchase of state,
      MAJCOM, and other organizational flags for military housing units is a personal
      expense of the member and may not be purchased with MFH O&M or other
      appropriated funds. While this policy allows for purchase and installation of U.S.,
      combatant command, Service, and host nation flags on MFH units, it is highly
      recommended that MAJCOMs restrict the purchase and installation of MFH
      O&M-funded flags to key representational and command billets. All MAJCOMs
      should use discretion in implementing this policy as prudent custodians of public funds.
      Appropriated funds are not authorized to purchase US (American), state or Air Force
      flags for Privatized Housing.
  21.3.2. Exclude these costs:
      21.3.2.1. Military Personnel Services. Record costs to MFH in a memorandum account.
      When using WIMS shop rates, exclude only military pay, not the entire shop rate.
      21.3.2.2. Indirect labor costs (such as administrative, clerical or supervisory) because
      you normally cannot accumulate them.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                       329

      an assignment or leaves public quarters for the government's convenience. For permanent
      changes of station, charge costs to the appropriation in the order. Otherwise charge them
      to the O&M-type fund cite provided by your base family housing management office.
      21.3.2.5. Temporary moves from MFH at the government's convenience (see AFI 32-
      6001).
      21.3.2.6. Appropriated funds are not authorized to purchase US (American), state, or Air
      Force flags for Privatized Housing.

      Appropriations Acts for operation and maintenance of family housing shall be the
      exclusive source of funds for repair and maintenance of all family housing units,
      including flag and general officer quarters. It further directs that unless there is a specific
      exception requested for a unit in the President‘s Budget justification, not more than
      $35,000 per unit may be spent annually for the operations, maintenance, and repair of any
      general or flag officer quarters without 30 days advance prior notification of the
      appropriate committees of Congress. (See AFI 32-6002, Family Housing Planning,
      Programming, Design, and Construction and AFI 32-6003, General Officer Quarters,
      paragraph 2.5.2).
      21.4.2.2. Funding Military Family Housing Units Temporarily Diverted for Use as
      Unaccompanied Housing. Unless a unit is permanently taken out of service and
      removed from the family housing property records, it remains as family housing
 330                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


       regardless of its temporary use as unaccompanied housing. Only MFH O&M funds
       may be used for repair and maintenance of a temporarily diverted unit, not regular

AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                 331


21.10. Paying Taxes. Do not use the MFH appropriation to pay real estate taxes to foreign
governments.
21.11. Providing Common-Service and Interagency Support for MFH Occupancy and
Services. Apply the following guidance.
   21.11.1. Occupancy by People Not in the USAF. The Air Force must operate and maintain
   all MFH units it owns, regardless of occupancy by other than Air Force people (see
   paragraph 21.12).
   21.11.2. Common Service. Do not charge or collect reimbursements when military
   members of one DoD component occupy housing owned by another component. Occupancy
   of MFH units within DoD is not chargeable.
   21.11.3. Support Agreements. Establish a local agreement for interservice support when
   other agencies (Air Force organizations and non-DoD government agencies) occupy MFH.
   The Coast Guard is an example.
      21.11.3.1. Charge billings received for Air Force occupancy of non-DoD federal
      government housing (such as VA and FHA) to BP 721, EEIC 599XX.
      21.11.3.2. Credit proceeds from occupancy of leased units to BP 723/725, Operation of
      Leased Foreign/Domestic MFH.
      21.11.3.3. Credit proceeds received from non-DoD agencies occupying Air Force family
      housing per paragraph 21.16
   21.11.4. Quarters Allowances. Stop paying quarters allowances to people who receive
   MFH, except when the housing is substandard (see DoD Military Pay Manual).
   21.11.5. Utilities and Maintenance. Reimburse for these services when one service or
   agency provides them to support the MFH owned by another service or agency.
21.12. Charging for Occupancy of MFH by Contractors and Other Nonmilitary People:
   21.12.1. Nonmilitary People. The Financial Services Office (FSO) or Financial
   Management Analysis (FMA) office will collect rent due from nonmilitary people (such as
   recently separated members) occupying Air Force MFH, except that appropriated funded
   Federal civilian employees may authorize a payroll deduction for the rent. Credit proceeds
   from these occupants per Section 21E.
   21.12.2. Employees of the American Red Cross (ARC). Treat ARC employees the same
   as employees under appropriated funds for assigning and occupying MFH overseas. ARC
   employees in the CONUS, United States' territories, and possessions must pay a rental charge
   based on the rates charged for comparable private rental housing nearby (AFI 32-9003,
   Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property). Do not charge rental at foreign
   locations (see AFI 36-3105, Red Cross Activities Within the Air Force). Credit proceeds from
   these occupants per Section 21E.
   21.12.3. Employees of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). Reimburse
   the MFH account for MFH rent and utilities furnished to qualifying AAFES employees.
   (Overseas AAFES employees not paid from appropriated funds are nonappropriated fund
   employees (NAF category 1, MWR activity) for MFH occupancy.) In Europe, centrally bill
   to AAFESEUR. In the Pacific area, local AAFES managers and FSOs/FMAs should
 332                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   coordinate and establish procedures for collecting rental charges. Credit proceeds from these
   occupants per Section 21E.
21.13. Occupying Substandard Housing:
   21.13.1. Military Personnel (P. L. 85-241). Military personnel may rent inadequate
   quarters, but if in substandard condition, then the following applies:
       21.13.1.1. Pay the member the net difference between the basic allowance for housing
       (BAH) and the fair rental value of the quarters not to exceed 75 percent of the member‘s
       BAH. Pay this difference, as BAH, from the Military Personnel (MILPERS), Air Force
       appropriation. The adjusted BAH is the only charge to the MILPERS appropriation.
       ("Fair Rental Value" is the gross charge for occupying quarters, including charges for
       utility services (except telephone) and furniture when provided (see AFI 32-6001).
       21.13.1.2. Do not reimburse the person, the MFH, or any other account from the
       MILPERS appropriation.
       21.13.1.3. Do not make cash or payroll collections from United States military occupants
       of substandard housing.
   21.13.2. Civilian Employees. Civilian occupants must pay cash monthly or authorize a
   payroll deduction equal to the fair rental value of the occupied quarters. Do not reduce
   civilian salary reports for occupying of MFH units. Credit the proceeds per Section 21E.

Section 21D—Debt Payments

                           CIVILIAN PERSONNEL SERVICES

22.1. Overview. Within fund limitations, the Air Force uses in-service civilian personnel and
contract services to complete workloads that do not require military incumbents.
22.2. Coordinating      Personnel      Authorizations    and     Workyears       with     Fund
Authorizations. HQ USAF and MAJCOMs must coordinate funding and manpower
authorization documents before issuing them. All echelons of command must include funds to
adequately cover planned civilian employment levels in your operating budget authorities (OBA)
and fund allocations or allotments. In determining employment levels, managers must consider
manpower authorizations, funding priorities, employment capability, lapse (the length of time
vacated positions are normally vacant), and overhire requirements. Use current average annual
salaries and known or projected pay raises in pricing the civilian employment program. Pay
personnel from the same appropriation and program element in which manpower spaces are
authorized. Coordinate fund authorizations and planned employment levels by developing
financed civilian workyear utilization/employment plans under the direction of the civilian
employment and cost management committee (or a similar group as a Corporate Board).
22.3. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel:
   22.3.1. Do not apply the guidance in this paragraph to travel for security assistance
   programs, which is covered in Chapter 17.
   22.3.2. The Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, prescribes the activity responsible for
   paying authorized direct travel and transportation expenses. Charge these expenses to the
   same appropriation and budget activity from which you pay the employee's salary.
       22.3.2.1. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is responsible for funding PCS
       expenses for transportation by Military Sealift Command (MSC) of civilian personal
       effects.
       22.3.2.2. HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC) centrally funds transportation of
       unaccompanied baggage and household goods on aircraft operated under the
       Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). Unaccompanied baggage arriving at an
       aerial port without funding authorization for further movement is held a maximum of 7
       days, during which time tracer action by most expeditious means (message, telephone,
       etc.) must be initiated to obtain funding authorization. If you do not obtain funding
       authorization within the 7-day period, initiate onward shipment citing operation and
       maintenance (O&M) type funds of the organization which has custody of the baggage.
       When proper funding data is obtained, reimburse or refund the prior charge (as required),
       considering the $500 waiver policy.
       22.3.2.3. See DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations regarding the
       fiscal year to be charged for travel expenses.
22.4. Paying Civilian Personnel Working on Major Repair Projects. Charge the pay of
personnel engaged in maintenance and repair projects and in the design and inspection of
construction projects to elements of expense (EEIC) for civilian pay (11X) under O&M type
appropriations. EXCEPTION:
 336                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   22.4.1. Military Family Housing (MFH) Account, Construction Projects. Charge all
   personnel cost incurred for MFH new construction to Budget Program 710. You may hire
   personnel solely for this work and directly cite O&M (Appn 3400, FC 30) for their payroll
   costs. You charge these personnel services to the base O&M type appropriation. Then, you
   must reimburse the base O&M type appropriation from Budget Program 710, as follows:
       22.4.1.1. For direct civilian personnel services, include actual payroll costs plus actual
       cost of benefits.
       22.4.1.2. For foreign national labor services (local wage rate), you must reimburse for
       both direct and indirect hire labor, at 100 percent of total labor costs (BCE and non-
       BCE), including government contributions for employee benefits.
       22.4.1.3. For bases operating under the Interim Work Information Management System
       (IWIMS), which will eventually be replaced by the Automated Civil Engineer System
       (ACES), charge the labor costs to MFH at the shop rate prescribed by that system. Note:
       If the shop rate includes military labor costs, record it as an unfunded cost.
   22.4.2. Expense of Operating and Maintaining Military Family Housing. The Base
   Civil Engineer (BCE) and other organizations usually provide civilian personnel services and
   initially finance them from base O&M funds. You must reimburse from Budget Program
   720, as follows:
       22.4.2.1. For Air Force civilian Personnel in direct support of the MFH property account
       and MFH management, include actual payroll costs plus the actual cost of benefits.
       22.4.2.2. For foreign national labor services (local wage rate), reimburse for both direct
       and indirect hire at 100 percent of total labor costs (BCE and non-BCE), including
       government contributions for employee benefits.
       22.4.2.3. For bases operating under the Interim Work Information Management System
       (IWIMS), charge the labor costs to MFH at the prescribed shop rates. Note: If the shop
       rate includes military labor costs, record it as an unfunded cost.
   22.4.3. Military Construction Projects. Charge civilian personnel services (in-house or
   contract) required for in-house design and inspection of construction projects to O&M-type
   funds.
   22.4.4. Pay of Other Government Agency Personnel. Treat services provided by district
   engineers or other government agencies as contractual services. Program and finance them
   under the element of expense codes for design and construction.
22.5. Awards Guidance. For Suggestion Awards, see AFI 38-401. AFI 36-1001 and AFI 36-
1004 provide guidance pertaining to civilian performance awards. Also see Chapter 4, Section
4L of this instruction.
22.6. Pay of Civilian Personnel Employed in Certain Specialized Functions. Follow this
guidance in charging for salaries in the following specialized functions:
   22.6.1. Service Club and Library Personnel. Use appropriated funds to pay salaries,
   including assistants, when manpower authorization documents include these authorizations.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                  337


   22.6.2. Dining Hall Personnel. You may establish civilian authorizations for dining hall
   personnel, such as cooks, bakers, and mess attendants according to AFI 34-239, subject to
   availability of appropriate funds and following AFI 38-201.
   22.6.3. Auxiliary Civilian Clergy. Commanders of Air Force activities, with the
   coordination and approval of wing chaplains, may authorize and appoint auxiliary civilian
   clergy when necessary.
   22.6.4. Property Disposal Program. Charge the pay of Air Force civilian employees
   assigned to O&M activities, who perform services directly related to preparing and disposing
   of scrap, salvage, excess, surplus, or foreign excess personal property, to the appropriation
   from which you usually pay the employee. DFAS centrally administers reimbursement for
   these services, according to Chapter 10, Section 10D.
22.7. Subsistence and Quarters to Civilian Employees. AFI 34-246 contains guidance on
furnishing subsistence and quarters to civilian employees and related charges. Make collections
from the employee either in cash or by payroll deduction. (See Chapter 21 for collecting rent).
   22.7.1. Collecting for Subsistence. Payrolls for civilian employees subsisting in Air Force
   messes are stated in the gross amount. Collect the cost of subsistence in cash or by payroll
   deduction. In developing civilian pay budgets, you must provide for the total salary of the
   employee.
   22.7.2. Collecting for Utilities. Handle utility charges collected by payroll deductions as
   stoppages; that is, charge the gross salary to the appropriation from which the employee is
   paid and credit the amount representing collection for utility services to the appropriation
   available for supply of the utility services. Administer cash collections the same way. In
   either case, provide for the total salary of the employee in your budgets.
22.8. Witness and Jury Fees. Employees must turn in to their agencies all jury and witness
fees paid to them by state and municipal courts while on court leave from their agencies, except
when such payments are "reimbursement for expenses" rather than "fees".
   22.8.1. Deposit jury fees turned over to the Air Force by employees as refunds to the
   appropriation or funds from which the employee was paid.
   22.8.2. Deposit witness fees turned over to the Air Force to the credit of receipt account
   573099, miscellaneous recoveries and refunds not otherwise classified.
22.9. Lump-Sum Leave Payment. If an employee refunds a lump sum leave payment upon
reemployment during the period covered by the payment, accomplish the refund either by cash
collection or by payroll deduction. In either case, credit the collection as a refund to the
appropriation that pays the employee.
22.10. Unliquidated Leave. Collect the value of unearned advanced leave upon separation, or
unliquidated overdrawn leave at the end of a calendar year, from the employee concerned by
cash, payroll deduction, or refund from any amount due or which may become due to the
employee from the United States. Refund cash collections to the appropriation originally
charged. Payroll deductions simply reduce the amount of the employee's current pay.
22.11. Travel Over-Advances. Under conditions specified in JTR, Volume 2, an employee
may receive a travel expense advance. Usually, the advance is repaid by deduction from
reimbursement due for travel. If this is not possible (for example, when the advance exceeds the
 338                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


amount due), the employee must repay the amount over-advanced. If cash collection efforts are
unsuccessful, make a payroll deduction. Treat the collection as an appropriation refund to the
appropriation originally charged.
22.12. Reimbursement of Professional Liability Insurance Premiums. Section 636 of the
Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997, as
amended by Section 642 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000, requires agencies to reimburse qualified employees for
not to exceed one-half of the costs incurred for professional liability insurance. DoD further
restricts reimbursement to a maximum of $150 per year from the account the employee receives
their salary. Employees eligible to receive reimbursement are law enforcement officers and
supervisors and management officials. Eligible employees include civilians paid from
appropriated and working capital fund activities. Non-Appropriated Fund and Military
Appropriation funded employees are not eligible for reimbursement.

23.1. BRAC Appropriations. BRAC no-year funds may only be used for the purposes
described in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (P.L. 101-510 as amended and
hereafter referred to as ―The Base Closure Act‖), Section 2905 to implement actions. Sections
2906 (BRAC 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995) and 2906A (BRAC 2005) of the same statute provide
additional specific information on each of the authorized accounts. Financing may come from
appropriations, transfers in appropriations acts, and proceeds from the sale of assets made
available from Base Realignment and Closures. Each appropriation has a specific code
described below. Also see AFMAN 65-604 for specific appropriation codes for each BRAC
round and each program year. Each year will have a separate appropriation code.

Table 23.4. . BRAC 95 (Round IV).

Appropriation 97X0510.40XX (See AFMAN 65-604 for specific codes for each program year),
DoD Base Closure and Realignment Account, Part IV (BRAC 95) funds closure and realignment
costs associated with actions recommended by the 1995 Base Closure Commission created under
the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Title 29 of P.L. 101-510). After July
13, 2001, funds in the DoD Base Closure Account 1990 are available only to incur new
obligations for environmental restoration, property management and disposal, and other
caretaker costs at closed or realigned installations and for the purpose of recording, adjusting and
liquidating obligations properly chargeable to the account under Title 31, United States Code,

         Lowry AFB CO (Redirect)                    Malmstrom AFB MT

   23.1.2. REDIRECTS: In some cases, the subsequent Commission's recommendations
   change the base closure or realignment actions of a previous Commission. In most cases, this
   does not affect environmental restoration, property management, and disposal. Usually, you
   fund redirects with the BRAC appropriation associated with the Commission that directed the
   change. In the case of BRAC 91, there are three redirect actions for Mather, George, and
   Chanute AFBs which are authorized payment with BRAC 91 vice BRAC 88. Prior to 11 July
   97, pay for the redirect of Mather reserves to Beale AFB with BRAC 91 funds. After 10 Jul
   97, pay the costs of the BRAC 93 redirects (Castle AFB, Mather AFB, Chanute AFB,
   Rickenbacker ANGB, and Carswell AFB) with BRAC 93 funds. MacDill AFB was further
   redirected BRAC 95. If you are uncertain regarding appropriate funding, contact SAF/IE
   PMO for guidance.
   23.1.3. BRAC 05 (Round V): Appropriation 97X0512.50XX (See AFMAN 65-604 for
   specific codes for each program year), DoD Base Closure and Realignment Account, Part V
   (BRAC 05) funds closure and realignment costs associated with actions recommended by the
   2005 Base Closure Commission created under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
   Act of 1990 (Title 29 of P.L. 101-510). After September 15, 2011, funds in the DoD Base
   Closure Account 2005 are available only to incur new obligations for environmental
   restoration, property management and disposal, and other caretaker costs at closed or
   realigned installations and for the purpose of recording, adjusting and liquidating obligations
   properly chargeable to the account under Title 31, United States Code, section 1553. The
   approved recommendations for which the Air Force has either full or partial funding
   responsibility are shown in Table 23.6.
23.2. Structure of the Account. The structure of the base closure accounts is by base
"package" and by commodity (e.g., Military Construction, Operation and Maintenance, etc.) as
shown in paragraph 23.2.2 below.
   23.2.1. The Air Force uses uniform budget program (BP) and project numbers to identify
   these expenses for budget formulation and execution. In addition, SAF/FMB assigns a
   discrete budget activity account number (BAAN) to identify each closure or realignment
   package. The list of BAANs is shown in Table 23.6.
   23.2.2. See AFMAN 65-604 for the detailed coding structure of the programs, projects, and
   BAANs used for recommendations of all the Base Closure Commissions.
       23.2.2.1. The budget programs include:
          23.2.2.1.1. 100 Military Construction
          23.2.2.1.2. 200 Military Family Housing (Used prior to 1997)

   23.3.8. BRAC funds distributions and expenditures are recorded and reported using
   established DoD financial accounting systems and procedures.
23.4. Budget Process:
   23.4.1. MAJCOM BRAC PMOs develop initial requirements for facilities projects, MFH,
   O&M, and Other Procurement costs. MAJCOM Civil Engineer Environmental Planning
   offices develop initial requirements for environmental compliance and restoration for closing
   installations/sites.    MAJCOMs         cost these requirements, coordinate with their
   MAJCOM/FMAs and submit requirements to the MAJCOM/BRAC PMO for entry in the AF
   BRAC Management Tool (BMT) IAW MAJCOM BRAC PMO procedures.

      23.5.1.1. While Congressional action is pending, the Air Force cannot carry out any
      closure or realignment included in those recommendations.
23.6. Reprogramming:
   23.6.1. Funding documents contain administrative limitations on moving funds between
   programs and projects.
      23.6.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs may not move funds between OACs.
      23.6.1.2. MAJCOMs/FOAs may notincur obligations for more than the amount stated for
      each budget program or each line item (BAAN) if funds have been issued to a specific
      BAAN by SAF/FMBIC.
      23.6.1.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs may not move funds between Budget Programs, but may
      move funds within a Budget Program for requirements approved by SAF/IEI PMO.
   23.6.2. Due to the dynamic nature of the BRAC business, requirements may change
   unexpectedly. Each MAJCOM BRAC PMO validates and submits any increase to a project
   amount or additional requirements to SAF/IEI PMO. SAF/IEI PMO will review and approve
   changes in requirements and funding.
      23.6.2.1. If reprogramming of funds within the total MAJCOM program cannot fulfill

   funds in the BRAC accounts.
      23.6.3.1. Section 2906 limits authority to use funds for BRAC 88, 91, 93, and 95. ―After
      July 13, 2001, the Account shall be the sole source of Federal funds for environmental
      restoration, property management, and other caretaker costs associated with any real
      property at military installations closed or realigned under this part or such title II.‖ OSD
      Comptroller Memo, 4 May 2001, states, ―After July 13, 2001, funds in the DoD Base
      Closure Account 1990 shall be available only to incur new obligations for environmental
      restoration, property management and disposal, and other caretaker costs at closed or
      realigned installations and for purposes of recording, adjusting and liquidating
      obligations properly chargeable to the Account under 31 U.S.C. 1553.‖
      23.6.3.2. Section 2906A (1)(B) authorizes a separate account for BRAC 2005 and use of
      its funds ―…only for the purposes described in Section 2905 with respect to military

 344                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   23.7.1. The MAJCOM owning the closing or realigning base is responsible for compiling all
   closure or realignment costs, including costs of non-Air Force DoD agency tenants. Do not
   include costs for non-Federal agencies or private sector firms or personnel, unless there is a
   specific contract termination cost generated by the closure or realignment.

Section 23C—Funding Guidance

23.8. Availability of Appropriations for BRAC Costs:
   23.8.1. Funding Direct Base Closure Costs under BRAC. The law authorizes the BRAC
   accounts to fund one-time, non-recurring costs that are a direct result of BRAC-directed base
   closure or realignment actions (P.L. 101-510, Section 2905, 2906 and 2906A).
       23.8.1.1. Charge the BRAC account established to cover the base that is being closed or
       realigned (Round I, II, etc.).
       23.8.1.2. Fund redirects as directed in paragraph 23.1.6. Table 23.5 identifies typical
       costs financed by BRAC. It does not address all situations. Apply the guidance in this
       paragraph regarding direct, non-recurring costs in all cases. Section 23D contains
       additional guidance for special situations.
       23.8.1.3. Direct questions concerning approval for a particular requirement for BRAC
       funding to SAF/IEI PMO. Direct questions on financial management procedures and
       directives to SAF/FMBIC.
   23.8.2. Reimbursing Other Agencies. Under Section 2905 the Military Services may also
   reimburse other Federal agencies for actions performed at the request of the Secretary
   concerning implementing any such closure or realignment, and may use for such purpose
   funds in the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of the Air Force and available
   for such purpose. (Note: If you are uncertain regarding a request from another agency (non-
   AF), ask SAF/IEI PMO for guidance.)
   23.8.3. BRAC Funding Exclusions. The following costs do not qualify for BRAC funding.
       23.8.3.1. Force structure drawdowns or realignments made outside the BRAC process,
       e.g., PCR actions.
       23.8.3.2. Civilian or military salaries, except where authorized and approved by SAF/IEI
       PMO.
       23.8.3.3. Normal upkeep for base facilities through the closure date.
       23.8.3.4. Installation level closure or realignment management office manpower and
       normal operating expenses except where approved by SAF/IEI PMO.
       23.8.3.5. Unit operating expenses such as telephone service, janitorial services, utilities,
       airfield operating costs through the closure date.
       23.8.3.6. Corrections of existing deficiencies.
       23.8.3.7. Normal rotation PCS moves, both military and civilian.
       23.8.3.8. PCS moves associated with emergency evacuation, accession, training,
       retirements and separations.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      345


       23.8.3.9. Costs incurred to recruit and hire civilian personnel (including associated PCS
       costs) to fill vacant positions resulting from a realignment of an activity from a closing or
       realigning installation to a receiving installation in accordance with a BRAC
       recommendation except in the case of Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) activities.
       (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, paragraph 090103 H 3).
   23.8.4. Environmental Restoration. Since 1991 the BRAC accounts are the exclusive
   source of funds for environmental restoration at closing installations.
       23.8.4.1. Do not use either (Defense) Environment Restoration Account (ERA) O&M or
       other funds for environmental restoration at an installation closed under a BRAC
       recommendation.
       23.8.4.2. AFMAN 65-604 lists the environmental compliance expenses projects eligible
       for BRAC funding. Direct technical environmental questions to AF/A7CV.
23.9. Election Rule. The base closure laws created a unique situation, in making both the
BRAC account and AF appropriations that finance costs for O&M, planning and design, and
minor construction available for realignment and closure costs. However, once legal
appropriation is charged for a specific BRAC-related expense (e.g., a particular civilian PCS),
that expense cannot subsequently be transferred to another account. Consequently, except for
some civilian personnel costs, another appropriation may not be reimbursed for an expense that
should have been paid from the BRAC account. This limitation applies even if BRAC funds are
not available due to a continuing resolution. Direct questions on reimbursements or transferring
charges to the BRAC account to SAF/FMBIC.

Section 23D—Other Funding Guidance

23.10. Military PCS Costs:
   23.10.1. BRAC Active Duty AF Military Permanent Change of Station (PCS). BRAC
   PCS funds will be managed in accordance with procedures approved by SAF/IEI PMO,
   SAF/FMBIC and SAF/FMBOP.
       23.10.1.1. BRAC PCS moves will be coded as ―T‖ as directed by Headquarters Air
       Force Personnel Center (AFPC/DPAPD).
       23.10.1.2. AFPC/DPAPB will provide fund cite authorizations, instructions and other
       information on preparing and processing military PCS orders to affected installations.
       AFPC/DPAPB will establish limits on the number and type (officer or enlisted) PCS
       orders chargeable to BRAC. SAF/FMBIC will issue BRAC military PCS funds (BP 400)
       to the MAJCOMs by location, BAAN and Budget Project Number. MAJCOMs will
       issue the funds to the installations.
       23.10.1.3. Use the CMA PCS (3500) account for personnel who PCS from designated
       closure bases to an overseas station. If you use CMA funds, follow the normal
       procedures. BRAC funds may not be used to fund a PCS move to an overseas location
       except where specifically directed in a BRAC recommendation and then only to an
       overseas location that is one of the United States, its territories or possessions (see 10
       U.S.C. 2687).
 346                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


23.11. Civilian Personnel Costs. (This applies to host and tenant costs but excludes NAF costs
which are addressed in a separate paragraph.)
   23.11.1. Health Benefits. The organization that pays for the individual's salary is
   responsible to pay for the continuation of health benefits. (Section 8905a(d), title 5 U.S.C)
   23.11.2. Retirement. BRAC will not fund retirement-related costs for civilian employees
   who elect to retire instead of relocating to another job. Fund only lump-sum leave balances
   from the BRAC account.
   23.11.3. Separation Pay and Reduction in Force (RIF). The appropriation and
   organization that pays for the individual's salary pays for separation or RIF costs. On a base
   closure or realignment base, the BRAC accounts are available for making Voluntary
   Separation Incentive Pay (VSIP) payments, as well as related Voluntary Early Retirement
   Authority (VERA) payments, provided that the payments are legitimate implementation costs
   associated with a base closure commission recommendation. If the VERA or VSIP payment
   is not a legitimate implementation cost associated with (i.e. a direct result of) a BRAC
   closure or realignment, the organization that pays the salary of the individual is responsible
   to fund the separation pay (P.L. 102-484, October 23, 1992, Section 5597).
   23.11.4. Unemployment Compensation. Unemployment compensation is a base closure
   account cost. The Services pay up to 26 weeks, and do not pay for extended benefits.
   However, BRAC cannot fund unemployment costs related to downsizing or realignment
   actions outside BRAC.
   23.11.5. Severance Pay. This is funded from BRAC because it is considered a one-time
   cost.
23.12. Tenant Employees Costs. Follow the rules for other civilian employees.
   23.12.1. BRAC will fund employee relocation costs for affected Department of Defense
   Agencies such as the Defense Commissary Service, Defense Reutilization Marketing Office,
   National Geospatial Agency, sister Service, etc., employees, if they are the last persons in
   their positions and another program does not fund them.
   23.12.2. Headquarters Air Force Manpower must approve the designation of positions
   qualifying for BRAC funding.
23.13. Training Costs For AFRPA Employees. Charge the BRAC accounts for on-going
training of Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) civilian employees who are assigned to
BRAC responsibilities. Charge BRAC accounts for training costs for HQ AFCEE BRAC
employees assigned to BRAC responsibilities.
23.14. Packing, Crating, And Transportation of MWR Equipment. Appropriated funds may
be used to pay for the transportation of MWR equipment and supplies (appropriated and
nonappropriated fund-owned) directly resulting from a base closure or realignment.
   23.14.1. Funding policy for shipment of MWR items is the same as that for appropriated
   support equipment.
   23.14.2. Use BRAC Account funds to transport MWR equipment and supplies.
   23.14.3. In all cases, the gaining base must have a requirement to use BRAC funds approved
   by SAF/IEI PMO.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    347


23.15. Congressional Approval for Construction. P.L. 101-510 Sections 2906 and 2906A
require when the cost of any BRAC project ―will exceed the maximum amount authorized by
law for a minor construction project, the Secretary [of Defense] shall notify the congressional
defense committees of the nature of, and justification for, the project and the amount of
expenditures for such project.‖ For BRAC purposes, the threshold for minor construction
projects is currently $750,000. Projects whose estimated cost is less than $750,000 will be
treated as minor construction; projects estimated above $750,000 will be treated as major
construction and must be reported individually to Congress. This threshold is set by law and will
be adjusted to match the most current legislation. Normal Military Construction thresholds for
repair or other purposes do not apply to BRAC projects. There are additional requirements in the
BRAC statute‘s subsections for reporting amounts expended, projects added or projects proposed
but not completed. All construction projects will be submitted to and approved in advance by
SAF/IEI PMO.
23.16. Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Costs Including Facilities
Construction:
   23.16.1. DoD Instruction 1015.15, Establishment, Management, and Control of
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities and Financial Management of Supporting
   Resources, Paragraph 6.12.2.3, October 31, 2007 states ―Category C activities at installations
   identified for closure under BRAC procedures may receive APF support authorized for
   Category B activities. APF may finance costs that are a direct result of an approved BRAC
   action. Those costs include, but are not limited to, PCS for NAF employees, NAFI
   unemployment and severance payments associated with NAF personnel, and facilities
   construction. NAFI realignment and closure costs are authorized funding from all BRAC
   accounts, not just the Reserve Account.‖
   23.16.2. Base closure account funds may fund construction and renovation of Category A,
   B, & C NAF facilities and commissaries at receiving installations.
       23.16.2.1. These projects must not exceed the needs created by closure or realignment
       action.
       23.16.2.2. Do not use base closure account funds for existing deficiencies or "get well"
       projects unrelated to closure or realignment.
       23.16.2.3. Congress will be notified for all projects whose cost exceeds $750,000 in
       accordance with P.L. 101-510, Section 2906 and 2906A.
   23.16.3. Appropriated funds are not normally available for construction or expansion of
   category B or C NAFIs. Therefore commands should coordinate any proposal to use
   appropriated funds for construction or expansion of category B or C NAFI at receiving
   installations with SAF/FMBIC, SAF/FMCEB, and SAF/IEI PMO.
       23.16.3.1. Section 23C lists exceptions to the funding policies (e.g., when the transfer of
       new units or functions requires construction or expansion at an installation).
23.17. Funds Request and Issue Process.
   23.17.1. SAF/IEI PMO provides program oversight and approval of funding requests for all
   BRAC funding issues. SAF/IEI submits funding requests to SAF/FMBIC for processing,
348                                                          AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


  monitors account status and approves all requests for reallocation of BRAC funds prior to
  SAF/FMBIC processing Fund Authorization Documents.
  23.17.2. SAF/FMBIC notifies SAF/IEI PMO of initial distribution and funds availability via
  the SD Form 440 from OUSD/C.
  23.17.3. SAF/IEI PMO notifies MAJCOMs/FOAs of availability of funds, advises command
  to submit request(s) for funds via email using Microsoft Excel format.
  23.17.4. MAJCOM BRAC PMOs submit request(s) for funds by budget program (100, 300,
  500, 600) and amount to SAF/IEI PMO by email. MAJCOMs may submit fund request(s)
  only for projects approved in the BMT. Each request will include the following:
      23.17.4.1. MAJCOM
      23.17.4.2. Recommendation Number
      23.17.4.3. BMT Increment Number
      23.17.4.4. BMT Requirement Title
      23.17.4.5. Budget Program
      23.17.4.6. Amount Requested (Dollars rounded to the nearest thousand-initial
      distribution only; exact amounts for changes)
  23.17.5. MAJCOM/A7Cs (except ANG and AFRC) will submit requests for facilities
  projects whose cost exceeds $750K to AF/A7CC after approval of the MAJCOM BRAC
  PMO and SAF/IEI PMO. AF/A7CC prepares and submits a Funds Authorization
  Memorandum for each project to SAF/IEI PMO. ANG/AFRC will submit requests for major
  construction projects directly to SAF/IEI PMO for each project
  23.17.6. SAF/IEI PMO verifies all requirements and amounts, prepares and/or submits
  Forms 378 to SAF/FMBIC to issue funds to the executing entity.
  23.17.7. SAF/FMBIC verifies funds availability and processes a Fund Authorization
  Document to issue funds to the MAJCOM/FOA. SAF/FMBIC also issues funds to the
  construction agent (United States Army Corps of Engineers – USACE), Naval Facilities
  Command (NAVFAC), Air Force Center for Engineering and Environmental Excellence
  (AFCEE), ANG, AFRC) or MAJCOM for facilities projects whose cost exceeds $750K) with
  advice and approval of SAF/IEI PMO and input from AF/A7CC.
  23.17.8. MAJCOM/FMA confirms and notifies MAJCOM BRAC PMO or equivalent of
  receipt of funds.
  23.17.9. MAJCOM BRAC PMOs will direct the MAJCOM/FMA to distribute funds by
  recommendation and base for each budget project (O&M, Other, Environmental Compliance
  facilities as appropriate) using the BAAN and installation codes listed in Table 23.6. Funds
  (other than facilities projects exceeding $750K) are issued to the installation location where
  the expense will occur or to the MAJCOM functional manager for centrally managed
  projects. For example, facilities projects for less than $750K at Moody AFB related to Pope
  AFB recommendation will go to the parent command of Moody and then to the base if
  required; transportation (O&M) funds for moving A-10s from Pope to Moody will flow first
  to ACC then to Pope. MAJCOMs should use established funds control procedures to direct
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                               349


   funds to the appropriate BAAN and base. Contact SAF/FMBIC for additional assistance
   with funds control procedures.
   23.17.10. Installations execute the action, record and report the expense as required. See
   Attachment 6.
   23.17.11. MAJCOMs may move funds within a budget program (300, 500, 600) to manage
   fact-of-life changes. However, funds may only be expended on requirements approved by
   SAF/IEI PMO. MAJCOMs must submit requests for additional funds or to move funds
   between budget programs to SAF/IEI PMO. These requests will be addressed individually
   and approved subject to fund availability.
   23.17.12. MAJCOMs may direct questions concerning PBAS operations and data
   requirements to the PBAS Systems Office, points of contact (POC) include Cheryl Coonce at
   DSN 699-3325, Ed Woelfel at DSN 699-3081, and Robin Ebert at DSN 699-5880.

anticipated [see the FM Data Quality Service (DQS)].
Administrative Costs—Administrative and overhead expenses (for use of the Department of
Defense (DoD) logistics system) incident to issue, sale, or transfer of materials, supplies, and
equipment to authorized personnel, and public or private organizations outside the United States
Government.
Advance EOQ Procurement (Multiyear Procurements)—An exception to the full funding
policy that allows the use of expanded advance procurement in conjunction with a multiyear
contract to purchase more than one fiscal year's program increment of components, materiel, and
parts in order to obtain the economic advantages of multiyear procurement.
Advance Procurement (Long Leadtime Items)—An exception to the full funding policy that
allows procurement of long leadtime components, materiel, parts, and effort in a fiscal year

improve design, diagnose possible structure failures, give a basis for corrective action, and
predict operational life expectancy of the weapon system.
Apportionment—A distribution by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of amounts
available for obligation in appropriation or fund accounts of the executive branch. The
distribution makes amounts available on the basis of time periods (usually quarterly), programs,
activities, projects, objects, or combinations thereof. The apportionment system is intended to
achieve an effective and orderly use of funds. The amounts so apportioned limit the obligations
that may be incurred
Cancellation—A procedure unique to multiyear contracts that involves the unilateral right of the
government to discontinue contract performance for subsequent fiscal years' quantities of items.
Cancellation is effective only upon the failure of the government to fund successive fiscal year
quantities under a multiyear contract.
Cancellation Ceiling—The maximum amount the government will pay the contractor as a result
of cancellation. This amount reflects the incurred costs that the contractor would have recovered
as a part of the unit price of subsequent fiscal years canceled items. The amount paid to the

and managed per acquisition instructions These computers are integral to and in direct support of
a major system or a less-than-major system.
Computer: Related Equipment— This includes computer resources not appropriate for
acquisition and management under the guidance listed in paragraph 4.8. Note: this includes
systems or items of equipment that contain, or depend on a computer device for their operation
and do not fall under the acquisition or command, control, communications and computer series
of instructions for acquisition and management control. Such computers are normally not very
complex and are therefore considered as an integrated feature of the equipment item. Some
examples are materiel handling equipment, lathes and depot and industrial plant equipment
(commercial type machinery), and other off-the-shelf items of shop equipment normally used in
a depot or industrial plant environment.
Computer: Software—The programs, routines, and associated documentation used to extend or
realize the capability of ITE. There are two types of software: basic software and applications
software.
Computers: Basic Software (nonfunctional)—Basic software comprises those routines and
programs designed to extend or facilitate particular ITE, taking into account the design
characteristics of such equipment. This software is usually provided by the original equipment
 376                                                           AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


manufacturer (OEM) and is normally essential to, and a part of, the system configuration
furnished by the OEM. Examples of basic software are executive and operating programs;
diagnostic programs; compilers; assemblers; utility routines, such as sort-merge and input/output
conversion routines; file management programs; and information management programs.
Information management programs are commonly linked to, or under the control of, the
executive or operating programs.
Computers: Applications Software (functional)—Applications software are those routines and
programs designed by or for ITE users to accomplish specific, mission-oriented tasks, jobs, or
functions using the ITE and basic software available. Applications software may be either
general/common purpose packages, such as demand-deposit accounting, payroll, machine tool
control, etc.; or specific application programs tailored to accomplish a single or a limited number
of user functions, such as base level personnel, depot maintenance, missile or satellite tracking,
etc. Except for packages acquired directly from software vendors or from the OEM, the user
generally develops this type of software with in-house resources or through contract services.
Computers: Software Maintenance—Efforts associated with eliminating faults in software to
ensure that an information system (IS) or application is in a satisfactory working condition.
Computers: Software Changes—Efforts associated with revision or alteration of an existing IS

the contingency operation were not being carried out (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 12,
Chapter 23).
Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA)—Budget authority resulting from legislation
introduced as a joint resolution and enacted by the Congress to provide authority for federal
agencies to continue operations until a specified date or until the regular appropriations are
enacted. The Continuing Resolution usually specifies a maximum rate at which obligations may
be incurred based on the rate of the prior year, the President's Budget Request, or an
appropriation bill passed by either or both Houses of the Congress. Obligations under Continuing
Resolution Authority are usually controlled by apportionment. There is no ―standard‖ CRA
language. Each CRA enacted must be carefully read for the specific provisions pertaining to the
particular fiscal year being addressed.
Contract Change—A change to a contract which requires the contractor to perform additional
work. Contract changes do not include adjustments to pay claims, increases under escalation
costs or corrections for administrative or accounting errors.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     377

system, equipment or item, to provide all or part of the sustainment elements in direct support of
the approved sustainment strategy. It may include work managed and or accomplished by the
government. CLS becomes the sustainment methodology after the Source of Repair Assignment
Process (SORAP), which is used to determine if the permanent source for accomplishment of a
depot level maintenance workload generated by operational equipment will be contract or
organic.
Current or currently available appropriations—An appropriation which is available for new
obligations and has not entered expired status. This includes all unexpired appropriations for
multi-year accounts.

supplying activity in the case of intraappropriation reimbursements.
Customer Account—Funding authority, in addition to financing direct Air Force requirements,
specifically identified for procurement of materiel or services to support customer orders
received. The term "procurement other than Air Force" identifies budget programs within the
procurement appropriations. In other appropriations separately identify "Direct Air Force" and
"Reimbursable".
Customer Programs—Firm, authorized agreements or orders received and accepted by Air
Force to furnish equipment, supplies, and services on a reimbursable basis. Customer programs
may originate at higher headquarters (for example, Grant Aid program and FMS), or at another
agency (for example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), and Coast Guard). Customer programs may also originate at installation
level through tenancy agreements or by receiving a customer order direct from a customer
agency.
Acquisition—The procurement or ownership of real property by any means, such as fee

resources, including the establishment of reserves under the Antideficiency Act, as amended by
the Impoundment and Control Act. Section 1013 of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974
requires a special message from the President to the Congress reporting a proposed deferral of
budget authority. Deferrals may not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the
message reporting the deferral is transmitted and may be overturned by the passage of an
impoundment resolution by either House of Congress.
Development Engineering—Development engineering includes the engineering effort required
to define, develop, optimize, design, integrate, test, evaluate, and verify a new weapon system,
equipment, modification, or other product prior to production. Also applicable to extensive
redesign and requalification of an existing item or system (including embedded ADP systems,
both hardware and software). Development engineering effort should be focused on the
achievement or improvement of the product's performance as defined by the operational
requirements process (see AFI 10-601). Performance requirements include the range of
operational, technical, and support requirements specified in the most current requirements
document (e.g., MENS, SORD, RCM, etc.) provided by the operational command. These
performance requirements include the full range of validated operational requirements, e.g.,
speed, range, payload, reliability, maintainability, cost, etc. across the weapon system's life cycle
as specified in the appropriate requirements document. It is intended to result in the attainment of
a qualified operational configuration baseline before production of the equipment, system or
modification kits.
Direct Air Force Obligation Authority—Authority to incur obligations and expenses for
operating facilities, purchasing of materiel, etc., in direct support of unit missions and for which
reimbursement is not received.

Activity—The lowest organization within the Component which is managed as a single entity,
e.g., Ogden Air Logistic Complex.
Activity Groups— An aggregation of DWCF activities, within a Component (Army, Navy, Air
Force, Defense Agency), that produces similar products and is under the management control of
the same higher level organization and/or individual. Air Force Activity Groups include:
Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group—CSAG is comprised of two divisions:
Maintenance Division (CSAG-Mx) and Supply Division (CSAG-Supply).
Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group—Maintenance Division (CSAG-Mx): The CSAG-
Mx provides repair and other services to customers throughout the Air Force, as well as to other
DoD components, U.S. Government agencies, and foreign governments. The CSAG-Mx repairs
a wide range of customer assets, including aircraft, missiles, aircraft engines, and engine
modules, landing gears, electronics, composites, and computer hardware and software. In
addition, the CSAG-Mx centers are the primary suppliers of repair services to the Supply
Management Activity Group (SMAG-R).
Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group–Supply Division (CSAG-Supply)—The CSAG-
Supply provides policy, guidance, and resources to meet the needs of the Air Force for spare
parts, in war and peace. The CSAG-Supply manages weapons system spare parts, fuels,
equipment, and items used for non-weapon system applications.
Supply Management Activity Group—Retail (SMAG-R)—The SMAG-R is comprised of
three divisions: General Support, Medical-Dental, and the United States Air Force Academy.
Within these divisions, the SMAG-R manages weapons system spare parts, fuels, medical/dental
supplies and equipment, and items used for non-weapon system applications. Material is
procured from vendors and held in inventory for sale to authorized customers.
Capital Assets—Depreciable equipment acquired at a specific point in time for a determinable
cost of $250,000 or more which is to be used over some period (useful life), the length of which
is estimated to be 2 years or greater and generally, becomes economically worthless (except for
salvage value) at the end of the estimated useful life. The capital investment threshold for Minor
Construction projects is $100,000. The capitalization thresholds differ from the depreciation
thresholds. The depreciation threshold is $100,000 for Automated Data Processing Equipment
(ADPE) (hardware and software) and non-ADPE equipment. The depreciation threshold for
Minor Construction is $20,000.
Common Costs—Costs incurred by multiple business areas or activities, which are payable to a
single entity external to the DWCF. Examples are Military Personnel or General Service
Administration costs.
Corporate Level—The summary of all business areas within a Component.
Cost Goal—The cost, measured at year-end, which may be incurred in the production of a unit
of output.
Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)—USTRANSCOM TWCF transferred from
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Defense-Wide Working Capital Fund responsibility to the Air
Force in FY98. USTRANSCOM provides air, land, and sea transportation for the DoD, both in
time of peace and war. As a unified command, USTRANSCOM exercises combatant command
and peacetime management over the common-user aspects of the global mobility network and

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)—That quantity derived from a mathematical technique used
to determine the optimum (lowest) total variable costs required to order and hold inventory.
When used in connection with multiyear procurement EOQs, the procurement of materiel for
future-year production quantities of items that is not required by procurement leadtimes but is
desirable for economic reasons.
Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535)—DoD activities may place requests (orders) for
materials, work, or services with another DoD component or another federal government agency
under the Economy Act. 31 U.S.C. 1535 requires that obligations recorded against such orders on
the books of the ordering agency be reduced at the end of the period for which the appropriation
is authorized for obligation, to the extent that the agency ordered upon has not incurred
obligations under that order (see DFAS-DE 7000.4-R). This statutory restriction applies only to

The contract is not fully funded if a future-year appropriation is required for delivery of some
components of the end item. (NOTE: Installation funding for procurement appropriation
modifications can be budgeted in the year the installation is to be accomplished.)
Funding Distribution—The process of issuing and limiting authority to incur obligations and
make expenditures. An administrative action, usually within the chain of command,
accomplished within appropriations made by Congress and apportionment limitations established
by OMB (for example, allocation and allotment).

obligation authority to the commands that provide the goods or services to enable them to
finance the cost of the goods or services.
Centrally Collected Reimbursements—Reimbursement transactions collected centrally by a
designated operating agency although the reimbursable order is received or earned at some other
place.

Replacement—Sale of an item that requires replacement to compensate DoD inventories for the
resultant loss of capability or readiness. However, because of a number of circumstances, the
replacement item may not be identical to the item sold. It must, however, be a later series or
"mod" designation of the same basic model or an acceptable substitute item used against the
same inventory objective or authorized acquisition objective in requirements computations. In
this situation, the reimbursement from the sale will be included under reimbursable financing,
but the buy-back of the replacement item must be shown under the direct budget plan.
Replacement-in-Kind—Sale of an item of materiel that requires replacement with an item of
the identical type, model, and series or "mod" designation. In this situation, the reimbursement
from the sale must be included in reimbursable financing at the time of buy-back of the item.

and levels of effort available to an operational test organization (AFI 99-103).
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)— 1. The field test, under realistic combat
conditions, of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the
purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions
for use in combat by typical military users; and the evaluation of the results of such test. (Title
10, Section 139(a)(2)).
2. Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational environment as possible to
estimate the prospective system‘s operational effectiveness, suitability, and operational
capabilities. In addition, OT&E provides information on organization, personnel requirements,
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   391


doctrine, and tactics. It may also provide data to support or verify material in operating
instructions, publications, and handbooks. Note: The generic term OT&E is often substituted for
IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, OUE, or FDE, and depending on the context, can have the same
meaning as those terms (AFI 99-103).
Initial OT&E (IOT&E)—Dedicated Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) conducted on
production, or production representative articles, to determine whether systems are operationally
effective and suitable, and which supports the decision to proceed Beyond Low Rate Initial
Production (BLRIP).
Follow-on OT&E (FOT&E)—FOT&E is the continuation of operational test and evaluation
(OT&E) after IOT&E or QOT&E and is conducted only by AFOTEC. It answers specific
questions about unresolved COIs and test issues; verifies the resolution of deficiencies or
shortfalls determined to have substantial or severe impact(s) on mission operations; or completes
T&E of those areas not finished during OT&E. (AFI 99-103).
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)—A type of operational testing performed by MAJCOM
operational test organizations in support of system acquisition, fielding, and sustainment or in
support of MAJCOM-managed system acquisition (AFI 99-103).
Qualification OT&E (QOT&E)—A tailored type of IOT&E performed on systems for which
there is little to no RDT&E-funded development effort. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), non-
developmental items (NDI), and government furnished equipment (GFE) are tested in this
manner. (AFI 99-103)
Operational Test Agency (OTA)—An independent agency reporting directly to the Service
Chief that plans and conducts operational tests, reports results, and provides evaluations of
overall operational capability of new systems as determined by effectiveness, suitability, and
other operational considerations. Note: each Service has one designated OTA. The Air Force
OTA is the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC). (AFI 99-103)
Test Program Set (TPS)—TPS is the interface equipment which allows automatic test
equipment (ATE) to diagnose the condition or performance level of equipment or systems. TPS
is considered an integral part of the end item.
Production Acceptance Test and Evaluation (PAT&E)—T&E of production items to
demonstrate that items procured fulfill the requirements and specifications of the procuring
contracts or agreements.
Qualification Test and Evaluation (QT&E)—A tailored type of DT&E performed on systems
for which there is little to no RDT&E-funded development effort. Commercial-off-the-shelf
(COTS), non-developmental items (NDI), and government furnished equipment (GFE) are tested
in this manner. (AFI 99-103)
Qualification Tests—Tests that verify the design and manufacturing process and thus provide a
baseline for subsequent acceptance tests (they include both preproduction qualification tests and
production qualification and acceptance tests).
Test Funds—Funds specifically programmed and allocated for test and evaluation preparation,
planning, conduct, and reporting, and issued to a test organization responsible for conducting
T&E activities.

Test Resource Plan (TRP)—The TRP is a resource management document used throughout the
OT&E planning process to identify and coordinate resources required to support testing. TRPs
are prepared and submitted by AFOTEC for all Air Force-directed OT&E. This includes
AFOTEC-conducted, QOT&E, and IOT&E; and HQ USAF-directed, AFOTEC-conducted
FOT&E. The TRP must be coordinated with the program office and all other agencies tasked to
support the test. The TRP is a source of programming information and assures resources in the
plan are properly identified for programming and budgeting by those agencies tasked for support.
Transfer Authority—Authority provided by the Congress to transfer budget authority from one
appropriation or fund account to another.
First Destination Transportation (FDT)— Transportation required to effect the delivery of
materiel from a procurement source (including DoD industrial activities that fabricate new
material, but not if the industrial activity only reworks the item or component) outside the DoD
supply system to the first point at which the Air Force takes possession or ownership. In those
cases where the Air Force accepts a production item at the manufacturer's plant, or source of
production, and legally owns the item, FDT extends to the first point of delivery for either use or
storage. It includes the charges for freight, cartage, and demurrage incurred incident to shipment
of the materiel. Amplifications of this definition are as follows if materiel is:
—Procured within the CONUS, or overseas, for delivery to a CONUS or overseas point of use or
storage, FDT includes all transportation by land, air, and inland or coastal waterways, except that
FDT terminates at the port of embarkation (CONUS or overseas), when the item enters the
Defense Transportation System.
—Incident to a HQ USAF-approved package program (such as Distant Early Warning (DEW)
line, or Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS)) and provided to the contractor by the
Air Force for use or storage at an overseas location, FDT includes all transportation from point
of origin of shipment to the point of use or storage, unless otherwise provided under the terms of
the "package program".
—Materiel procured for, or on behalf of, a coproduction agreement for delivery to an overseas
point of use or storage, FDT includes all transportation from point of origin of shipment (that is,
contractor or government storage) to the overseas point of use or storage. Direct Air Force funds
pay the Air Force share of transportation; the coproduction partners' share must be funded by
reimbursable first destination funds.
Second Destination Transportation—Any transportation other than first destination. It includes
port handling charges and charges for freight, cartage, demurrage (also see paragraph 10.39 &
10.40), and other charges incurred overseas incident to shipment of Air Force property.
Value Engineering—An organized effort directed at analyzing the function of Department of
Defense systems, equipment, facilities, procedures and supplies for the purpose of achieving the
required function at the lowest total cost of effective ownership, consistent with requirements for
performance, reliability, quality, and maintainability. FAR, chapter 1, subchapter G, part 48,
contain guidance for developing VE programs.)
Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP)—A specific cost reduction proposal, developed
and submitted under VE contract provisions by a contractor, that requires a change to the
contract specifications, purchase description, or statement of work.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    393


Value Engineering Incentive Clause—Used in procurement and construction contracts to
motivate contractors to submit proposals for changes in drawings, designs, specifications, or
other contractual requirements for the purpose of stimulating cost reduction and provide for
compensation to contractors if such proposals are accepted.
Value Engineering Program Requirements Clause—A clause used primarily in design and
development contracts and to some extent in production contracts to require the contractor to
perform VE work at a stated level of effort during the course of performance of the contract and
to provide compensation for performance of such work and to share in resultant savings. The
contract will identify this requirement as a separate line item.
Value Engineering Proposal (VEP)—A specific proposal by Air Force personnel for economic
improvement through the use of VE techniques. The term can also be applied to contractor-
generated proposals that do not require a contract change to be implemented.
Warrant—The official document issued pursuant to law by the Secretary of the Treasury that
establishes the amount of money authorized to be withdrawn from the Treasury.
Weapon System Engineering—Weapon system engineering is the application of scientific and
engineering principles required to transform military requirements into operationally suitable
hardware and software products. Weapon system engineering includes the definition,
optimization, design, integration, interface control, test, verification, production, delivery and
support of the product throughout its life cycle (see Air Force Supplement 1 to DoDI 5000.02).

                                          Attachment 2
    STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE FOR RESOURCE
                            MANAGERS

A2.1. Attachment 2 provides Air Force financial management guidance to resource managers.
This guidance applies to resource managers at all levels and provides the broad guidelines for
managers to carry out their mission responsibilities. Provide a copy of this statement to
commanders at all levels down to and including detachment commanders.
A2.2. Each Air Force commander and manager is responsible for the effective, efficient, and
economical use of all resources made available to his or her organization. The extent to which
each commander and manager directly influences the budgeting, allocation, composition, and
distribution of these resources depends on the degree of centralization of authority. The degree of
centralization is the prerogative of each echelon of command and is determined by the mission
needs, the resources involved, and managerial environment. Regardless of the level of
centralization, operating level managers are directly involved and responsible for managing the
resources used.
A2.3. Some resources may appear to be a cost-free asset in the view of the lower level manager,
because this manager may not either control the determination or allocation of these resources
(real property, weapon systems, and manpower) or may not have the authority to change the mix
of the total resources allocated. In these instances, the manager's principal responsibility is to
insure that these resources are used in the most cost effective manner. Managers need to be
aware of the composition of the total resources of the base, responsibility center or cost center.
All resources at operating locations are either directly controllable or there use is directly
influenced by managers.
A2.4. There are positive means for a manager to directly influence the effectiveness, efficiency,
and economy with which all resources are used to perform assigned missions and operations.
The individual manager assists in budget formulation and resource allocation by recommending
the best mix of resources to secure the most efficient use of available resources. Each manager
should take an active part in the formulation and execution of operating budgets. Participatory
management includes the use of resource advisors in each responsibility center and a financial
management and working committee structure to advise and assist the commander in the
decision-making process. The comptroller assists the manager by assuring fiduciary accounting
and control of obligations and providing expense data through the accounting system. Both
obligation and expense data are important because each involves distinct but related aspects of
financial management. Managers must have obligation data to monitor availability of funds.
Expense data is important because this is the basis for measuring performance of the
organization. Relating expenses to production for a given period tells a manager how well the
manager has done compared to a standard or to past activity. In most instances, expenses are the
same as obligations during execution of the operating budget as relates to the use of resources.
The comptroller also provides training in resource management and in the use of expense data in
financial management.
A2.5. The operation and maintenance (O&M) type appropriations finance most of the day-to-
day cost of running an Air Force base. There are a variety of factors that influence the degree to
which managers decide how these funds will be applied. The flying hour program, civilian
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     395


personnel authorizations, facility project approval, command directed TDY, and other
nonfinancial constraints determine to a large extent how a base uses its O&M dollars. Among all
the funds the Air Force receives, these O&M appropriations offer the highest degree of control to
managers.
A2.6. Civilian personnel costs can be influenced because requests for authorizations are initiated
by managers. The manager has the prerogative to recommend a future trade of this resource for
other resources. Civilian grade structure and overtime are controllable at base level.
A2.7. Managers either control or significantly influence utilities, transportation,
communications, contractual services, supplies, and equipment funds. Significant management
flexibility exists in these areas. Aviation Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant (POL) costs are tied
directly to flying hours. Managers can influence these costs by efficient scheduling of
proficiency, operational, and training flights.
A2.8. Managers have direct control over a portion of TDY funds; basically the control is
exercised over administrative TDY and mode of travel, depending on the base mission.
Command-directed TDY may use some of these funds; however, managers can be selective as to
the number of travelers and the mode of transportation.
A2.9. Military personnel selection, assignment and funds are centrally controlled as a basic
policy of Air Force operations. The costs of military personnel are properly expensed as part of
the financial data provided to managers at all levels. Military personnel are a key resource of the
manager. The manager`s effectiveness in controlling on the job training (OJT), career
management, motivation, and personnel productivity are the key factors to the productivity of the
total system. It is essential that the manager knows the costs of military personnel resources that
go into mission performance. By maintaining surveillance over the total military personnel
program, the manager can influence the costs for military personnel through effective use of
personnel complementing the central assignment and funding policies.
A2.10. The advent of the Defense Working Capital Fund (formerly DBOF) in FY 1992
represents a significant change in the way we program, budget and execute support dollars
within the Department of Defense. The DWCF concept expands the use of revolving funds in the
DoD to cover many functions previously funded with direct appropriations, and then charges the
cost of these functions to the primary mission component that benefits from them. The method
develops a provider/consumer relationship for support elements where the customer has much
more control over the source of supply and can weigh alternatives on the bases of cost efficiency
and product effectiveness.
   A2.10.1. The concept has a two-fold focus. First, the DWCF identifies more of the support
   costs directly to the weapon systems that are supported, giving a more complete picture of
   the true costs of systems' support. Second, the concept fosters a more entrepreneurial spirit in
   the operation of DWCF "business areas", with more focus on cost control benefiting the
   customers through lower rates.
   A2.10.2. The method of distributing financial authority and fixing responsibility in the
   DWCF environment is through the principle of unit cost resourcing. As a typical example, a
   DWCF business area is provided a budget document that permits that activity to incur costs
   as a percentage of sales revenue. There is no obligation authority or operating budget
   authority as in the appropriated fund environment. This method allows each business activity
 396                                                         AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012


   to respond to the demands of its customers and promotes a more cost oriented focus across
   the support spectrum. In addition, there are other support elements which are not part of the
   DWCF but which are funded on the basis of both an obligation authority and a unit cost goal.
A2.11. An integral part of the entire resource management process is performance evaluation
and productivity measurement by the manager. Individual managers and commanders must have
tools, techniques, and analytical support required to interpret the data available and make
judgments as to performance. The comptroller assists both in this phase of resource management.
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                   397


                                         Attachment 3
                   ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES (A&AS)

A3.1. Public Law 102-394, as implemented in OMB Circular A-11, requires that obligations for
consulting service for the prior year through the budget year be submitted annually to the
Congress as a separate object class (Object Class 25.1). The purpose of the exhibit is to provide
Congress with actual estimates on the amount spent by DoD on consulting services which are
utilized to enhance, assist, or improve the ability of government employees to make decisions on
governmental processes, programs, and systems.
A3.2. All commands and FOAs must submit annual budget exhibits identifying amounts
budgeted and obligated for three categories of services: Management and Professional Support
Services; Studies, Analyses, and Evaluations; and Engineering and Technical Services. Special
instructions for preparing the exhibit and for submission dates to SAF/FMB are in DoD
7000.14R, Volume 2, Chapter 19 (see paragraph A3.4), and in guidance issued annually by
SAF/FMB.
A3.3. Reporting requirements for A&AS are exempt from licensing according to Volume 2 of
DoD FMR 7000.14-R. Also see DoD 8910.1-M, Department of Defense Procedures for
Management of Information Requirements.

                                          Attachment 4
                             DEFERRALS AND RESCISSIONS

A4.1. DoD Comptroller Guidance on Deferrals and Rescission (from DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
Volume 3, Chapter 2, Paragraph 0207, January 2011) See paragraphs A4.2 through A4.4
A4.2. Deferrals:
   A4.2.1. "1. Available budgetary resources may be withheld from obligation temporarily
   through the apportionment process with the intent of apportioning them for use later, before
   they lapse. Such deferral action may be taken by OMB on its own initiative or at the request
   of agencies. Budgetary resources may be deferred as reserves to provide for contingencies
   under provisions of the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1512, formerly 31 U.S.C. 665); or
   they may be deferred for other reasons under the Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. 681
   through 688, formerly 31 U.S.C. 1403), except that funds available for only one fiscal year
   may not be deferred throughout the year."
   A4.2.2. "2. All funds deferred through the apportionment process must be reported to the
   Congress in special messages. The Congress may overturn a deferral at any time by passing a
   law disapproving the deferral. If the Congress takes no action to disapprove reported
   deferrals, those deferrals may remain in effect until the end of the fiscal year unless a special
   message indicates that an earlier release is planned. For annual accounts and the last year of
   multiple-year accounts, however, funds may be deferred only for part of the year."
   A4.2.3. "3. As the fourth quarter approaches, Components should review all deferrals
   (particularly of funds expiring at the end of the year) to ensure that amounts deferred for only
   part of the year will be released in time to be used prudently before the year ends. If a
   determination is made that such amounts should not be used, a rescission will be proposed
   prior to the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Only in exceptional cases will rescissions
   be proposed during the fourth quarter. All proposed rescissions must be approved by OMB."
   A4.2.4. "4. If amounts actually becoming available are less than anticipated for indefinite
   budget authority, transfers, reimbursements, or recoveries, the difference will be deducted
   from amounts apportioned and not from amounts deferred or otherwise unapportioned, unless
   specific provision is made for a different treatment on the approved apportionment form or
   reapportionment action is taken. Whenever it is determined that a deferred amount will not
   be required to carry out the purposes of the appropriation or other authority, it will be
   recommended for rescission as required by law (31 U.S.C. 1512 and 2 U.S.C. 683)."
A4.3. Rescissions:
   A4.3.1. "1. The Impoundment Control Act specifies that, whenever the President determines
   that all or part of any budget authority will not be required to carry out the full objectives or
   scope of programs for which it is provided, the President will propose to Congress that the
   funds be rescinded. Likewise, if all or part of any budget authority limited to a fiscal year
   (e.g., annual appropriations or budget authority for the last year of multiple-year accounts) is
   to be reserved for the entire fiscal year, a rescission will be proposed. Budget authority may
   also be proposed for rescission for fiscal policy or other reasons. Generally, amounts
   proposed for rescission will be withheld during the time the proposals are being considered
AFI65-601V1 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    399


   by the Congress. This may be accomplished through OMB apportionment action or through
   agency withholding action. "
   A4.3.2. "2. All funds proposed for rescission, including those withheld, must be reported to
   Congress in special messages. Positive action in the form of an enacted law must be
   completed to rescind funds. If both Houses of Congress have not completed action on a
   rescission proposed by the President within 45 calendar days of continuous session, any
   funds being withheld must be made available for obligation."
A4.4. DoD Comptroller Guidance on Deferrals:
   A4.4.1. "1. OMB Circular A-34 recognizes the possibility of agency deferrals that are not
   identified in connection with the apportionment process. These are categorized as deferrals of
   funds provided for a specific purpose or project when such deferral would result in obligation
   for such specific purpose of project at a pace significantly slower than intended by the
   Congress. Since it is the policy of the Secretary of Defense to obligate programs consistent
   with the expressed intent of the Congress, this category of action should not take place within
   the Department. Strict adherence to this policy, however, does not preclude the continuance
   of prudent administrative actions reflected on financial authorizations that affect the timing
   of obligations for reasons related to the routine financial management of an appropriation,
   program, or project or to comply with procurement regulations or sound procurement
   practices. Any action taken in this regard must consider the intent of the Congress in
   providing funds as the primary criterion in determining whether a reportable deferral exists.
   Accordingly, the DoD agency responsible for such actions must, at all times, be ready to
   support these judgments to any reviewing authority."

                         PHASES OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

A5.1. Congressional authorization of major construction projects typically represents
accumulation of planning, programming, and budgeting efforts.
   A5.1.1. First identify a need for additional facilities.
   A5.1.2. Define the need, rank the priority, and compete the projects for available resources.
   A5.1.3. Start the project definition at the installation level and move the project through the
   chain of command for budget submission. Table A5.1 shows the life cycle of a military
   construction project and the 3 to 7 years' process of acquiring a military facility from
   conception to completion.
   A5.1.4. The actual design phase lasts 1 to 2 1/2 years, while the construction phase could
   take 1 to 5 years.
   A5.1.5. The remaining time is to plan, program, budget, design, construct, and financial
   close out. However, the total construction process consists of four phases: planning and
   programming, budgeting, design and construction. (See AFI 32-1021 for details on military
   construction phases.)
A5.2. Table A5.1. portrays these phases.

         BASE CLOSURE: COMPTROLLER DEACTIVATION CHECKLIST

A6.1. As a guide, the installation comptroller normally performs the following deactivation
activities:
   A6.1.1. Ensure continuity of comptroller functions needed to support operational
   requirements during phase down and deactivation.
   A6.1.2. Coordinate with other staff functional areas to determine fund requirements needed
   to support closure plans, and ensure that such funds are available.
   A6.1.3. Ensure that an adequate number of qualified comptroller personnel remain in place
   to effectively manage comptroller supports requirements during phase down and
   deactivation.
   A6.1.4. Suspense and control submission of all OPRs, EPRs, and award recommendations
   well before the CBPO cutoff. Contact local military and civilian personnel offices, as
   necessary to resolve questions concerning military and civilian personnel offices.
   A6.1.5. Designate individual to be responsible for documentation of unit phase out and
   submission of lessons learned.
   A6.1.6. Advise Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) representative of base closure.
   A6.1.7. Notify commanders of the importance of early identification of losses so required
   reports can be initiated.
   A6.1.8. Notify survey officers to expedite processing of outstanding reports of survey and
   government property loss or damage (GPLD) certificates.
   A6.1.9. Close military finance facility. Notify command and DFAS.
   A6.1.10. Determine closeout vice transfer of orderly room functions.

           FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT AND AUDIT READINESS (FIAR)

A7.1. The following guidance must be adhered to:
   A7.1.1. AF Form 1269, Request for Load or Change in Fund Targets – you are required to
   use the AF Form 1269 and to maintain all supporting documentation for individual
   transactions. Note the AF Form 1269 must be signed by a designated approving official,
   which is applicable to all transactions loaded into GAFS-BQ, whether the result of a new
   Funding Authorization Document (FAD), realignments (including realignments between
   Elements of Expense) or the correction of errors. The original AF Form 1269 must be
   annotated, with the correction action taken. In those cases where a feeder system (i.e. B-
   Tools) creates a target load sheet, that document may be used providing it contains all of the
   required data elements along with preparer/approver signatures and dates.
   A7.1.2. Delegation of Authority – personnel who approve the loading and distribution of
   funds must have a signed delegation of authority memorandum. Additionally, those
   personnel loading funds into the accounting system must have the proper authority
   documented (DD Form 2875).
   A7.1.3. Field Level End of Month Reconciliation, AFM to GAFS-BL – at the end of each
   month, MAJCOMs and Bases are required to reconcile annual and quarterly authority with
   supporting documentation. This includes timely resolution of ―out of balance‖ conditions,
   maintaining electronic or hard copy of the reconciliations, and evidence of approval by
   personnel at the appropriate level (as further supported by proper delegation of authority
   documentation). Monthly reconciliations must also include all funding withholds and
   reimbursements. Additionally, all tenant units loading their own targets must submit a copy
   of their AFM and PBAS funding documents to the host FM organization. For all
   appropriations, SAF/FMB, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve will suspend issuing of
   Budget Authority (BA) documents by close of business on the 23rd of each month in order to
   allow field organizations time to balance before end of month closeout. The only exception
   to this BA cutoff date will be any bonafide emergency requirement validated by SAF/FMB
   (or by NGB/FMA or AF/RECB).
   A7.1.4. Intermediary Funding Points (IFPs) – starting in FY13, all IFP‘s must distribute
   funds to applicable execution OBAN‘s; they cannot load targets or execute dollars (they will
   serve instead as a pass-thru to the executing OBAN‘s).
   A7.1.5. Interface Files from AFM to GAFS – MAJCOMs and Intermediary Funding Points
   should send an interface file to GAFS each month (instructions are in the AFM Help
   Manual).
   A7.1.6. Sales Codes – proper use of sales codes assists Air Force‘s financial reporting by
   identiying the customer, while also contributing to the Federal government-wide effort to
   reconcile inter-governmental transactions. Because there are no automated controls in place
   to ensure the sales code field is populated correctly, you will need to develop a manual
   internal control; this control must be documented and retained.
