          ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT

1.1. Purpose of AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management. The
purpose of this instruction is to implement direction from the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) as outlined in Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1/20-1, Acquisition and
Sustainment Life Cycle Management. The primary mission of the Integrated Life Cycle
Management (ILCM) Enterprise is to provide seamless governance, transparency and integration
of all aspects of weapons systems acquisition and sustainment management. This instruction
must be used in conjunction with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-601, Capabilities-Based
Requirements Development, AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation, AFI 63-1201,
Life Cycle Systems Engineering, and AFI 20-101, Logistics Strategic Planning Procedures, to
provide an integrated framework for the implementation of ILCM.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to the management of all programs identified on the
Acquisition Master List (AML) and Sustainment Program Master List (SPML), space programs,
designated weapon systems cited in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, and systems, activities, and projects that support warfighter
capability planning and validated needs. Note: Until updated and throughout this document, the
AML previously known as the APML refer to the same list. All roles and responsibilities
associated with the APML are transferred to the AML introduced in section 3.10.
   1.2.1. Unless otherwise specified, for the purpose of this document, the term Program will be
   used to identify any program on the APML or SPML, space systems, designated product
   groups, and other specified system or subsystem activities including Special Access
   Programs unless otherwise excluded. Due to their unique nature requiring additional security
   measures, Special Access Programs shall follow guidance regarding reporting, coordination,
   and use of specified tools, systems, and databases only to the extent practicable and as
   coordinated with Assistant Secretary of the AF (Acquisition), Directorate of Special
   Programs (SAF/AQL) and approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).
   1.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, for the purpose of this document, the term Program
   Manager (PM) will be synonymous with System Program Manager (SPM), or Product Group
   Manager (PGM) as applicable to a program.
   1.2.3. Unless otherwise specified, this instruction applies to the management of space
   systems, except as amended by DoD guidance. MDAs retain the right to tailor guidance to
   fit the particular conditions of an individual program consistent with applicable laws and
   regulations.
1.3. The Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM) Framework. ILCM is the overarching
system of concepts, methods, and practices used by the Air Force to effectively manage systems
from need identification through final disposal and shall be applied to Air Force acquisition and
sustainment activities. ILCM shall be composed of seamless and transparent governance, core
and enabling processes to acquire and sustain systems, subsystems, end-items, and services to
satisfy validated needs. The goals of ILCM are to recapitalize Air Force capabilities through
maximum acquisition cycle time efficiency, provide agile support that will optimize fielded
capabilities and the supply chain, minimize the logistics footprint, and reduce total ownership
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          13


cost. The ILCM framework as illustrated in Figure 1.1 consists of: 1) an ILCM Executive
Forum; 2) enterprise and business system execution; and 3) program execution and support. The
framework provides an overarching management structure that integrates across systems,
portfolios, and management levels in order to effectively influence and execute life cycle
decisions in response to capability shortfalls. The six ILCM tenets outlined below provide the
governing management principles necessary for the execution of the ILCM Framework. These
tenets as applied to the framework are primary contributors to satisfying the Air Force Strategic
Objective ―Recapitalizing and modernizing our aging aircraft, satellites, and equipment … to
optimize the military utility of our systems to better meet 21st Century challenges.‖ (Air Force
Strategic Plan, 2006-2008, page 7)

Figure 1.1. Integrated Life Cycle Management Framework.




1.4. The ILCM Tenets. The six tenets of ILCM are life cycle planning and integration;
expectation management; collaborative and continuous requirements management; life cycle
systems engineering; technology planning and insertion; and continual, integrated testing.
Enabling principles necessary for successful application of the ILCM tenets are listed below and
detailed in AFPAM 63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management
[when published].
   1.4.1. Life Cycle Planning and Integration. ILCM ensures the program is actively
   managed throughout its entire lifespan, from conception and requirements generation, to
   technology and product development and testing, and throughout manufacturing and field
   operations until the system or product is retired and disposed. Three major parallel
   management and execution structures support life cycle planning and integration:
   Capabilities Based Requirements Development, System Acquisition and Sustainment and
   Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation. This execution framework provides a roadmap for
   the ILCM stakeholders and process owners to use in the integrated management of programs
   across their entire life cycle.
   1.4.2. Expectation Management. Expectation management establishes program credibility
   and accountability through formal, recurring communication among stakeholders and is the
   cornerstone of the ILCM process. Significant reasons to actively manage expectations are 1)
   developers, users, and sustainers often interpret requirements differently, 2) program changes
   occur throughout development and are not always documented which impacts cost, schedule,
 14                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   performance, and risk which affect end-item deliverables, 3) different users may have
   different views of probability of success, and 4) expectations can drift apart over time
   through leadership/personnel changes.
   1.4.3. Collaborative and Continuous Requirements Management. Collaborative
   requirements development requires the user, acquirer, enterprise architect, developer, tester,
   and sustainer to operate as one team. Continuous management is monitoring and controlling
   the weapon system requirements baseline throughout the program life cycle. While the user
   is responsible for identifying the required capability, this must be accomplished in a
   collaborative environment with all stakeholders in order to understand and communicate the
   ―art of the possible.‖ The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)
   process identified in CJCSI 3170.01, Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System,
   is closely integrated with the acquisition process and exists to identify, develop, and validate
   defense-related requirements.
   1.4.4. Life Cycle Systems Engineering. Life cycle systems engineering is the overarching
   process governing the transition from a stated capability need to an operationally effective
   and suitable system. Systems engineering addresses architecture, requirements development
   and management, design, technical management and control, and test and evaluation (T&E) /
   verification and validation (V&V). It is the integrating mechanism for balanced solutions.
   The systems engineering process begins early in concept definition and covers all efforts
   across all life cycle phases, to include sustainment and disposal.
   1.4.5. Technology Planning and Insertion. Technology planning and insertion is the
   timely maturation and incorporation of relevant technology throughout the program life cycle
   to ensure an operationally effective and suitable system. Technology planning and the
   assessment of technology readiness levels include consideration of such factors as reliability,
   producibility, testability, sustainability and operational performance. Successful technology
   planning and insertion as part of program life cycle management results in higher fidelity
   time phased requirements with a more realistic schedule and improved cost estimates.
   1.4.6. Continual, Integrated Testing. Continual, integrated testing structures T&E to
   reduce the time it takes to field effective and suitable systems by providing qualitative and
   quantitative information to decision makers throughout the program‘s life cycle. Integrated
   testing minimizes the distinction between contractor, developmental, and operational testing
   by implementing integrated testing techniques and objectives to the maximum extent
   possible. Key stakeholders share all information in open T&E databases, identify problems
   early, engage contractors to fix deficiencies sooner, and ensure systems are ready to enter
   dedicated operational testing and fielding with a high probability of success.
1.5. Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Framework. This section summarizes the key
acquisition and sustainment activities that occur in each phase of the ILCM framework. A multi-
functional collaborative effort between the requirements, acquisition and sustainment, and test
communities is necessary for weapon system life cycle management; as illustrated in Figure 1.2.
This section provides an overview of key acquisition and sustainment activities throughout the
life cycle management phases. Details on key acquisition and sustainment activities can be
found in the body of this document and other supporting documentation. For more information
regarding requirements, test and evaluation, systems engineering and logistics activities, refer to
AFI 10-601, Capabilities-Based Requirements Development, AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based

Strategic Planning Procedures. For more information regarding information technology
management and compliance refer to the applicable 33 series documents describing information
technology (IT) acquisition and Chief Information Officer (CIO) compliance requirements.
   1.5.1. User Needs and Technology Opportunities. The purpose of this timeframe is to
   identify and validate mission needs and to examine promising technology concepts.
   Involvement of the acquisition and sustainment community, especially systems engineering
   subject matter experts, starts with participation in the requirements development process and
   pre-materiel solution analysis phase activities described in AFI 10-601, CJCSI 3170.01 Joint
   Capabilities Integration and Development System, the JCIDS Manual, and CJCSI 6212.01,
   Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security
   Systems. Key activities include conducting capabilities based assessments (CBA),
   identifying capability gaps and shortfalls, developing the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)
   Study Plan, and the development of the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).
       1.5.1.1. Identifying Capability Gaps and Shortfalls. The user, with support from the
       acquisition and sustainment community, identifies capability shortfalls or the need to
       develop a new technology that will enhance war fighting capability. The process used to
       identify shortfalls is governed by CJCSI 3170.01, the JCIDS Manual, and AFI 10-604,
       Capabilities-Based Planning.
       1.5.1.2. Technology Concepts. Promising technologies are identified from all foreign
       and domestic sources, including government laboratories and centers, academia, and the
       commercial sector. Initial science and technology investments support the maturation of
       concepts allowing for introduction of materiel solutions into the weapon system life
       cycle.
       1.5.1.3. Development Planning (DP). DP is the materiel contribution to AF or AF-led
       capability planning. It considers the entire product/system life cycle (pre-concept to
       disposal) but brings its greatest leverage prior to the Materiel Development Decision
       (MDD). DP collaboratively identifies and develops concepts (prospective materiel
       solutions) in response to operational capability needs, and provides early acquisition
       involvement in support of the lead command to ensure initiation of high-confidence
       programs. DP performed in support of prioritized capability needs should generate
       alternative concepts with a range of performance and cost parameters, ensuring AF
       leadership is offered trade space for portfolio and risk management. Some DP is also
       performed proactively, in anticipation of future needs.
       1.5.1.4. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study Guidance. The AoA Study Guidance,
       developed by the Lead Operational MAJCOM or other sponsoring office and supported
       by the Office of Aerospace Studies (OAS), describes how materiel alternative solutions
       will be analyzed during the Materiel Solution Analysis phase.
       1.5.1.5. Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Development. Acquisition and
       sustainment personnel participate in the development of the requirements strategy
       through the requirements development High Performance Team (HPT) process. At the
       Requirements Strategy Review (RSR), the ICD sponsor must identify the proposed AF
       funding strategy for the Materiel Solution Analysis and Technology Development
       Phases.
 16                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


Figure 1.2. Integrated Life Cycle Execution Framework (Acronyms in Atch 1).




      1.5.1.6. Both the ICD and the AoA Study Guidance must be presented to the MDA for
      entry into the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase. By this point in the process, acquisition
      and sustainment personnel should have a thorough understanding of the users‘ desired
      capabilities, and users should have a realistic understanding of what is technically
      possible. The sustainment community, in collaboration with the user, needs to address
      reliability, availability and maintainability to ensure life cycle mission capability and
      supportability.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          17


     1.5.1.7. When the ICD is completed and validated, the user will forward a copy to the
     MDA and HQ AFMC (for non-space programs). The MDA, working with appropriate
     stakeholders, determines if there is sufficient information to proceed with a Materiel
     Development Decision (MDD) and entry into Materiel Solution Analysis.
     1.5.1.8. Mission assignment usually takes place at this point, including identification of a
     PM who will have responsibility from issuance of the Materiel Development Decision
     until the effort is officially established as a program at Milestone (MS) B.
     1.5.1.9. The MDA decision to begin Materiel Solution Analysis DOES NOT mean that a
     new acquisition program has been initiated.
  1.5.2. Materiel Solution Analysis Phase. The purpose of this phase is to assess potential
  materiel solutions and to satisfy the phase-specific entry criteria for the next program
  milestone designated by the MDA. This phase begins with the Materiel Development
  Decision. Entrance into this phase depends upon an approved ICD resulting from the
  analysis of current mission performance and an analysis of potential concepts. Activities
  during this phase are in preparation for a MS-A decision.
     1.5.2.1. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). AoAs document the rationale for identifying a
     preferred solution or solutions to the capability shortfalls. The MDA approves the AoA
     study guidance, but the operational Major Command (MAJCOMs) (or other sources) are
     responsible for AoA execution. The AoAs should clearly articulate performance,
     schedule, and cost expectations as well as initial risk assessment of the program to ensure
     expectations are known and agreed to up front.
  1.5.3. Technology Development The Technology Development starts at MS-A when the
  MDA has approved the TDS. The purpose of this phase is to reduce technology risk,
  determine the appropriate set of technologies to be integrated into a full system, demonstrate
  critical technology elements (CTE) on prototypes, and complete a preliminary design.
  Activities during this phase are in preparation for a MS-B decision.
     1.5.3.1. Assessing Technology Readiness. Technology is required to be demonstrated in
     a relevant environment to be considered mature enough to use for product development
     after MS-B. The analysis to show this is documented in a Technology Readiness
     Assessment (TRA).
     1.5.3.2. DELETED.
  1.5.4. Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). The EMD starts after approval
  of MS-B. The purpose of the EMD is to develop an increment of capability; complete
  system integration; validate producibility and manufacturing processes; posture for life cycle
  sustainment; ensure affordability; and demonstrate system integration, interoperability,
  safety, and utility. Activities during these phases are in preparation for a MS-C decision.
     1.5.4.1. Integrated System Design. Guided by the CDD and SEP, this effort defines
     system and system-of-systems functionality and interfaces, completes hardware and
     software detailed design, reduces system-level risk and establishes product baselines for
     all configuration items. This effort culminates in the system-level Critical Design
     Review (CDR). Successful completion of the CDR ends Integrated System Design and
 18                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       continues the EMD phase into System Capability and Manufacturing Process
       Demonstration.
       1.5.4.2. Final Depot Source of Repair (DSOR). An important outcome of the
       demonstration phase will be the generation of the final DSOR. A DSOR decision for all
       depot-level maintenance for hardware and software, with special attention to Title 10
       USC §2464 (Core Capability) and Title 10 USC §2466 (50/50 Requirements), is essential
       to the life cycle sustainment strategy. DSOR decisions and programmed resources are
       required prior to MS-C for new depot capabilities.
       1.5.4.3. Capability Production Document (CPD) Development. The CPD provides firm,
       measurable, and testable requirements necessary to support production and sustainment
       of an increment of capability. The ICD, AoA/ Courses of Action (COA), CDD, testing
       results, and critical design reviews guide CPD development.
   1.5.5. Production and Deployment. The Production and Deployment starts after approval of
   MS-C. The purpose of the Production and Deployment phase is to demonstrate operational
   effectiveness and suitability and to achieve an operational capability. During this phase
   several key decisions and activities will take place in preparation for the Full Rate Production
   (FRP) decision and subsequent entry into the Operations and Support Phase.
       1.5.5.1. Materiel Fielding. The materiel fielding process integrates asset production and
       support activities conducted by the program office with asset acceptance/beddown,
       deployment, operation, and sustainment planning activities conducted by the user. The
       PM leads this process, with significant support from the user and sustainment
       communities for field and depot support. The objective is to ensure an orderly transition
       of assets from the production line to the user‘s operating location(s).
   1.5.6. Post Implementation Review (PIR). The purpose of the PIR is to compare actual
   system performance to program expectations and mission realities based upon the operational
   environment and Concept of Operation (CONOPS). PIR activities may be accomplished in
   the context of typical program acquisition activities or system operational processes. The
   initial PIR is held after IOC but prior to Full Operational Capability (FOC).
       1.5.6.1. Full Sustainment. Full sustainment is achieved when all the requirements of the
       sustainment strategy are in place to satisfy the established mission requirements for full
       operational capability (FOC) of the fielded system in accordance with (IAW) the LCMP.
       The PM in collaboration with the Lead Command and AFMC documents the full
       sustainment criteria in the LCMP and/or Materiel Fielding Plan (MFP).
1.6. Acquisition and Sustainment Organizations. Various organizations facilitate the
acquisition and sustainment of weapon systems through their life cycle. Figure 1.3 identifies the
relationships of primary Air Force organizations involved in ILCM acquisition and sustainment
activities. While the acquisition and ―command‖ lines of authority are distinct, they often reside
simultaneously with the same individuals. It is the responsibility of each commander/director to
ensure separate authority lines are kept clean and processes are streamlined. (NOTE: Figure 1.3
only indicates organizational relationships and is NOT a formal command or organization
structure diagram.)
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                             19


1.7. Integrated Life Cycle Management Chain of Authority. All Air Force (AF) programs
shall have a clear and unambiguous governance chain of authority. The management structure
shall be streamlined and characterized by short, clearly defined lines of responsibility, authority,
and accountability. Acquisition management responsibility for all Acquisition Category (ACAT)
programs flows from the Service Acquisition Executive to the Program Executive Officer or
Designated Acquisition Official to the accountable Program Manager. In no case shall there be
more than two levels of review between the Program Manager and the Milestone Decision

   (Chapter 3) or the agency responsible for deploying new or modified mission capabilities to
   the location.
   2.37.3. Facilitate LCL fact-finding trips and/or site surveys. Ensure hardware interface
   requirements, proper utilization of power, backup power, heating, ventilation and air
   conditioning requirements; rack cooling and floor space utilization are adequately addressed
   and documented. Note: AFISRA/A5C facilitates basing actions (i.e., stand-ups, moves,
   stand-downs, etc.).
   2.37.4. Participate in mission capability testing/demonstration activities.
   2.37.5. Coordinate pre- and post- deployment issues, up through acceptance of a mission
   capability through the program manager, AFCO, AFISRA staff organizations, and/or the
   respective Wing/Group LCL representatives, as applicable.

            ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT LIFE CYCLE READINESS

Section 3A—Acquisition and Sustainment Processes

3.1. Acquisition and Sustainment Processes Overview. The Program Manager (PM) has to
assess and balance multiple process requirements from this guidance and other DOD and
Headquarters Air Force (HAF) issuances. This section contains acquisition and sustainment
process requirements applicable to Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM). Critical
processes within the ILCM enterprise must be standardized to provide repeatable and predictable
results. Process owners shall engage policy Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPRs) to ensure
that standardized processes are codified in appropriate HAF or MAJCOM issuances. Additional
detail on specific documents, requirements, limitations, and activities is presented in later
sections.
3.2. Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Decisions, Certifications, and Reviews. The
MDA may tailor program strategies and oversight, including documentation of program
information, life cycle phases, the timing and scope of decision reviews, and decision levels to fit
particular conditions of that program, consistent with applicable laws and regulations and the
time sensitivity of the capability need. All tailoring decisions will be documented by the PM and
approved by the MDA. The MDA will consider total life cycle factors such as the program‘s
cost, funding, risk, schedule, importance to the user, technical complexity, information support,
and program interfaces when making programmatic decisions. The MDA will conduct program
reviews to assess the adequacy of all life cycle strategies, planning, and documents. The goal of
program reviews is to provide the MDA sufficient, near real-time information that enables the
MDA to provide direction without the need for formal oversight. At the request of the MDA
and/or PM, all supporting functional staffs will provide resources and advice as appropriate.
MDAs will review at least semi-annually any MDAP that has exceeded critical cost growth
thresholds but has not been terminated, until one year after the date on which the program
receives a new milestone approval.
   3.2.1. Tailoring Regulatory Information and Procedures. The MDA may tailor DODI
   5000.02 regulatory program information (Enclosure 4, Statutory and Regulatory Information
   and Milestone Requirements) to fit the particular conditions of an individual program. The
   MDA and PM may tailor AF Departmental guidance only to the extent provided in each
   applicable directive. Non-compliance with Departmental guidance requires the PM to notify
   the appropriate HAF organization as outlined in AFPD 63-1/20-1.
   3.2.2. All acquisition and sustainment execution requirements, processes, procedures, or
   activities which require resources and are not required by statutes, executive orders, DOD
   issuances, Air Force directive issuances, or previously approved through the programmatic
   chain of command, must add value to the mission. Organizations outside the programmatic
   chain provide support and advice to the decision makers. If the PM analysis indicates a
   functional requirement does not add value, the PM can require the proponent to justify the
   requirement and identify the resources (e.g., materiel, personnel, skills, training, and funding)
   for execution. The functional proponent may appeal a PM determination through the
   programmatic chain up to the MDA. The burden of proof lies with the proponent.

  3.2.3. The MDA shall comply with all program Milestone (MS) certification requirements as
  prescribed by statute or DOD policy.
     3.2.3.1. MS A Certification. The MDA for all MDAPs, without the authority to
     delegate, shall assess the program and sign a certification memorandum prior to MS A
     approval. MDAPs that received MS A approval prior to 22 May 2009 (date of enactment
     of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009) and have not yet reached MS B
     must complete MS A certification as described herein prior to 22 May 2010. The
     certification will be completed via a memorandum for the record and will include the
     statements in 10 USC §2366a without modification.
         3.2.3.1.1. For MDAP programs the MDA certifies at MS A:
            3.2.3.1.1.1. The program fulfills an approved initial capabilities document.
            3.2.3.1.1.2. The program is being executed by an entity with a relevant core
            competency as identified by the Secretary of Defense
            3.2.3.1.1.3. If the program duplicates a capability already provided by an existing
            system, the duplication provided by such system is necessary and appropriate.
            3.2.3.1.1.4. An AoA has been performed consistent with the study guidance
            developed by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation.
            3.2.3.1.1.5. That a cost estimate for the program has been submitted with the
            concurrence of Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (D,CAPE)
            and that the level of resources required to develop and procure the program is
            consistent with the priority level assigned by the Joint Requirements Oversight
            Council (JROC).
         3.2.3.1.2. In addition to certification, the MDA of MDAP programs shall include the
         following in the ADM for MS A: ―I have made the certifications required by section
         2366a of title 10, United States Code.‖
         3.2.3.1.3. The PM shall notify the MDA if the projected cost of the program, at any
         time prior to MS B approval, exceeds the cost estimate for the program submitted at
         the time of the MS A certification by at least 25 percent or the program manager
         determines that the period of time required for the delivery of an initial operational
         capability is likely to exceed the schedule objective submitted at the time of
         certification by more than 25 percent.
         3.2.3.1.4. The MDA, in consultation with the JROC/AFROC on matters related to
         program requirements and military needs, determines whether the level of resources
         required to develop and procure the system remains consistent with the priority level
         assigned by the JROC/AFROC. The MDA may withdraw the certification concerned
         or rescind MS A approval if the MDA determines that such action is in the interest of
         national defense.
         3.2.3.1.5. The MDA submits to the congressional defense committees within 30 days
         of PM notification of an MDAP cost or schedule growth prior to MS B a report that
         identifies the root causes and appropriate acquisition performance measures and
         includes one of the following:
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            59


            3.2.3.1.5.1. A written certification (with a supporting explanation) stating that the
            program is essential to national security; there are no alternatives to the program
            that will provide acceptable military capability at less cost; new estimates of the
            development cost or schedule, as appropriate, are reasonable; and the
            management structure for the program is adequate to manage and control program
            development cost and schedule.
            3.2.3.1.5.2. A plan for terminating the development of the program or withdrawal
            of MS A approval, if the MDA determines that such action is in the interest of
            national defense.
     3.2.3.2. MS B Certification. The MDA for an MDAP, without the authority to delegate,
     shall assess the program business case and sign a certification memorandum prior to MS
     B approval. MDAPs that received MS B approval prior to 6 Jan 2006 and have not yet
     reached MS C must complete MS B certification as described herein prior to 16 Feb 2010
     or must complete annual certification assessment reviews the time of certification.. The
     certification memorandum shall include the statements in 10 U.S.C. §2366b without
     modification. If the program is initiated at a later date, i.e., MS C, a similar certification
     memorandum shall be prepared. The certification shall be submitted to the congressional
     defense committees with the first Selected Acquisition Report submitted after completion
     of the certification.
        3.2.3.2.1. For MDAP programs the MDA certifies at MS B that:
            3.2.3.2.1.1. The program has received a business case analysis and certifies on
            the basis of the analysis that the program is affordable when considering the
            ability of the Department of Defense to accomplish the program's mission using
            alternative systems.
            3.2.3.2.1.2. Appropriate trade-offs among cost, schedule, and performance
            objectives have been made to ensure that the program is affordable when
            considering the per unit cost and the total acquisition cost in the context of the
            total resources available during the period covered by the future-years defense
            program submitted during the fiscal year in which the certification is made.
            3.2.3.2.1.3. Reasonable cost and schedule estimates have been developed to
            execute, with the concurrence of the Director of Cost Assessment and Program
            Evaluation, the product development and production plan under the program.
            3.2.3.2.1.4. Funding is available to execute the product development and
            production plan under the program, through the period covered by the future-
            years defense program submitted during the fiscal year in which the certification
            is made.
            3.2.3.2.1.5. The program has received a PDR and conducted a formal post-PDR
            assessment, and certifies on the basis of such assessment that the program
            demonstrates a high likelihood of accomplishing its intended mission.
            3.2.3.2.1.6. Appropriate market research has been conducted prior to technology
            development to reduce duplication of existing technology and products.
60                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


            3.2.3.2.1.7. The DOD has completed an analysis of alternatives with respect to
            the program.
            3.2.3.2.1.8. The JROC has accomplished its duties with respect to the program
            including an analysis of the operational requirements for the program.
            3.2.3.2.1.9. The technology in the program has been demonstrated in a relevant
            environment as determined by the MDA on the basis of an independent review
            and assessment by the Director of Defense Research and Engineering.
            3.2.3.2.1.10. The program complies with all relevant policies, regulations, and
            directives of the DOD.
         3.2.3.2.2. In addition to certification, the MDA of MDAP programs shall include the
         following in the ADM for MS B: ―I have reviewed the program and the business case
         analysis and have made the certifications required, or executed a waiver of the
         applicability of one or more of the components of the certification requirement as
         authorized by section 2366b of title 10, United States Code.‖
         3.2.3.2.3. The PM shall notify the MDA immediately of any changes to the program
         that alter the substantive basis for the certification relating to any component of such
         certification or otherwise cause the program to deviate significantly from the material
         provided in support of such a certification. Upon receiving the notification, the MDA
         may withdraw the certification concerned or may rescind MS B approval if the MDA
         determines that such certification approval is no longer valid.
         3.2.3.2.4. Waiver for National Security. The MS B MDA may, at the time of MS B
         approval or at the time of withdrawing a certification or rescinding MS B approval
         waive the applicability of one or more components of the certification requirement if
         the MDA determines that, but for such a waiver, the DOD would be unable to meet
         critical national security objectives. Whenever the MDA makes such a determination
         and authorizes such a waiver:
            3.2.3.2.4.1. The waiver, the determination, and the reasons for the determination
            shall be submitted in writing to the congressional defense committees within 30
            days after the waiver is authorized.
            3.2.3.2.4.2. The MDA shall review the program not less often than annually to
            determine the extent to which the program currently satisfies the certification
            components until such time as the milestone decision authority determines that
            the program satisfies all certification components. All budget requests, budget
            justification material, budget displays, reprogramming requests, Selected
            Acquisition Reports, or other budget documentation or performance reports
            submitted to Congress must prominently and clearly indicate that the program has
            not fully satisfied the certification requirements (until such time as the MDA
            determines that the program has satisfied such certification requirements)..
  3.2.4. Where the course of action, as approved and documented through the programmatic
  chain of command, conflicts with an AFPD, the PM shall submit a request for a waiver to the
  certifying authority for the publication, who will obtain SECAF approval for the waiver if
  warranted. Where the course of action, as approved and documented through the
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                           61


   programmatic chain of command, conflicts with Air Force Departmental directive issuances
   other than AFPDs, the PM shall submit a notification via memorandum to the appropriate
   SAF/AQ Capability Directorate, SAF/USA or AF/A4L for action. For programs on the
   APML, the notification should be submitted to the applicable SAF/AQ Capability
   Directorate. Notifications involving space programs should be submitted through SAF/USA.
   For programs on the SPML, the notification should be submitted to AF/A4L. Appropriate
   action shall be taken by the SAF/AQ Capability Directorate, SAF/USA, or AF/A4L to either
   provide direction to comply with policy, obtain a waiver to requirements, or to initiate
   changes to publications as appropriate to resolve the conflict IAW AFI 33-360. Resolution
   of conflicts between Air Force issuances shall be resolved by SAF/AQX, SAF/USA, AF/A4L
   or SAF/IEL and the appropriate HAF functional.
3.3. Capability Based Requirements Development. The operational community is responsible
for developing capability based requirements. However, the other ILCM stakeholders will
participate to gain understanding and communicate the ―art of the possible.‖ Refer to CJCSI
3170.01, Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, the JCIDS Manual, AFI 10-
601, Capabilities-Based Requirements Development, and AFI 10-604, Capabilities-Based
Planning for additional details about the requirements development process.
   3.3.1. The AFMC/CC and AFSPC/CC will support the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
   (CSAF), Service Acquisition Executives (SAE) and other MAJCOM/CCs by:
      3.3.1.1. Recommending phasing and adjustments of requirements to ensure operationally
      acceptable increments are fielded in a timely manner.
      3.3.1.2. Monitoring and controlling weapon system requirements baselines from MS A
      to fielding.
      3.3.1.3. Attesting to feasibility of operational requirements concurrent with all CDD and
      CPD presentations to the AFROC. Feasible is defined as the requirements are technically
      achievable and executable within the estimated schedule and budgeted life-cycle cost.
   3.3.2. The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process is
   closely integrated with the acquisition process and exists to identify, develop, and validate
   capability based requirements. JCIDS implements an approach that leverages the expertise
   of DOD and non-DOD agencies and industry to identify, assess, and prioritize joint force
   capabilities. The process validates warfighting capabilities while considering the full range
   of materiel and non-materiel solutions. Within DOD, there is a distinct separation between
   the requirements authority and acquisition authority. In order for the processes to work
   effectively together, early and continual collaboration is required between both communities.
   3.3.3. The PM shall support the establishment of the operational and sustainment related
   performance attributes that provide the capability that support the warfighter. All acquisition
   personnel who engage directly with the requirements community on requirements documents
   shall take the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) training module CLM 041 and the
   online training course RQM 110 (or appropriate executive level course).
 62                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.3.4. For ACAT I, ACAT IA, and non-delegated ACAT II programs within their portfolio,
   the SAE and AFMC/CC or AFSPC/CC shall certify CDDs to the SECAF concurrent to
   document presentation to the AFROC. The certification shall attest:
       3.3.4.1. The CDD requirements can be clearly and unambiguously translated for
       evaluation in a source selection.
       3.3.4.2. The capabilities are prioritized (if appropriate) and organized into feasible
       increments of capability that are technically achievable and executable within the
       estimated schedule and budgeted life cycle cost.
3.4. Mission Assignment. The AF mission assignment process establishes management
responsibilities in support of approved missions to achieve designated AF ILCM enterprise
objectives. AFMC/AFSPC shall establish mission assignment processes to manage resources
and align the acquisition and sustainment infrastructure and levels of service that ensure the
proper resources and skills are positioned to achieve designated program outcomes.
   3.4.1. HQ AFMC shall complete mission assignment for non-space activities in sufficient
   time to define and program for resources to support acquisition and sustainment planning, but
   not later than program initiation (usually MS B). HQ AFMC will refer to the Acquisition
   Program Master List (APML) and Sustainment Program Master List (SPML) to ensure
   appropriate mission assignments.
   3.4.2. (ADMIN) HQ AFSPC shall complete mission assignment for space activities in
   sufficient time to define and program for resources to support acquisition and sustainment
   planning, but not later than program initiation (usually MS B).
   3.4.3. Capability Directors, PEOs, DAOs, PMs, MAJCOMs or other impacted organizations
   will notify HQ AFMC or HQ AFSPC of any change of workload that may impact a mission
   assignment. This notification will occur at Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and/or
   Capability Development Document (CDD) initiation, Materiel Development Decision
   (MDD), initial Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), or completion of Materiel
   Solution Analysis but not later than program initiation. Notification should occur in
   sufficient time to ensure HQ AFMC or HQ AFSPC can assess, define and program for
   resources to support acquisition and sustainment planning.
3.5. Evolutionary Acquisition (EA). EA is the DOD and AF preferred acquisition strategy for
rapidly delivering needed capabilities to the users based on the maturation of technologies. The
success of the EA strategy depends on consistent and repeated validation of operational
capability requirements, stated in increments of increasing capability. These lead to the
development of systems providing required capability. EA strategies demand maturation of
technologies, robust systems engineering, and improved supportability strategies focused on
adding capabilities in future increments. Under some circumstances, systems may be fielded
using a traditional single step to full capabilities approach.
   3.5.1. An EA approach delivers capabilities in increments, recognizing up front the need for
   future capabilities improvements. EA works hand-in-hand with the requirements process to
   provide the ability to incrementally refine capability requirements, insert technology or
   additional capabilities, react to the environment, and exploit opportunities as they arise. The
   objective is to balance needs and potential capabilities with resources and to quickly put
   supportable capabilities into the hands of the operator. During all phases of EA, sustainment
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            63


  elements must be considered and included in acquisition planning in order to sustain the
  system cost effectively. Figure 3.1 displays a notional program being developed using an
  EA approach. Technology development preceding initiation of an increment shall be at the
  required level of maturity.
  3.5.2. Incremental Development. There are two approaches to incremental development.
  The first consists of validated increments at program initiation that lead to satisfying the full
  end-state capability. The second consists of validated capability needs for the initial
  increment(s), while future increments and the precise end-state capabilities are not finalized
  at program initiation.
     3.5.2.1. For incremental development that satisfies the full capability need, capability
     documents specify a stable, well-defined end-state capability and stable, well-defined
     interim increments, including an initial operational capability (IOC) date for each
     increment. In this case, the acquisition strategy defines each increment of capability and
     how it will be funded, developed, tested, produced, and sustained.
     3.5.2.2. For incremental development where the end-state capability is not defined,
     incremental development relies on user feedback and technology maturation to define
     requirements for future validation. In this process, the initial capability requirements
     specify a stable, well-defined first increment(s), including an IOC date for those defined
     increments. Future increments and end-state capabilities are not finalized at program
     initiation. The acquisition strategy defines the first increment of capability and how it
     will be funded, developed, tested, produced, and supported. It also describes the desired
     general capability the program is intended to satisfy, and establishes a management
     approach that will be used to define the exact capability needs for each subsequent
     increment. Future capabilities requirements for subsequent increments are refined
     through demonstration and risk management.

Figure 3.1. Evolutionary Acquisition Approach.




3.6. Management of System of Systems (SoS)/Family of System (FoS). Systems of
Systems/Family of Systems acquisition is required when a materiel solution analysis to a
capability need described in an Initial Capability Document (ICD) cannot be accomplished by a
single weapon system, and will require collaboration of new and/or modified weapon systems
and existing weapon systems. MDAs and PMs for programs that are system of systems will be
cognizant of the decomposition and allocation of capabilities and resources amongst the
constituent systems and other elements of the SoS/FoS. Special consideration will be given to
critical technical interfaces and programmatic interdependencies. During the acquisition and
sustainment process, MDAs shall consider overall system progress during milestone reviews.
3.7. Air Force Review Boards (AFRB)/Acquisition Strategy Panels (ASP). AF Review
Boards/Acquisition Strategy Panels are integral to a deliberative process that supports AF
leadership in making milestone decisions or conducting major decision reviews.
   3.7.1. Air Force Review Boards (AFRB).
       3.7.1.1. AF Review Boards are forums chaired by the SAE for conducting major
       decision reviews (in- or out-of-cycle), as well as making and documenting major
       milestone decisions. AFRBs are not conducted for services or space programs.
       3.7.1.2. AF PM&AE is the AFRB process owner and secretariat.
       3.7.1.3. The AFRB process is required for all ACAT IC, ACAT IAC, non-delegated
       ACAT II programs and special interest programs. The PEO may recommend what type
       of AFRB is necessary: full, mini (tailored attendance), or paper. A template and more
       information can be found at the AF PM&AE AF Portal Page.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          65


       3.7.1.4. For ACAT ID and ACAT IAMs, AFRBs are used to develop the AF corporate
       consensus prior to an OSD Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) (pre-DAB within AF) or
       Information Technology Acquisition Board (ITAB). The AFRB should be conducted no
       later than two weeks prior to last OSD Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT).
       The SAE determines if an ACAT ID or ACAT IAM program requires an AFRB.
       3.7.1.5. PEOs and DAOs execute a tailored AFRB process for delegated ACAT II and
       ACAT III programs.
   3.7.2. Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP).
       3.7.2.1. The Acquisition Strategy Panel supports the SAE and other MDAs. ASPs are
       forums that evaluate proposed acquisition strategies to ensure all key viable alternatives
       have been considered and that the best recommendation is provided to the SAE and/or the
       program‘s MDA for approval.
       3.7.2.2. The AF PM&AE is the SAE-chaired ASP process owner and secretariat for all
       ACAT I/IA and non-delegated ACAT II programs.
       3.7.2.3. The field ACE offices are the ASP process owner and secretariat for all non-
       SAE chaired ACAT II and III PEO/DAO programs.

3.12. Request for Reclassification of Acquisition Programs Categorization. For
reclassification of an ACAT I or IA program to a lower ACAT, the SAE must submit requests to
USD(AT&L), or the OASD/NII or DOD CIO, whichever applies. The request shall identify the
reasons for the reduction in ACAT. The PM shall notify the PEO/DAO and the SAE when it is
necessary to raise the ACAT category from an ACAT III or ACAT II to a higher level ACAT
category. This notification shall be made immediately upon determining that the program meets
the requirements of the higher category as defined in DODI 5000.02. If the program qualifies as
an ACAT I program, the program is assumed to be an ACAT ID or IAM until the SAE requests
and the USD(AT&L) or OASD/NII agrees to categorize the program as an ACAT IC or ACAT
IAC. USD(AT&L), OASD/NII, or the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) may reclassify an
acquisition program as a pre-MDAP/MAIS or as an ACAT ID or IAM at any time.
3.13. Life Cycle Acquisition and Sustainment Reporting. Life cycle metrics are critical
elements in characterizing the progress in a program‘s achievement of its goals. PMs will use
life cycle metrics, including sustainment metrics, to evaluate program status and determine if
programs are meeting the weapon system life cycle requirements. Objectives for the metrics
shall be established early in the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase, refined throughout the
Technology Development and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phases, and
then carried through as program baseline goals until system retirement.

     3.13.1.5. With the approval of SAF/AQX, System Program Managers may roll up a
     Weapon System‘s multiple AML programs into a single MAR. Programs should submit
     roll up requests to SAF/AQXR.
     3.13.1.6. The program decision authority will review and approve each MAR in their
     portfolio by the 8th working day of each month.
     3.13.1.7. Programs may only terminate MAR reporting with the approval of SAF/AQX.
     Programs can submit a request for termination through SAF/AQXR when all contracts
     are 90% complete and/or all program investment funds (RDT&E and Procurement) are
     90% expended.
  3.13.2. ACAT designated programs shall follow DOD 5000 series for DOD and
  Congressional reporting requirements.
  3.13.3. The PM shall define, measure, report, and make programmatic decisions using
  appropriate life cycle outcome-oriented metrics. In all cases, the metrics tracked should be
  aligned with the organization‘s strategy and objectives as well as provide actionable insight
  into how well the organization is achieving those objectives.
  3.13.4. The PM shall collect, report, and analyze sustainment metrics to measure program
  life cycle sustainment outcomes that satisfy the sustainment KPP/ Key System Attributes
  (KSAs) defined by the user in accordance with the JCIDS Manual. This will include as a

AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            69


   down time (MDT). Additional sustainment metric calculation information can be found in
   AFPAM 63-128.
       3.13.4.1. Materiel availability shall measure the percentage of the total inventory of a
       weapon system‘s operational capability (ready for tasking) based on materiel condition
       for performing an assigned mission at a given time. Materiel availability for aircraft will
       be measured in accordance with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
       Management.
       3.13.4.2. Materiel reliability shall measure the probability that the system will perform
       without failure over a specific interval. Materiel reliability for aircraft will be measured
       in accordance with AFI 21-101.
       3.13.4.3. TOC shall measure total costs as identified in the OSD Cost Analysis
       Improvement Group‘s (CAIG) Operating and Support (O&S) Cost Estimating Structure.
       TOC will be measured referencing OSD CAIG Operating and Support Cost-Estimating
       Guide, Chapter 4, elements 2.0 through 5.0.
       3.13.4.4. Mean down time shall measure the average total downtime required to restore
       an asset to its full operational capabilities. Mean down time (MDT) for aircraft shall be
       measured by combining Total Not Mission Capable - Maintenance (TNMCM) time and
       Total Not Mission Capable - Supply (TNMCS) time in accordance with AFI 21-101.
3.14. Life Cycle Expectation Management. The PM shall ensure effective expectation
management is an integral part of the system integrated life cycle management strategy.
Successful expectation management will reduce the number of significant issues and surprises
that hurt the acquisition community‘s credibility with Congress, OSD, and AF leadership. The
roles and responsibilities of expectation management cut across the acquisition, sustainment, and
operational user communities. Program changes or other influences that drive expectation
adjustments must be made clear to the most senior leaders who have responsibility for the
success of a program. Expectation management documents capture existing validated
requirements and agreements among program stakeholders. Documents such as a Life Cycle
Management Plan (LCMP) or the Program Management Agreement (PMA) will be accessible
from an authoritative source to provide the basis for communicating expectations between
stakeholders.
3.15. Total Ownership Costs (TOC). Total ownership cost of a system encompasses all life
cycle costs including development, production, operations, support, and disposal costs.
   3.15.1. At a minimum TOC consists of the following cost elements as defined in the CAIG
   Operating and Support (O&S) Cost Estimating Structure: Unit Operations (2.1.1 only);
   Energy (fuel, petroleum, oil, lubricants, electricity); Maintenance (All); Sustaining Support
   (all except 4.1, System Specific Training); Continuing System Improvements (all). Fuel
   costs will be based on the fully burdened cost of fuel. Costs are to be included regardless of
   funding source, and the value should cover the planned life cycle timeframe, consistent with
   the timeframe used in the Materiel Availability KPP. Sources of reference data, cost models,
   parametric cost estimating relationships, and other estimating techniques or tools must be
   identified in supporting analysis. Programs must plan for maintaining the traceability of
   costs incurred to estimates and must plan for testing and evaluation.

   3.15.2. The PM shall seek to reduce costs of operating DOD systems while improving
   readiness, and will be held accountable for clear and timely articulation of actions to reduce
   life cycle costs for their systems.
   3.15.3. Consideration shall be given to both operational and life cycle economic impacts
   when evaluating technical trade-offs or allocating resources among research and
   development, acquisition, operating and support costs. TOC must be appropriately estimated
   and documented to provide the decision makers the needed information for evaluating
   options.
   3.15.4. To reduce the cost of fielded systems while still meeting the program‘s technical
   requirements, the PM shall continuously look for opportunities to improve reliability and
   maintainability; reduce logistics footprints and supply chain response times; and ensure
   competitive sourcing of product support resulting in streamlining and overhead reductions.
   Initiatives to consider include Value Engineering (VE), Public-Private Partnerships (PPP),
   and Reduction of Total Ownership Cost (R-TOC).
3.16. Risk-Based Program Management and Decision Making.
   3.16.1. Programmatic Risk. PMs shall pursue a comprehensive integrated risk analysis
   throughout life cycle and shall prepare and maintain a risk management plan. Risks include,
   but are not limited to, cost, schedule, performance, technical, product data access, technology
   protection, integration, and Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) risks.
   These risk areas are influenced by factors such as program stability, manning, contractor
   execution, the chosen technologies, intelligence supportability, system design and
   manufacturing processes. Methodologies used to manage risk shall include Risk
   Management Plans (RMP), program risk reviews, risk-based source selection, technical risk
   management, Probability of Program Success (PoPS), and the DoD Standard Practice for
   System Safety prescribed in MILSTD882D.
   3.16.2. Probability of Program Success (PoPS). All MAR reporting programs shall use PoPS
   to provide program management, at all levels, with leading indicators of risks that can impact
   program success. Programs shall update PoPS through the SMART database. The PoPS
   Operations Guide, which contains extensive instructions on completing PoPS and populating
   the PoPS windshield chart, is available at each Center Acquisition Center of Excellence
   (ACE) or through the Acquisition Chief Process Office.
   3.16.3. Risk-based Source Selection. The source selection approach, as part of the
   acquisition strategy, shall be developed to reduce risk over the life cycle of the program.
   This includes identifying the strengths, weaknesses, domain experience, process capability,
   development capacity, and past performance for all developer team members with significant
   development responsibilities. Source selection guidance and procedures are contained in
   FAR Part 15, DFARS Part 215, AFFARS 5315.3 and AFFARS Mandatory Procedure
   5315.3. To realize high confidence source selection, the Request for proposal (RFP) and
   source selection approach should require the following:
      3.16.3.1. Expectations for warfighters, users, decision-makers, evaluation teams, and
      industry from the outset of the source selection. This includes an understanding by all of
      the desired end-state and clear expectations to industry on proposal requirements and
      timelines.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                        71


     3.16.3.2. A clear understanding of the methods of estimating costs for the program
     including uncertainty analysis and verification requirements. The government most
     probable cost estimate may need to be verified by a certified cost estimator in accordance
     with SAF/FM policy/guidance.
     3.16.3.3. Identification of the key discriminators from among the mission requirements.
     These must represent the key areas of importance and emphasis to be considered in the
     source selection decision and support meaningful comparison and discrimination between
     and among competing proposals.
     3.16.3.4. Establishment of the minimum performance or capability requirements against
     which offers will be judged. For contracts after MS B this includes minimum prototype
     performance.
  3.16.4. Technical Risk Management. Chief/Lead Engineers have execution responsibility
  for technical risk management, and shall utilize Systems Engineering throughout the life
  cycle, in accordance with AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, to manage program
  technical risks. Technical risk management includes risk based prototype planning and
  development.
  3.16.5. All programs conduct Technology Readiness Assessments (TRA) per DODI 5000.02
  and are encouraged to conduct Manufacturing Readiness Assessments (MRA) in preparation
  for program Milestones.
     3.16.5.1. Technology Readiness Assessments (TRA). The TRA is the primary tool to
     assess the maturity of critical technology elements at MS B and C. For MDAPs, the TRA
     provides information to support MDA certification that ―the technology in the program
     has been demonstrated in a relevant environment‖ prior to MS B approval per USC Title
     10 (§2366b). If the MDAP is initiated at a later decision point, MDA certification is
     required prior to that decision point. Technologies that are demonstrated in a relevant
     environment are at a Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6) (reference DOD Technology
     Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook, July 2009, for additional guidance.)
         3.16.5.1.1. All acquisition programs on the APML shall complete an objective,
         measurable TRA for MDA consideration prior to MS B and MS C.
         3.16.5.1.2. Critical Technology Elements (CTE) (reference DOD Technology
         Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook) shall be demonstrated prior to MS B in a
         relevant environment (preferably an operational environment) and matured for the
         production of each increment of capability prior to MS C. The PM and Chief/Lead
         Engineers will incorporate appropriate technology demonstrations in program
         acquisition documentation to support milestone decision points.
         3.16.5.1.3. The MDA directs, reviews, and approves TRAs for delegated ACAT II
         and III programs.
         3.16.5.1.4. SAF/AQR directs MS B and C TRAs for Air Force programs where the
         SAE or DAE is the MDA. SAF/AQR reviews and endorses MS B and C TRAs to
         SAF/AQ for SAE programs and to DUSD (S&T) for DUSD (AT&L) and OASD/NII
         programs. The results of space TRAs for MS B and C are forwarded to the MDA and
         Independent Program Assessment Team (IPAT) leader.
72                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


         3.16.5.1.5. The PM shall contact SAF/AQR 12 months prior to MS B for MDAP
         programs to coordinate TRA preparations.
         3.16.5.1.6. The PM shall address technology maturity in the solicitation supporting
         source selections conducted in conjunction with a MS B. The measure of merit that
         ―the technology in a program has been demonstrated in a relevant environment‖ is
         that all Critical Technology Elements (CTE) are at TRL 6 or greater. The PM shall
         include language in solicitations for the EMD phase advising offerors that (1) the
         government will not award a contract to an offeror whose proposal is based on CTEs
         that have not been demonstrated in a relevant environment, and (2) that offerors will
         be required to specify the technology readiness level of the CTEs on which their
         proposal is based and to provide reports documenting how those CTEs have been
         demonstrated in a relevant environment.
     3.16.5.2. Manufacturing Readiness Assessment (MRA). The MRA including
     identifying Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) were developed to provide an
     understanding of manufacturing risk and maturity similar to TRLs. MRLs and MRAs
     can foster better decision making, program planning and program execution through
     improved understanding and management of manufacturing risk. See Acquisition
     Community Connection, https://acc.dau.mil, for more information.
  3.16.6. Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH). Although an integral part of
  a program‘s overall Risk Management effort throughout the system‘s life cycle, ESOH risk
  management has some unique requirements imposed by DODI 5000.02.
     3.16.6.1. The PM and Lead/Chief Engineer shall use the DOD Standard Practice for
     System Safety, MIL-STD-882D, to manage ESOH risks as part of the Systems
     Engineering (SE) process in all developmental and sustaining engineering activities.
     3.16.6.2. The PM should try to eliminate ESOH hazards where possible and minimize
     the ESOH risks where the hazards cannot be eliminated.
     3.16.6.3. ESOH hazards and risks include those resulting from routine system operations
     and maintenance (O&M); from mishaps or system or subsystem failures; and from
     potential impacts to program cost, schedule, and performance from requirements to
     comply with ESOH laws and regulations.
     3.16.6.4. The PM shall document the strategy for integrating ESOH considerations into
     the SE process in a Programmatic Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health
     Evaluation (PESHE).
     3.16.6.5. Formal ESOH Risk Acceptance. The PM shall document that the associated
     risks have been accepted by the following acceptance authorities: the SAE for high risks,
     PEO-level for serious risks, and the PM for medium and low risks prior to exposing
     people, equipment, or the environment to known system-related ESOH hazards. Formal
     risk acceptance requirements apply throughout the life of the system.
         3.16.6.5.1. High risk acceptance packages shall be coordinated with the user
         representative, SAF/AQR, and AF/SE before submission to the SAE for acceptance.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                        73


         3.16.6.5.2. The PM shall ensure each High risk acceptance package describes the
         hazard; predicted risk consequence and probability; available mitigation measures;
         costs, or other limitations to mitigation implementation; proposed mitigation
         measures; resulting net mishap risk after implementation of proposed mitigation; the
         proposed acceptance period; and an assessment of the expected losses for the period
         of acceptance.
         3.16.6.5.3. The period of a risk acceptance should be either the remaining life of the
         system if no mitigations are proposed, or the period for implementation of the
         proposed mitigation(s) throughout entire fleet plus sufficient time to validate the
         effectiveness of the implemented mitigation(s).
         3.16.6.5.4. The risk assessments that support High risk acceptance packages must
         conform to the guidance in MIL-STD-882D and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force
         Mishap Prevention Program, Attachment 15.
     3.16.6.6. The PM shall report the status of all applicable ESOH technology requirements
     at all program and technical reviews.
     3.16.6.7. In addition to inclusion in the ESOH hazard tracking system of identified
     hazardous materials either imbedded in the system or used for system O&M, the program
     will provide additional information in the tracking system on the locations, amounts,
     disposal requirements, and special training requirements for the hazardous materials.
     Program Offices developing or sustaining aircraft will provide this information to the Air
     Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) responsible for including these data in
     TO 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information
     (Emergency Services).
     3.16.6.8. The PM shall assist the system testers, operators, and maintainers in the
     application of Operational Risk Management (ORM) to those systems, to include the
     assessment of hazards and potential mitigation measures. Refer to AFI 90-901,
     Operational Risk Management, for more information on ORM.
     3.16.6.9. The PM shall provide system-specific ESOH hazard and risk analyses and data
     to support using commands‘ and T&E organizations‘ National Environmental Policy
     Act/Environmental Impact Analysis Process (NEPA/EIAP) and E.O. 12114,
     Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, documentation requirements.
     3.16.6.10. The PM shall support the mishap investigations of all Class A and B mishaps
     involving their systems, provide analyses of the ESOH hazards that contributed to the
     mishap under investigation, and make recommendations for materiel risk mitigations
     measures, especially those designed to minimize the potential for human error.
  3.16.7. Intelligence Risk Management. Center Intelligence Offices will assist Program
  Manager‘s in their assessment and reporting of the intelligence metrics in PoPs.
  3.16.8. Product Support Risk Management. The Acquisition Sustainment Tool Kit (AS Tool
  Kit), Logistics Health Assessment (LHA), and Independent Logistics Assessment (ILA) are
  three product support/logistics life cycle tools designed to help program managers identify,
  track, and mitigate product support risks.
 74                                              AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       3.16.8.1. The AS Tool Kit provides program office personnel a road map of logistics
       processes from Milestone A through disposal. It identifies tasks critical to successful
       integration of product support planning that are required by current DOD and Air Force
       guidance. The AS Tool Kit ensures disciplined product support planning is accomplished
       and provides a baseline of product support activities to support individual program
       detailed planning. It also provides a method to effectively and efficiently plan, organize,
       and manage integrated life cycle logistics tasks. See Section 3D and AFPAM 63-128 for
       additional information on AS Tool Kit.
       3.16.8.2. LHA provides a standard method for program office personnel to assess
       product support and to highlight risks. It creates a site picture of program logistics health
       at any point in the system‘s life cycle and is tailorable for individual programs. LHA
       provides a mechanism for assessing, measuring, and recording, logistics planning and
       execution information, and can be accessed through System Metric and Reporting Tool
       (SMART).
       3.16.8.3. ILAs are an objective assessment of product support planning and execution in
       preparation for major milestones B, C, and Full Rate Production. They are performed at
       the discretion of the MDA by an independent team of subject matter experts (members
       not in the direct chain of command for the program being assessed). Their purpose is to
       highlight risks and impacts associated with up-front decisions, cuts, and trade-offs so
       senior leaders can make more informed decisions.
3.17. Earned Value Management (EVM). Earned Value Management is a program
management tool that integrates the technical, cost, and schedule parameters of a project into a
Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB). It measures how efficiently resources are consumed
against what was planned to be consumed to meet technical goals.
   3.17.1. The PM shall integrate EVM into their management processes and contracts in
   accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and DODI
   5000.02. When EVM is required, the PM shall conduct Integrated Baseline Reviews (IBRs),
   receive and analyze EVM data from the contractor, perform detailed analysis of EVM data
   using procedures detailed in the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) EVM
   Implementation Guide, understand the PMB, and use EVM as a management tool. As part of
   the analysis process, the PM should reconcile Contract Performance Reports (CPR) report
   formats and reconcile Contract Funds Status Reports (CFSR) to the CPR, if the contractor is
   not required to do so. The contractor has ownership of the Earned Value Management
   System (EVMS), is expected to maintain compliance with the EVMS standard and uses
   EVM as an internal management tool.
   3.17.2. DCMA is designated as the DOD Executive Agent for EVMS. The DCMA is
   responsible for ensuring the integrity and application effectiveness of contractor EVMS.
   3.17.3. EVM applicability and implementation is required based on the dollar threshold and
   type of contract. The requirement for EVM applies to cost or incentive contracts,
   subcontracts, intra-government work agreements, and other agreements that meet certain
   dollar thresholds prescribed in DFARS, unless a waiver is obtained from the MDA.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         75


       3.17.3.1. The PM shall implement EVM on applicable contracts within acquisition,
       upgrade, modification, or materiel maintenance programs, including highly sensitive
       classified programs, major construction programs, and automated information systems
       (AIS).
       3.17.3.2. The PM shall implement EVM on applicable contracts when the following
       exist: (1) the prime contractor or one or more subcontractors is a non-U.S. source; (2)
       contract work is to be performed in government facilities; or (3) the contract is awarded
       to a specialized organization such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
       (DARPA).
       3.17.3.3. The PM shall implement EVM on applicable contracts designated as major
       capital acquisitions in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation and Office of
       Management and Budget Circular A-11, Part 7, Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition, and
       Management of Capital Assets.
   3.17.4. The PM shall ensure EVMS compliance or validation based on the dollar threshold
   and type of contract. The EVMS compliance standard is the latest release of the 32
   Guidelines of American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard
   ANSI/EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) Standard.                    Reference
   information is contained within the standard document, however actual compliance and if
   required, validation, is determined by the DCMA. The DCMA‘s guidance may be found in
   the Earned Value Management Implementation Guide and the Defense Acquisition
   Guidebook. Consult the AF EVM IPT CoP website for the latest AF-specific working-level
   guidance and links to additional resources.
   3.17.5. The PM shall ensure EVMS reporting for each contract, unless otherwise specified.
   AF requires that the resulting level-one data for each contract with EVM be reported in
   SMART. Programs that are considered to be MDAPs are expected to report EVM data in the
   Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES). SMART and DAES data will be
   reconcilable to each other.
3.18. Performance Based Contracting. Performance based contracting is a procurement
strategy that structures all aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be
performed, as opposed to either the manner in which the contractor must perform the work or the
processes that must be used. This strategy leverages the ingenuity of industry while providing
the government with access to the best commercial products, services, and processes across the
program life cycle.
   3.18.1. The PM shall consider performance based contracting to the maximum practical
   extent, unless exempted by the Services Designated Official (defined in Chapter 4).
   3.18.2. The contracting officer has the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate
   contracts and make related determinations and findings. Contracting officers‘ may bind the
   Government only to the extent of the authority delegated to them. A contract defines the
   relationship between the Government and the industry partner. It sets forth the contractual
   requirements that the contractor is obligated to meet.
   3.18.3. Internal Controls for Procurements on Behalf of the DOD by Certain Non-Defense
   Agencies. Program managers shall only place an order, make a purchase, or otherwise
   procure property or services in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold through a non-
 76                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   defense agency in any fiscal year, if the head of the non-defense agency has certified that the
   agency will comply with defense procurement requirements for the fiscal year. The Director,
   Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) may make exceptions to this
   requirement or extend such determinations if it is determined, in writing, that it is necessary
   in the interest of the DOD to continue to procure property and services through the non-
   certified non-defense agency.
3.19. Selection of Contractors for Subsystems and Components. PMs shall determine the
approach to establish and maintain access to competitive suppliers for critical areas at the
system, subsystem and component level. Refer to Subcontractor Management, Make or Buy
Plans, FAR 7.105(b)(11), FAR 15.407.2 and FAR 44.202-2.
3.20. New Start Notification. A New Start is any program, subprogram, modification, project,
or subproject not previously justified to and approved by Congress during the appropriations
process for the fiscal year involved. When a determination has been made that the efforts
undertaken meet the New Start criteria, Congress must be notified via either a Letter of
Notification or DD1415-1 (Prior Approval Reprogramming Action). The methods of
notification to be used are delineated in AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Volume
I and DOD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (FMR),
Volume III Chapter 6
   3.20.1. New Start Validation Responsibilities. The PM, along with the respective Program
   Office Chief Financial Officer (CFO)/or Program Control Chief (PCC), is required to
   document and validate that efforts underway have obtained approval for new start or have
   been adequately assessed and determined not to meet the new start criteria before any funds
   are obligated for programs not categorized as ―commodity‖ programs. Pre-contract cost
   agreements are subject to new start criteria and require completion of the validation form.
   RFPs, proposal evaluation, and contract negotiations are part of normal Program Office
   activities and therefore do not represent new start activities.
       3.20.1.1. Where there is no PM, such as technology development efforts, validation is
       the responsibility of the Technical Director (TD).
       3.20.1.2. Refer to AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Volume I and DOD
       Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume III Chapter 6 for additional guidance
       on the key points delineated in the Validation Form at Attachment 3 of this publication.
       If no item in the Validation Form (Attachment 3 of this publication) is marked YES, then
       the PM shall work with their respective Program Element Monitor (PEM) and/or
       Capability Director (CD) at the HAF to coordinate the initiation of the appropriate New
       Start Notification package (i.e., Letter of Notification/1415-1 Packages). Once the
       Validation Form is completed it should be filed as part of the program‘s contract file.
   3.20.2. Validation Form Exemptions. Funding actions for the following are excluded from
   the requirement to complete the validation form prior to obligating funds. The exemption
   from completing the validation form does not absolve activities from complying with all
   regulations pertaining to New Start Notifications in the event that a New Start is planned for
   initiation.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            77


       3.20.2.1. All Basic Research (6.1), Applied Research (6.2) efforts, and Advanced
       Technology Development (6.3) efforts, UNLESS initiating a new research project
       (budget program activity code) not listed in the applicable descriptive summary (R-2
       exhibit). These exemptions DO NOT include program elements (PEs) beginning with a
       63 designation, but falling under the 6.4, Advanced Component Development and
       Prototypes, budget program activity code.
       3.20.2.2. All Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I and II efforts.
       3.20.2.3. Incremental funding actions for ongoing efforts if no change in required work.
       3.20.2.4. Contract changes pursuant to clauses that do not change the work requirement
       of the contract (i.e., award fees and some price adjustments).
       3.20.2.5. Program management and administrative efforts directed at business
       management and Program Office operations.
   3.20.3. Reference AFI 65-601 Volume I for details on the New Start Notification process,
   procedures, and reporting requirements. In addition, individuals can contact SAF/AQXR,
   AF PM&AE and SAF/FM for additional guidance and/or help regarding New Starts specific
   issues.
3.21. Modification Management. For the purposes of this instruction, a modification is
defined as a change to the form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) of an in-service, configuration-
managed Air Force asset. Modifications are identified as capability modifications or sustainment
modifications and can be either temporary or permanent. All modifications must be coordinated
through a formal configuration review/control process and implemented in accordance with HAF
publications. All approved modifications shall be implemented by a PM or project manager who
will be the designated individual with the responsibility for, and authority to accomplish
modification program objectives for the development, production, and sustainment of materiel
modifications that satisfy user operational needs. Additional information, terms and guidance
governing AF modification management is contained in AFI 63-131, Modification Program
Management. Further guidance on capability modifications can be found in AFI 10-601,
Capabilities-Based Requirements.
   3.21.1. Modification efforts that are designated ACAT programs or activities on the APML
   shall comply with all program requirements commensurate with their ACAT level.
   Modification efforts on the SPML shall comply with program requirements as identified by
   the AFMC/CC or designee. Modification efforts not on the APML or SPML will establish
   baseline technical, cost, and schedule objectives per AFI 63-131.
   3.21.2. Limitation on Modification of Certain Items (a.k.a. Sunset Provisions). 10 USC
   §2244a limits the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) from carrying out a modification to an
   aircraft, weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise
   dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification, if carried out, would be
   completed.
   3.21.3. The prohibition does not apply under the following situations:
       3.21.3.1. A modification for which the cost is less than $100,000.
 78                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


           3.21.3.1.1. The reusable items of value installed on the item of equipment as part of
           the modification will, upon retirement or disposal of the modified item, be removed
           from the item, refurbished, and installed on another piece of equipment and the cost
           of this modification (including cost of removal and refurbishment of reusable items of
           value) is less than $1M.
           3.21.3.1.2. The modification is a safety modification.
   3.21.4. The SECAF may waive the prohibition if the SECAF determines that carrying out
   the modification is in the national security interest of the U.S. Such a waiver requires
   notification to congressional defense committees in writing.
3.22. Program Terminations. It may be necessary to terminate a program for a variety of
reasons including a Presidential, Congressional, DOD or an AF Leadership decision, change in
threat, poor contractor performance or withdrawal of funding.
   3.22.1. Upon the termination decision, the PM shall notify the Head of Contracting Activity
   (HCA) and Senior Procurement Executive of all ACAT program terminations. The
   termination decision is normally documented in a Program Decision Memorandum (PDM).
   3.22.2. Upon termination decision, the PM shall develop a termination strategy to describe
   how to close the program down in an expeditious, orderly manner with the least impact to the
   government. The termination strategy shall at a minimum address status of contracting
   activities, status of contract, location of the Termination Contracting Officer, the most
   advantageous way to conclude open contracts, termination costs and unliquidated
   obligations, potential for claims against the government, disposition of technology,
   disposition of accumulated equipment, organizations‘ responsibilities, enterprise/architectural
   impacts, and reassignment of Government personnel.
   3.22.3. The termination strategy shall be approved by the MDA.
3.23. Materiel Fielding. Materiel fielding is the process by which AF weapon systems and
equipment are delivered to and put into service by operational units in the field. The central
element of this process is the requirement for PMs to plan and coordinate materiel fielding
requirements and activities with materiel developers, product support/sustainment organizations,
and the lead/using command(s), well in advance of required materiel delivery dates, and in a
manner that enables all parties to identify, understand, and resolve issues associated with the
materiel to be fielded. The overarching objective of the materiel fielding process is to ensure
sufficient time is available and required investments are made to develop the capabilities and
infrastructure that will be necessary to operate and sustain the materiel once it is fielded. The
materiel fielding process is a collaborative activity that is primarily executed by the PM, with
significant support from AF/DOD product support organizations and the user(s).
   3.23.1. For all programs on the APML, designated space programs, or at the SPML PM
   discretion, the PM shall develop and maintain a Materiel Fielding Plan (MFP) from program
   initiation through the production and deployment phase. The MFP will include and describe
   the materiel fielding-related requirements, methodologies, and timelines contained in the
   user‘s approved capability requirements document, all fielding-related activities or actions
   plans to be executed during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and
   production phases, and all organizational responsibilities and points of contact associated
   with the planning for, and the delivery of, the materiel to its intended user(s). The PM shall
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                           79


  coordinate the MFP with the lead/using command(s) and other stakeholder organizations that
  will interface with, sustain, or provide support (e.g. training) for the materiel being
  developed. At the PM‘s discretion and with MDA approval, the MFP may be a stand-alone
  document, an annex to the program LCMP, or embedded within the LCMP itself.
  3.23.2. At MS/KDP C and all subsequent production decision reviews the PM shall update
  the MFP as necessary to reflect the materiel fielding-related requirements specified in the
  user‘s CPD, or any changes in the user‘s system/product delivery and acceptance criteria, the
  user‘s operational/mission employment and product support concepts, or the user‘s
  requirements to support operator and maintenance training (e.g. Required Assets Available),
  Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and Full Operational Capability (FOC).
  3.23.3. At MS C and all subsequent production decision reviews the PM shall update the
  MFP as necessary to reflect the materiel fielding-related requirements specified in the user‘s
  CPD, or any changes in the user‘s system/product delivery and acceptance criteria, the user‘s
  operational/mission employment and product support concepts, or the user‘s requirements to
  support operator and maintenance training (e.g. Required Assets Available), Initial
  Operational Capability (IOC), and Full Operational Capability (FOC).
  3.23.4. DELETED.
  3.23.5. Consult AFPAM 63-128 for additional guidance and information related to the
  materiel fielding process.     This pamphlet provides detailed planning criteria and
  considerations that PMs can use to develop, coordinate, and implement MFPs.
  3.23.6. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Materiel Fielding Process. Procedures provided in this
  supplement identify the minimum actions and documents that must be completed by the
  acquisition agency/sponsoring agency, or site, to successfully field mission capabilities to the
  AFISRA and/or subordinate organizations. The list is not intended to specify every
  milestone that will be taken in every deployment, but provides a means to ensure users
  receive a supportable capability that meets operational requirements. AFPAM 63-128,
  Chapter 10 further explains the materiel fielding process.
     3.23.6.1. (Added-AFISRA) Materiel Fielding Notification. The AFISRA staff office,
     authoritative Wing/Group or Center, or responsible program manager will notify the site
     (via message) once a decision is made, but not less than 6 months prior to fielding a
     mission capability.
         3.23.6.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Information copies to AFISRA staff (A1, A2, A3,
         A4/7, A5/8/9, and A6) are also required.
         3.23.6.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Organizations will refer any component attempting to
         install a mission capability without prior notification to the authoritative Wing/Group
         or Center, and AFISRA staff.
         3.23.6.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Notification Requirements Information. In order to
         assist the site in successfully integrating a proposed capability into the existing site
         architecture, the system fielding notification will include the following information:

       3.23.6.3. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Mission Capability Acceptance Requirements.
       Upon completion of installation testing of a new or modified mission capability,
       representatives from the acquisition and gaining organization(s) shall jointly review and
       document: the status of the installation; results of testing; status/effectiveness of training;
       availability of previously ―agreed to‖ support deliverables (i.e., spares, training,
       documentation, etc); and, open discrepancies levied against the capability with proposed
       corrective actions. Following this assessment, the responsible commander or designated
       representative will make a decision to accept (conditionally or unconditionally) or not
       accept the capability.
           3.23.6.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) Acceptance. The
           responsible commander retains authority to delay acceptance until resolution of
           critical deficiencies (i.e., installation, supportability, safety, training, etc. shortfalls).
               3.23.6.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) If the capability is accepted (conditionally or
               unconditionally) the appropriate certifications must be signed and an IOC
               message released (Attachment 6).
               3.23.6.3.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) The IOC message will outline/document the
               results of the operational and logistics assessment. Document liens against a
               system, if any, in the conditional IOC acceptance message, SCC, Materiel
               Fielding Process report(s), and/or the AF Form 1261, Communication and
               Information Systems Acceptance Certificate, as applicable. (NOTE: Impact of
               liens are rated as follows: Minor - a ―work around‖ exists/no mission loss; Major
               - mission loss might be experienced; or Critical - mission loss is/will be
               experienced).

     cycle for those mission capabilities having short delivery schedules. It applies
     specifically to QRC requirements submitted out-of-cycle, to include modification
     proposal QRCs. Acquisition organizations deploying QRC capabilities to AFISRA field
     sites should endeavor to meet materiel fielding objectives as prescribed in AFPAM 63-
     128; however, special provisions may be made to effect initial support requirements.
        3.23.6.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) A QRC materiel fielding plan will be documented as
        a MOU/MOA message (Attachment 7). The message, as minimum should include
        the following information:
            3.23.6.4.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Mission or Signal of Interest/Data to be
            Collected.

            3.23.6.4.1.5. (Added-AFISRA) Acquisition organization‘s acceptance of risk
            associated with extended downtimes due to lack of formal support deliverables
            (i.e., training, spares, technical documentation, etc.).
        3.23.6.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) QRC MOU/MOA messages will be provided to
        AFISRA staff offices, appropriate Wing/Group, external organizations, and AFCO
        when applicable.
        3.23.6.4.3. (Added-AFISRA) No capability should remain in a QRC status beyond
        1 year of initial deployment.
        3.23.6.4.4. (Added-AFISRA) Approval of QRC for a permanent installation will
        follow established AF, SCC or external DoD organization(s) acquisition and
        sustainment life cycle management standards.
        3.23.6.4.5. (Added-AFISRA) Minimum QRC Logistics Support Requirements.
        When a decision is made to deploy a QRC to an AFISRA site, the authoritative
        Center, Wing, AFCO, or external agency (as applicable) must provide or ensure the
        acquisition organization provides the site with the following documentation or

        3.23.6.4.7. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA cryptologic field sites, managed under the
        Position Equipment Table, will add QRC to unit authorizations as prescribed in
        AFISRA Instruction 21-104, Maintenance Manpower Management/Position
        Equipment Table (PET).
        3.23.6.4.8. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A4M will coordinate with NSA/BA02 to
        ensure assignment of a temporary Position Equipment Identifier (POEI) to ensure the
        QRC is added to the unit authorizations for those units providing maintenance
        functions.
     3.23.6.5. (Added-AFISRA) Management of AFISRA Proof of Concept (POC), Risk
     Assessment (RA), Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), and Research
     & Development (R&D) Requirements. The processes prescribed in this supplement are
     applicable to those capabilities specifically excluded from governance of acquisition and
     life cycle sustainment-related AFIs, policy, guidance and processes published by external
     DoD organizations. It applies to POC, RA, ACTD, and R&D requirements, hereinafter
     referred to as POCs, which allows developers to determine the feasibility of a concept in
     the operational and maintenance environment. The intent of this policy is twofold: (1)
     encourage cooperation between AFISRA organization(s) and developer(s) to allow
     testing of new technology in the operational environment; and (2) limit the burden of
     POCs on the gaining organization.
        3.23.6.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) POC Notification Process. The gaining organization,
        in coordination with the sponsoring authority, has complete control of all incoming
        POC installations. The gaining organization or sponsoring activity will ensure the
        authoritative Center, Wing/Group, AFISRA staff offices and/or AFCO (as applicable)
        are formally notified of pending POC installations.
 84                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


          3.23.6.5.2. (Added-AFISRA) POC Requirements. The sponsoring activity will
          provide the gaining organization a SSP and MOU/MOA message (see Attachment 8).
          As a minimum, the MOU/MOA will contain the POC CONOP and outline the
          conditions for delivery/acceptance of the capability as follows:
              3.23.6.5.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Specify the capability has no formal or official
              operational tasking.
              3.23.6.5.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Designate the sponsoring activity as OPR for
              providing daily operational and maintenance support requirements until
              deactivation/de-installation.
              3.23.6.5.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Specify limited operational or maintenance
              requirements to be performed ―as time permits‖ by site personnel. ―As time
              permits‖ is defined as having no impact on operational systems performing
              validated/tasked missions.
              3.23.6.5.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) Address the sponsoring activity‘s acceptance of
              risks associated with the lack of LCL planning and/or deliverables (i.e., limited to
              no spares, training, documentation, etc.).
              3.23.6.5.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) Confirmation of agreement to deactivate/de-
              install capability within 180 days or agreed upon date. If determined the POC is
              required for an official operational tasking, the concept should be converted into
              the normal acquisition cycle.
              3.23.6.5.2.6. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA organizations should coordinate all
              issues, questions, and/or actions pertaining to NSA/CSS POC capabilities
              destined for or deployed to their locations with AFCO.
          3.23.6.5.3. (Added-AFISRA) The site will not extend a POC deployment schedule
          beyond the initial 6 months (or agreed upon date) without formal coordination of the
          requirement with appropriate AFISRA staff offices.
3.24. Post Implementation Review (PIR). The PIR is not a single event or test; it is a finite
sequence of activities when combined provides the necessary information and preliminary
planning to ensure weapon system effectiveness and suitability throughout the life cycle. The
PIR compares actual system performance to program expectations and mission realities based
upon the operational environment and CONOPS. PIR activities may be accomplished in the
context of typical program acquisition activities or system operational processes. Review of
Final Operation Test and Evaluation Results, Mission Readiness and Platform Readiness reports,
User Surveys, War Game results, and the Annual Chief Financial Officer Report are examples of
information that could be included in the PIR. Post Deployment Performance Review and PIR
may be used interchangeably, both terms refer to the same process; the evaluation of how well
actual program results have met established performance objectives for any acquisition program.
   3.24.1. The PM shall develop a PIR plan no later than the Full-Rate Production
   (Deployment) Decision Review/Full Deployment Decision Review (FDDR). The plan shall
   outline PIR activities to support initial deployment of each increment.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                             85


   3.24.2. The PM shall evaluate the programs current sustainment capability status, activities,
   and schedule to achieve the sustainment strategy‘s full capability to include sustainment
   attribute measurements, integrity monitoring activities and sustainment funding.
   3.24.3. The PM, in conjunction with the user, shall conduct program reviews comparing
   actual program results with the current program established performance goals from the
   Capability Document for all MDAP and MAIS programs.
   3.24.4. The initial PIR will be conducted after IOC but prior to FOC.
   3.24.5. The PM in conjunction with the user shall assess build-to system requirements,
   technical requirements and provisioning against facts-of-life mission realities and CONOPS.
   Disconnects between build-to and facts-of-life shall be identified and documented as a
   potential capability shortfall.
   3.24.6. The PM shall document the outcome of the PIR to include all identified shortfalls
   and adjustments due to mission realities and amend to the existing LCMP.
   3.24.7. DELETED.
3.25. System/Program Transfer. System/Program transfer is the process by which the
management authorities and responsibilities for AF weapon systems and acquisition programs
are formally transferred between AFMC product centers and logistics centers. There are two
overarching requirements associated with this process. First is the requirement for the losing and
gaining organizations to thoroughly coordinate the transition requirements, activities, and
timeframes associated with a proposed transfer. Second is the requirement for the gaining
organization to secure sufficient resources (manpower, funding, facilities, etc.) prior to accepting
weapon system/program management responsibilities. The overall objective of this process is to
ensure a seamless (within AFMC) and transparent (to the user) transition of system/program
management responsibilities.
   3.25.1. System/Program Transfer Requirements.                Management authorities and
   responsibilities for weapon systems and acquisition programs on the APML that are initially
   managed at an AFMC product center shall not be transferred to an Air Logistics Center
   (ALC) unless, at a minimum, the system, subsystem, component, or increment of capability
   has been certified as interoperable within its intended operational environment, has achieved
   IOC and FRP, and is logistically supportable per the user‘s requirement. Executive
   management responsibilities for acquisition programs identified on the APML shall remain
   with the PEO/DAO.
       3.25.1.1. Space systems/programs do not typically transfer to a logistics center for
       sustainment management. For space systems/programs that do not transfer, the
       acquisition program manager retains responsibility for the system for the life of the
       program. A PSM is assigned to manage sustainment activities within the program office;
       this person reports to the PM.
   3.25.2. System/Program Transfer Process. The system/program transfer process is a
   collaborative activity that is primarily executed by the PM at the losing organization, in close
   coordination with their counterparts at the gaining organization. PMs may initiate planning
   for program transfer at any point in the acquisition process, but must establish and document
   the initial target transfer date in the LCMP no later than MS C or as determined by the SAE.
 86                                               AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   As part of this planning activity, the losing PM shall determine and coordinate
   system/program transition requirements and timelines based on the criteria outlined in the
   previous paragraph, and the program transfer planning criteria and considerations described
   in AFPAM 63-128. As the transfer planning effort unfolds, the PM shall brief their transition
   plans, requirements, risks and risk mitigation plans, and associated timelines during
   applicable milestone and production/deployment decision reviews, and during other
   program/portfolio reviews as necessary to inform senior system/program management
   executives and resolve transfer-related issues.
   3.25.3. Transfer Support Plans (TSP). All system/program transfers shall be conducted in
   accordance with a Transfer Support Plan that is prepared by the losing PM in collaboration
   with their counterparts at the gaining organization. All affected PEOs/DAOs and AFMC
   center commanders that (will) oversee the program designated for transfer shall be
   signatories on the TSP. The AFMC/CC shall be the final signatory on the TSP prior to
   forwarding the plan to the SAE for approval. The PM shall target completion of the TSP no
   later than three years prior to the target transfer date. Once the TSP is approved, the losing
   PM shall update the program LCMP and any other detailed supporting plans/documents
   (systems engineering plan, test and evaluation master plan, etc.) as necessary to reflect the
   actions, timelines, and responsibilities specified in the TSP. The TSP will be maintained
   until the program transfer is completed, or a determination is made to terminate the proposed
   program transfer.
   3.25.4. Consult the System/Program Transfer Guide chapter in AFPAM 63-128 for
   additional guidance and information related to the system/program transfer process. This
   pamphlet provides detailed planning criteria and considerations that PMs can use to develop,
   coordinate, and implement TSPs.
   3.25.5. The PM shall provide TSP status to AFMC and the gaining logistics organization as
   requested and shall coordinate changes impacting the transfer date/ TSP with the MDA and
   the gaining logistics organization, and notify AFMC of approved changes as detailed in
   AFPAM 63-128.
3.26. Portfolio Transfer. Portfolio transfer is the process by which the management authorities
and responsibilities for AF acquisition programs are formally transferred between PEO and DAO
portfolios. Transfer of non-space programs between PEO and DAO portfolios shall be
coordinated through the AFMC/CC and approved by the SAE. The impacted PEO and DAO
shall prepare a joint request providing rationale and justification for the proposed transfer. Once
the portfolio transfer request is approved, the impacted PEO and DAO shall prepare and execute
a portfolio transfer plan.
3.27. Urgent Operational Needs. To satisfy Warfighter Urgent Operational Needs (UON),
refer to process in AFI 10-601 Capabilities-Based Requirements Development, Attachment 3,
Responding To Warfighter Urgent Operational Needs (UON) and AFI 63-114, Warfighter
Urgent Needs and the Rapid Response Process. The UON process provides a limited number of
needed systems/capabilities in a combat theater during an ongoing conflict or crisis situation to
address a critical capability gap/shortfall that could result in ―loss of life‖ and/or prevent mission
accomplishment. The Joint Urgent Operational Needs process is contained in CJCSI 3470.01,
Rapid Validation and Resourcing of Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of
Execution.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            87


3.28. Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Process. The AF Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Process
(WRAP) accelerates the development and fielding of operational initiatives resulting from
innovation. Guidance on the WRAP process may be found in AFPAM 63-128.
3.29. Joint Capability Technology Demonstration. The Joint Capability Technology
Demonstration (JCTD), previously called Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration
(ACTD), process is a pre-acquisition activity, spanning from two to four years. It provides the
user an opportunity to assess innovative technologically mature capabilities and determine the
military utility before deciding to acquire additional units. The concept falls between the Joint
Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) ―urgent needs‖ process of fewer than two years with little or no
development and the traditional, more deliberate, formal acquisition process that can stretch five
to ten years. JCTDs focus on four areas: Joint, Transformational, Coalition, and Inter-agency
capabilities.
   3.29.1. JCTDs are intended to exploit mature and maturing technologies to solve important
   military problems and to concurrently develop the associated CONOPS to permit the
   technologies to be fully exploited. These capabilities and operational concepts are then
   evaluated in military exercises on a scale large enough to clearly establish operational utility
   and system integrity. Emphasis is on technology assessment and integration rather than
   technology development. The demonstration is jointly sponsored by the operational user and
   the materiel development communities.
   3.29.2. JCTDs typically have one of three outcomes: 1) enter into formal acquisition as a
   new program; 2) integrate with an existing program; 3) return to technology development. A
   JCTD becomes a candidate for transition following a successful military utility assessment.
   A key goal of JCTDs is to move into the appropriate phase of formal acquisition without loss
   of momentum. To ensure transition occurs smoothly, the transition objective must be
   identified at the time the JCTD is initially approved and the transition strategy, including
   sustainment, must be included in the JCTD Management Plan approved by the SAE and
   developed during the detailed planning for the JCTD.
   3.29.3. The Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) is responsible for
   oversight of the JCTD process. Prior to approval of a JCTD, an ―Implementation Directive‖
   is required to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various parties executing the JCTD
   and to provide unambiguous top level guidance. This document is a succinct agreement
   which defines the operational capability to be demonstrated, the general approach, the
   agencies responsible for planning and conducting the demonstration, a notional approach to
   transition assuming a successful military utility assessment (MUA) and a positive acquisition
   decision, and the approximate funding and schedule. The Implementation Directive is
   typically signed by the sponsoring combatant command commander, Operations Deputy of
   the lead service, Joint Staff representative, the SAE, and DDR&E.
   3.29.4. More information can be found in CJCSI 3170.01 Joint Capabilities Integration and
   Development System, the JCIDS Manual, AFI 10-601, and at the JCTD webpage

3.30. Intelligence Supportability Requirements. The PM, in collaboration with the Center
Intelligence Office and other stakeholders, shall develop and document requirements and level of
intelligence support required for the life cycle of the system IAW AFI 14-111, Intelligence in
Force Modernization and AFI 14-205, Geospatial Information and Services. AFI 14-201,
Intelligence Production and Applications and CJCSI 3312.01a, Joint Military Intelligence
Requirements Certification.
   3.30.1. Documentation of intelligence requirements shall include the creation of a life cycle
   signature support plan for validated and approved signature dependent programs; in
   accordance with DOD Directive 5250.01, Management of Signature Support within the
   Department of Defense. Intelligence requirements can be developed and maintained as a
   stand-alone document or incorporated into the LCMP as appropriate.
       3.30.1.1. The signature support plan, developed during the Materiel Solution Analysis
       and Technology Development phases, shall be developed and fully defined in
       collaboration with the Center Intelligence Office prior to Milestone B , as defined in
       DOD Directive 5000.01 and DOD Instruction 5000.02. The support plan shall document
       signature data requirements for events and activities supporting all ACAT levels and
       phases of the acquisition process. Requirements captured in the plan shall include but not
       be limited to signature data used for intelligence, targeting, combat identification (CID),
       Blue Force tracking (BFT) and other tracks, smart munitions, training, weapon systems,
       and weapon systems development. The support plan will be reviewed, requirements re-
       verified and approved by Center Intelligence Office prior to each Milestone Decision.
       The support plan can be developed and maintained as a stand-alone document or
       incorporated into the LCMP as appropriate.
   3.30.2. In each instance that intelligence support is required, the following must occur:
       3.30.2.1. The Center Intelligence Office will determine if the program‘s intelligence
       requirements can be obtained from existing intelligence products. If the required
       intelligence does not currently exist, the PM will work with the Center Intelligence Office
       to develop a mitigation strategy; to include the development of cost estimates for tailored
       intelligence production.
       3.30.2.2. The Center Intelligence Office shall assist the PM initiate, develop and submit
       intelligence community production requests as required.
       3.30.2.3. If developmental or operational testing is required for any aspect of the
       program/initiative, the PM shall coordinate with the Center Intelligence Office and the
       Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) to plan for development of
       any intelligence resources that will ultimately be needed for testing and to develop data
       for inclusion in the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and supporting documents.
       3.30.2.4. The PM shall coordinate with the supporting intelligence office at AFMC,
       AFSPC or AF/A2 to develop the intelligence appendix to the Information Support Plan
       (ISP). Before the plan is submitted to the MDA, the intelligence appendix to the ISP
       must be approved by the supporting intelligence office.
   3.30.3. The PM will work collaboratively with the Center Intelligence Office to determine
   and document requirements for geospatial information support in accordance with AFI 14-
   205; to include those requirements supporting Foreign Military Sales program. The Center
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                        89


   Intelligence Office will provide the PM the appropriate geospatial information products as
   required. Requirements for National Geospatial Agency (NGA) geospatial product and
   services support not immediately available through the Center Intelligence Office must be
   submitted through AFMC/A2 or AFSPC/A2 to AF/A2 for approval.
   3.30.4. The PM shall engage with SAF/AQL for special access programs (SAP) or special
   access initiatives. SAF/AQL will work with the appropriate AF/A2 representative to
   determine whether intelligence support is required.
   3.30.5. All ACAT ID and pre-MDAP acquisition programs/initiatives or programs requiring
   joint oversight, must team with their Center Intelligence Office to prepare and provide
   intelligence related inputs to JCIDS documents and subsequent Intelligence Certification
   assessments.
   3.30.6. The PM will incorporate the results of intelligence supportability analysis as an
   integral component of life cycle planning, documentation, reviews and other programmatic
   activities and ensure the results consider supporting program protection activities.
3.31. Independent Assessments. Independent assessments not specified by statute, executive
orders, DOD issuances, or AF Policy Directives are at the discretion of the MDA. The
functional proponent for the independent assessment may appeal the decision to the DAE/SAE
for assessments within the acquisition execution chain and to AFMC/CC or to AFSPC/CC for
assessments within the sustainment execution chain.
3.32. Nuclear Weapon Related Acquisition. Life-cycle management of Joint Air Force-
National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-NNSA) developed nuclear weapons will be
accomplished in accordance with DODD 3150.1, Joint DOD-DOE Nuclear Weapon Life-Cycle
Activities, DODI 5030.55, DOD Procedures For Joint DOD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life-Cycle
Activities, and AFI 63-103, Joint Air Force-National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-
NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Management. Where the AF and NNSA have agreed
through a weapon-specific memorandum of understanding that the AF will be responsible for the
life cycle management (to include acquisition and sustainment) for specific non-nuclear
components/subsystems integral to a joint AF-NNSA nuclear weapon program, the DOD 5000-
series publications and this instruction shall be followed. Additional Air Force nuclear weapon
related policy may be found in AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program, AFI
63-125, Nuclear Certification Program, AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE Program, AFI 20-110,

Section 3B—Acquisition Programmatic Requirements

3.33. Acquisition Programmatic Requirements Overview. The following section outlines
acquisition program management requirements that shall be addressed throughout the program
life cycle development and execution process.
 90                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


3.34. Documentation. The PM is responsible for completing or coordinating all applicable
program documentation as required by statute and policy and assessing the value to the program
of other related documentation requirements. However, the law does not always specify format
or level of detail.
   3.34.1. The PM shall ensure sufficient detail is included in documentation to facilitate a
   decision by the MDA. If the PM analysis indicates a documented functional requirement
   does not add value, the PM can require the proponent to justify the requirement. The
   functional proponent may appeal a PM determination through the programmatic chain up to
   the MDA. The burden of proof lies with the proponent.
   3.34.2. No document will be ―held hostage.‖ Reviewing offices need to expedite their
   coordination within the time specified by the MDA/PM and either ―concur‖ or ―non-concur.‖
   Concurrence and coordination by all parties involved may not be necessary for an MDA to
   make a decision. If applicable, staff packages should reflect the ―non-concur‖ and stated
   reasons so the MDA can make a fully informed decision. PMs shall use automated tools, as
   available, to streamline coordination and approval.
   3.34.3. The PM shall ensure program documentation is maintained and made available
   electronically. The PM shall ensure the LCMP, ISP, SEP, and the TEMP are consistent and
   complementary documents. The PM shall consolidate information requirements and
   streamline documentation as approved by the MDA and consistent with statute, regulations,
   policies, and mandates.
3.35. Materiel Development Decision (MDD). All potential programs proceed through an
MDD review when entering the acquisition lifecycle framework. The MDD review is the formal
entry into the acquisition process substantiating the need for a materiel solution based on a
validated capability gap. MDD reviews will be conducted using the established Defense
Acquisition Board (DAB) / Information Technology Acquisition Board (ITAB) / Air Force
Review Board (AFRB) processes. The MDD review shall ensure that a complete and rigorous
analysis/assessment of alternatives and their non-materiel implications will be or has been
conducted. An MDA decision to begin Materiel Solution Analysis DOES NOT mean that a new
acquisition program has been initiated.
   3.35.1. MDD Authority. The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), as the Milestone
   Decision Authority, (MDA) chairs the MDD for all potential Air Force Acquisition Category
   (ACAT) I and IA programs, unless delegated or designated per DODI 5000.02. The SAE, as
   the MDA, chairs all potential ACAT II MDD reviews unless delegated to a Program
   Executive Officer (PEO) or a Designated Acquisition Official (DAO). The PEO or DAO, as
   MDA, chairs all potential ACAT III MDD reviews unless the MDA authority has been
   delegated to the Deputy PEO.
   3.35.2. MDD Preparation. Prior to the MDD review, organizations have the following
   responsibilities:
       3.35.2.1. The Lead Operational MAJCOM (or other sponsor organization):
          3.35.2.1.1. Leads the effort to develop and obtain approval of the Initial Capabilities
          Document (ICD) or other document that validates the capability gap (supported by

     MAJCOM draft AoA Study Guidance to ensure readiness for presentation to MDA at the
     MDD.
  3.35.3. Conducting the MDD. The MDD review occurs at a DAB / ITAB / AFRB or other
  venue as established by MDA or DOD policy. The MDD precedes entry into the acquisition
  management system. At a minimum, conducting an MDD is dependent upon a JROC /
  AFROC approved ICD (validated capability gap) and the D, CAPE / Lead Operational
  MAJCOM being prepared to present the AoA Study Guidance or alternative analysis /
  supporting analysis guidance for MDA approval. At the MDD, organizations have the
  following responsibilities:

          AFSPC input.
3.36. Courses of Action (COA). The purpose of the Courses of Action (COA) is to present the
operational MAJCOM commander with acquisition strategy options for the selected materiel
solution resulting from AoAs. The AoAs should clearly articulate performance, schedule, and
cost expectations as well as initial risk assessment of the program to ensure expectations are
known and agreed to up front. The COA will serve as the basis for the Acquisition Strategy,
TDS, T&E Strategy, LCMP and PMA. Approval at the lead MAJCOM commander and MDA
level for the selected COA will ensure agreement among leadership on program expectations,
risks and performance (or incremental performance) for specified cost and schedule goals.
   3.36.1. COA Team Composition. The COA team, led by the acquisition community, is
   comprised of representatives from S&T, T&E, financial management, contracting,
   planning/requirements, intelligence, sustainment, acquisition, and user communities and
   others that are deemed necessary.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         95


  3.36.2. COA Development. The MDA (or designee) will lead the development of the COA
  in conjunction with the user to identify different acquisition strategy approaches for the
  selected materiel solution selected from the AoA. The acquisition strategy options may vary
  based upon the full or partial capabilities needed by the user over time coupled with the type
  of approach recommended. Different COAs may have different contracting strategies,
  incremental development schedules, product support considerations, or deployment
  methodologies. A preliminary T&E strategy will also be developed for each COA to provide
  a complete picture for the decision maker. The important differences between past practices
  and this one are that the user fully participates in the process, and the lead MAJCOM
  commander is presented with more than one approach. While the TDS sequentially follows
  the COA, the COA cannot be created without an understanding of the technology and
  maturity levels needed to provide the new capabilities. After the MAJCOM selects a
  preferred COA, the TDS and T&E strategy become the plans for lowering technical risk
  during the Technology Development Phase.
     3.36.2.1. COA Attributes. Joint Pub 5-00.1, Joint Doctrine for Campaign Planning,
     defines required COA attributes this way: ―A valid COA must be: 1) Suitable:
     accomplish the mission and support the commander‘s guidance; 2) Feasible: accomplish
     the mission within the established time, space, and resource constraint; 3) Acceptable:
     balance cost with advantage gained by executing a particular COA; 4) Distinguishable:
     each COA must be significantly different from the others; and 5) Complete: must
     incorporate major operations and tasks to be accomplished, logistics concept,
     employment concept, time estimates for reaching objectives and desired end state.‖
     3.36.2.2. Preparing COAs. The COA has no specified format. Each COA briefly
     describes how the program will deliver the required capability to the user and clearly
     state the cost, schedule, and performance objectives. A collaborative team (acquirer,
     user, tester, sustainer, etc.) determines the specific content of the COA. The COA should
     state an initial risk assessment. COAs will capture possible tradespace to satisfy user
     capability needs. The final COAs should clearly state each capability‘s development
     schedule and delivery date as well as cost estimates. The commitments in the COAs
     should be presented at the most realistic level possible. Documentation must show
     confidence levels regarding cost, schedule, capabilities delivered, risk mitigation, etc.
  3.36.3. Selecting a COA.
     3.36.3.1. Submittal. Once complete, the MDA will approve the PM‘s COAs in writing
     and submit them to the lead operational MAJCOM.
     3.36.3.2. Selection. The lead MAJCOM may select a COA or decide not to pursue the
     requirement. Should the MAJCOM choose a COA, it will serve as a formal agreement
     between the MDA and lead MAJCOM commander. The lead MAJCOM commander‘s
     decision will serve as a basis for the AS/LCMP and the PMA.
     3.36.3.3. Funding and Changes. The selected COA will include the lead MAJCOM‘s
     commitment to appropriately fund the development effort in accordance the governing
     Program Objectives Memorandum (POM). Any changes must be in writing with the
     mutual agreement of the MDA and the lead MAJCOM.
 96                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       3.36.3.4. Documenting a COA. The COA will serve as an agreement and will be
       reflected in the program‘s acquisition documentation. Help from the Acquisition Center
       of Excellence (ACE), either locally at the Product or Logistics Centers or at SAF/AQ, is
       available to assist PMs as they prepare the COAs. The COA can later be used as the
       starting point for the PMA.
3.37. Program Management Directive (PMD). The PMD conveys the guidance and direction
of the decision authority and identifies the various organizations along with their essential
responsibility for ensuring the success of a program or other effort. This includes the PEO,
DAO, PM, CDs, HAF offices, MAJCOMs, test organizations, FOAs, and any other component
or organization essential for meeting the operational need. PMDs are required for funded
programs contained in the Acquisition Program Master List (APML). If events necessitate
programmatic changes, the PMD OPR must update the PMD. (See Headquarters Operating
Instruction (HOI) 63-1, HQ AF Guidance for Preparing Program Management Directives, for
additional details and guidance).
3.38. Product Support Considerations and Strategic Sourcing Determination. Product
support considerations and strategic sourcing considerations shall be identified as part of
development planning.        This includes identifying and documenting product support
considerations and strategic sourcing as part of AoA and COA analysis and decisions. Product
support considerations and strategic sources determination shall be made as early as feasible and
should consider the Air Force enterprise needs.
3.39. Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP). The Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) is
the integrated acquisition and sustainment strategy for the life of the system. The LCMP fulfills
the FAR, DFARS, and AFFARS requirements of the Acquisition Plan and the DODI 5000.02
requirements of the Acquisition Strategy which includes the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan. (See
AFPAM 63-128 for LCMP template and detailed guidance.)
   3.39.1. The PM shall develop a LCMP that documents the life cycle strategies necessary to
   satisfy statutory and regulatory requirements for programs or modifications acquired under
   DODI 5000.02. The LCMP streamlines, consolidates, and makes visible to senior leadership
   all aspects of the program. The LCMP shall guide program execution from program
   initiation (generally at MS B) through demilitarization and will be used as the basis for
   program transfer planning and materiel (hardware, software, and services) fielding decisions.
   3.39.2. The LCMP is required for all programs on the APML, weapon systems identified in
   AFPD 10-9 Lead Command Designations and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, and
   space acquisition programs. At the AFMC/CC, ALC/CC, or PM discretion, programs on the
   SPML may utilize an LCMP. At the AFSPC/CC, SMC/CC, or PM discretion, space
   programs in sustainment may utilize an LCMP. It shall be approved prior to program
   initiation (normally MS B), drafted as early as possible and continually matured through
   program life cycle. An LCMP is required for ACAT III programs; however this can be
   accomplished by a tailored LCMP as approved by the LCMP approval authority.
       3.39.2.1. The LCMP shall be updated/approved preceding each milestone decision point
       or whenever the approved strategies change.
       3.39.2.2. At the discretion of the approval authority, the LCMP for a modification may
       be an annex to the existing and approved system LCMP.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                        97


     3.39.2.3. Fact-of-life changes, such as updates to schedule and funding adjustments, do
     not require a re-coordination of the LCMP unless they drive a significant change in the
     approved strategies or APB.
     3.39.2.4. Existing programs that do not currently have an LCMP shall transition to an
     LCMP when the program:
         3.39.2.4.1. Enters a new milestone, or
         3.39.2.4.2. Implements a significant change that would have resulted in a revision to
         the Product Support Management Plan (PSMP), or
         3.39.2.4.3. Implements a major system modification. At the discretion of the
         approval authority, the requirement may be met with an annex to the existing system
         approved acquisition/sustainment strategy documentation. The annex will be

3.43. Technology Development Strategy (TDS). The TDS defines the activities of the
Technology Development Phase and provides the technology development strategy over the
system life cycle. The results of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) during the Materiel Solution
Analysis Phase provide the basis for the TDS. The TDS documents the plan for multiple
technology development demonstrations or prototypes that may be necessary before the user and
developer agree that a proposed technology solution is affordable, militarily useful, and based on
mature technology. (Reference: Public Law 107-314, Section 803.)
   3.43.1. The MDA shall determine who will prepare the Technology Development Strategy
   (TDS). AFRL shall assist in the preparation of a TDS for MS A, B, and C when appropriate.
   3.43.2. The TDS is required for MS A and precedes the formal acquisition strategy. The
   TDS is updated at subsequent milestones and does not need to be a standalone document. It
   may be subsumed into the LCMP after MS A. The technical content of the TDS shall be
   consistent with the SEP. For evolutionary acquisition programs, the TDS shall be approved
   by the MDA prior to the start of each increment.
   3.43.3. Final Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for the Technology Development Phase should
   not be released or any action be taken that would commit the program to a particular
   contracting strategy for Technology Development, until the MDA has approved the TDS.
   3.43.4. The TDS at a minimum shall include the requirements defined in DODI 5000.02. In
   addition the TDS shall include the following:
       3.43.4.1. A summary of the prototyping and competition approach including the number
       of competing prototypes, prototype units, and prototype subsystem elements that may be
       produced and deployed during technology development. It will identify the decision

       performance goals. Unless waived, competitive prototyping is now a statutory
       requirement for MDAPs. (Reference: Public Law 111-23).
       3.43.4.2. Address reliability, availability, maintainability, and supportability (RAMS)
       concepts and technologies to ensure the technology(s) being developed meet the RAMS
       capability needs identified in the ICD.
       3.43.4.3. The technology development test plan, including the goals and exit criteria for
       technologies being developed in all phases of the acquisition not just the Technology
       Development Phase. This plan is distinct from the separately developed and approved
       T&E Strategy which takes a broader view.
       3.43.4.4. A summary of the intelligence support (to include signature data) required to
       develop and execute the TDS, concept/goal development, prototype evaluation and exit
       criteria for completing the Technology Development phase.
   3.43.5. AFRL Support. AFRL will support the development of the TDS and the associated
   risk plan. To rapidly and successfully transition their technology projects into operational
   military systems, AFRL will support the development of phased capabilities requirements by
   helping the acquisition and operational communities assess the maturity and viability of
   considered technologies in the operational environment.
       3.43.5.1. Help secure approved technology transition plans (TTP), to include prime
       contractors.
       3.43.5.2. Help secure associate contractor agreements between the technology developer
       and the acquisition systems prime contractor, if required.
       3.43.5.3. Support seamless communication and collaboration to assist in the
       incorporation of identified technologies; when appropriate co-locate laboratory personnel
       with the PM.
       3.43.5.4. Ensure incorporation of SE methodologies tailored for AFRL technology
       development done in support of EA programs.
       3.43.5.5. Ensure enhanced management oversight to quickly identify and resolve any
       issues that arise, and exploit additional collaborative opportunities.
       3.43.5.6. Ensure coordination from stakeholders that the fielded technology is
       supportable within program cost and time constraints.
3.44. Test and Evaluation (T&E) Strategy. The PM, working through the Integrated test
Team, shall ensure the T&E strategy is approved by MS A for all programs on the APML. The
T&E Strategy is the overarching integrated T&E plan for the entire acquisition program that
describes how operational capability requirements will be tested and evaluated in support of the
acquisition strategy. The T&E strategy addresses modeling and simulation, risk and risk
mitigation, development of support equipment, and identifies how system concepts will be
evaluated against mission requirements, among other things. The TE strategy is a precursor to
the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). Guidance on development of the T&E Strategy
can be found in AFI 99-103.
3.45. Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). The PM, working through the ITT, shall
ensure a TEMP is prepared prior to MS B for applicable programs in accordance with AFI 99-
 104                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


103. The TEMP integrates the requirements, acquisition, Test and Evaluation (T&E), and
sustainment strategies, along with all T&E schedules, funding, and resources, into an efficient
continuum of integrated testing. PMs must not disregard T&E for commercial-off-the-shelf
(COTS), non-developmental items (NDI), and government-furnished equipment (GFE). TEMPs
are strongly encouraged for all programs, projects, and activities. Guidance on development of
the TEMP can be found in AFI 99-103.
3.46. Integrated Master Plans (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedules (IMS). The PM
shall develop and maintain the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedule
(IMS) that integrates all program activities and schedules into a single sight picture. This
includes integrated master schedules from all contractors, as well as government activities to
include test plans. The IMP and IMS provide a basis for effective communication; serve as
baselines for program plans, status, and progress; and provide a basis for resource analysis,
exploration of alternatives, and cost, performance, and schedule tradeoff studies. They should be
integrated at all levels, contain sufficient detail, and capture key events. Refer to Defense
Acquisition Guidebook for additional information.
   3.46.1. Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) Analysis. The PM shall perform
   recurring, cost, schedule, and risk analysis of the contractors‘ PMB to assure continuing
   progress and program realism. PMB should contain sufficient detail, account for all scope,
   reflect accurate schedules, and must be jointly reviewed to assess implementation of the
   contractor‘s earned value system via the IBR process. The IBR is a continuous, iterative
   process throughout the life of the effort to ensure continued realism of the integrated PMB.
   Disciplined and comprehensive reviews of the IMP, IMS, and PMB are essential to avoid
   surprises and miscommunication.
3.47. Reliability,      Availability,   and      Maintainability      (RAM)         Analysis    and
Documentation. Overall responsibility for establishing and documenting RAM requirements
for a system rests with the system's lead MAJCOM. Weapon system capability and
supportability will be used throughout the entire life cycle to evaluate program status.
Reliability, availability, and maintainability are system parameters which directly contribute to
mission capability and supportability. The system's program manager, in collaboration with the
sustainment community, is responsible for conducting an analysis of the users‘ requirements and
recommending RAM parameters that are within the technical, cost, schedule, and risk constraints
of the program. In this analysis, consideration shall be given to the entire life cycle requirements
and design decisions shall strive to minimize total ownership costs and the logistics footprint
while delivering effective and suitable operational capability. RAM requirements shall be
developed for all programs, regardless of ACAT level, in concert with operational requirements
and addressed throughout the system life cycle. The PM shall implement a RAM strategy that
includes a reliability growth program as an integral part of design, development, and sustainment
to ensure mandatory sustainment KPPs and supporting materiel reliability KSAs are met. The
RAM strategy shall emphasize the reduction of life cycle costs through cost-effective RAM
initiatives and investments throughout the life of the system. The RAM strategy shall be
integrated within the Systems Engineering processes and addressed in the SEP and LCSP portion
of the LCMP. Reference the DOD Guide for Achieving Reliability, Availability, and
Maintainability and the DOD Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Cost Rationale
Report Manual for additional information.

      requirements and their operational utility. This includes the RAMS impacts analysis
      performed during the user‘s AoA and KPP determination, operational effectiveness
      analysis for each increment, and total cost of ownership analysis. This should be an
      interactive process with the developer‘s analysis to ensure proper balance between
      operational utility, cost, schedule, and risk considerations.
      3.47.3.6. The PM shall document the RAM parameters and methods of calculation that,
      as a minimum, include the following areas: availability, reliability, cost of ownership, and

3.48. Risk Management Plans. The PM shall prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for all
ACAT programs, potential ACAT programs, and Services Category I and II programs. The
RMP describes the strategy by which the program will coordinate and integrate its risk
management efforts to include a description and the responsibilities of the cross-functional risk
management IPT. The Risk Management Guide for DOD Acquisition is the basic guidance for
executing risk management.
   3.48.1. The PM shall use the 5x5 risk matrix, likelihood criteria, and consequence criteria
   provided in Chapter 12 of AFPAM 63-128 to assess cost, schedule, performance, and other
   program risks.
       3.48.1.1. Risks identified using the MILSTD882D system safety methodology shall be
       translated using Table 3.1, Translation of MIL-STD-882D Risk Matrix to the OSD Risk
       Management Guide Matrix.
       3.48.1.2. The RMP can be incorporated into the LCMP or other appropriate planning
       document. The RMP shall be linked to the risk management activities described in other
       planning documents (e.g., source selection plan, SEP, PESHE).
       3.48.1.3. The RMP shall be developed and continually matured throughout the life of the
       weapon system.
   3.48.2. The PM shall prepare risk handling/mitigation plans for all moderate and high risks.
   The PM shall ensure a mechanism is in place to track and archive all risks and
   handling/mitigation plans throughout the program‘s life cycle.
   3.48.3. DELETED.
   3.48.4. The PM shall present the following risk related information as a part of all program,
   technical, and Milestone decision reviews or to support other key decision points.
       3.48.4.1. The standard 5x5 risk matrix. On the risk matrix, the PM shall plot, and be
       prepared to discuss, each of the program‘s identified ―high‖ and moderate risks and the

Table 3.1. Translation of MIL-STD-882D Risk Matrix to the OSD Risk Management
Guide Matrix.




3.49. Programmatic Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Evaluation
(PESHE). The PM shall prepare and maintain a PESHE throughout the life of the program. The
PESHE is required at MS B, MS C, and at the Full-Rate Production Decision Review/Full
Deployment Decision Review/Build Approval. The PM shall obtain formal coordination of new
and updated PESHEs from their Product Center or ALC Environmental, Safety, SG offices, and
ESOHC-IPT offices. The PESHE must document the following:
   3.49.1. The strategy for integrating ESOH considerations into the SE process (reference
   MIL-STD-882D as a guide). This ESOH integration strategy must define the division of
   roles and responsibilities with the HSI effort for the overlapping domains of environment,
   safety and occupational health.
   3.49.2. The ESOH risk matrix, including definitions of each of the ESOH Severity
   Categories, Probability Levels, Risk Values, and Risk Categories.
   3.49.3. The ESOH hazard tracking data, preferably by linking to the hazard tracking system.
   This should include hazardous materials, wastes, and pollutants. (AFI 32-7086, Hazardous

   for reporting the status of ESOH hazards to the testers, operators, and maintainers.
   3.49.5. A compliance schedule for National Environmental Policy Act/ Environmental
   Impact Analysis Process (NEPA/EIAP) (42 USC §4321-4370d and Executive Order 12114).
   SAF/AQR is the Air Force approval authority for NEPA documentation for which the PM is
   the proponent (32 CFR 989).
   3.49.6. Identification of roles, responsibilities, and resources allocated for ESOH
   management within the SE process.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            109


   3.49.7. A reasonably current assessment of the ESOH management efforts using the
   ODUSD(A&T)/SSE ―System Safety-ESOH Management Evaluation Criteria for DOD
   Acquisition.‖
   3.49.8. Identification of system-specific applications that use hexavalent chromium (Cr6+).
   Include risks associated with Cr6+ use, efforts to qualify less toxic alternatives, and status of
   PEO or ALC/CC approval to continue to use Cr6+ in each application. Analysis of
   alternatives should address cost/schedule risks and life cycle cost comparisons (including
   material handling and disposal costs and system overhaul cycle times/costs due to differences
   in corrosion protection). Reference Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning paragraph
   (3.68) of this document for guidance on integrating with corrosion control planning and
   obtaining PEO or ALC/CC approval for each Cr6+ application.
3.50. Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The PM shall evaluate the benefits of including
Modeling and Simulation. M&S is a key enabler to reduce weapon system life cycle costs
(LCC) as well as reduce risk and accelerate acquisition and fielding. M&S can facilitate the
analysis of complex new system requirements and designs and expand performance envelopes.
   3.50.1. The PM shall coordinate M&S activities with other design, analysis, and
   T&E/verification and validation (V&V) activities to capitalize on efficiencies and savings.
       3.50.1.1. If applicable, the PM shall coordinate with the Center Intelligence Office to
       assess the need and determine the most appropriate method to obtain intelligence data for
       M&S. For more information reference AFI 14-206, Modeling and Simulation.
       3.50.1.2. If applicable, the PM shall plan for the use of M&S to support aircraft-stores
       certification over the life cycle of the item, in accordance with AFI 63-104, SEEK
       EAGLE Program.
       3.50.1.3. If applicable, the PM shall plan for the use of M&S to facilitate analysis of
       complex systems and SoS requirements and designs.The PM shall plan for and insert
       M&S early and throughout the life cycle. The PM shall document M&S analysis and
       resulting plans in the SEP and T&E Strategy as well as provide a summary in the LCMP.
3.51. Contractor Incentives. AF acquisition activities shall implement contract strategies,
applying incentives where appropriate, to consistently motivate excellent contract performance
while ensuring cost, schedule, and technical performance control. Contract fee structures must
be implemented throughout the life cycle that tie incentive or award fee to realized program
outcomes while, simultaneously recognizing the contractor‘s need to earn fees throughout the
contract performance period. There is no ―one size fits all‖ incentive strategy; the PM must use
methods to reward performance, motivating the contractor to deliver all contractual requirements
in a superior manner. Further direction is found in an appended note to 10 USC §2302, FAR
Part 16, and DFARS Parts 215 and 216. Refer to AFPAM 63-128 for further guidance on
contract incentives.
3.52. Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) Limitations. The MDA, PEO, DAO, and PM shall
ensure no entity performing Lead System Integrator (LSI) functions in the acquisition of a major
system by the Department of Defense has any direct financial interest in the development or
construction of an individual system or element of a system of systems or is performing
inherently governmental functions (reference PL 110-181 Section 802).
 110                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


3.53. Inherently Governmental Functions Determinations. If contractor support services are
being considered as part of the acquisition strategy, the PM shall solicit and receive written
determination from the Installation/Wing Manpower Office identifying if there are military
(active or Reserve Component) or civilian employees of the Air Force available to perform the
functions and if the required services are inherently governmental, acquisition functions closely
associated with inherently governmental functions, or otherwise inappropriate for performance
by contractor employees. (Reference DODI 1100.22, Guidance for Determining Workforce Mix,
FAR Subpart 7.5, DFARS Subpart 207.503(S-70), and Title 10 USC. §2463.)
3.54. Commercial Item Purchase. Commercial purchase determinations and guidance is
contained within Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements
(Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and AF Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (AFFARS)).
3.55. Buy American Act (BAA). The BAA was codified in 1933 to provide preferential
treatment for domestic sources of un-manufactured articles, manufactured goods, and
construction material.
   3.55.1. BAA applies to supplies and construction materials above the micro–purchases
   thresholds and restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products for use
   within the US. (Reference 10 USC. §10a-10d)
   3.55.2. For specific guidance and regulations, please follow FAR Part 25 as supplemented
   by DFARS Part 225 and AFFARS Part 5325.
3.56. Berry Amendment and 10 USC §2533b Compliance. Similar to the BAA, the Berry
Amendment and 10 USC §2533b restricts the purchase of specific items to domestic sources
unless exempted or waived. The Berry Amendment establishes domestic source preferences for
different commodities, including textiles, specialty metals, and machine or hand tools, in DOD
acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold. 10 USC §2533b establishes domestic
source preferences for specialty metals.
   3.56.1. The PM shall ensure that all activities within the acquisition cycle are compliant with
   10 USC. §2533a and §2533b unless they have an approved Domestic Non-Availability
   Determination (DNAD). 10 USC §2533a applies to all food, clothing, tents, cotton and other
   natural fiber products, and hand or measuring tools; 10 USC §2533b applies to specialty
   metals.
   3.56.2. A DNAD to the Berry Amendment and 10 USC §2533b may be granted only by the
   SECAF, another Service Secretary, or OUSD (AT&L).
   3.56.3. The Berry Amendment applies to contracts and subcontracts for procurement of
   commercial items, applies to both end products and raw materials and applies to Foreign
   Military Sales (FMS) cases. If the end product is comprised of components made of
   restricted items or materials, those components must also be wholly domestic of origin and
   manufacture unless either an exception or a waiver exists. (Reference Section 804 of the
   Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008).
   3.56.4. For specific guidance and regulations, please follow FAR Part 25 as supplemented
   by DFARS Part 225 and AFFARS Part 5325.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                           111


3.57. Leasing. For specific guidance and regulations governing leasing equipment follow the
regulations and guidance found in DFARS 207.4, DOD Financial Management Regulation
7000.14-R and OMB Circulars A-11 and A-94.
3.58. Serialized Item Management (SIM). The purpose of SIM is to improve the AF‘s
capability to manage materiel through the generation, collection, and analysis of data on
individual assets in order to enhance asset visibility, financial accountability, and improved
weapon system life cycle management. SIM is enabled through Item Unique Identification
(IUID), automatic identification technology (AIT), and automated information systems (AIS).
IUID is the assignment and marking of individual assets with a standardized, machine-readable,
two-dimensional marking containing a globally unique and unambiguous item identifier. AIT is
the technology used to scan the marking at points within the supply chain to identify discrete
transactions of an asset as well as transmit the data collected from these transactions to AIS. AIS
store and process the data so it can be used to make informed decisions concerning the
management of the asset or the system. Reference DODD 8320.03, Unique Identification (UID)
Standards for a Net-Centric Department of Defense, DODI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification
(IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property, DOD Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items and
DODI 4151.19, Serialized Item Management (SIM) for Materiel Maintenance, for additional
guidance.
   3.58.1. The PM shall ensure all solicitations, contracts or delivery orders that result in the
   delivery of tangible personal property to the Government include IUID requirements using
   the DFARS clause 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation and, as applicable,
   DFARS clause 252.211-7007, Item Unique Identification of Government Property. This
   includes service contracts for repair of an unmarked item that results in the delivery of a
   marked repaired item. Where a contract or delivery order was signed prior to the
   implementation date of the DFARS clause 252.211-7003, the clause will be inserted into the
   contract or delivery order as soon as feasible, but no later than at a phased event or exercise
   of a contract option, or other modification of contractual requirements.
   3.58.2. The PM shall require unique identification for assets meeting the following criteria:
   (For additional guidance see DODI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for
   Tangible Personal Property, DOD 4140.1-R, Supply Chain Material Management
   Regulation, DoD Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items, and AF Manual 23-110, USAF Supply
   Manual, Vol. 1, Part 4 and Vol. 2, Part 13.)
       3.58.2.1. Items (a single hardware article or unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies,
       components, or constituent parts) for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is
       $5,000 or more. For existing items already owned by the Government, this value should
       be construed as the acquisition value to replace the item.
       3.58.2.2. Items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000,
       when identified by the managing or requiring activity as serially managed, mission
       essential, controlled inventory or requiring permanent identification.
       3.58.2.3. Any DOD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within
       a delivered item, regardless of value.
       3.58.2.4. Any parent item (as defined in DFARS 252.211-7003(a)) that contains the
       serially managed embedded subassembly, component, or part.
112                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


  3.58.3. IUID criteria apply to government assets and tangible personal property assets owned
  by the AF in the possession of contractors know as Property in the Possession of Contractors
  (also generically known as Government Furnished Property (GFP)). Reference DOD Item
  Unique Identification of Government Property Guidebook for more information.
  3.58.4. IUID requirements shall apply to security assistance programs.
  3.58.5. The PM shall document the SIM strategy including the IUID implementation plan in
  the LCMP and Information Support Plan (ISP).
      3.58.5.1. The PM shall document a plan for IUID in the LCMP. The plan will consider
      maintenance strategy and ownership of spare parts inventory when determining what
      assets should be considered for unique identification.
      3.58.5.2. The PM shall identify in the ISP any system operational needs for data to
      conduct SIM in order for Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) to be used as the key field to
      associate data on tangible personal property assets.
  3.58.6. The PM shall ensure information on marked items is included in the DOD IUID
  Registry.
  3.58.7. The PM shall prepare an IUID implementation plan for all programs that result in the
  delivery of tangible personal property items to the Department of Defense and address all
  items meeting the IUID criteria. The implementation plan will address cost, schedule,
  impacts on legacy assets in service and in inventory, existing on-going contracts, engineering
  drawing update strategy, budget requirements, and impacts to FMS. Plans should reflect
  coordination between program acquisition and sustainment activities, and industry.
  Additional guidance and a template for the IUID implementation plan can be found in
  AFPAM 63-128.
      3.58.7.1. The PM shall prepare an initial IUID implementation plan within 90 days of
      ACAT designation.
      3.58.7.2. Plans will be approved by the program‘s MDA (or equivalent for non-ACAT
      programs). Adequacy of the IUID implementation plan requirements shall be assessed at
      all milestone reviews.
      3.58.7.3. The PM shall review the plan prior to each milestone or at least annually to
      ensure currency and track progress toward completion until all items used by the program
      have been uniquely identified.
      3.58.7.4. IUID Implementation Plans will be consolidated for programs related to the
      same weapon system in a logical manner while maintaining appropriate visibility on
      priority programs.
      3.58.7.5. Program planning for AIT infrastructure requirements and/or AIS
      enhancements to include IUID should occur only if the program is responsible for the
      management and/or maintenance of AIT and/or AIS.
      3.58.7.6. Plans should identify the items used by the program that meet the IUID criteria.
      This includes items managed by the AF, other DOD Components and Agencies,
      Government agencies outside the DOD, or support contractors.
  3.58.8. The PM shall use AIT for unique identification of items.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            113


   3.58.9. Physical application of a Unique Item Identifier (UII) will follow MIL-STD-130,
   Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property.
       3.58.9.1. Where engineering analysis determines physical application of a UII would
       destroy the form, fit, or function of an item, an alternate method to uniquely identify the
       item will be used.
       3.58.9.2. The PM for MAIS that will store data on tangible personal property assets shall
       ensure the system can accommodate all needed UII data for the identified assets.
3.59. Military Equipment Valuation (MEV). Military Equipment Valuation is a DOD
initiative to capitalize, and depreciate assets, including modifications, to meet federal accounting
standards as defined in DOD Instruction 5006.64, Accountability and Management of DOD-
Owned Equipment and Other Accountable Property.
   3.59.1. The PM shall account for all Military Equipment assets subject to capitalization and
   depreciation.
   3.59.2. Military Equipment is defined as tangible assets that:
       3.59.2.1. Have an expected useful life of two or more years;
       3.59.2.2. Are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business;
       3.59.2.3. Are intended to be used or are available for use in performance of military
       missions, to include training; and
       3.59.2.4. Meet the capitalization threshold found in the DOD Financial Management
       Regulation (FMR) Volume 4, Chapter 6.
   3.59.3. Military Equipment Valuation:
       3.59.3.1. Is required for aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), unmanned
       air vehicles, pods, satellite launchers and satellites.
       3.59.3.2. Will not be performed on drones, munitions, initial spares, repair parts,
       simulators and other ballistic missiles. In addition, other equipment assets (e.g., ground
       equipment, support equipment, etc.) will be valued as general purpose equipment.
   3.59.4. The PM shall include a military equipment program description as part of the LCMP.
   At Milestone C/(or any other decision point that leads to production or procurement of end
   items to be used for operations) for any program, project, product or system that has
   deliverable end items that meet the capitalization threshold, the program‘s military
   equipment description will identify the following deliverables at a detail level consistent with
   level 2 of the Program Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (detailed guidance on the work
   breakdown structures for defense materiel items is located in MIL-HDBK-881):
       3.59.4.1. The assets meeting the capitalization thresholds.
       3.59.4.2. The government furnished material that will be included in the assets.
       3.59.4.3. Other deliverables that will accompany the assets (e.g., manuals, technical data,
       etc.).
 114                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       3.59.4.4. Other types of deliverables that will be bought with program funding (e.g.,
       initial spares, support equipment, etc.) but that cannot be directly attributed to a specific
       assets.
   3.59.5. The PM shall ensure proper accounting and contractual allocation of program
   expenditures between capitalized assets and expenses. This shall be completed for every
   program, project, product, or system that has deliverable assets. Detailed guidance on
   accounting policy and procedures may be found in DOD 7000.14-R, DOD FMR Volume 4
   and at OSD‘s military equipment website.
       3.59.5.1. Business/Financial Management Analysts will identify to contracting personnel
       the items and services to be acquired and segregate them by accounting treatment within
       the requests for acquisition of services or materiel (e.g., military equipment; operating
       materials and supplies; inventory; internal use software; expenses). Each type of
       deliverable must be uniquely distinguishable and identified individually as a separate line
       item on the requisition.
       3.59.5.2. The PM shall ensure the gross book value of military equipment assets and
       modification to those assets are provided to the Air Force‘s MEV system. The PM shall
       also ensure the useful life of the assets and modification programs are also provided to
       the MEV system.
   3.59.6. Contracting Officers will be responsible for creating the proper contract line item
   (CLIN) and sub-line item (SLIN) to reflect the distinction necessary to facilitate appropriate
   financial accounting treatment of the military equipment to be acquired. Proposals,
   solicitations, contracts, and/or orders for or related to the acquisition of military equipment
   will be structured so that each type of item or service is properly segregated by use of
   separate CLINs and SLINs.
3.60. Government Cost Estimates. The PM shall update life cycle cost estimates in
accordance with AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics, and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis,
and compare them to the program budget to assess program executability. Risk assessments and
sensitivity analyses will be performed as level of knowledge and assumptions change. The
acquisition strategy must address the estimated program cost and the planned program funding,
to include advance procurement. See DOD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial
Management Regulation (FMRS) Vol. 2A for more details.
3.61. Cost Realism. All participants over the life cycle of a system shall view cost as an
independent variable and plan programs based on realistic projections of the funding and staffing
likely to be available in the future. As a minimum, during reviews the MDA shall be provided
with cost estimates at the mean confidence level and the 80% confidence level. The PM should
consider providing the MDA with estimates at a cumulative density function (S curve) to show
varying levels of confidence. The program funding should also be identified on the chart with its
corresponding confidence level. To the greatest extent possible, the PM shall identify the TOC
and the major drivers to this cost. Realistic program planning assumptions should be developed
to ensure adequate analysis of life cycle cost, schedule, and performance risks. This will be
documented in the Program Office Estimate, which is generally developed from the Cost
Analysis Requirements Description (CARD) for major programs or a similar document for less
than major programs. These cost estimates shall be reconciled with the contractor‘s proposal
prior to award. Refer to DFARS 215 for additional information.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         115


  3.61.1. For MDAP and MAIS programs, state the confidence level used in establishing the
  cost estimate and the rationale for selecting it for cost estimates used in support of MS A, MS
  B, MS C, LRIP, Full Rate Production, any certification under 10 USC§§ 2366a, 2366b, or
  2433a, any report under 10 USC §2445c, or as specified by appropriate authority. If the
  confidence level is less than 80%, also provide the justification for selecting the lower
  confidence level.
  3.61.2. The confidence level statement shall be included in the ADM approving the APB and
  with any other cost estimates for MDAP and MAIS prepared in association with the
  estimates identified above, and for MDAPs, in the next SAR report prepared in compliance
  with 10 USC §2432, and for MAIS, in the next quarterly report prepared in compliance with
  10 USC §2445c. Reference the US Air Force Cost Risk and Uncertainty Handbook for more
  information.
  3.61.3. All Air Force ACAT I and II program cost estimates shall provide decision-makers
  with a range of potential costs based upon a robust assessment of, and accounting for, cost,
  technical, and schedule uncertainty for each program. Each cost estimate and associated risk
  assessment shall be established using approved Air Force cost estimating procedures and
  shall consider technical, schedule, and programmatic risk assessments from qualified
  program personnel and independent subject-matter experts in order to produce a cost estimate
  distribution or, where a distribution cannot be computed, a range of potential program costs.
  3.61.4. To establish sufficient program funding, the MDA for an ACAT I or II program shall
  use the cost estimate distribution to make a deliberate choice of the cost estimate confidence
  level for the program. The selection of the appropriate program cost estimate confidence
  level is at the discretion of the MDA, however, an ACAT I and II program budget shall not
  be established at a confidence level lower than the mean of the program cost estimate
  distribution (typically 55 – 65% confidence level) or, where a distribution cannot be
  computed, the expected value of the cost estimate. For Air Force ACAT ID programs,
  SAF/AQ and SAF/US shall, in concert with SAF/FM, apply this approach in formulating the
  Service Cost Position.
  3.61.5. When selecting a confidence level, the MDA shall consider program-specific
  requirements, schedule, and technical maturity issues, as well as interrelationships with other
  programs and program increments, and any other relevant environmental considerations. The
  cost estimate confidence level shall be documented in the ADM and other
  deliverables/documents as required. The same approach should also be followed for
  programs below ACAT II.
  3.61.6. Independent Cost Estimates are required for MDAPs and MAIS programs in advance
  of: (1) MS A, MS B, LRIP, and full rate production; (2) Any certification pursuant to
  sections 2366a, 2366b, or 2433a of title 10, U.S.C.; (3) Any report pursuant to section 2445c
  of title 10 U.S.C.; and (4) At any time specified by the MDA or the D,CAPE.
  3.61.7. Estimating agencies shall state the confidence level used in establishing the cost
  estimate. This confidence level statement shall be included in the ADM approving the APB;
  it will also be included in any other cost estimates for MDAPS or MAIS programs prepared
  in association with the estimates identified above.
 116                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.61.8. For MDAPs, the confidence level statement shall also be included in the next
   selected acquisition report prepared in compliance with section 2432 of title 10 U.S.C., and
   for MAIS, in the next quarterly report prepared in compliance with section 2445c of title 10
   U.S.C.
3.62. Budget Stability. Acquisition program budget perturbations are a fact of life. However
there are still actions a PM can take to document budget history and ensure budget decisions are
made based on current and accurate information. The PM shall at a minimum complete the
following:
   3.62.1. Maintain a realistic cost estimate and ensure it is well documented to firmly support
   budget requests, enlist user advocacy for the program via the AF Program Objective
   Memorandums (POM), or initially included as part of the Course of Action (COA) effort.
   3.62.2. Ensure funding for the execution year(s) is consistent with the contractor‘s ability to
   expend the funding according to the current program schedule; reassess throughout the
   program‘s life cycle and make sure the data continues to firmly support budget requests; and
   if not, enlist user advocacy for the program when necessary. The key is to keep program
   funding phased correctly and emphasize meeting OSD expenditure and obligation goals. See
   DOD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, Volume 2A, for more detail.
   3.62.3. Develop a range of independent estimates at completion from cost data and analysis
   of the IMS. Compare the results to the contractor‘s projected final costs to assess realism and
   to form the basis for adjusting the program budget.
   3.62.4. Reflect budget changes in the PMA as required.
3.63. Management Information Systems and Program Control Metrics. Whenever possible,
the PM should use the contractor‘s management information and program control systems and
associated metrics rather than impose unique requirements. It is the PM‘s responsibility to
assess the value and benefits of these items and to ask only for those items that are essential to
the effort. The PM shall assure that this data is in a structured format, is made available to the
government through an electronic interface and meets contractual requirements.
3.64. Unliquidated Obligations (ULO). The PM shall conduct periodic analysis of
unliquidated obligation(s) (ULO) balances to ensure deobligation of funds without a valid
requirement. The analysis shall as a minimum include ULO balances, reason each ULO exists,
estimated date of liquidating the ULO balances, and any amount to be deobligated. For
programs using the Transportation Working Capital Fund the PM shall additionally track
expenses and conduct periodic analysis of accrued expenditures unpaid (AEU) balances to
ensure funds are expended in the year given. The analysis shall include AEU balances, reason
for AEU balance, estimated date of moving AEU, accrued expenses paid (AEP), and any amount
that will be expensed in the following year.
3.65. Use of Specifications and Standards. Specifications and standards may be used in
solicitations to define essential standard practices (e.g., system safety and parts management) and
technical requirements (e.g., materiel interoperability and support requirements) and manage
risk. Specific DOD policy on the use of specifications and standards and other methods to
achieve objectives required by 10 USC §2451-2457, DODD 5000.01 and DODI 5000.02 are
contained in DOD 4120-24M, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and
Procedures. AF guidance is contained in AFI 60-101, Materiel Standardization.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          117


3.66. Program Protection Planning. The PM and/or Chief Engineer/Lead Engineer (CE/LE)
must ensure critical technologies, systems, and information identified as Critical Program
Information (CPI) are protected to prevent loss, theft, or compromise that could yield any of the
following negative consequences: impact cost, schedule, performance, or supportability; force a
change in program direction; degrade systems‘ capabilities; shorten the useful life of the system;
enable unauthorized transfer of technology; or require additional resources to develop
countermeasures. Program protection planning applies to all phases of the system‘s life cycle
including capability planning activities, technology research, development program efforts,
modification efforts, and continues through sustainment and disposal. Program protection
planning must involve all stakeholders including the operating and other participating
commands. Reference DOD 5200.1-M, Acquisition Systems Protection Program, DODI
5200.39, Critical Program Information (CPI) Protection within the Department of Defense, and
AFPAM 63-1701, Program Protection Planning (will convert to AFMAN 63-113, Program
Protection Planning for Life Cycle Management) for more information.
   3.66.1. The PM and/or CE/LE shall accomplish protection on technology and programs by
   using systems engineering processes to perform a functional decomposition of the
   technology/system to determine if CPI exists in the project/program.
       3.66.1.1. The requirement to complete program protection analysis cannot be waived or
       exempted. In addition, non-AF funded programs using AFRL or AF program personnel
       will comply with this requirement.
       3.66.1.2. The applicable PM and/or CE/LE shall develop a Program Protection Plan
       (PPP) for the technology or program if CPI are identified.
       3.66.1.3. If the PM and/or CE/LE determines there is no CPI associated with the
       technology or program (neither internal to the program nor inherited from a supporting
       program), a PPP is not required. Approval not to develop a PPP must be obtained in
       writing from the AFRL/CC, the MDA, or the ALC/CC commensurate with the execution
       authority of the activity.
   3.66.2. The PM and/or CE/LE shall provide for protection planning (including cost
   considerations) at all CPI locations until the PM and/or CE/LE makes the determination that
   protection is no longer required. MAJCOMs shall ensure compliance at all user locations
   until the PM determines CPI no longer exists and that protection is no longer required.
       3.66.2.1. CPI protection begins once a military unique capability is identified during
       technology research and development, during the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase, or
       any other time CPI is identified and continues throughout the life cycle. The CPI
       continues to be protected through all phases in the technology‘s life cycle including
       capability planning, acquisition, sustainment, modification, developmental and
       operational testing, and through retirement and disposal.
       3.66.2.2. Incidents of loss, compromise, or theft of CPI shall be reported in accordance
       with DODI 5240.4, Reporting Of Counterintelligence and Criminal Violations and DOD
       5200.1-R, Information Security Program, as well as the criteria for defensive Information
       Operations (IO) reporting established by AFPD 10-7, Information Operations and AFI
       10-2001, Defensive Counterinformation Planning, Operations and Assessment.
118                                          AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


  3.66.3. Technology protection is a Common Core Compliance Area (CCCA) as outlined in
  AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
  3.66.4. Program Protection Plans (PPP).
      3.66.4.1. The PM and/or CE/LE shall prepare a PPP as soon as practicable after CPI are
      identified and submit the PPP to the approval authority for review and approval. The
      need for a PPP may occur at any time during the life cycle of the program to include
      modifications or upgrades. Typical triggers for developing a PPP are identification of
      CPI, receipt of an ICD, CDD, PMD, CPD or AoA, or following mission assignment.
      Refer to AFPAM 63-1701, for the recommended procedures to create a PPP and DODI
      5200.39 for the minimum required elements of the PPP.
         3.66.4.1.1. AFRL/CC is the approval authority for technology programs unless the
         activity is at a battlelab or warfare center. For protection plans generated by the
         battlelabs and warfare centers, the approval authority is the commander/director.
         3.66.4.1.2. The MDA is the approval authority for ACAT programs.
      3.66.4.2. The PM and/or CE/LE shall coordinate the PPP with the all stakeholders
      including the operating, implementing and participating commands, acquiring agency,
      and intelligence community, as applicable.
      3.66.4.3. The PM and/or CE/LE shall apply common security measures for protecting
      similar CPI that are used by more than one program to ensure horizontal protection. The
      PM and/or CE/LE shall ensure horizontal protection through the distribution of the
      approved, signed PPP plan to any related or affected programs or subsystems for
      incorporation into their PPP.
      3.66.4.4. The PM shall review and update as necessary the PPP at MS B and MS C, as
      required by changes to acquisition program status, or by changes in the actual or
      projected threat, or reviewed and updated at least every three years.
      3.66.4.5. The PPP shall be maintained throughout the life of the CPI. Ownership and
      responsibility for the PPP shall transfer to the PM solely when a technology is
      incorporated into a system and remains with the PM throughout the life cycle of the
      system.
  3.66.5. The PM, in coordination with SAF/AQL, and the supporting systems engineering
  function, shall identify, plan, program, develop, implement, and validate anti tamper (AT)
  measures, if necessary. The AT Plan will be integrated into and maintained as a classified
  annex to the PPP. Refer to DODI 5200.39, the DOD AT website, and contact the Air Force
  Anti-Tamper OPR for additional information.
  3.66.6. The PM and/or CE/LE shall ensure the principles of Systems Security Engineering
  (SSE) are applied to their technology and acquisition programs throughout the life cycle as
  an essential element of systems protection. SSE ensures time-phased, affordable security
  protection alternatives and requirements are integrated into the weapon system and
  supporting subsystems security architecture in order to reduce system susceptibility to
  damage, compromise, or destruction; and to support the identification, evaluation, and
  elimination or containment of system vulnerabilities to known or postulated security threats
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         119


   in the operational environment. Other required equipment and supporting facilities should be
   integrated using risk management principles.
       3.66.6.1. For ACAT programs the PM and/or CE/LE will establish the Systems Security
       Working Group (SSWG) as early as possible but not later than MS B. Working in
       concert with the PM and/or CE/LE, the SSWG defines and identifies all SSE aspects of
       the system, develops SSE architecture, reviews the implementation of the architecture,
       and participates in design validation. For development or non-ACAT programs or
       projects, the PM and/or CE/LE will ensure an Integrated Product Team (IPT) process is
       used to conduct program protection planning. The SSWG or IPT is comprised of
       technology developers, acquisition and sustainment program office personnel; testers,
       supporting counterintelligence (CI), intelligence, and security personnel; system user
       representatives; and other concerned parties supporting the PM and/or CE/LE.
   3.66.7. The PM and/or CE/LE develop a Counterintelligence Support Plan (CISP) for each
   PPP in coordination with their servicing AF Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) research
   and technology protection specialist. The plans will address defensive Information
   Operations (IO) and CI support for the life cycle of the system or technology.
   3.66.8. Special Access Programs (SAP) due to their unique nature are not required to comply
   with Program Protection Planning. However, the programs must comply once SAP
   provisions are removed. The PM and/or CE for a collateral program will collaborate with
   SAF/AAZ when SAP information is involved to determine a prudent protection approach
   prior to developing a PPP.
3.67. Information Support Plans (ISP). The Information Support Plan (ISP) describes and
evaluates needs including intelligence, infrastructure, interoperability, and other Information
Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS) interfaces that the acquisition program
needs during development, testing, training, operations and disposal. The ISP also documents
current/projected deficiencies in intelligence support required to develop the weapon system
capability. Additional guidance on ISPs can be found in: the Defense Acquisition Guidebook;
DOD Directive 4630.5, Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and
National Security Systems (NSS); DODI 4630.8, Procedures for Interoperability and
Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS); and CJCSI
6212.01, Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security
Systems (NSS).
   3.67.1. The PM shall prepare the ISP, which documents the information support needed to
   develop warfighter capabilities described in the ICD, CDD, and Capability Production
   Document (CPD).
   3.67.2. The PM shall prepare an ISP for IT and NSS programs regardless of ACAT and for
   systems in sustainment that exchange information with external systems or reside on the
   Global Information Grid (GIG). The Lead Command, as part of the requirements process
   and identification of Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP), shall identify IT and
   NSS interoperability requirements, infrastructure, and other support requirements early in the
   life cycle. This information will form the basis of the ISP.
 120                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.67.3. The PM shall update the ISP due to a modification to an IT/NSS system to reflect
   any impact that the modification may have on their NR-KPP. ISPs that do not have an NR-
   KPP will have a NR-KPP section added.
   3.67.4. For systems that will be part of a Family of Systems or System of Systems
   (FoS/SoS), an ISP is required unless waived. If the Milestone Decision Authority
   (MDA)/Cognizant Fielding Authority for the FoS/SoS approve, an annex to the FoS/SoS ISP
   may be developed to meet ISP requirements for a new system that is part of a FoS/SoS.
   3.67.5. PMs that do not believe their IT or NSS system requires the development of an ISP
   shall submit a request to waive the ISP requirement through SAF/XCP to OASD/NII /DOD-
   Chief Information Officer (CIO).
   3.67.6. An approved initial ISP is required not later than MS B (or appropriate and related
   ―milestone-like event‖ (for non-ACAT)) and should be initially developed concurrently and
   collaboratively with the associated CDD, unless exceptions are noted in an ADM. The PM
   shall prepare the updated final ISP for the MS C Decision Review concurrently and
   collaboratively with the associated CPD. As the program matures or proceeds through
   multiple evolutionary blocks, phases, or modifications, the Program Manager shall update the
   ISP as needed.
       3.67.6.1. The program office must coordinate with the supporting intelligence office or
       AFMC/A2 to develop the intelligence appendix to the Information Support Plan.
       Intelligence appendices to ISPs supporting AFSPC programs must be reviewed and
       approved by the supporting intelligence office, AFSPC/A2, and AF/A2. Before the plan
       is submitted to the MDA, the intelligence appendix to the ISP must be approved by the
       supporting intelligence office, AFSPC, AFMC, or AF/A2.
   3.67.7. ISP Reviews. ISPs prepared for Milestone Decision Reviews must first undergo the
   formal ISP review process before they can be approved. ACAT I, ACAT IA, and special
   interest programs are reviewed at both the Air Force and Joint level. ACAT II and below are
   reviewed at the Air Force level only. The PM will enter the ISPs into the Air Force C4I
   Program Assessment Tool (APAT) to initiate the automated review process. Reference the
   Air Force Program Manager’s Guide for Developing, Processing, and Approving ISPs for
   more information on the development, review, coordination, and approval of Information
   Support Plans.
   3.67.8. ISP Approval. The MDA or ALC/CC (for non-space systems in sustainment) shall
   review, assess, and approve ISPs for ACAT and sustainment programs at each Milestone
   Decision Review. The PM shall consider the ISP for making DSOR recommendations.
   3.67.9. ISP Support. At the end of MS B or equivalent, the PM will ensure all support
   concept elements are fully identified with supporting documentation.
   3.67.10. Additional ISP policy guidance can be found on the Information Support Plan
   Policy CoP.
3.68. Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning. As part of a long-term DOD corrosion
prevention and control strategy that supports reduction of total cost of system ownership, the PM
shall document a Corrosion Prevention and Control Plan. The Corrosion Prevention and Control
Plan shall be required at MS B and C as part of the LCMP/Acquisition Strategy and SEP.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                        121


Corrosion considerations shall be objectively evaluated throughout program design and
development activities, with trade-offs made through an open and transparent assessment of
alternatives. See DODI 5000.67, Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on DOD Military
Equipment and Infrastructure, for additional guidance. Additional information including the
DOD Corrosion and Prevention Guidebook can be found at Home - CorrDefense.
   3.68.1. The Air Force designated Corrosion Control and Prevention Executive (CCPE) is the
   senior Air Force Corrosion Control and Prevention Enterprise official. The CCPE is
   responsible for coordinating AF-level corrosion control and prevention activities, advocating
   for corrosion prevention and mitigation, and evaluating the effectiveness of AF corrosion
   prevention and mitigation.
   3.68.2. AFMC, PMs, and PGMs shall provide data as requested by the AF CCPE to support
   the evaluation and reporting of AF corrosion control and prevention activities and identify
   funding levels necessary for providing corrosion prevention and mitigation throughout the
   system‘s life cycle.
   3.68.3. The PM shall incorporate the DOD ban on the use of Cr6+ in their long-term
   corrosion prevention planning. This ban applies to all programs regardless of ACAT or life
   cycle phase.
       3.68.3.1. The PM shall obtain PEO or ALC/CC approval for any new or continued use of
       Cr6+. In order to approve the request to use Cr6+, the PEO or ALC/CC must certify that
       there is no acceptable alternative for the requested use. The PM will obtain AF CCPE
       concurrence on all approval requests prior to submittal to the PEO or ALC/CC
       3.68.3.2. To enable the PEO or ALC/CC to make this certification, the PM must
       demonstrate the assured availability of Cr6+ for the period of the requested approval and
       one or more of the following findings concerning the available alternatives: (1)
       unacceptable life cycle cost increases; (2) technically not feasible; (3) Serious or High
       ESOH risks (based on MIL-STD-882D); (4) MRL of 7 or less; (5) lack of assured
       availability for the period of the requested approval; or (6) unacceptable corrosion
       prevention performance. Additional guidance on documenting Cr6+ usage and
       elimination efforts in the PESHE is provided in the PESHE section of this document.
3.69. System Survivability. The AF will address survivability requirements and performance
parameters for a system‘s entire life cycle based on the capabilities of that system. System
developers will review all capability documents to assess how these survivability requirements
apply to their program. System survivability assessment, based on system concept of operations
and validated threat assessment, shall be considered during SE and HSI planning. This planning
should be in conjunction with affordability, schedule, and performance considerations.
Designing, testing, and/or analysis during the acquisition process will be carried out against
specific performance attributes.
   3.69.1. Capability document sponsors will develop and define the survivability requirements
   for each system, including designating the level of survivability that a system must have in
   the operational environment for which it is intended. The sponsors will plan for all resource
   requirements to satisfy survivability requirements.
 122                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.69.2. The PM shall integrate validated survivability requirements into the systems
   engineering process from the earliest possible stages of program planning and throughout the
   life cycle. In addition to previously stated documents, this paragraph also implements
   survivability policy and guidance found in Public Law 108-375, Section 141 Development of
   Deployable Systems to Include Consideration of Force Protection in Asymmetric Threat
   Environment, and Section 1053, Survivability of Critical Systems Exposed to Chemical and
   Biological Contamination; DODD 3222.3, DOD Electromagnetic Environmental Effects
   (E3) Program; MIL-HDBK-237, Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Spectrum
   Certification Guidance for the Acquisition Process; 50 USC §1522, Conduct of Chemical
   and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).
   3.69.3. The PM shall follow the guidance outlined in the above referenced documents and
   comply with documentation and reporting procedures as specified in each. If the system will
   provide an urgent operational need, full compliance with survivability is not expected until
   FOC. When there is an incremental acquisition or the system is modified, the lead command,
   PM, and lead operational test organization will conduct a survivability review to assess how
   the increments/modifications affect the survivability of the system.
       3.69.3.1. The PM shall include the system survivability requirements, the system‘s threat
       assessment, and a summary of the program‘s overall plan for addressing survivability in
       the LCMP, TEMP, and SEP and other life cycle documents as applicable.
       3.69.3.2. If a system requires hardening to survive against nuclear, ballistic, chemical,
       biological, high power microwave, or laser threats, the PM shall implement a hardness
       assurance, maintenance, and surveillance (HAMS) program. (Reference DNA-H-93-140,
       Military Handbook for Hardness Assurance, Maintenance, and Surveillance (HAMS))
       3.69.3.3. During technical, program, and Milestone decision reviews, the PM will
       provide an assessment of the system‘s survivability in the anticipated battlefield
       environment. For any identified shortfalls in meeting survivability requirements, the PM
       will provide a plan for meeting requirements prior to key testing and operational events.
       At MS C, the MDA will verify compliance with survivability requirements.
       3.69.3.4. Survivability requirements apply to COTS/NDI.
3.70. Arms Control Compliance. The PM shall ensure all activities within the acquisition
cycle are compliant with all United States Government arms control obligations. The PM shall
ensure SAF/GC, AF/A3/5 (for compliance with arms control agreements) and AF/JA (for
compliance with international law) review all weapons for legality at the earliest possible stage,
whether new acquisitions or modification of existing weapons. This assessment will occur prior
to all Milestone reviews or when concerns arise. If necessary, the PM shall seek (with AF/A3/5
assistance) clearance to undertake or continue the activity in question from the appropriate Arms
Control Compliance Review Group. PMs who oversee acquisition programs involving strategic
weapons (e.g., bombs, warheads), their delivery vehicles (e.g., ballistic missiles, bombers, and
cruise missiles, including their associated basing, testing, and launch facilities), or chemical and
biological weapon defense-related materials and equipment should become aware of the
implications and limitations that arms control treaties may have on or impact their program(s).
Refer to AFI 16-601, Implementation of, and Compliance With, Arms Control Agreements and
AFI 51-402, Weapons Review, for additional guidance.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            123


3.71. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Security Assistance (SA). International relationships
are a critical component of U.S. national security and its commitment to promoting democratic
institutions, world peace, and global security. Security Assistance (SA) and Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) programs support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives by enabling
the United States to build, sustain, expand, and guide international partnerships that are critical
enablers for its national security objectives.
   3.71.1. SA programs allow the transfer of military articles and services to friendly foreign
   governments. These transfers are also conducted using Letter of Offer and Acceptance
   (LOAs) between the U.S. Government and an authorized foreign purchaser and may be
   carried out via authorized sales, grants, or leases under the premise that if these transfers are
   essential to the security and economic well-being of allied Governments and international
   organizations, they are equally vital to the security and economic well-being of the United
   States. SA programs support U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives by
   increasing the ability of our friends and allies to deter and defend against possible aggression,
   promoting the sharing of common defense burdens, and helping to foster regional stability.
   SA is witnessed by: the delivery of defense weapon systems to allied and friendly foreign
   governments and international organizations; U.S. Service schools training international
   students; U.S. personnel advising other governments on ways to improve their internal
   defense capabilities; and U.S. personnel providing guidance and assistance in establishing
   infrastructures and economic basis to achieve and maintain regional stability.
   3.71.2. FMS is that portion of U.S. security assistance authorized by the Foreign Assistance
   Act of 1961, as amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended. It differs
   from other forms of assistance in that the recipient provides reimbursement for defense
   articles and services transferred. The FMS program is conducted using LOAs which are
   agreements between the United States Government and an authorized foreign purchaser.
   These agreements authorize the sale of military equipment and services to allied and friendly
   foreign governments and international organizations. SAF/AQ, as the SAE, is responsible for
   acquisition policy, program management, and execution of all AF FMS acquisition cases and
   will work with SAF/IA and HQ AFMC to accomplish necessary tasks.
   3.71.3. For clarity, program management responsibility for FMS programs is limited to
   elements/tasks contained in a government-to-government agreement and specifically
   implemented for execution to the PM, through the appropriate accountability reporting chain,
   by the assigned DOD component authority over the specific agreement.
3.72. Management of AF Training Systems. Management of training systems requires close
coordination between lead and using commands and the acquisition and sustainment community.
Refer to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, for specific requirements and
responsibilities associated with the acquisition and sustainment of training systems, including
aircrew mission training systems, maintenance training systems, and training services attendant
to AF weapon systems. The PM shall apply AFI 63-1201, to ensure the OSS&E of training
systems. Training systems that have been designated as stand-alone acquisition programs shall
be governed by a PMD.
   3.72.1. The PM shall contact the weapon system Training System Product Group Manager
   (TS-PGM) or equivalent prior to/at program initiation to develop and assign organizational
   responsibilities for the acquisition and sustainment of training systems for the weapon
 124                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   system. Weapon system PMs shall coordinate their program plans and activities with the TS-
   PGM, specific training system PMs, lead and using commands, and HQ Air Education and
   Training Command (AETC) as necessary to meet training system life cycle cost, schedule,
   and performance requirements.
   3.72.2. As appropriate, the PM or their designees shall participate in Training Planning
   Teams (TPT) activities including accomplishing the Training System Requirements Analysis
   (TSRA) and the development of System Training Plans (STPs). Lead commands will
   determine when TPTs, TSRAs and STPs are required. The PM will coordinate on STPs
   prepared by lead commands.
   3.72.3. As requested, the PM shall assist lead and using command modernization planning
   and POM development efforts, including the analysis of training system needs, materiel and
   non-materiel alternatives, development of capability documents, and preparation of budget
   materials.
   3.72.4. The PM shall include weapon system training concepts and training system
   requirements in all LCMPs prepared for, and subsequent to, MS B. As appropriate, the PM
   will include the TS-PGM, training system PMs, lead and using commands, and HQ AETC
   during the development of weapon system acquisition strategies, program plans, and
   pertinent contract documents such as System Requirements Documents.
   3.72.5. The PM shall ensure training systems remain current with prime mission systems
   throughout the life cycle of a weapon system, in accordance with approved program
   management directives and funding. The PM shall ensure training system requirements are
   included in all post-production system modification/upgrade programs conducted for prime
   mission systems.
   3.72.6. The PM shall, with lead and using commands, determine the training system fielding
   requirements necessary to support the fielding of prime weapon systems and equipment. The
   PM shall coordinate training system product acceptance, movement, and delivery matters
   with the lead and using commands that will receive the training system(s).
   3.72.7. The PM shall assist lead and using commands with management and reporting of
   training system concurrency matters (e.g., AF/A3/5 data calls).
   3.72.8. The PM shall manage and execute the disposal of training devices in accordance with
   federal acquisition regulation and supplements, AFMAN 23-110, and AFI 23-501, Retaining
   and Transferring Materiel, as applicable.         PMs will coordinate actions for the
   declassification and demilitarization of training devices, the removal and repatriation of
   weapon system-common equipment, and the disposal of hazardous materiels prior to the
   shipment of training devices to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or
   other final resting places.
3.73. End Use Certificates. The AF purchases products produced by allies and friendly
countries, and participates in cooperative development programs to 1) promote interoperability,
standardization, and an expanded procurement base, and 2) to obtain products that best meet U.S.
needs at the lowest cost. An End Use Certificate (EUC) may be necessary to facilitate purchases
of foreign products when the purchase of such products is in the best interest of the United
States. An EUC applies to all personnel who purchase, use, and dispose of restricted items from
a foreign vendor. See DODD 2040.3, End Use Certificates (EUC), for more details.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          125


  3.73.1. When an EUC is necessary or requested by foreign governments they can be divided
  into three categories:
     3.73.1.1. Category I. Applies to acquisition items classified for security purposes by a
     foreign government and covered by the nonproliferation agreements to which the United
     States is a party (such as missile technology). This permits the item to be used by or for
     the U.S. Government in any part of the world and transfer by means of grant aid,
     International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, FMS, and other security
     assistance and armaments cooperation authorities.
     3.73.1.2. Category II. Applies to all other items not defined as either Category I or III.
     3.73.1.3. Category III. USD (AT&L) must grant a waiver for items that require
     Category III EUCs as it limits the right to use an item by or for the U.S. Government in
     any part of the world; or to provide the item to allies engaged together with the United
     States in armed conflict with a common enemy.
  3.73.2. The SECAF, or a delegated civilian officer, appointed by the President with the
  advice and consent of the Senate, is the approval authority for Category I and II EUCs. To
  purchase an item with a Category III EUC, the SECAF or the SECAF representative must
  request authority from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and
  Logistics (USD (AT&L)).
  3.73.3. EUCs originating in development and test centers require AF/TE review prior to
  requesting formal approval.
  3.73.4. The following procedures shall be used to request formal approval for the purchase
  of foreign items for each EUC category as indicated:
     3.73.4.1. Category I EUC.
         3.73.4.1.1. The PM shall prepare a package requesting permission to purchase an
         item requiring EUC. The request includes the item‘s name, nomenclature, and
         purpose; justification of need; and any other purchasing options.
         3.73.4.1.2. Test center commanders will notify AF/TE when requesting permission to
         purchase an item requiring a EUC. The request includes the item‘s name,
         nomenclature, and purpose; justification of need; and any other purchasing options.
         3.73.4.1.3. The PEO, DAO, or AF/TE, in coordination with the applicable CD,
         requests approval to purchase an item requiring a EUC from the approval authority.
     3.73.4.2. Category II EUC.
         3.73.4.2.1. PMs or test center commanders will follow approval process as outlined
         for Category I.
         3.73.4.2.2. The approval authority must notify USD(AT&L) at least 21 calendar days
         prior to approving the request of the intent to purchase an item with a Category II
         EUC. Notification to USD (AT&L) must include a description of the recommended
         item and all limitations imposed on it by the exporting government. The approval
         authority may assume that USD (AT&L) concurs with the purchase if it does not
         receive a response by the end of the 21-day period.
 126                                          AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       3.73.4.3. Category III EUC.
          3.73.4.3.1. To justify a waiver, PMs or test center commanders will follow approval
          process as outlined for Category I, and the PM or center commander must specify:
              3.73.4.3.1.1. The reasons the US Government would benefit from purchasing the
              foreign item;
              3.73.4.3.1.2. The limitations imposed by the exporting government and their
              justification;
              3.73.4.3.1.3. The cost, schedule, or operational requirements that could not be
              filled by any satisfactory alternative, either domestic or foreign.
   3.73.5. The SECAF, or a delegated civilian officer, requests policy waivers from
   USD(AT&L).
       3.73.5.1. If USD (AT&L) grants a policy waiver, then signature authority is delegated to
       the PEO, DAO, or AF/TE.
   3.73.6. The PEO, DAO, or AF/TE signatory must sign two original EUCs and provide both
   to the PM.
   3.73.7. The designated PM or test center commander will:
       3.73.7.1. Transmit the two signed originals to personnel representing the foreign
       government for signature. The foreign government will keep one original and return the
       second to SAF/AQ which forwards a copy to the PM or test center commander.
       3.73.7.2. Send copies of the form to the PEO, DAO, or AF/TE and to USD(AT&L).
       3.73.7.3. Notify major command (MAJCOM) headquarters of the EUC approval and
       explain any restrictions on the use, transfer, or disposal of the item‘s hardware,
       technology, and associated technical data. Command Headquarters must notify users of
       the EUC restrictions.
   3.73.8. Upon receiving a proposal to waive the EUC restrictions from the MAJCOM, the
   PM or test center commander must immediately request permission from the originating
   foreign government. The PM or test center commander must then advise MAJCOM
   Headquarters, the approval authority, and USD (AT&L) of the foreign government‘s
   response.
   3.73.9. MAJCOM headquarters must ensure AF compliance with EUC restrictions and
   advise the SECAF, or a delegated civilian officer, of any proposal that would require a
   waiver of EUC restrictions.
   3.73.10. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for identifying, cataloging, controlling, and
   disposing of items with EUCs.

Section 3C—Life Cycle Systems Engineering Requirements

3.74. Life Cycle Systems Engineering (SE). Life cycle Systems Engineering (SE) is addressed
in AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, which will take precedence if there are any
conflicts. Application of SE fundamentals must begin with concept inception, and must cover all
efforts across all life cycle phases, to include sustainment and disposal. All AF products and
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                             127


systems must exhibit and preserve attributes of OSS&E and mission assurance throughout their
operational life.
   3.74.1. SE addresses architecting, requirements development and management, design,
   technical management and control, and test and evaluation (T&E) / verification and
   validation (V&V). These fundamental elements must be accomplished on all development,
   acquisition, and sustainment efforts to develop a relevant technical knowledge base that is
   matured, maintained, and transferred in a disciplined manner. They are not to be
   implemented independently but must be integrated to mutually reinforce each other.
   3.74.2. SE enables the technical aspects of Development Planning (DP). SE during DP
   (―Early SE‖) produces concepts (prospective materiel solutions to operational capability
   needs) that track to operational and functional (e.g., sustainability, reliability, producibility,
   etc.) needs. Early SE products provide high-quality decision support information to inform
   sponsors and decision makers, prior to initiating an acquisition program, about the feasibility
   of concepts to address identified capability needs.
       3.74.2.1. Concept developers will employ Early SE in support of DP efforts. AFI 63-
       1201 identifies principal Early SE activities and products, their linkage with the JCIDS
       CBA, and their relationship to pre- and post-MDD events (ref 3.35.2 thru 3.35.4).
       3.74.2.2. Governance, management, and execution of DP efforts prior to MDD fall under
       the oversight of the implementing command, and beyond MDD fall under the authority of
       the MDA. Prospective programs that have already completed or are in the late stages of
       an AoA, if directed to go back to accomplish a MDD, may use AoA documentation in
       support of MDD rather than developing new documentation unique to Early SE.
3.75. AF SE Management Responsibilities. PM and Chief/Lead Engineer responsibilities are
typically not formally assigned prior to MS A. For early capability development efforts, such as
science and technology (S&T) and concept studies, the term ―program‖ refers to the specific
activity; for those efforts a designated project or capability manager performs the SE tasks
identified herein as PM and Chief/Lead Engineer responsibilities. ALC and related post-MS C
SE efforts may be assigned to the applicable PM, PGM (including software), Commodity
Manager, or AFGLSC as AF Supply Chain Manager (SCM). PMs and Chief/Lead Engineers
must include relevant performance incentives in contract solicitation, evaluation, award, and
execution processes.
3.76. Systems Engineering Plan (SEP). The Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) documents the
organizations, authorities, roles and responsibilities, processes, and integration used to plan,
evaluate, execute, and manage the technical aspects of a program. AFI 63-1201 identifies SEP
requirements for all AF efforts, including those that may not formally be identified as
―programs‖ (e.g., pre-acquisition activities or modifications managed at a Logistics or Test
Center). To facilitate entry into formal acquisition, managers of pre-acquisition efforts shall
ensure that documentation of analysis and technical planning is compatible with SEP
requirements for MS A and B. The SEP should be developed in concert with the technical
planning supporting the acquisition strategy, the ICD, and other relevant predecessor documents.
The SEP must be reviewed annually, and updated as required throughout the life cycle.
3.77. Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH). The PM must eliminate
Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) hazards where possible and shall manage
 128                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


risks of hazards that cannot be avoided. Refer to AFI 63-1201 Atch. 4 for a more complete
discussion of ESOH requirements.
3.78. Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E)/Mission Assurance .
   3.78.1. OSS&E is an integrated effort to ensure that base-lined characteristics of systems and
   end items are not allowed to degrade as a result of operational use, configuration changes,
   maintenance repairs, aging, parts substitutions, and similar activities. The PM must assure
   OSS&E throughout the life cycle of each configuration of the system by working
   collaboratively with members of the operational, maintenance/sustainment, and test
   communities. The PM shall ensure historical OSS&E data is considered during the
   development of new systems. Reference AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, Atch
   3.
   3.78.2. Mission Assurance is the integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis,
   production, verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution
   processes performed over the life cycle of a system or end item, by which an operator/user
   determines that there is an acceptable level of risk to its employment to deliver an intended
   capability in an intended environment. The objective of the assurance process is to identify
   and mitigate design, production, and test deficiencies that could impact mission success.
3.79. Human Systems Integration (HSI). The PM shall integrate manpower, personnel,
training, human factors engineering, safety and occupational health, personnel survivability,
environment, and habitability considerations into the Systems Engineering process. The
acquisition strategy should identify HSI responsibilities, describe the technical and management
approach for meeting HSI requirements, briefly summarize the planning for each of the above
elements of HSI, define the division or roles and responsibilities with ESOH for the overlapping
domains of safety and occupational health, and summarize major elements of the associated
training system. Reference AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, Atch 5 for more
information.
3.80. Maintenance       Engineering/Sustaining      Engineering        (ME/SE). Maintenance
Engineering/ Sustaining Engineering (ME/SE) involves the review, assessment, definition, and
resolution of hardware deficiencies revealed throughout the life cycle, including development
and production as well as operational service. PMs and Chief/Lead Engineers shall employ
ME/SE principles throughout the system‘s life cycle. Reference AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle
Systems Engineering, Atch 6 for more information.
3.81. Configuration Management (CM). The PM shall ensure the use of Configuration
Management (CM) functions to establish and maintain consistency of product/system attributes
with requirements and configuration information throughout the entire life cycle. Product and
system characteristics, including components, key processes, and methods used to verify
compliance with design and performance requirements, must be documented.
3.82. Product and System Integrity. The PM and Chief/Lead Engineers are responsible for
ensuring that product/system-level performance and safety requirements will be met under any
combination of design usage environments throughout the operational life of a product or
weapon system. Processes that must be addressed to ensure product/system integrity include
design, configuration management, system safety, manufacturing, quality management, test,
maintenance, inspection, supply chain management, flight operations, and mishap investigation.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         129


Reference AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, Atch 7 for more information on
implementing these processes. Reference AFI 63-1401, Aircraft Information Programs, to
implement data collection and distribution capabilities that support these processes.
   3.82.1. Quality Management. The PM and Chief/Lead Engineers are responsible for
   assuring the delivery of quality products and services. Policy for addressing program quality
   management is contained in AFI 63-501, Air Force Acquisition Quality Program.
   3.82.2. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). In accordance with AFI 63-1001, an
   aircraft-specific ASIP is required for each Mission Design Series (MDS) of aircraft (manned
   or unmanned) the AF acquires, uses or leases. Each ASIP shall be developed, documented,
   approved, and executed according to MIL-HDBK-1530, Aircraft Structural Integrity
   Program (ASIP).
   3.82.3. Aircraft Weapon System Integrity Program. An aircraft-specific aircraft weapon
   system integrity program shall be developed, documented, approved, and executed according
   to MIL-HDBK-515 (USAF), Weapon System Integrity Guide (WSIG).
   3.82.4. Propulsion Systems Integrity Program. An aircraft-specific propulsion systems
   integrity program shall be developed, documented, approved, and executed according to
   MIL-STD-3024, Propulsion System Integrity Program.
   3.82.5. Mechanical Equipment and Subsystems Integrity Program. An aircraft-specific
   mechanical equipment structural integrity program shall be developed, documented,
   approved and executed according to MIL-STD-1798, Mechanical Equipment and Subsystem
   Integrity Program.
   3.82.6. Avionics Integrity Program. An aircraft-specific avionics/electronics integrity
   program shall be developed, documented, approved, and executed.
3.83. Aircraft Information Program. All Air Force weapons systems requiring airworthiness
certification shall have an Aircraft Information Program (AIP) to evaluate and integrate weapon
system information requirements. These weapons systems shall employ an information
recording capability consisting of those components deemed necessary to meet the collection,
processing, storage, distribution and reporting needs of processes such as mishap investigation,
integrity programs, Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance, and Condition-Based
Maintenance. This systematic approach to integrating all data requirements is essential to ensure
capture of critical information and optimization of benefit while minimizing overall cost.
Reference AFPD 62-6, USAF Aircraft Airworthiness Certification, and AFI 63-1401, Aircraft
Information Program (AIP).
   3.83.1. Crash Survivable Flight Data Recorders. Provide a crash-survivable data collection
   capability for mishap investigation, including parametric (i.e. flight data recorder) and
   acoustic (i.e. cockpit voice recorder) data. Employ devices such as Emergency Locator
   Transmitter (ELT), Underwater Locator Beacon (ULB), and Crash Position Indicator (CPI)
   to enable the recovery of the crew and information recording devices in the event of a
   mishap.
   3.83.2. Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA). A platform-specific
   MFOQA program is required for each MDS the AF acquires or uses (manned, unmanned,
   and leased) per AFPD 90-13, Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance. MFOQA
 130                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   provides insight into the operational usage of the aerial system, supporting OSS&E through
   analysis of flight maneuvers and identification of hazardous trends, facilitating risk
   assessment and mitigation activities.
3.84. Software Engineering. Programs and developmental efforts must address key software
focus areas throughout the life cycle, beginning with pre-MS A activities. These focus areas will
be incorporated as appropriate in the SEP, or acquisition plans. Consideration should be given to
application of Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and Open Technology Development
(OTD) principles, and software assurance. PEOs/DAOs may tailor the implementation of these
focus areas as required, and the SAE will be notified of all tailoring. Reference AFI 63-1201,
Life Cycle Systems Engineering, Atch 8 for more information.
3.85. Value Engineering (VE). All AF systems, subsystems, equipment and products are
candidates for value engineering (VE) procedures and processes, except those specifically
exempted by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 48. For more information
reference FAR 52.248-1.
   3.85.1. AF personnel charged with procuring systems, subsystems, equipment and products
   will comply with FAR Parts 48 and 52 when dealing with suppliers. Voluntary participation
   via Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECP) will be the primary means to achieve
   contractor support.
   3.85.2. When resources permit, an in-house VE program to review and analyze internal AF
   processes with the goal of reducing the cost of doing business is encouraged. A Value
   Engineering Proposal (VEP) documents the effort.
3.86. Systems Engineering in Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and Integrated Master
Schedule (IMS) . The IMP/IMS must capture key SE events, activities, and criteria; contain
sufficient detail about SE efforts, resources, monitoring, and control; and be integrated at all
levels.
3.87. System Compatibility and Interoperability. The PM shall identify and assess the
potential impacts on technical, schedule, cost, and funding critical path issues of meeting system
compatibility and interoperability requirements for independent AF or joint operations. DOD
4120.24M, DODI 2010.06 and AFI 60-101 provide guidance on considering applicable U.S.
ratified international standardization agreements (ISAs) for compatibility, interoperability, and
logistics interchangeability of materiel in allied and coalition operations.
   3.87.1. For joint, allied and coalition operations, the PM shall consider compatibility and
   interoperability attributes (e.g., databases, fuel, transportability, ammunition) that may need
   to be identified and require verification to ensure a capability is interoperable IAW CJCSM
   3170.01.
   3.87.2. The PM shall consider future multinational operations in the acquisition of all
   materiel intended for use by U.S. Forces DODI 2010.06, Materiel Standardization and
   Interoperability with Allies and Coalition Partners. For programs delivering capabilities with
   potential use in allied and coalition operations, the identification and assessment should
   include the ISAs applicable to areas such as cross-servicing (with interchangeable fuels,
   lubricants, gases, and munitions), armaments, air transport and air drop, medical evacuation,
   combat search and rescue, crash/fire/rescue, and geospatial/intelligence.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                           131


   3.87.3. Following approval of the acquisition strategy, the PM should notify AF/A5 and
   SAF/AQR of all applicable ISAs that are not included in the Systems Requirement
   Document (SRD) to allow agreement reservations to be registered with the appropriate
   multinational body (see AFI 60-106, The United States Air Force International Military
   Standardization Program, for further information).

Section 3D—Sustainment Planning Requirements

3.88. Product Support/Sustainment Planning Overview. Product support is a continuous and
collaborative set of activities that establishes and maintains readiness and the operational
capability of a system, subsystem, or end-item throughout its life cycle. It is an overarching
activity that bridges the acquisition and sustainment phases of a program. A product support
strategy shall be built around the product support elements to integrate the acquisition and
sustainment phases of a system throughout its life cycle.
   3.88.1. The PM shall ensure the appropriate concepts, techniques, and analyses necessary to
   assure achievement of predefined supportability and support requirements and objectives are
   applied. The PM shall ensure that integrated logistics support objectives are considered and
   introduced as early as practical with a far-reaching life cycle view concerning logistics
   design and supportability of the system. This activity requires integration of current logistics
   concepts into preliminary planning to evaluate the various options for maintenance concepts
   and supply support from the standpoint of life cycle cost and parameters to ensure balanced
   life cycle strategy.
   3.88.2. The PM shall consider life cycle sustainment during the Materiel Solution Analysis
   phase and mature sustainment planning in the Technology Development phase. The PM
   shall ensure the requirement for a Life Cycle Sustainment Plan is included as an integral part
   of the LCMP prepared for MS B (program initiation) using the following top-level Product
   Support Elements: 1) sustaining/system engineering, 2) design interface, 3) supply support,
   4) maintenance planning and management, 5) support equipment/automatic test systems
   (SE/ATS), 6) facilities, 7) packaging, handling, storage, and transportation (PHS&T), 8)
   technical data management/technical orders, 9) manpower and personnel, 10) training, 11)
   computer resources, and 12) protection of critical program information and anti-tamper
   provisions. Additional information on the Product Support Elements is in AFPAM 63-128.
   3.88.3. To ensure compliance with Title 10, USC, Sections 2464,                 Core Logistics
   Capabilities, and 2466, Limitations on the Performance of Depot-Level          maintenance of
   Materiel, the PM shall reflect the Air Force enterprise Core and 50/50         requirements in
   programmatic strategy and detailed product sourcing documents throughout       the program life
   cycle.
       3.88.3.1. Prior to MS-B the PM shall have an initial plan for depot activation
       requirements and funding, to include operational rationale, which shall be finalized prior
       to IOC. Data shall be kept current until all depot activation requirements are achieved.
       3.88.3.2. The PM shall collaborate with and provide program depot activation data to
       AFMC for inclusion in a centralized depot activation depository.
132                                           AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


  3.88.4. The PM shall ensure product support integration throughout the system life cycle.
  Product support integration consists of integrating the activities of the product support
  providers as well as intra-system and inter-system integration with supporting systems,
  subsystems, end-items, components and facilities.
  3.88.5. A performance based strategy shall be used to link product support to weapon system
  performance. A performance based logistics (PBL) strategy shall be used in accordance with
  the PBL guidance section in this AFI.
  3.88.6. Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+), as an extension of the maintenance
  design program executed during development, shall be used to improve maintenance agility
  and responsiveness, increase operational availability, and reduce life cycle total ownership
  costs. The goal is to perform maintenance only upon evidence of need by employment of
  technologies, processes, and procedures to improve maintenance/logistics. Enabling
  technologies and concepts include prognostics, diagnostics, portable maintenance aids,
  interactive electronic technical manuals, interactive training, data analysis, integrated
  information systems, automatic identification, reliability-centered maintenance, and joint
  total asset visibility. See DODI 4151.22, Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) for
  Materiel Maintenance, for more details.
  3.88.7. The PM shall work with the PSM to ensure product support strategies are
  implemented throughout the system life cycle.
      3.88.7.1. PM. The PM is responsible to ensure PSM activities are adequately resourced
      within the Program Office and all functional activities within the Program Office provide
      adequate support to PSM activities. The product support strategy shall consist of 1) all
      product support planning which begins prior to Milestone A and continues through
      disposal and 2) execution of the product support functions required to field and maintain
      the readiness and operational capability of the program. The PM and PSM will use the
      Acquisition Sustainment (AS) Tool Kit as an aid to facilitate product support/sustainment
      planning and management throughout the life cycle of the program. Reference AFPAM
      63-128 for more information on the AS Tool Kit.
      3.88.7.2. PSM. The PSM is the single point of contact for overall product support
      throughout the system life cycle. They report directly to the PM and are accountable for
      all product support matters regarding program cost, schedule, performance and
      supportability. The PSM will seek assistance from AFMC/A4 or AFSPC/A4 regarding
      all program product support matters and specifically on impacts to the overall
      implementing commands‘ logistics, installation, and mission support responsibilities. The
      PSM is responsible to develop and implement a comprehensive, outcome-based, product
      support strategy that addresses the total life cycle support for the system. The PSM will
      work with other Functional Leads within the program office to ensure the product support
      strategy is reflected in all appropriate programmatic documentation and document and
      maintain currency of the product support strategy in the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan
      (LCSP) in accordance with DoDI 5000.02. Other PSM responsibilities include:
         3.88.7.2.1. Adjust performance requirements and resource allocations for Product
         Support Integrators (PSIs) and Product Support Providers (PSPs) no less than
         annually to implement the product support strategy.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                          133


           3.88.7.2.2. Ensure the program addresses product support interrelationship and
           integration with other programs in their respective portfolio and joint infrastructure.
           3.88.7.2.3. Conduct initial and revalidate subsequent business case analyses (BCA)
           performed in support of the product support strategy every five years or prior to each
           change in the product support strategy, whichever occurs first. Include any new or
           updated alternatives, costs, and schedule impacts relative to the most recent or
           changed product support strategy.
           3.88.7.2.4. Conduct periodic reviews no less than every five years to assess and
           revalidate the product support strategy and adjust allocations and performance
           requirements to validated warfighter needs.
           3.88.7.2.5. Ensure processes and procedures are in place within the Program Office
           for accurate collection and reporting of 50/50 and Core data and provide data IAW
           data calls.
           3.88.7.2.6. Analyze maintenance data, mishap data, and Environment, Safety, and
           Occupational Health (ESOH) compliance to evaluate operation and maintenance
           performance and compliance in support of achieving overall product support
           performance.
           3.88.7.2.7. Develop performance-based agreements with warfighter customer(s),
           PSIs and PSPs to meet the overall performance requirements and support validated
           warfighter needs.
3.89. Depot Source of Repair (DSOR). The DSOR process is the method by which the DOD
postures its depot level maintenance workloads – organic or contract. It applies to workloads for
hardware, software, new acquisitions and fielded systems, whether the Government or private
contractor manages the system or subsystem. Source of repair (SOR) processes are also utilized
to reassess prior DSOR decisions when major changes occur that could potentially affect
previous DSOR decisions (e.g., changes in the length of a program‘s life cycle; capability and
sustainment modifications; increases greater than 20% in labor-hours, cost or quantities of
fielded systems). For fielded systems, the process will be initiated as soon as the change in
posture is considered. DSOR planning shall be initiated early in the life cycle.
   3.89.1. DSOR determinations for specific programs, systems, sub-systems, and end items are
   processed and approved through AFMC.
   3.89.2. The overall DSOR decision for a program is a compilation of the results of the
   individual DSOR determinations that are based on the combined Source of Repair
   Assignment Process (SORAP) and the depot maintenance interservice (DMI)
   recommendations. The overall DSOR decision shall be approved by the MDA at MS-B
   (program initiation) and MS-C. MDA approval is normally accomplished by including the
   DSOR decision in the LCMP.
   3.89.3. The PM, PGM and Air Logistics Center (ALC) Commander shall ensure appropriate
   subject matter experts and stakeholders are involved in developing the DSOR decision
   package, validating and implementing DSOR decisions. DSOR packages shall be submitted
   with lead time sufficient to include the outcome of the determination in any acquisition
   strategy development supporting a program initiation approval MS B and/or the award of any
134                                          AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


  contracts for subsequent acquisition and sustainment phases. If a DSOR is required in less
  than 90 days from the date the initiating official submits the request to HQ AFMC, the
  request will include the rationale for the need and the required date. The following are
  responsible for the DSOR decision package submittal:
      3.89.3.1. The PM for weapon-system specific acquisitions.
      3.89.3.2. The PGM for product group acquisitions.
      3.89.3.3. The managing ALC Commander for common commodities not managed by a
      PM or PGM.
  3.89.4. DSOR packages shall be processed through use of the DSOR Electronic Manager
  (DSOR-EM). HQ AFMC shall manage the DSOR-EM and processes/procedures consistent
  with DOD/AF DSOR guidance. Initiators of DSOR packages shall adhere to the HQ AFMC
  established DSOR processes and procedures.
      3.89.4.1. HQ AFMC is designated the AF executive manager for DSOR and will:
         3.89.4.1.1. Develop and/or provide DSOR-EM user guidance, access management,
         training, user functional support, operation, and sustainment of the DSOR-EM.
         3.89.4.1.2. Develop and/or coordinate on forms required for DSOR processes.
         3.89.4.1.3. Develop DSOR processes/procedures for processing DSOR packages
         through SORAP, DMI, and if applicable the strategic source of repair (SSOR)
         activities (SSOR determination is addressed later in this section). DSOR
         processes/procedures shall be integrated within the DSOR-EM to the maximum
         extent practical.
         3.89.4.1.4. Manage the process for all initiated DSOR decision packages through all
         actions (SORAP, DMI, and, as needed, SSOR determination).
         3.89.4.1.5. Maintain up-to-date status on DSOR packages.
         3.89.4.1.6. Ensure DSOR-EM entry for completion (approval) of a SORAP, DMI,
         SSOR (if applicable), and DSOR decision is restricted to appropriate management
         personnel and the entry is linked to a digital signature for accountability.
         3.89.4.1.7. Coordinate with HQ AFSPC on all space DSOR packages.
         3.89.4.1.8. Be the AF interface with the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group
         (JDMAG).
         3.89.4.1.9. Develop and publish needed documentation, agreements, processes, and
         guidance as needed for effective operations between HQ AFMC and the JDMAG,
         consistent with DOD and AF policy and guidance.
         3.89.4.1.10. Accomplish an SSOR determination if required, utilizing the
         information from the pending DSOR package.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                     135


     3.89.4.2. The DSOR process considers a broad range of factors but at a minimum shall
     consider: public law (e.g. Title 10 USC §2464, Core Logistics Capabilities and §2466,
     Limitations on the Performance of Depot-level Maintenance of Materiel); long-term
     depot strategy; overall cost to the DOD; mission assignment alignment, environmental
     impacts (to comply with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and
     Title 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 989), and specific weapon system
     requirements. DSOR packages shall be prepared at the highest level practicable e.g.,
     system or subsystem and be a collaborative process that includes Government
     stakeholders‘ participation in determining the most beneficial SOR. The SORAP portion
     of the DSOR should be viewed as a decision point based on multiple factors rather than a
     competition between an organic depot and a contractor source.
        3.89.4.2.1. Joint acquisition programs require the DSOR to be executed for new
        items entering the AF inventory, regardless of decision rendered or degrees of
        commonality of the items being acquired by other DOD components. This does not
        preclude the use of data available from the other DOD components in the preparation
        of an AF DSOR recommendation. When the AF is the lead DOD Component, the
        other DOD Components‘ core needs are to be considered prior to any AF DSOR
        decisions.
        3.89.4.2.2. The DSOR initiator (SPM/PM, PGM or ALC OPR) is responsible to
        complete, validate, and implement the total DSOR package. The initiator of the
        DSOR shall also ensure all viable sustainment options are considered before deciding
        on a SOR recommendation for the DSOR package. The DSOR initiator is
        responsible for submitting the DSOR package in time to support milestone decisions,
        RFP releases, and other programmatic needs. RFPs shall include requirements for
        technical data which are necessary to set up AF determined needed organic repair
        capabilities.
        3.89.4.2.3. The DSOR initiator shall review DSOR decisions:
            3.89.4.2.3.1. Every three years to document continued validity of the DSOR in
            the DSOR-EM.
            3.89.4.2.3.2. As requested by HQ AFMC when depot activation plans are
            accomplished or new depot capability is activated.
     3.89.4.3. There are five situations when a DSOR is required:
        3.89.4.3.1. New acquisitions. A new acquisition includes any weapon system, item,
        component, system, subsystem, or software that will result in a new requirement for
        depot-level maintenance. DSORs for new acquisitions shall be accomplished on the
        total anticipated inventory to be acquired.
            3.89.4.3.1.1. For new acquisitions, the DSOR requirements shall be initiated
            during the Technology Development Phase in sufficient time to obtain a DSOR
            decision or an SSOR determination prior to program initiation. If only an SSOR
            determination is accomplished at program initiation, the DSOR requirements must
            be accomplished prior to the Production and Deployment life cycle phase. The
            PM initiates the DSOR by identifying the requirement. While there may not be
            firm programmatic data available in the pre-acquisition inception phase, the
136                                       AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


         identification may use information based on a system or systems that are currently
         satisfying the same or similar requirement. In the absence of a comparable source
         of data, conceptual data may be used. The submission must be of sufficient depth
         to allow for identification of candidate organic depots and completion of a core
         capability assessment.
      3.89.4.3.1.2. The PM will consider core and partnered workloads in their
      development of DSOR packages and resolve any inconsistencies with the candidate
      depots.
         3.89.4.3.1.3. The PM is responsible for review of the results of the solicitation
         and sorting workloads into two categories: (1) core and partnered workload
         decisions that were made but need to be reviewed, relative to the equipment and
         software selected. The earlier decision will either be validated or the workload
         will be placed in the contract repair candidate category. (2) Workloads, which
         also include the contract candidates, will be postured using a cost-based approach.
         These workloads may be deferred until more mature data is available.
      3.89.4.3.2. New work. New work, as related to requiring a DSOR, is a change
      (hardware or software) to a previously postured system, end-item, or component that
      will result in a change greater than 20% to the depot maintenance workload hours or
      cost.
      3.89.4.3.3. Modification follow-on workloads. Modification follow-on workloads
      are depot maintenance workloads generated as a result of a modification installation.
      When a modification installation introduces one or more new acquisition, as defined
      above, it generates a need for the DSOR to determine the destination of the workload.
      DSOR packages for modification follow-on workloads are prepared and must meet
      the same requirements as for a new acquisition.
      3.89.4.3.4. Overseas Workload Program (OWLP). DSORs are required for any new,
      modified, or shift in a SOR that involves the potential for accomplishment of depot-
      level maintenance by a source outside of the United States. Information required to
      make an informed DSOR decision is generally available. DSOR packages will be
      prepared and submitted in the same manner as for new start packages. This is
      applicable even in those instances where the results of the assessments appear to be
      obvious.
      3.89.4.3.5. Workload Shifts. Permanent change in the officially designated SOR or
      source of modification can only be accomplished through a DSOR process when such
      change involves an organic depot. Changes from one contract repair source to
      another or consolidating several contract workloads does not require a DSOR. A
      DSOR is required for a workload shift when there is a proposed change in the SOR
      that results in one of the following types of SOR shifts: from assigned organic depot
      to another organic depot; from assigned organic depot to a contract; or from contract
      SOR to an organic depot. DSOR package actions for workload shifts are the same as
      for OWLP.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            137


  3.89.5. There is no waiver to the DSOR for depot-level maintenance workloads meeting the
  criteria above, although certain categories of workloads may be excluded from DSOR
  requirements. Categories of workloads meeting the exclusion criteria include:
     3.89.5.1. DELETED.
     3.89.5.2. Workloads generated by Industrial Plant Equipment located exclusively within
     the depot maintenance complex and funded through the industrial fund.
     3.89.5.3. Modifications that are to be performed in conjunction with scheduled depot
     maintenance at the assigned SOR.
     3.89.5.4. Modifications to components that do not change the form, fit, or function of the
     component modified and do not change the basic part number, only the version (dash
     number change), as long as the SOR of the end-item does not change.
     3.89.5.5. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs.
     3.89.5.6. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) workloads which are
     Major Force Program (MFP)-11 funded.
     3.89.5.7. Systems and equipment under special access programs.
     3.89.5.8. Automated data processing equipment workloads that are not for national
     security systems (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
     applications).
     3.89.5.9. Department of Energy special design military spares. (Examples include but
     are not limited to nuclear weapon trainers, nuclear weapons test or handling equipment,
     and use control equipment.)
  3.89.6. While cost is a consideration in any posturing decision, a formal costing effort may
  not always be necessary, e.g., a review of the potential cost drivers is sufficient to allow for a
  SOR recommendation when considered with other, more salient criteria. In those instances
  where a costing effort is required, the PM (who may utilize DSOR team) will determine the
  scope and methodology. The primary consideration is the cost to the Government and not to
  individual acquisition programs. Costs incurred by an individual acquisition program
  composed of elements that would accrue costs to the Air Force regardless of the posturing
  decision are not relevant to the posturing decision. However the costs associated with the
  shift in workload shall be identified as quickly as possible so that these activities may be
  programmed and budgeted.
  3.89.7. Upon approval of the SORAP recommendation, HQ AFMC will introduce the DSOR
  package for DMI study/review. This DMI study/review is required regardless of the SORAP
  decision, organic or contract.
  3.89.8. When a DSOR decision cannot be accomplished for program initiation approval (MS
  B), HQ AFMC will accomplish an SSOR determination. The SSOR determination, defined
  as a determination of the anticipated SOR (organic or commercial and probable organic
  depot(s) considering all Services) is based on the best available information during the
  Technology Development Phase (non-space programs) or Concept Development Phase
  (space programs) or during the first applicable acquisition phase.
 138                                             AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       3.89.8.1. The SSOR determination is to identify anticipated SORs early in the
       acquisition process so that defense acquisition planning and programming documents,
       and resulting contracts, contain the appropriate sustainment elements needed to support
       the acquisition strategy. The determination will also support Title 10 USC §2464, Core
       Logistics Capabilities (Core) and §2466, Limitations on the Performance of Depotlevel
       Maintenance of Materiel (50/50) requirements, mission assignment alignment, and guide
       the DSOR initiator in accomplishing timely and efficient product support activities
       needed for operational capability. The documentation submitted for a DSOR, for both
       SORAP and DMI decisions, is used for making a SSOR determination with the
       understanding that the level of information is not sufficient to make a full DSOR
       decision.
       3.89.8.2. The AFMC/CC shall be the SSOR determination approval authority.
           3.89.8.2.1. For ACAT I, IA and II programs, the approval for the SSOR
           determination may not be delegated.
           3.89.8.2.2. For ACAT III programs, the approval for the SSOR determination may be
           delegated by the AFMC/CC.
       3.89.8.3. HQ AFMC shall determine the need for an SSOR determination within 90 days
       from the date that the initiating official submits the DSOR package. If an SSOR
       determination is required, HQ AFMC shall provide the documented approved SSOR
       determination to the DSOR package initiator at least 45 days prior to the projected or
       scheduled date for the MS B, or program inception decision.
       3.89.8.4. The SSOR determination documentation shall include at a minimum:
           3.89.8.4.1. Identification of AF and/or other Services‘ candidate depot(s) which
           possess the needed organic technical repair capability.
           3.89.8.4.2. A brief summary of the required Core capabilities, identification of Core
           capability gaps, organic workload needed, and why these organic workloads are
           necessary to alleviate the applicable identified Core gaps.
           3.89.8.4.3. Identification, from a strategic perspective, of workload projections (for
           hardware and software) required for 50/50 compliance and direction to the PM/PGM
           to plan for organic depot maintenance to satisfy the projections.
           3.89.8.4.4. A specific statement that stresses to the PM the requirement that the RFP
           include appropriate technical data rights clauses and necessary deliverables, or
           options for technical data and equipment deliverables required to support an organic
           SOR determination.
3.90. Data Rights. Ensuring access to technical data (recorded information used to define a
design and to produce, support, maintain, or operate a system) is critical to life cycle sustainment

       parts that apply to an entire system during interim supply support. At the end of the
       Interim Supply Support Period, the concept is to transition support spares directly into
       replenishment spares. More information can be found on the CSWS Community of
       Practice website.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                         147


  3.94.3. CSS can be used for materiel management, configuration management, data
  management, supply, distribution, repair, calibration, depot maintenance, operating command
  organizational maintenance (and other levels as negotiated), and many other operations and
  maintenance tasks normally performed by an organic support activity for all or part of the
  logistics support required by a system, sub-system, equipment, or end-item. Applications
  include the support of government-owned systems, sub-systems, equipment, end-items,
  research and development (R&D) prototypes converted to operational use, and other
  instances where organic life cycle logistics support is not planned. Support decisions shall be
  based on analyses (such as a Business Case Analyses (BCA)) and the ability to meet users‘
  capabilities requirements and must be in the over-all best interest of the AF.
  3.94.4. TCT, as applied in this AFI, is to provide a contractor-operated performance based
  training system. TCT may be utilized when the lead command, after coordination with the
  PM and validation by the using commands, specifies the desired level of training, objectives,
  and learning outcomes (to include metrics for assessing the accomplishment of objectives
  and outcomes). The PM shall ensure the supported system‘s TCT is defined and that its
  devices and logistics support elements will provide students with the appropriate training to
  meet the users‘ defined objectives.
     3.94.4.1. The PM, with collaboration from the lead command, shall accomplish the
     analysis for determining the use of TCT or organic support. This analysis shall be
     coordinated with and provided to the appropriate functional office for systems training at
     HQ AETC and HQ AFMC. The lead command, in collaboration with using commands,
     shall document in the operational requirements the numbers of persons or crews to train
     and the required skill level or qualifications of the students at training completion. The
     acquiring organization shall implement the lead command‘s documented defined level of
     training and the desired learning outcome(s).
     3.94.4.2. Other than Government Furnished Property (GFP) and/or Government
     Furnished Information (GFI), the PM shall ensure provisions are made for the TCT
     contractor to provide the management, instructors, curriculum, courseware, facilities,
     trainers, and logistics support required to meet requirements. For GFP/GFE/GFI
     provided through the TCT contract, the PM shall ensure provisions are made to maintain
     and make Government approved changes (e.g., engineering and software updates) to GFP
     and for control of intelligence GFI IAW AFI 14-303, Release of Intelligence to US
     Contractors.
  3.94.5. CLS and other Support requirements shall be programmed for and executed using the
  types of funds and funding level approved by the lead/using commands and/or AF
  Centralized Asset Management (CAM) Executive Agent (AFMC). The PM shall provide
  lead/using commands and/or AF CAM Executive Agent applicable copies of obligation
  documents and expense reports as agreed to and/or as stipulated by the AF CAM Executive
  Agent. Reference AFI 65-601, Vol 1 for more information.
     3.94.5.1. The lead command and using commands will plan and advocate for
     programming and budgeting for their portion of the CLS costs and any associated CLS
     requirements for the sustainment of weapon systems.
148                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


      3.94.5.2. When the funding is for the direct mission support of a program using multiple
      sustainment elements, the source of funds is operation and maintenance (O&M)
      appropriations using the Air Force Element of Expense (AFEE) 578, CLS. Note, AFEE
      578 CLS funds can only be used for applications as identified in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, not
      all CLS applications.
      3.94.5.3. When support is for a single sustainment element, the source of funds is the one
      for the specific element, such as AFEE 583 for sustaining engineering by contract, AFEE
      594 for contract technical data, AFEE 560 or 54x (depending on the commodity) for
      depot maintenance provided through the Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance
      (DPEM) program.
  3.94.6. CLS O&M requirements shall be programmed through the AF CAM Executive
  Agent or HQ AFSPC/A4/7 for space programs. The AF CAM Executive Agent shall provide
  CAM implementation/execution processes and procedures guidance. HQ AFSPC/A4/7 will
  provide tailored CAM implementation/execution guidance for space programs to standardize
  processes to the greatest extent possible. The PM shall provide actual and projected
  requirements over a nine-year period (i.e., current year, planning year, plus seven projected
  years). Projections‘ content shall include the split of contractor and public-private
  partnership (PPP) workload to support the ―50/50‖ depot maintenance workload reporting
  requirements.
  3.94.7. CLS contracts will be written based on characteristics for performance based
  logistics. The PM shall establish flexible performance and funding ranges commensurate
  with targets developed in conjunction with the lead commands, industry partners, and other
  relevant agencies across the acquisition, logistics, and user communities. These contracts
  will link contract incentives to performance outcomes while allowing the Air Force to make
  sound enterprise-wide, capabilities based resource decisions when deciding where to accept
  risk. The PM shall balance affordability, flexibility, and required operational capability
  within the program funds available.
      3.94.7.1. CLS contracts should be crafted to identify ranges of outcome performance
      with thresholds and objectives, and the target price (cost to the user) for each level of
      capability. The contract should also delineate any constraints or boundary conditions and
      will reflect normal operations. The execution performance level will be dictated by the
      allocation of funds to a weapons system during the execution year. It must include
      specific terms and conditions related to surge and warfighting operations that will be
      considered ‗over-and-above‘ activity.
      3.94.7.2. Generally, a focus on a few performance based outcome metrics — such as
      weapons system availability, mission reliability, logistics footprint, and/or overall system
      readiness levels — will lead to more effective solutions. However in developing the
      actual support arrangements, it may not be possible to directly state the warfighter
      performance objectives as support metrics because of lack of support provider control of
      all support activities necessary to produce the warfighter performance (e.g., availability).
      3.94.7.3. The PM, in collaboration with stakeholders, shall identify the needed CLS
      requirements and make provisions in the RFP, SOW, and contracts to ensure visibility of
      direct contractor costs for each type of support material and service that is being
      provided.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            149


         3.94.7.3.1. The PM will ensure contract data requirements for tracking and reporting
         of contractor/organic (50/50) costs are established.
         3.94.7.3.2. The PM shall report all contract support costs in accordance with AFI 65-
         601, Vol. 1
     3.94.7.4. CLS activities shall be consistent with AF format standards and be compatible
     with AF management and data collection systems to the maximum extent feasible.
     3.94.7.5. CLS contracts should be flexible enough to address a range of support
     requirements, so as to accommodate changes in operational tempo (OPTEMPO) or
     execution year funding, including surge or contingency requirements to the extent that
     they can be defined. Agreements should clearly articulate cost versus price
     considerations, attendant risks associated with requirements definition, performance
     failure, etc., and should capture alternatives.
     3.94.7.6. The PM shall obtain the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL)
     PGM approval prior to contracting for commercial calibration services or when deviating
     from currently established calibration support plans IAW AFI 21-113, Air Force
     Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program
     3.94.7.7. When making logistics sustainability decisions, the PM shall consider the
     impact of geographic Combatant Commander specific contractor policies and
     requirements in existing Operation Plans/Operation Orders (OPLAN/OPORD) (including
     as a minimum: restrictions imposed by applicable international and host nation support
     agreements; contractor-related deployment, theater reception and accountability
     reporting; operational security plans and restrictions; force protection; personnel
     recovery; medical support; and redeployment) upon any proposed CLS arrangement.
     Reference DODI 3020.41, Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany US Armed
     Forces for additional information.
  3.94.8. The PM shall apply quality assurance to CLS material and services. For additional
  guidance, refer to AFI 63-501, Air Force Acquisition Quality Program.
  3.94.9. The lead command and using commands will plan, program and budget for their
  portion of the CLS costs and any associated CLS requirements for the sustainment of weapon
  systems.
  3.94.10. The PM shall coordinate and obtain MAJCOM agreement on unit, base, or
  MAJCOM support requirements and ensure the agreed-to support requirements are included
  in the CLS contract. If the contractor is operating a support site at a base (installation)
  location, the PM shall ensure the contract identifies the support elements associated with the
  site for which the AF is responsible (e.g., facility maintenance, data, utility, security). If the
  base (installation) maintains the GFP, clearly identify the procedures to the contractor to
  obtain maintenance and GFI necessary for proper equipment operation. The PM shall
  identify ESOH practices that must be complied with that are specific to the AF installation.
  The PM shall identify the GFP to be maintained by the contractor and require the
  maintenance be completed in accordance with appropriate technical orders and the GFP to be
  returned in serviceable condition unless otherwise contractually specified‖.

   3.94.11. CLS for commercial derivative/hybrid aircraft shall adhere to Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) maintenance standards, directives, and bulletins to the maximum
   extent practical for commercial derivative aircraft, IAW respective manufacturer‘s
   maintenance manuals, military technical manuals, approved maintenance concept, and the
   maintenance contract. For further information, see AFI 21-107, Maintaining Commercial
   Derivative Aircraft; AFPD 62-5, Standards of Airworthiness for Commercial Derivative
   Hybrid Aircraft; and AFPD 62-4, Standards of Airworthiness for Passenger Carrying
   Commercial Derivative Transport Aircraft. OSS&E product baseline shall be preserved.
   Support for Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) shall adhere to the
   requirements of AFI 13-204, Functional Management of Airfield Operations.
   3.94.12. For training systems that use CLS, the PM is responsible to ensure the CLS
   maintains the configuration for training devices functionally equivalent to the system,
   equipment, or program they serve.
   3.94.13. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A4M will serve as the OPR for CLS support.
3.95. Industrial Base Constraints. All programs shall identify and manage industrial base
constraints throughout all phases of the life cycle, from requirements definition to disposal.
Industrial base constraints include, but are not limited to, critical raw materials, sources of
strategic materials, diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS),
manufacturing technologies and capabilities, the supply chain, parts obsolescence, depot
capacity, and industrial workforce.
   3.95.1. The PM shall address industrial base constraints in the LCMP. This should address
   mitigation to ensure that the system(s) can be supported during its life cycle. Open systems
   design, including Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), can help mitigate the risks
   associated with technology obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing capabilities by
   avoiding being locked into proprietary technology or by relying on a single source over the
   life of a system. Incremental development also should be considered to alleviate
   obsolescence concerns.
   3.95.2. The PM must ensure that PBL product support efforts include an active DMSMS
   process to anticipate occurrences and take appropriate actions. Actively addressing DMSMS
   will ensure effective support throughout the system life cycle and prevent adverse impacts on
   readiness or mission capability. The Services and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) have
   DMSMS efforts that can assist the PM in addressing DMSMS. For further information See
   DOD Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) Guidebook,
   and SAF/AQ - Policy Homepage for DOD PBL guide, and DOD 4140.1-R.
3.96. Support Equipment/Automated Test Systems (SE/ATS). Application of standardized
Support Equipment/Automatic Test Systems (SE/ATS) is preferred to provide efficiency and
reduce cost. The PM shall minimize the proliferation of system-unique equipment at all levels
while ensuring the maintenance and deployment requirements of existing and developing
systems are met.
   3.96.1. The PM shall acquire SE/ATS which is to the maximum extent possible common and
   interoperable with other Services and across multiple weapon systems and munitions.
   Peculiar SE/ATS shall be developed only as a last alternative. Additionally, the PM shall:
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                      151

3.97. Weapon System Support Program (WSSP). AF participation in this DLA managed
program is key to receiving the appropriate level of support to AF weapon systems from DLA.
The AF identifies all weapon systems that use DLA consumables, how important the system is to
the AF mission, the National Stock Numbers (NSNs) assigned to each weapon system and how
critical each NSN is to a weapon system. DLA uses this information to plan, program, and
budget for support to weapon systems. This program applies to all organic and contractor
supported weapon systems that utilize DLA supported items, including classified systems. The
implementation guidance for this program is contained in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1.
Each PM with systems that use DLA NSNs shall fulfill the Weapon System Support Program
(WSSP) responsibilities. These responsibilities begin prior to the first provisioning conference
and end when DLA parts are no longer required to support the weapon system and the weapon
system is removed from the WSSP database.
3.98. Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC). RESERVED
3.99. Depot Maintenance / Sustainment Cost Reporting (50/50). The concept of depot-level
maintenance applies to work performed by both government and contractor personnel. It
includes all types of contracts (CLS, ICS, requirements contracts) and Partnership arrangements
(Workshare Agreements, Direct Sales Agreements, and contract work excluded under the terms
of 10 USC §2474), regardless of the source and type of funding and where the work is
performed. The organic versus contract sustainment decisions must ensure compliance with
public law (e.g. Title 10 USC §2464, Core Logistics Capabilities and §2466, Limitations on the
Performance of Depot-level Maintenance of Materiel).
   3.99.1. AFMC shall develop, implement, and sustain depot maintenance procedures and
   processes for compliance with Title 10 USC §2464 (Core) and §2466 (50/50) statutory
   requirements.

       (Core) and §2466 (50/50) data and report this data to HQ AF pursuant to data calls from
       OSD through HQ AF. Computation of core data shall be accomplished IAW DODI
       4151.20, Depot Maintenance Core Capabilities Determination Process.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                     153


     3.99.1.2. Types of depot maintenance include Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM),
     Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI), Speedline, major overhaul and repair, repair of
     reparable, contract/depot field teams, over and above, storage, extended/negotiated
     warranty costs, software maintenance, and disposal (decommissioning and/or
     demilitarization). In accordance with OSD 50/50 reporting direction, all maintenance
     and repair performed in DOD maintenance depots is considered depot-level maintenance.
     The term ―in DOD maintenance depots‖ is designated by the AF as workload funded
     through the working capital fund, and accomplished by employees of the SECAF
     designated Centers of Industrial and Technical excellence.
     3.99.1.3. All factors of production cost to include labor, material, maintenance,
     engineering, and the depot maintenance portion of general contract costs such as award
     fees, over-and-above, and program management.
     3.99.1.4. Financial systems, requirements documents, budget records, and contract
     records from which the PM should obtain obligations.
     3.99.1.5. Procedures for PMs to document the rationale and methodology for estimating
     ICS and CLS depot maintenance expenditures when contracts do not provide for detailed
     depot maintenance accounting.
     3.99.1.6. Partnerships excluded from 10 USC §2466 which meet the 10 USC §2474
     Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence: Designation; Public-Private
     Partnerships, requirements for exclusion.
  3.99.2. The PM shall support AFMC, IAW AFMC developed procedures by:
     3.99.2.1. Tracking obligated depot maintenance funds for their programs, regardless of
     the source of funds, for the purpose of reporting these obligations to AFMC.
     3.99.2.2. Documenting rationale and methodology for tracking obligated depot
     maintenance funds.
     3.99.2.3. Ensuring contracts for depot maintenance include requirements to document
     and report upon request funds obligated for depot level maintenance.
  3.99.3. The first time a weapon system or other item of military equipment described in
  subsection (a)(3) Title 10 USC §2464 is determined to be a commercial item for the purposes
  of exception the PM shall document the justification for the determination and include at a
  minimum:
     3.99.3.1. The estimated percentage of parts commonality of the item version that is sold
     or leased in the commercial marketplace and the Government‘s version of the item.
     3.99.3.2. The value of unique support, test equipment, and tools that is necessary to
     support the military requirements if the item were maintained by the Government.
     3.99.3.3. A comparison of the estimated life cycle logistics support costs that would be
     incurred by the Government if the item were maintained by the private sector with the
     estimated life cycle logistics support costs that would be incurred by the Government if
     the item were maintained by the Government.

3.100. Public-Private Partnerships. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a logistics
sustainment philosophy involving a cooperative agreement between DOD and private sector
entities. A PPP for depot maintenance is an agreement between the buying authority (e.g. PM or
PGM), one or more organic maintenance activities (including geographically separated
organizations/units of a depot/center), and one or more private industry entities to perform work
or utilize facilities and equipment. The purpose of PPP is to leverage the optimal capabilities of
both the public and private sectors in order to enhance depot support to the warfighter. Goals of
partnering are more responsive product support, improved facility utilization, reduced cost of
ownership, more efficient business processes, and improved AF 50-50/Core posture.
   3.100.1. The PM shall identify potential public-private partnerships (PPP) as early as
   possible in the acquisition life cycle. New weapon systems that are establishing their support
   concept shall require consideration of PPP in the RFP for Engineering and Manufacturing
   Development (EMD) Phase. Fielded weapon systems changing their depot maintenance
   support shall proactively consider use of the organic depots as part of a public-private
   partnership (PPP) strategy.
   3.100.2. The PM shall capture cost data for all factors of production related to PPPs (e.g.,
   direct labor, overhead, materiel, G&A). The cost data shall be quantifiable and measurable
   utilizing generally accepted accounting practices.
   3.100.3. The PM in collaboration with candidate depots, lead/using commands and other
   stakeholders will develop a depot maintenance strategy that addresses both the requirement
   to conduct organic repair and to pursue a PPP approach, where feasible. The information
   necessary to implement the strategy will be included as part of the RFP for the EMD Phase to
   ensure depot posturing requirements are addressed.
   3.100.4. Statutory authorities used to support depot maintenance partnerships are listed in
   Table 3.2 Depot Maintenance Partnership Authorities.

   3.100.5. There are three types of PPPs: direct sales agreement (DSA), work share
   arrangement, and leases.
       3.100.5.1. In a DSA dollars flow from the Government buying activity directly to the
       contractor. The contractor in turn funds the depot by funds transfer to the Department of
       Treasury for the goods/services supplied by the depot. Those funds received for work
       performed in support of a PPP are credited to the depot‘s Working Capital Fund rather
       than getting deposited into a general US fund account. The contractor may also supply
       materiel to the depots in support of the PPP.
       3.100.5.2. A work share is a partnership where the buying activity determines the best
       mix of work that capitalizes on each partner‘s capabilities. The workload is then shared
       between the contractor and the organic repair entity. The contractor is funded through a
       contract, and the organic depot is funded through a project order. The partnering
       arrangement between the organic repair entity and contractor focuses on the roles and
       responsibilities of each partner, and both jointly work to accomplish the overall
       requirement.
       3.100.5.3. Leases allow private industry access to facilities/equipment located at a Center
       of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE). Facilities or equipment located at a CITE
       may be made available to private industry to perform maintenance or produce goods, as
       long as it does not preclude the CITE from performing its mission. The goal is to make
       those Government owned facilities more efficient and ensure that a workforce with the
       necessary manufacturing and maintenance skills are available to meet the needs of the
       armed forces.
3.101. Centralized Asset Management (CAM). This paragraph does not apply to the National
Guard Bureau (NGB), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or space programs. CAM is the
management and execution of sustainment funding by one AF process owner. AFMC is the
designated AF CAM Executive Agent and shall designate a CAM Director for CAM-associated
funding, requirements determination, and integrated wholesale supply and depot maintenance
operations to satisfy the user‘s operational needs. Reference AFPD 10-9 for more information.
   3.101.1. The AFMC CAM Director shall:
       3.101.1.1. Develop, coordinate with MAJCOMs and publish procedures required for
       CAM execution that are standardized, repeatable, and consistent methods for identifying
 156                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


       and prioritizing requirements, reporting expenditures, and tracking outcomes. To the
       maximum extent, he will use AF automated processes and IT systems.
       3.101.1.2. Plan, budget, and execute Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM);
       air vehicle related depot-level reparable (DLR); sustainment engineering; TOs), CLS;
       aviation petroleum, oil and lubricants (AVPOL); flying hour (FH) consumables; and
       O&M support equipment. CAM shall apply to area base (organic) manufacturing,
       aircraft, missiles, engines, other major end-items, Materiel Support Division (MSD)
       exchangeables, non-MSD exchangeables, software, and storage.
       3.101.1.3. Administer CAM funding to users.
       3.101.1.4. Collaborate with lead commands and PMs on changes to weapon systems‘
       requirements/funding prioritization.
       3.101.1.5. Coordinate with appropriate functional support offices prior to reprogramming
       when statute mandated or reporting requirements, including 50/50 and Core, may be
       negatively impacted.
   3.101.2. MAJCOMs and PMs shall utilize the HQ AFMC developed CAM procedures, meet
   established timeframes/suspense, and support associated reviews.
   3.101.3. MAJCOMs and PMs shall collaborate with HQ AFMC to advocate and ensure all
   requirements associated with weapon systems‘ support receive equitable consideration under
   CAM.
3.102. Provisioning. The PM of new weapon systems, subsystems, modifications to existing
systems, or sustainment of activities of existing weapons systems shall determine and acquire as
applicable, the range and quantity of support items necessary to operate and maintain an end-
item of materiel for an initial period of service in time to meet/accommodate the operational
need date. Support items are items subordinate to, or associated with, an end item (i.e., spares,
tools, test equipment and sundry materials) and required to operate, service, repair, or overhaul
an end item. The acquisition of provisioning items must be integrated with other elements such
as production, support equipment, technical manuals, training, and facilities. The PM shall
ensure that the logistics business processes implemented within their applicable programs are
aligned with provisioning guidance. Reference DOD 4140.1-R, AFPD 23-1, Materiel
Management Policy and Procedures, MIL-PRF-49506, and the AF Initial Provisioning
Performance Specification (IPPS) for more information.
3.103. Performance Based Logistics (PBL). Performance based logistics (PBL) is a strategy
that applies to new programs; capability and sustainment modifications; and re-procurement of
systems, subsystems and commodities that are procured beyond the initial production contract
award. The strategy employs an integrated and affordable performance package that is designed
to optimize system readiness and reduce the demand on the logistics tail of a system. It is
intended to meet performance goals through a support structure based on long-term performance
agreements with clear lines of authority and responsibility. Figure 3.2 depicts relationships of a
PBL strategy for a weapon system.
   3.103.1. The PM shall utilize and implement a PBL strategy for new acquisition category
   ACAT I, IA and II systems, unless otherwise justified by a BCA and approved by the MDA.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            157


   A PBL strategy is preferred on new ACAT III, fielded systems, end items, or commodity
   acquisition.
   3.103.2. For all cases where PBL is being considered as the support strategy, the PM shall
   perform a BCA to validate that PBL is cost effective, financially feasible and optimizes
   system readiness. The strategy decision rationale shall be documented and retained by the
   PM. Reference AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis and AFI 65-509, Business Case Analysis
   (when published) for more information.
   3.103.3. A PBL strategy may provide various levels of support as illustrated below in Figure
   3.3, Performance Based Logistics Relationships.
   3.103.4. A PBL strategy shall be tailored to fit the individual system/component in the
   intended operational environment(s) for the duration of its projected service life. The
   product support planning and execution process supports translation of performance
   requirements into system design and is implemented in conjunction with the overall systems
   engineering approach. The PBL strategy shall define performance in terms of military
   objectives using criteria such as: operational availability, operational reliability, total cost,
   logistics footprint, and logistics response time.

Figure 3.3. PBL Levels




   3.103.5. A PBL strategy shall be tailored to fit the individual system/component in the
   intended operational environment(s) for the duration of its projected service life. The
   product support planning and execution process supports translation of performance
   requirements into system design and is implemented in conjunction with the overall systems
   engineering approach. The PBL strategy shall have the following characteristics:
       3.103.5.1. Performance defined in terms of military objectives using criteria such as
       operational availability, operational reliability, total cost, logistics footprint, and logistics
       response time.
       3.103.5.2. Performance measures that reflect the specific service definitions and unique
       circumstances of the PBL arrangements.
       3.103.5.3. Focus on system performance outcomes versus individual support elements.
       3.103.5.4. Best use of public and private sector capabilities through PPP initiatives.
       3.103.5.5. Long-term agreements with support providers, which may be organic,
       commercial, and/or a PPP, which empower and provide incentives to meet overarching
       performance requirements to improve product support effectiveness while reducing TOC.
   3.103.6. BCAs, for new acquisitions, shall have detailed MS C baselines that consider
   reliability and maintainability projections at the major system repairable level. These
   individual estimates will be instrumental in providing the basis for contractual actions
   leading to the implementation of the acquisition product support strategy. PBL strategies and
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                       159


  implementation will be re-evaluated at appropriate decision points in the life cycle process.
  Therefore, BCAs will continue to be used throughout the life cycle process with oversight to
  ensure reassessment at appropriate times, such as life cycle cost (LCC) updates, reduction in
  total ownership cost (R-TOC) activities and continuous improvement actions.
  3.103.7. The PM is accountable to accomplish product support objectives, including
  development and implementation of sustainment strategies.            The management and
  sustainment responsibility for commodities not peculiar to a single weapon system belongs to
  the AFMC/CC. (NOTE: Accountability for accomplishment of logistics objectives for
  common commodities may be assigned by AFMC/CC to PGMs. PMs and PGMs shall
  consider supportability, total life cycle costs, and performance throughout the system life
  cycle. As part of the product support strategy, planning for operations and support and the
  estimation of TOC shall begin prior to MS B.)
  3.103.8. The initial product support strategy for new ACAT I, IA, and II programs shall be
  developed prior to MS B, including definition of metrics that will be used to define a
  program‘s ability to meet future logistics and operational performance requirements. For
  ACAT I, IA, and II programs, PMs shall, in collaboration with the product support
  stakeholders and providers (Government and industry), form a team to assess applicability of
  a PBL strategy to the program. The assessment shall include, as a minimum, consideration
  of and/or potential for achievement of the following:
     3.103.8.1. Existing sustainment strategy through organic or commercial means of same
     or similar systems and/or end items.
     3.103.8.2. Logistics requirements for the program to include long term technical data
     needs, Core, and 50/50 requirements and long term software maintenance support and
     upgrade planning to sustain depot requirements and Operational Flight Program (OFP)
     operational requirements in response to new threats, emergent operational environment
     and requirements.
     3.103.8.3. Lead/using MAJCOMs‘ stated capability requirements and the potential for
     increased system performance.
     3.103.8.4. Capability to reduce the cost per operational unit of performance through the
     application of a PBL approach.
     3.103.8.5. Accomplishment of a detailed BCA prior to MS C.
     3.103.8.6. Linkage of lead/using MAJCOM‘s metrics to contract incentives for
     commercial PBL. For organic PBL support, linkage of MAJCOMs requirements to
     performance based agreements (PBAs) between the PM and the organic product support
     providers.
  3.103.9. PBAs shall delineate measurable performance outcomes that correspond to support
  requirements and the resources to achieve both. Weapon system PBAs between the PM and
  the lead/using MAJCOMs should be consistent with the applicable system PMA. PBAs are
  to support established performance baselines and define required metrics necessary to
  achieve the performance requirements. They may be used as a basis for support
  arrangements or contracts and as a tool to ensure accountability in meeting requirements by
  defining the expectations, range of support requirements, and roles and responsibilities.

  3.103.10. For ACAT I, IA and II programs the PM will accomplish a BCA that shall:
      3.103.10.1. Be based on performance requirements, which should be documented in
      PBAs.
      3.103.10.2. Reflect the operational requirements and DOD guidance for contractors on
      the battlefield, ability to synchronize with the Defense Transportation System, and the
      flexibility to support contingencies and surges.
      3.103.10.3. Consider the full range of minimum and maximum essential logistics
      capabilities (peacetime to full mobilization requirement), existing infrastructure, and
      common consumables support.
      3.103.10.4. Assess changes from existing product support strategies for legacy systems
      to support the product support strategy for new weapon systems.
      3.103.10.5. Evaluate all services or activities needed to meet lead/using MAJCOMs‘
      performance requirements using best value assessments (with ―best value‖ meaning the
      expected outcome that provides the greatest overall benefit in response to requirements).
      3.103.10.6. Include risk assessment of expected performance and supply chain
      responsiveness. Performance and cost risk shall explicitly consider contract versus
      organic risk management, financial accountability, and recovery actions.
      3.103.10.7. Use information provided by product support stakeholders, including
      government and industry providers. A competitive environment shall be maintained;
      therefore industry participation shall be determined IAW the Federal Acquisition
      Regulation.
      3.103.10.8. Address the cost per output, performance measures, capitalization/asset
      ownership, size of logistics footprint, reliability growth, system life cycle costs,
      diminished manufacturing sources management, obsolescence, technology insertion, risk
      management, unique identification, and mitigation plan.
  3.103.11. For the total life cycle of a program, a funding stream must be programmed,
  budgeted, and executed in accordance with applicable AF policy/guidance and a funding
  strategy for the program‘s sustainment must be established.
      3.103.11.1. The AF Working Capital Fund (WCF) may be used to fund CSS
      arrangements if: (1) The weapon system/modification is currently supported organically;
      (2) There is a defined customer base; (3) A well-defined and established buyer and seller
      relationship exists; (4) The assets are currently managed and paid for by the WCF, no
      exceptions. (If the assets are not already managed and paid for by the WCF, it is not
      appropriate to move the items into the WCF for the purpose of establishing a PBL
      arrangement.)
      3.103.11.2. Appropriated funds will not be merged to fund CSS arrangements without
      Congressional approval; e.g., 3400 (O&M) funds cannot be merged with 3010 (Aircraft
      Procurement) funds.
      3.103.11.3. The PM shall ensure the strategy and execution of CSS funding is
      documented within the program‘s financial plans.
AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                           161


       3.103.11.4. The PM planning shall ensure that the product support concept is integrated
       with other logistics support and combat support functions to provide agile and robust
       combat capability. The PM shall identify a single point of contact responsible for
       integrating the activities of the product support providers. Product support integration
       includes intra-system and inter-system integration with supporting systems, subsystems,
       end-items, components, and facilities.
       3.103.11.5. PBAs with lead/using MAJCOMs shall provide the objectives that form the
       basis of the PBL effort.
          3.103.11.5.1. DELETED.
          3.103.11.5.2. To meet revised requirements for expectations and drive performance-
          based outcomes, new PBAs and/or updates to existing PBAs between stakeholders
          likewise are to be accomplished.
          3.103.11.5.3. For support provided by commercial organizations, the contract in most
          cases serves as a PBA.
              3.103.11.5.3.1. One of the characteristics of PBL contracts with commercial
              product support providers shall be based on ―pay for performance‖. Inherent in
              purchasing a level of performance, rather than discrete goods and services, is a
              shift of risk to the product support provider.
              3.103.11.5.3.2. While the AF cannot completely delegate risk for system
              operational performance, PBL strategies move the level of risk away from the AF
              to the product support provider commensurate with the scope of the support
              responsibility.
3.104. Demilitarization, Disposal, Reclamation, and Migration. Migration planning shall be
an integral part of weapon system life cycle planning as an element in the inventory management
of AF assets, which is addressed in AFPD 16 4, Accounting for Units, Installations and
Aerospace Vehicles. Upon award of the final production contract the PM shall develop a
migration plan in accordance with AFI 16 402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. Demilitarization, reclamation
   3.104.1. For aircraft programs, the migration plan shall address reclamation and disposal for
   each mission design series (MDS), to include peculiar end items associated with the MDS.
   The plan shall be updated to maximize the value of reclaimed assets; provide for the orderly
   flow of inactive storage aircraft from the most restrictive category to the least restrictive in
   order to reduce spare parts costs to support active fleets; and ensure viability of the aircraft
   disposition plan.
   3.104.2. Demilitarization (DEMIL) Code Determination/Procedures and Execution of
   DEMIL Plans. Demilitarization code determination must be performed as soon as material
   designs are documented. DEMIL requirements for items such as prototypes and tooling, end
   items, and each NSN must be documented as well as how to procedures for demilitarizing the
   items. The PM shall ensure demilitarization and disposal of end items are addressed in the
   program budget.
   3.104.3. For system not designated as MDS, the plan shall address migration to the system
   or end item level as appropriate.
 162                                          AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.104.4. The migration plan shall be documented in the LCMP and periodically reviewed.
   The LCMP documents an assessment of when the initial AFI 16-402 Migration Plan is due.
   Generally, this would be when retirements of the weapon system are scheduled in the Future
   Years Defense Program (FYDP).

Section 3E—Networks and Information Integration Requirements.

3.105. Networks and Information Integration Requirements Overview. The PM shall
ensure Information Technology (IT) system development adheres to mandated IT standards

       requirement in an area such as safety or security, or
       3.108.5.2. Necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on a project that is needed to
       achieve an essential capability, taking into consideration the alternative solutions for
       preventing that adverse effect.
   3.108.6. Certification approvals expire based on the date set by the DBSMC provided scope,
   cost, and schedule are maintained and any conditions contained in the approval memorandum
   are met. All business systems require annual review by an IRB.
   3.108.7. Details of the AF‘s certification process are found in the AF IT Investment Review
   Guide. More information on the DOD BEA can be found on the Business Transformation
   Agency website.
   3.108.8. For ACAT 1AM programs that are defense business systems, the SAE shall provide
   a written statement to the MDA through the cognizant IRB per DTM 08-020.
3.109. Directed Use of Joint Integrated Architectures. The PM shall ensure integrated
architectures for IT and NSS are developed in accordance with CJCSI 3170.01, CJCSI 6212.01
and AFI 33-401, Implementing Air Force Architectures and ensure that the architectures are
aligned with the Air Force Enterprise Architecture (AF-EA). The USD(AT&L), (OASD/NII),

security services, and other associated services necessary to achieve information superiority. For
additional information reference DODD 8100.01, Global Information Grid Overarching Policy.
3.111. Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Internet Protocol (IP) is the ―language‖ and set of
rules computers use to communicate over the Internet. IPv6 is the standard that enables the
DOD to support a greater networking capacity. All GIG IP based network assets are required to
be IP version 6 (IPv6) capable (in addition to maintaining interoperability with IP version 4
(IPv4) systems/capabilities).
   3.111.1. The PM shall ensure that all GIG IP based network assets being developed,
   procured, or acquired are IPv6 compliant.
   3.111.2. The PM shall initiate efforts to transition IPv4 systems and applications to support
   IPv6 and determine the IPv6 impact. The PM shall conduct an analysis to determine cost and
   schedule impacts necessary to modify the system. The PM shall include IPv6 requirements in
   program acquisition and technology refresh budget and POM submissions.
   3.111.3. The PM shall ensure that accurate and complete IPv6 data is recorded in the AF‗s
   officially designated IT data repository, currently EITDR.
   3.111.4. AF guidance on IPv6 process information is available in the AF IPv6 Transition
   Plan and IPv6 Process Guidance in the AF IPv6 Transition Site.

3.113. Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP). CJCSM 3170.01 requires all
CDDs and CPDs for IT and NSS systems to include a Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter
(NR-KPP) for interoperability based on the information exchange of the proposed system. NR-
KPP assesses information needs, information timeliness, information assurance, joint
interoperability and supportability, and net-ready attributes required for both the technical
exchange of information and the end-to-end operational effectiveness of that exchange. To
accomplish this, the NR-KPP consists of measurable, testable, or calculable characteristics or
performance metrics required for the timely, accurate, and complete exchange and use of
information.
   3.113.1. Requirement. Inclusion of the NR-KPP is mandatory for all acquisition IT and NSS
   programs for systems used to enter, process, store, display, or transmit DOD information,
   regardless of classification or sensitivity and regardless of acquisition category. The only
   exception is for those IT or NSS systems that do not communicate with external systems.
   Non-acquisition programs must also comply in accordance with DODD 4630.5, DODI
   4630.8, and AFPD 33-4. Documentation of the four NR-KPP components (as defined in
 166                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   CJCSI 6212.01) is required for Interoperability and Supportability Certification.
   Architecture requirements for JCIDS, NR-KPP, and ISP documentation can also be found in
   CJCSI 6212.01.
   3.113.2. Timeline. The NR-KPP is included as part of the CDD, CPD, and ISP documents
   that are approved at MS B and C. The NR-KPP is developed to a level commensurate with
   the information available at each milestone.
   3.113.3. Certification. The NR-KPP is a key product used by J6 (Joint Staff) to certify
   systems for interoperability and supportability at MS B and C. See CJCSI 6212.01, Table 1

3.114. Integrated Architecture Data. Integrated architecture data, including the joint
integrated architecture, is used to assess the impacts of trades from an operational context and to
support strategy development and testing.
   3.114.1. The PM shall ensure the RFP and contracts provide the needed architectural data to
   support development of the T&E strategy and realistic operational testing according to AFI
   99-103.
   3.114.2. RFPs should include the elements of the joint integrated architecture that were used
   to define the requirement as the starting point for the contractor‘s architectural development
   work. Section L of an RFP will include a requirement to develop architectural data as a part
   of the proposal and demonstrate use of this data to evaluate proposed engineering solutions to
   the requirement in the context of the joint integrated architectures showing linkages from
   products to requirements.
   3.114.3. The PM should ensure that each review point includes an architecture-based
   assessment to confirm that the system development remains aligned to its operational
   requirements with an architecture-based assessment. Any changes to the solution should be
   negotiated with the users and other programs that are affected as depicted in the joint
   integrated architecture.

3.115. Information Assurance (IA). IA is a risk management activity that refers to the
measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their
availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. These measures
include providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection, detection,
and reaction capabilities. The objectives of the Air Force IA program will be met through the
effective employment of the Air Force‘s core IA disciplines of Communications Security
(COMSEC), Computer Security (COMPUSEC), and Emissions Security (EMSEC). AFPD 33-2,
Information Assurance (IA) Program, AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management,
and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP) establish
the AF IA program framework.
   3.115.1. PM shall ensure an IA strategy is documented and IA requirements are
   implemented at all phases of the life cycle. The IA strategy is done to ensure compliance
   with the statutory regulations of the CCA. The IA strategy is done early in a program
   lifecycle (pre-milestone A) and is required for Milestone Reviews.
       3.115.1.1. The IA strategy applies to all IT including NSS per DODI 5000.02, Enclosure
       4, Table 3. Refer to DoDI 8580.1 for submission and review process information.
       3.115.1.2. The IA strategy describes the program approach to IA including interfaces
       with other systems, impacts to the security posture of the program, Mission Assurance
       Category (MAC), Confidentiality Level, and the integration of IA requirements into the
       life cycle management of the program (i.e. integration of IA testing into the program test
       strategy).
   3.115.2. IA policy is based on fact-based operational risk assessments. Total risk avoidance
   is not practical in many cases; therefore, risk assessment and management is required.
   3.115.3. IA shall be a visible element of all investment portfolios and acquisition programs
   incorporating AF-owned or AF-controlled information systems.
   3.115.4. Using fact-based operational risk management, AF systems and networks will be
   protected using a ―deny all, permit by exception‖ approach.
   3.115.5. The PM shall ensure that IA Manager responsibilities are designated to an
   individual.
   3.115.6. The PM shall review Air Force Specialized IA Publications to determine
   applicability to their program, refer to AFI 33-200 for listing of publications.

3.116. Information Technology Lean and SISSU Processes. The Information Technology
Lean (IT Lean) process is a tailored version of the DOD 5000 series acquisition process
specifically designed for small IT programs. With proper approval and when used in
conjunction with the Security, Interoperability, Supportability, Sustainability and Usability
(SISSU) process using EITDR, this tailored process can be used to manage the acquisition
process and is required for system security certification and accreditation. The requirements of
DOD 5000 acquisition series, CJCSI 3170, and AFI 10-601 still apply.
 168                                          AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   3.116.1. The program scope for the IT Lean process is limited to programs that meet all of
   the following criteria:
       3.116.1.1. Must be an Information Technology program as defined in DODI 5000.02.
       3.116.1.2. Designated Acquisition Category (ACAT) III or Non-ACAT, with a value of
       $15M or less in development or enhancement costs.
       3.116.1.3. Must have a Joint Potential Designator (JPD) of ―Independent‖ (programs
       with no JPD are assumed to be ―independent‖-see CJCSI 3170.01 for definition of JPD).
   3.116.2. A modified IT Lean/SISSU process can be considered for commercial off-the-shelf
   (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) products being integrated into the AF
   Enterprise Network that meet the above criteria.
   3.116.3. The PM shall receive approval for a program to enter the IT Lean process from the
   appropriate acquisition authority for that program (MDA for ACAT programs).
   3.116.4. Security, Interoperability, Supportability, Sustainability, and Usability (SISSU)
   process. All IT programs including ACAT and MAIS designated programs can benefit from
   the SISSU process to assist in the early identification of derived SISSU requirements.
   Starting with requirements development and continuing throughout the program, the
   continuous use of this tool will assist the PM in creating an efficient and effective
   development environment.
   3.116.5. Detailed information on the IT Lean process and the SISSU process is provided in
   the IT Lean Guidebook.
3.117. Certification and Accreditation. Certification and accreditation is a process that
ensures that systems and major applications adhere to formal and established security
requirements. Certification and accreditation is required by the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. The PM for Air Force information systems must ensure the
system is certified and accredited in accordance with DODI 8510.01, DoD Information
Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), AFPD 33-2, Information
Assurance (IA) Program and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation (C&A)
Program (AFCAP).
   3.117.1. The PM shall initiate DIACAP planning prior to MS B (or as early as possible) by
   developing the System Identification Profile (SIP) and DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP).
   3.117.2. The PM shall ensure that the system is certified and accredited before fielding of
   the system and that all DIACAP requirements have been fulfilled. An accreditation decision
   is issued by a Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) and is expressed as an authorization
   to operate (ATO), interim authorization to operate (IATO), interim authorization to test
   (IATT), or denial of authorization to operate (DATO).
   3.117.3. The PM shall ensure the systems; plan of action and milestones are documented and
   tracked, annual security testing (contingency plan and security controls) is completed and
   documented, reviews are conducted and documented, and recertification and reaccreditation
   is completed in order to maintain the IA posture of the system.

3.118. Spectrum Management. Spectrum management is the planning, coordinating, and
managing of the joint use of the electromagnetic spectrum through operational, engineering, and
administrative procedures. The objective of spectrum management is to enable electronic
systems to perform their functions in the intended environment without causing or suffering
unacceptable interference. Systems using or impacting the electromagnetic spectrum must
obtain spectrum certification to comply with national and international laws as well as
established treaties. Spectrum supportability is an assessment as to whether the electromagnetic
spectrum necessary to support the operation of a spectrum-dependent equipment or system
during its expected life cycle is, or will be, available in specified environments or locations.
Reference DODD 4650.1, Policy for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum AFI
33-118, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management and AFMAN 33-120, Electromagnetic
Spectrum Management and supporting information for a additional information and definitions
of spectrum management terms.
   3.118.1. The PM shall address spectrum supportability and requirements as early as possible
   in the acquisition life cycle to mitigate programmatic risk but no later than MS B. The PM
   shall then review spectrum requirements throughout the life cycle of the program. Spectrum
   supportability can be a lengthy process and should begin during concept development for
   programs and technologies that may require spectrum certification. Spectrum supportability
   must also address Equipment Spectrum Certification (ESC) for applicable countries where
   the equipment/system may be expected to operate as well as electromagnetic compatibility
   (EMC) with other systems.
   3.118.2. The PM shall ensure system documents (including contract deliverables) properly
   address characteristics required by the equipment spectrum certification process described in
   AFI 33-118 and AFMAN 33-120. The PM shall obtain Stage 3 (Developmental) approval
   for spectrum-dependent systems prior to MS B. No spectrum-dependent systems being
   developed shall proceed into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase or the
   Production and Deployment Phase without such a spectrum supportability determination
   unless specific authorization to proceed is granted by the Milestone Decision Authority
   (MDA). No spectrum-dependent ―off the shelf‖ or other non-developmental system shall be
   purchased or procured without such a spectrum supportability determination. Spectrum
   certification must be obtained through the U.S. national-level spectrum planning process, and
   respective host nation process (if overseas use/deployment is required). Program managers
   shall send their requests through their respective product center and/or MAJCOM to the Air
   Force Frequency Management Agency (AFFMA) for review and submission to the national
   and international communities. Program managers shall ensure spectrum requirements are
   properly documented in Information Support Plans (ISPs), a regulatory requirement at MS B
   and C.
   3.118.3. The PM shall ensure electronic and electrical systems, subsystems, and equipment,
   including ordnance, procured for U.S. forces are mutually compatible in the operational
   electromagnetic environment in accordance with DODD 3222.3/AFSUP1, Electromagnetic
   Compatibility Program (Air Force Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Program). The
   collective term defined by the DOD to address and manage compatibility issues is
   Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3). E3 control requirements must be considered
   during all phases of equipment planning, research, development, acquisition, logistic support,
   deployment, operation and disassembly. Each organization and person who participates in
 170                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


   the generation of operational requirements, system design, development, testing, acquisition,
   off-the-shelf purchase, site surveys, logistics support and operation of Air Force electrical,
   electronic, or communications equipment must consider the requirement to achieve control of
   E3 in the intended operating environment.
   3.118.4. Users of radio frequency radiating systems, including experimental, developmental,
   and operational systems and technologies, must obtain authority (license) to radiate in the
   electromagnetic environment. The authorization is obtained from the cognizant frequency
   management authority in the area of operation and must be obtained before the system is
   placed in operation.
   3.118.5. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A4/7, Integrated Electronics Maintenance Systems
   Branch (AFISRA/A4MY) will serve as the OPR for implementation of the AFISRA
   Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) program.
3.119. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Waivers/Notifications. OSD policy requires all
services to minimize non-Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) purchases and develop migration
strategies for existing radios.
   3.119.1. The PM shall complete a JTRS waiver or notification prior to initiating contracting
   activity to develop, modify, or procure non-JTRS radios. A waiver is needed for programs
   procuring or modifying non-JTRS approved single-channel tactical handheld radios. A
   notification is required for all other radio procurements.
   3.119.2. The PM shall forward JTRS waiver/notifications to the Air Force Lead Command
   for JTRS, currently the Air Force Global Cyberspace Integration Center (GCIC), for entry
   into the Air Force JTRS waiver/notification process. Following GCIC review and
   coordination the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) coordinates
   and sends a waiver/notification letter to OUSD/NII. The typical process takes 6 weeks from
   initial GCIC contact, although this can be accelerated for validated urgent operational needs.
   Due to this timeline, all waivers/notifications that require approval before the end of a fiscal
   year must be submitted to AF GCIC prior to 1 August. For further information on JTRS
   waivers, contact the Air Force Global Cyberspace Integration Center (AF GCIC).
3.120. AF IT Standards Waiver Process. When an AF organization identifies a need for a
new or emerging standard to be added to the DISR, or to update a version of or retire an existing
DISR standard, the DISR change request (CR) process must be followed, whether the CR is for a
joint mandated standard or for an AF-unique standard. For ACAT programs, this must be done
prior to MS B or an IT standards waiver must be obtained.
   3.120.1. The PM shall request a waiver to use an IT standard not approved for use in the
   DISR or when a decision is made not to use a DOD-mandated IT standard. Waivers must
   also be requested for use of a standard listed in DISR as emerging or retired. Requests for
   waivers will be submitted to the Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) Technical
   Architecture Division for review and coordination to ensure there are no interoperability
   issues, in accordance with AFI 33-401. AFNIC can provide a waiver request template to be
   used when submitting the request. SAF/XC is the AF IT Standards Waiver Approval
   Authority. Additional information can also be found on the DISR website at
   https://disronline.disa.mil.

3.121. AF Automated Computer Program Identification Number System. When
developing new Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs) for AF Weapons Systems and
Automatic Test Equipment, the AF Automated Computer Program Identification Number
System (ACPINS) will be considered for use in numbering each CSCI and related
documentation and in ordering and tracking software.
3.122. Privacy. The PM shall ensure information assurance controls are implemented that
protect privacy act and personally identifiable information (PII). The PM will ensure privacy
impact assessments (PIA),system of records notices (SORN), and SSN reduction in records and
forms, are conducted, documented, and coordinated in accordance with DOD 5400.11-R, DoD
Privacy Program and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program.
3.123. Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System (CIPS). The PM shall ensure applicable
use of and updates to the CIPS. CIPS is the AF enterprise-wide communications and
information equipment, systems and infrastructure planning tool. CIPS includes downward
directed enterprise solutions, MAJCOM, base and in-theatre planning. Additional information
can be found at the CIPS CoP.
3.124. Section 508. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, was enacted to
eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people
with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these
goals. The PM shall consider Section 508 requirements specified in AFI 33-393, Electronic and
Information Technology Accessible to Individuals with Disabilities, Section 508.

   functional team brings to the table their unique area of expertise. This expertise is vital to the
   success of the team. However, the functional perspective each person brings to the
   acquisition must always be subordinate to the greater perspective of the mission. The
   purpose of the multi-functional team is to create an environment that shapes and executes an
 180                                            AFI63-101_AFISRASUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011

   stakeholders are responsible for the acquisition throughout the life of the requirement. For
   complex, multi-functional service acquisitions, membership should include all stakeholders
   impacted by the services performed. This may include subgroup(s) responsible for routine
   tasks associated with the service acquisition process. For less complex, single-function
   service acquisitions, membership in this group may include as few members as: the procuring
   contracting officer, the administrative contracting officer, the program manager, quality
   assurance representatives, the functional/technical representative, and a subject matter expert.

                           DEVELOPMENT

5.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to identify acquisition workforce management and
professional development requirements and responsibilities. The 1990 Defense Acquisition
Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA), Chapter 87, Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.),
provides specific minimum qualification standards of those personnel performing functions
integral to the acquisition process and defines critical acquisition positions. The law requires
DOD to formalize career paths for personnel who wish to pursue careers in acquisition to
develop a skilled, professional workforce. This chapter defines the Air Force‘s implementation
of this law as required by DODD and DODI.
5.2. Acquisition Workforce. For the purposes of this publication, the acquisition workforce is
defined as those individuals assigned to positions having predominantly acquisition functions as
defined by DODD 5000.01, DODI 5000.02, and DODD 5000.52. These positions shall be
designated by acquisition coding in the manpower and personnel systems of record.
5.3. Responsibilities and Authorities. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Acquisition, SAF/AQ, establishes policy and provides Service oversight for acquisition
workforce management and professional development, and in accordance with DODD 5000.52,
is responsible for implementing the Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Workforce
Education, Training and Career Development Program in the AF on behalf of the Secretary of
the Air Force (SECAF).
   5.3.1. AF Director, Acquisition Career Management (DACM). The DACM is designated by
   SAF/AQ with authority to assist the SAEs for space and non-space programs with oversight
   and execution of acquisition workforce responsibilities. Responsibilities of the DACM shall
   include:
       5.3.1.1. Developing, implementing and overseeing policies and procedures for the AF

word TEMP appears in this AFI, the LCMP T&E annex is also implied. The TEMP may be
included in a LCMP as a T&E annex.
Test and Evaluation Strategy—The overarching integrated T&E outline for the entire
acquisition program that describes how operational capability requirements will be tested and
evaluated in support of the acquisition strategy. Developed prior to Milestone A, the T&E
strategy addresses modeling and simulation, risk and risk mitigation, development of support
equipment, and identifies how system concepts will be evaluated against mission requirements,
among other things. The T&E strategy is a precursor to the test and evaluation master plan.
Testable—The attribute of being measurable with available test instrumentation and resources.
NOTE: Testability is a broader concept indicating whether T&E infrastructure capabilities are
available and capable of measuring the parameter. The difference between testable and
measurable may indicate a test limitation. Some requirements may be measurable but not
testable due to T&E infrastructure shortfalls, insufficient funding, safety, or statutory or
regulatory prohibitions.

       use for a specific purpose.
Vulnerability—The characteristics of a system that causes it to suffer a definite degradation
(loss or reduction of capability to perform its designated mission) as a result of having been
subjected to a certain (defined) level of effects in an unnatural (man-made) hostile environment.
Vulnerability is considered a subset of survivability. Vulnerability in an information system is a
weakness in system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be
exploited.
Warfighter—An individual or organization who executes military force or is responsible for
making operational decisions that result in the use of military force. The term includes field
level personnel assigned to an Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) whose duties support
USAF core competencies and distinctive capabilities.

                             CATEGORIES

Category I Engineering Data Service Center (EDSC)—This EDSC is established to support a
base or installation whose mission requires minimal engineering data. These EDSCs do not
maintain data files nor are they authorized to have any equipment for viewing and reproduction.
A DOD Index of Specifications and Standards (DODISS) documents library is permitted.
Category II EDSC—This EDSC is established to support a base or installation whose mission
requires small amounts of engineering data. These EDSCs do not maintain data files but may
have equipment for viewing and printing copies of engineering data. These EDSCs may
requisition engineering data on a one-time basis. A DODISS documents library is permitted.
Category III EDSC—This EDSC is established to support a base or installation whose mission
requires individual items of data, some partial or complete sets of data, and the maintenance of
data files. These EDSCs requisition data on a one-time basis. They are authorized to have
equipment for viewing and printing copies of engineering data. A DODISS documents library is
required.
Category IV EDSC—This EDSC is established to support a base or installation whose mission
requires complete sets of data. These EDSCs must maintain data files. They are authorized to
have equipment for viewing and printing copies of engineering data. A DODISS documents
library is required.
Category V EDSC—This EDSC is established to receive new data from contractors,
subcontractors, vendors, and government design activities; process requests for copies of
individual items and sets of data from government and non-government activities and provide
automatic updates to Category III and Category IV EDSCs to other individuals or activities as
necessary. These EDSCs, located at the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), are primary DOD
repositories maintaining the official Air Force record copies of data, sets of data (reserve files),
and they have complete reproduction capabilities for that data. These EDSCs also perform the
local base-level EDSC operations for their respective bases. A DODISS documents library is
required.
