This instruction implements Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4,
Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP) and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 23-1,
Materiel Management Policy and Procedures. It prescribes policies and procedures for
Spangdahlem Air Base’s (SAB) participation in the Department of Defense (DoD) PMRP. The
PMRP applies to all USAF personnel including those assigned to geographically separated units
that generate, store or dispose of precious metals bearing scrap or residue. Procedures are
provided to ensure the proper control, identification and accounting of items containing precious
metals. The PMRP is established to promote the economic recovery of precious metals from
excess and scrap materials. Within the Air Force inventory, a number of commodities contain
precious metals which are not consumed in their use. Retention of this residue is of vital
importance to the USAF, in that dollar savings can be realized and results in the better utilization
of precious metals which are limited within our country’s natural resources. The PMRP applies
to all USAF activities that generate, store or dispose of precious metals bearing scrap or residue.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It now
prescribes the use of Spangdahlem Form 9, Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP) Self
Inspection Checklist.
1. General:
     1.1. Applicability. All activities at SAB will cooperate to the fullest extent with the
     installation PMRP Manager to ensure a successful program. Activities will use prescribed
     Spangdahlem Form 9 for semiannual self-inspections to ensure program compliance (also
     refer to paragraph 2.2.7.3. of this SABI for further instructions). Units in a deployed status
     will participate in the PMRP at the host installation.
     1.2. Exemption. Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Cost designator XD, XF, ND,
     or NF items, and XB3 items, which retain their identity after use (serviceable), are exempt
     from the requirements for records keeping set forth in this instruction. These items will be
     processed IAW normal supply turn-in procedures.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Organization Commander's Responsibilities.
        2.1.1. Organization commanders or their designated representative must appoint, in
        writing, a primary and alternate PMRP monitor for their organization. Other personnel
        may be appointed as shop monitors to assist the organization monitors if desired.
        Appointment of shop monitors may be made by the organization commander or by other
        personnel as determined within the organization.
        2.1.2. Appoint individuals other than the organization monitor or alternate to receive,
        issue and turn-in items assigned a Controlled Item Code (CIC) “R” (fine precious metals
        or high precious metal content) if these items are used by the organization.
     2.1.3. Appoint, in writing, individuals to harvest silver flake/sludge from electrolytic units
     and/or to change silver recovery cartridges if used by the organization.
        2.1.4. Furnish a copy of all appointment letters to the installation PMRP manager.
     2.2. Organization Monitor’s Responsibilities.
        2.2.1. Attend initial Block IIB training provided by 52 LRS Flight Service Center upon
        appointment and provide initial training to shop monitors assigned. Training provided to
        shop monitors will be documented and maintained in the organization monitor’s PMRP
        record/continuity book.
        2.2.2. Establish turn-in containers for each Precious Metal Indicator Code A, C, G, P, S,
        U and V. The PMIC will be clearly marked on the outside of each container. When the
        materiel accumulates, the Flight Service Center will be contacted for preparation of the
        DD Form 1348-1A. After documentation is obtained, the customer can turn-in the
        materiel to TMO for transfer to DRMO.
        2.2.3. Use Spangdahlem Form 9 for the PMRP. Self-inspections will be performed
        semi-annually in March and September in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI)
        90-201, Spandahlem Air Base Instruction (SABI) paragraph 1.2.3 .
SPANGDAHLEMABI23-101 11 MAY 2011                                                                3


       2.2.4. Ensure proper handling, accountability, safeguarding, and security of high
       precious metal content items assigned CIC “R” and silver flake/sludge and silver
       recovery cartridges.
       2.2.5. When harvesting silver flake/sludge from electrolytic units or replacing recovery
       cartridges/cores, both the person performing the harvesting and a disinterested witness
       will verify weights and document the weight on the disposal turn-in document (A5J).
       2.2.6. Ensure organization work centers who generate precious metal bearing-scrap and
       use precious metal items, collect and turn-in materiel promptly to prevent/minimize the
       possibility of theft.
       2.2.7. Maintain a record/continuity book for the organization recovery program. The
       book will contain the following items:
          2.2.7.1. TAB A: Monitor’s appointment letter. Documentation of organization and
          shop monitor’s training (if applicable).
          2.2.7.2. TAB B: AFMAN 23-110 Vol 6 Ch 4 (stamped “for reference use only”),
          operating instructions (if applicable) and a copy of this instruction.
          2.2.7.3. TAB C: Copies of self-inspection reports generated with Spangdahlem Form
          9 and PMRP manager semi-annual inspection report.
          2.2.7.4. TAB D: One-for-one swap log for CIC “R” National Stock Numbers.
          2.2.7.5. TAB E: Turn-in control log for silver flake/sludge harvested from
          electrolytic units turned in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office by troy
          weight.
3. Identification of Precious Metals:
   3.1. Bench Stock Items. Organizational bench stock listing (S04) notes the PMIC assigned
   to an item. Bench stock bin labels for items containing precious metals will be highlighted in
   blue for identification. This will identify to the user which scrap bin to place the used items
   in.
   3.2. Recoverable PMICs for items issued to the customer (issues and due-out-releases).
   Assignment of a recoverable PMIC will cause the appropriate phrase to appear on all issue
   documents (DD Form1348-1A). This phrase will identify the type of precious metal
   contained in an item. The appropriate phrase will also appear on the Standard Asset
   Tracking System label. For example “SILVER”, “GOLD”, “PLATINUM”, “COMBO
   SILVER/GOLD/PLATINUM”, “PRECIOUS METALS UNKNOWN”, “PRECIOUS
   METALS VARY”, or “NO PRECIOUS METALS” will appear on the label. All
   organizations using items with a recoverable PMIC assigned are tasked with recovery of
   these items.
4. Scrap Materiel.
   4.1. Each organization/work center will have containers available for collection of precious
   metals bearing scrap. Separate containers are required for each PMIC.
   4.2. Non-precious metal scrap will not be placed in containers designated for precious metals
   scrap. Non-precious metal containers will be marked with PMIC A.

     4.3. Scrap Materiel Turn-In. Condemned XB3 precious metals items that do not retain their
     identity after use (used/unserviceable) will be segregated from other scrap and processed to
     DRMO under the PMRP. Upon turn-in, each recoverable PMIC will require a separate DD
     Form 1348-1, DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document (see Attachment 3). Turn-in
     document will be made by the Flight Service Center using an off-line (do not post) DD Form
     1348-1. The Flight Service Center will forward a copy of the signed DD Form 1348-1 to the
     organization monitor for coordination of turn-in to Traffic Management Office/processing to
     DRMO.
