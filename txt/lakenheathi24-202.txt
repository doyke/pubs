SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision changes 48 LGRTC (Cargo Movement Section) to 48 LGRDC (Cargo Movement Section)
throughout.


1. Definition of Types of Containers.
   1.1. Container. Any receptacle used to enclose and afford maximum protection to government prop-
   erty during storage and shipment.
   1.2. Reusable Container. A specially designed container that is engineered for repeated use without
   impairment of its protective function. The reusable container is intended to be used, saved and reused
   as a complete system, excluding the wrap or barrier material. These containers are marked “Reusable
   Container, Do Not Destroy.
2                                                               LAKENHEATHI24-202 10 JULY 2008


       1.2.1. Category I Container. Container is usually made of metal, plastic, synthetic, or composite
       materials fabricated to ensure a minimum of 100 trips.
       1.2.2. Category II Container. Container is usually made of plywood, wood, or fiberboard. It can
       be identified by military federal specification number. It is constructed to withstand a minimum of
       10 trips.
       1.2.3. Discrete Special Packaging Instruction Container. This container is a specially designed
       reusable container for a particular commodity. This will be identified on the exterior of the con-
       tainer by Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) number, i.e. SPI 080-6214.
       1.2.4. Fast Pack. Families of standard size reusable containers whose design permits shipment of
       a large variety of items within certain limits of size, weight, and fragility.
       1.2.5. Standard Pack. Packs for which the packaging components including the shipping con-
       tainer, have been standardized as to material and size. The cushioning in the Standard Pack is not
       bonded to the interior container walls.

2. Reimbursements and Transfers of Funds.
    2.1. Due to the high maintenance costs and depleted inventory levels, requirements to provide reus-
    able containers or materials to construct containers, including all packaging costs incurred, are subject
    to reimbursement or prior transfer of funds to purchase materials before shipment turn-in to 48 LRS/
    LGRDC (Cargo Movement Section). All associate units and host wing units with unforecasted unique
    requirements will be required to compensate the Cargo Movement Section for services rendered using
    information from completed AF Form 451, Request for Packaging Service, prescribed by AFI 24-203,
    Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo (can be ordered/printed at www.e-publishing.af.mil).
    Reimbursements will be tracked monthly and reported quarterly for fiscal purposes to accounting and
    finance and the unit accruing the cost.

3. Reusable Container Program Responsibilities.
    3.1. 48th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander.
       3.1.1. Provides guidance and support to Base Reusable Container Program Monitor to ensure pro-
       gram success.

       3.1.3. Monitors quarterly program statistical analysis report to ensure compliance of minimum
       standard of 90 percent turn-in rate (see Attachment 2). If turn-in rate is below 90 percent, initiate
       a letter addressed to the appropriate Unit Commander for corrective action.
    3.2. Wing Reusable Container Monitor.
       3.2.1. Manages the overall Wing Reusable Container Program. Administration of the program
       will be accomplished through the NCOIC, Packing and Crating, and his/her designees.
       3.2.2. Provides guidance and training to all Unit Reusable Container Monitors as required.
       3.2.3. Tracks program’s container usage/non-usage by squadron (see Attachment 3), and recov-
       ers costs of packaging materials as appropriate (see Attachment 4).

      alternates appointed) to represent the unit on all matters pertaining to the base reusable container
      program. The unit program monitors must be in the rank of SSgt or above.

       monitor.

       be made to keep that item with that container.
    4.2. Other Units.

       immediately re-used, the unit reusable container monitor should be contacted so that the container
       can be properly stored. When containers are turned in for unit storage, all internal packaging mate-
       rials should be maintained with that container.
