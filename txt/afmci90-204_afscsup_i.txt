                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes the roles and responsibilities to ensure Air Force
Materiel Command provides effective stewardship of the nuclear enterprise. This instruction
provides a framework for AFMC to efficiently and effectively manage, control and integrate all
functions of the Air Force nuclear enterprise for which it is responsible. This instruction also
captures AFMC organizational equity in the nuclear enterprise.
     1.1.1. AFMC manages the people, organizations, processes, procedures and systems used to
     conduct, execute and support nuclear deterrence operations within the command. Included
     are infrastructure and life-cycle activities for nuclear weapons, delivery platforms and
     supporting systems; intellectual and technical competencies; and the cultural mindset that
     ensures sustainable, responsive, safe, secure and effective Air Force nuclear systems. In
     addition, it includes development and adherence to nuclear policy and guidance, and
     relationships with other entities who contribute to the Nation’s nuclear deterrence mission.
     AFMC's nuclear responsibilities cut across all centers. Every decision by program managers,
     testers, maintainers and others has a potential impact on nuclear surety.
     1.2. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The command will organize, train and equip
     to execute the life-cycle management support functions necessary to acquire, modernize and
     sustain nuclear systems and their support systems.
        1.2.1. AFMC has two substantial responsibilities in the nuclear arena. First, AFMC has a
        special nuclear support mission as a stockpile manager for active, inactive and retired
        nuclear resources. Second, as a provider of worldwide life-cycle support for systems and
        products, AFMC is the vital “first link” in nuclear surety and accountability.

integration of affordable warfighting technologies for aerospace forces. Controls the Air Force
Science and Technology budget plus additional monies from customers. Manages Technology
Directorates and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in the execution of Science and
Technology Programs. Determines the investment strategy for the full spectrum of Air Force
science and technology activities. Conducts basic research to ensure continued technological
superiority; develops and transitions new technologies for Air Force weapon systems and their
supporting infrastructure; and ensures responsive technical support to time-urgent problems.
   3.4.1. AFRL will:
       3.4.1.1. Act as the Air Force S&T honest broker by providing SMEs as needed to assist
       the nuclear community (i.e., AFMC, AFSC, AFLCMC, etc.) with planning and
       programming decisions related to current and planned systems/concepts.
       3.4.1.2. As requested, assist AFSC and AFMC by conducting Integrated Planning to
       analyze their ability to meet nuclear operational requirements. This Integrated Planning
       and Programming Process identifies operational capabilities each MAJCOM and CFLI
       must provide current and future warfighters, assesses the ability of current and planned
       systems to accomplish those requirements and then identifies shortfalls between what the
       warfighter is requesting and what the MAJCOM can provide. These shortfalls are
       commonly referred to as Capability Gaps.
       3.4.1.3. Assist Product Centers, working with industry and the greater S&T
       communities, to identify potential capabilities and/or processes to solve nuclear
       shortfalls. Often, implementation of new capabilities (i.e., acquisition of new systems),
       will require maturation of S&T state-of-the-art. These areas where S&T must be matured
       referred as Capability Gaps and S&T Needs. These Capability Gaps and S&T Needs are
       vetted through the CFLI CFMP Process for prioritization across the near, mid and far
       term and are provided to AFRL through the annual publishing of CFMPs by CFLIs, and
       through Applied Technology Councils accomplished in accordance with AFI 61-101,
       Applied Technology Council.
       3.4.1.4. Collaborate with the Nuclear Community following delivery of nuclear
       Capability Gaps and S&T Needs to identify potential S&T Solutions/Technology Risk
       Reduction efforts to provide the nuclear community with increased and better technology
       options for modernization of the nuclear force structure. These Solutions and Risk
       Reduction efforts may become S&T projects that AFRL initiates after approval and
       funding is secured through AFRL’s S&T Integrated Planning and Programming process
       with looks at all AF S&T requirements. Some Solutions/Risk Reduction efforts may be
       proposed as candidate Advanced Technology Demonstrations, Flagship Capability
       Concepts, or Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations which require approval by
       their respective governing bodies.
3.5. Air Force Test Center (AFTC). Conducts Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) of
air, space, and cyber systems to provide timely, objective, and accurate information to decision
makers. Provides a national aerospace ground test complex to conduct preflight tests,
engineering analyses, and technical evaluations for research, system development, and
operational programs of the Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD), other government
agencies, industry, and allied nations. Accomplishes authorized airframe, power plant, and

               NUCLEAR PROFESSIONAL CONTINUING EDUCATION

A3.1. Background. It is imperative that AFMC personnel be properly trained to meet AFMC’s
major responsibilities to develop and sustain our nuclear deterrent capability. To achieve this
objective, AFMC in 2004 established the Command’s Nuclear College within the AFNWC to
educate senior leaders and practitioners in maintenance or mission support activities (e.g.,
security or protection) involving nuclear surety programs, nuclear certification or related
organizational planning, requirements and funding advocacy. In 2013, this responsibility has
been transferred to Air University’s Counterproliferation Center Operating Location (AU/CPC-
OL) at Kirtland AFB, NM as part of the Air Force’s Nuclear Professional Continuing Education
Program.
A3.2. The Air Force Nuclear Professional Continuing Education (NPCE) Program
Curriculum. The NPCE curriculum supports two major areas: nuclear management-related
education and AF nuclear certification process related education, both with core and executive
courses. The nuclear management-related courses follow: AF Nuclear Management Executive
Seminar and the Air Force Nuclear Fundamentals Course (Nuclear 200), Advanced Nuclear
Concepts Course (Nuclear 300) and Senior Leader Nuclear Management Course (Nuclear 400).
The AF nuclear certification process-related courses follow: Nuclear Certification Process
Executive Course; Nuclear Certification Process Core Course; Nuclear Certification Process
Computer Based Training (CBT) Web-based Course; Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) Users
Course and NCE Users Course CBT.
   A3.2.1. The AF Nuclear Management Executive Seminar (NMES) is a road-mobile
   seminar aimed at Headquarters AFMC Directors, Division Chiefs and other staff personnel
   supporting nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems product support, logistics,
   maintenance and operations activities within the command. This seminar is meant to increase
   nuclear enterprise awareness among headquarters staff personnel and is tailored to AFMC
   nuclear support operations and program office environments. This seminar is a half-day
   course conducted at Headquarters AFMC. It can also be presented at ALC/SPO or other
   AFMC organizations/locations that support, acquire, sustain and maintain nuclear certified
   systems upon request. Requests for the AF NMES MTT will be coordinated AU/CPC-OL
   Course Manager. This seminar is not intended to replace the Nuclear 200-400 curriculum,
   but rather serves as a high level review of the nuclear enterprise.
   A3.2.2. Nuclear Fundamentals Course (Nuclear 200). This course is aimed at AF
   personnel involved with nuclear enterprise operations at unit, group, wing, NAF, MAJCOM,
   Air Staff or COCOM organizations. This four day in-residence course is designed to enhance
   awareness among Airmen of the USAF nuclear mission. The course covers nuclear weapon
   fundamentals, force structure, nuclear stockpile guidance and planning, the DoD/AF nuclear
   surety program, the nuclear community, and current issues related to the USAF’s nuclear
   mission. The focus of this course is an 'overview' of the entire nuclear enterprise for
   individuals that have completed at least one operational nuclear assignment and will stay
   core nuclear for most of their career, support function/Air Force Specialty Codes assigned to
   nuclear support positions, or are assigned to a nuclear unit in a supervisory or commander
   position and this is their first nuclear mission assignment. Who Should Attend: Airmen
   (military/civilian) identified as core nuclear E6-E7, O3-04, Civilian grades GS 9-12; Airmen
AFMCI90-204_AFSCSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         45


  in support roles/non-core nuclear billets assigned to a nuclear unit/job for the first time in a
  supervisory or decision making role E7-E9, O3-O6, Civilian equivalents. Attendance is
  controlled by MAJCOM quota allocations.
  A3.2.3. Advanced Nuclear Concepts (Nuclear 300). The focus of this course is for
  individuals who are at the 9+ year point working in the nuclear enterprise. They are ‘core
  nuclear’ and going to a position where they will be setting nuclear policy, procedures, etc.
  within their functional areas. Normally at the NAF Division Chief level, MAJCOM Branch
  Chief level or HAF/Joint O-4 AO level or higher. Also, for nuclear Air Force Specialty
  Codes Sq/CCs that for some reason have not attended before selection for command. Who
  Should Attend: E8-E9, O4-06 NAF/MAJCOM/HAF AOs;                            O-4/O-5 Squadron
  Leadership, civilian equivalents (grades 12-15). Attendance is controlled by MAJCOM quota
  allocations.
  A3.2.4. Senior Leader Nuclear Management (Nuclear 400). The focus of this course is
  for senior leaders who are either: working internal to the nuclear enterprise and are usually
  post Sq/CC command in an O-6 level HAF/MAJCOM 3 letter billet or E-9 in similar
  functional expert billet or; Flag Officers and SESs that have nuclear responsibilities
  anywhere in their portfolio of responsibilities. Who Should Attend: GOs/SES with nuclear
  portfolios; NAF/MAJCOM/HAF Directors O-6/O-9/civ equivalents. Attendance is controlled
  by AETC/A10 and is by invitation. Nominations for attendance are processed through
  AFMC/A10.
  A3.2.5. Nuclear Certification Process-related Education. IAW AFI 63-125, Nuclear
  Certification Program, AF personnel who are involved with acquiring, developing,
  modifying, managing or using nuclear certified equipment or weapon systems are required to
  receive training in the nuclear certification process. This is AF-directed requirement is
  managed jointly by AFNWC and AU/CPC-OL. AU/CPC-OL has developed courses that
  provide AF personnel with essential knowledge of the nuclear certification process and
  management of nuclear certified equipment management requirements throughout all phases

                         NUCLEAR SUPPORT FUNDING PROCESS

A4.1. Nuclear Support Profile. Support for nuclear weapons requires the integration of several
sources of funding. Nuclear surety standards dictate that senior-level management oversight
priority is provided to nuclear support budget requirements. It is essential that the correct funding
source is used for each requirement and that all requirements identified to meet the Planning,
Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) milestones through the established processes
are properly presented and advocated to MAJCOM leadership. A graphic portrayal of the nuclear
support funding depicts the complexity of multiple sources of programming efforts and types of
funding (Figure 5.1).
