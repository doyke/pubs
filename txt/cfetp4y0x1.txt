Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. In addition, the CFETP
provides personnel a clear career path to success. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated
positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts supervisors use to plan, manage, and control training within
the specialty.

2.1. Part I: Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
provides general information; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties
and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each skill
level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other);
Section D indicates resource constraints; and Section E identifies transition training guide
requirements.

2.2. Part II: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties,
tasks technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
conducted training, core and critical tasks, and correspondence course requirements. Section B
contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors use to determine if Airmen
satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials (i.e. Qualification
Training Packages); Section D identifies the training course index supervisors can use to
determine resources available to support training. Included in Section D are both mandatory and
optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors
can use to determine additional training required for associated qualification needs. At the unit
level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate
with the overall goals of this plan. Documentation of training is outlined in section F via the use
of the Air Force Training Record (AFTR); this section outlines the format and documentation
necessary to maintain an AFTR.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective
and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables us to train
today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

5. Skill/Career Progression. (Ref. Figures 8.1 - 8.3) Adequate training and timely progression from
the apprentice to the superintendent level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to
accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training does their part to plan,
manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP
will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in his or her career.

5.1. Apprentice 3-Skill Level. After completing initial skills training, an apprentice works with
qualified assistants and dentists to enhance his or her knowledge and skills. The apprentice will enter
UGT using the CDCs and QTPs to progress in the career field. Minimum training times will be 12
months for normal UGT and 9 months for retrainees. Primary emphasis in training should be on
chair-side assisting and dental radiology. Tasks taught during initials skills training and performed
on the job will be evaluated at the member’s first duty station. Individuals will participate in ongoing
dental continuing education programs to expand their knowledge and skills. Apprentices should
devote their full time to learning the specialty.

5.2. Journeyman 5-Skill Level. Journeymen may be assigned duties in various functional areas such
as general dentistry, dental specialty areas, dental radiology, preventive dentistry, and patient records
and reception. Duty position rotations are necessary to adequately train journeymen; however,
rotations should be managed to minimize disruption to patient services and treatment team stability.
Journeymen should strongly consider becoming nationally certified through the Dental Assisting
National Board and continue their education towards a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)
degree. Journeymen are eligible for special duty assignments such as instructor duty.

5.3. Craftsman 7-Skill Level. Craftsmen are expected to be knowledgeable and highly skilled in a
wide variety of patient treatment procedures and patient administration duties. They are the primary
trainers of those trainees working toward advancement to the 5- and 7-skill levels. In addition to
assisting in patient care, craftsmen must become knowledgeable on dental practice management as
they can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions. Minimum training times for
UGT to the craftsman 7-skill level will be 12 months for normal UGT and 6 months for retrainees.
Continued education through CCAF and higher degree programs is encouraged. TSgts who have two
years time in grade and who have attended the in-residence NCO Academy are highly encouraged to
complete the USAF SNCOA by correspondence.

5.4. Superintendent 9-Skill Level. Before attaining the 9-skill level, individuals must be SMSgt and
have attended the USAF SNCOA in-residence. A 9-skill level is expected to fill positions such as
dental clinic or dental laboratory superintendent. Additional training and experience in areas of
resource and personnel management should be pursued. Enrollment in higher degree programs is
appropriate.

6. Training Decisions. This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Dental Assistant Career Field. This
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. The

                                                   10
strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed
approach to training. The decisions regarding training within the 4Y0X1/H career fields were made
at the Dental STRT meeting, 3 March 2011 and 18 March 2011 with approval of changes done via a
virtual utilization and training workshop (U&TW) 24-28 April 2011.

6.1. An additional Training Decision meeting was held at the request of the new AFCFM to solidify
change requests. There were minor changes made to the CFETP. The changes have been identified
on an addendum to the original STRT document dated 3 March 2011.

7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of
basic military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of Applied Science
Degree. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:

7.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification training
consisting of the Basic Instructor Course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF instructors who
possess an associate degree or higher may be nominated by their school commander or supervisor for
certification as an Occupational Instructor.

7.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is
awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The college uses a competency based assessment
process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman,
Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager). All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

7.3. Degree Requirements. All Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. Prior to
completing an associate degree, the 5-skill level must be awarded and the following requirements
must be met:

                                                                                                                    Semester Hours

(A4/6) courses for CCAF degree requirements.

7.4. Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals
desiring to become an AETC Instructor must have a CCAF degree or be within one year of
completion (45 semester hours). A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Additionally, instructors must gain and retain
national certification through the Dental Assisting National Board.

8. All dental assistants are highly encouraged to attain national certification as a Certified Dental
Assistant (CDA) through the Dental Assisting National Board. National certification consists of
three examinations: Infection Control Exam (ICE), Radiation Health and Safety (RHS) and General
Assisting Examination. ICE and RHS examinations are administered to all dental assistants
attending the Dental Assistant Apprentice Course. Those graduates who pass both the ICE and RHS
during technical training will be exempt from set 4Y051A of the Dental Assistant Career
Development Course.

                                               PART II

Section A-Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes
beginning 3 Oct 12.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Attachment 4, Air Force Training Program Career Field
Education and Training, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1, the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TRs) necessary
for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, 7-skill level. TRs in the source summary are commercial
publications or other service publications that are essential for OJT and mission accomplishment and
are referenced by title throughout the STS. The unit OJT section will consolidate the requirements
for the unit they support and order publications through the medical group/clinic library activity.

2.2. Uses the numbers 5 or 7 in column 2A, to identify core tasks required for upgrade to the 5- and
7-skill levels respectively in the dental assistant specialty. Personnel must be trained on appropriate
core and duty tasks to complete upgrade training. Not all tasks require third party certification.
The symbol “X” in column 2B identifies critical tasks; these are the only tasks that require
third party certification.

2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems, if available, to document
technician qualifications. Task certification must show a certification or completion date.

NOTE: Trainers must (1) possess a 4Y0XX AFSC or DoD equivalent, (2) be qualified on the tasks
they will train, (3) be recommended by their supervisor, and (4) have completed the Air Force
Training Course. Certifiers must (1) be at least a SSgt or civilian equivalent, (2) possess a minimum
of 5-skill level, (3) have completed the Air Force Training Course, and (4) be trained and/or certified
on tasks they will certify. The certification official must be someone other than the trainer.
Licensed/credentialed healthcare providers may substitute as trainers and certifiers without attending
the Air Force Training Course. If the trainer is a licensed/credentialed provider, they may serve as
both the trainer and certifier.

2.4. Shows in column 4, formal training, correspondence course and QTP requirements. It also
shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the trainee as a result of training on the task
and career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. For a list of QTP volume numbers
and titles, refer to Section C. Note: Training codes in columns 4B2 and 4C2 reflected for 5 and 7-
skill levels indicate the information provided in the CDCs. These codes are not intended to reflect
the level required to satisfy OJT upgrade requirements.

2.5. Identifies qualification requirements. The proficiency code key indicates the level of training
and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.
                                                   19
2.6. Is used to document training in the Air Force Training Record. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force
Training Program, Chapter 6, Air Force On-The-Job Training Administration for further guidance on
documentation, transcribing, decertification, and recertification.

2.7. Is used as a performance standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go”
means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).

2.8. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) for the dental career field are developed at the USAF
Occupational Measurement Squadron, by dental SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their
career field. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development
team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study
references listed in the WAPS catalog. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard.

3. Recommendations. Identify inadequacies and recommend changes to this training standard
through channels at 937 TRG/TTS, 2931 Harney, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 or use the Customer
Service Information Line, DSN 420-1080 (Commercial 210-808-1080) to report your findings.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
task, or for a subject common to several tasks.
- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

Section E - MAJCOM Unique Requirements

7. There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements.

Section F - Documenting Training

8. The Air Force Training Record (AFTR).

8.1. The AFTR is an enterprise-wide custom training management system designed to replace the
paper-based training records system. It is the electronic equivalent of an Air Force Form 623 and
will be used by career fields within the Air Force Medical Service to document all training actions.
The AFTR allows training plans to be established by:


                                                  45
8.1.1. Career Field/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)

8.1.2 Duty position/team member.

8.1.3 Any group of tasks that require management, tracking, and documentation.

8.1.4 Trainee/trainer/certifier.

8.2. The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:

8.2.1. Master Task List (MTL). The MTL is a list containing all tasks that are to be trained in a work
center and is often broken out by specialty. The MTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and
III; AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and Qualification Training Packages (QTP). The supervisor
creates the MTL by selecting tasks from the Unit Task List (UTL) produced by the Unit Training
Manager and the STS.

8.2.2. Master Training Plan (MTP). The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks
within a particular duty position. The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Forms 797
and 1098 tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the MTP by assigning training times and methods
to tasks in the duty position. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and AFH 36-2235,
Volume 11, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training for
guidance in developing the MTP.

 8.2.3. Duty Task List (DTL). The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained on in a duty
position. The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks;
and QTPs. The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.

8.2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR). All training is documented in the ITR. This is the
electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder. The ITR is made up of
the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the Job
Qualification Standard (JQS). This record is automatically populated based upon the duty position
the individual is assigned to. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, for guidance in
documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR. Maintenance of the CFETP is
mandatory for all MSgts and below assigned to dental facilities.

8.2.4.1. The AFTR provides the capability to incorporate training source documents and/or to
manually enter completed training into the ITR. The following documents will be incorporated into
the ITR:

8.2.4.1.1. The member’s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.

8.2.4.1.2. A copy of career field-relevant training certificates or certifications/licenses, such as dental
short course certificates, Dental Hygiene License, or Certified Dental Assistant/Certified Dental
Laboratory Technician certifications.

8.2.4.1.3. Recurrent training such as BLS, HIPAA, and RSV training.


                                                    46
8.2.4.1.4. AF Form 2096, Classification On-The-Job Training Action.

8.2.4.1.5. AETC Form 156, Student Training Report. AETC Form 156 documents the level of
success, strengths, and weaknesses that a student demonstrated during technical school. It is emailed
to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her duty station. This form is
maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.

8.2.4.1.6. AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluation. AF Form 803 is used to conduct and document
completion of task evaluations during training site visits, when directed by the commander, or when a
task certification requires validation.

8.2.4.1.7. Other forms as appropriate.

Section G - Samples of ITR Documentation

9. The following are sample forms available in AFTR to document enlisted training.

9.1 AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. The AF Form 797
(Figure 9-1) will be used to document training for tasks that are not otherwise documented in the
CFETP.

20 Jan 2007 TSgt John Doe is assigned to the Dental Squadron on this date. I have been assigned as
his supervisor and trainer and will orient TSgt Doe to the squadron using the Dental Squadron
Orientation checklist, dated 20 May 06, located in the Master Training Plan. An initial interview was
accomplished on this date. TSgt Doe currently has no disqualifiers that would delay his
orientation/training. TSgt Doe stated that his goals during the orientation process were to learn as
much as possible and to question the trainers when he was not clear as to the training provided. TSgt
Doe seems to be very enthusiastic about working in the Clinical Dentistry Flight and has expressed
his desire to take on any challenges that the trainers have to offer. An initial evaluation was
conducted. Additional training is needed to meet the work centers position task qualifications. The
training plan for TSgt Doe has been adjusted to accomplish this training. [Or] TSgt Doe was
previously qualified on required work center tasks. These qualifications will be re-verified prior to
release from unit orientation.

                                 (Trainee Orientation)

[Date] AB Susan B. Anthony is entering upgrade training to the 5-skill level effective this date. She
has been briefed on the On-The-Job Training (OJT) Program and how she fits into the program while
in upgrade training (UGT). Upgrade training was explained as a dual-channel process designed to
qualify an Airman for skill level upgrade. Dual-channel OJT is a systematic reportable application of
self-study and the craftsman/apprentice principle. Trainees acquire job qualification while
performing on the job under supervision. This combination, knowledge and job position qualification
constitutes the dual-channel concept. Requirements from AFI 36-2101 and 36-2201 were covered.
AF Forms 623, 623A, 797, 2096, and the CFETP, STS/JQS or automated JQS, which serves to make
up the individual training record, were explained. Responsibilities of the commander, base training,
unit education and training manager (UTM), immediate supervisor, trainer, and trainee were
discussed. The career development course (CDC) was briefly discussed and will be explained in
detail when the CDC arrives. Requirements for upgrade to AFSC 4Y051 are: (1) satisfactory
completion of CDC 4Y051 A&B (2) satisfactory completion of all appropriate skill level core and
duty related tasks; and (3) supervisor recommendation for upgrade. Each Airman in grades E-1
through E-7 has an AF Form 623, and CFETP or JQS. The CFETP or JQS contains most duty
related tasks and should be annotated to show training has or is occurring in those tasks the Airman is
required to perform in his/her current duty position, all mandatory upgrade requirements, and core
task requirements. In the CFETP, the trainer, trainee, and certifier (as applicable) have a space to
initial when training is completed. After upgrade, the CFETP or JQS will continue to be used to
document further qualification training.
