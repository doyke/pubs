2.4. (Added) The Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (eQip) is used at
Maxwell AFB and Gunter Annex by all units supported by 42d Air Base Wing Information
Protection Office. When an individual reaches the 6 month window, or needs to upscope their
security clearance, the unit security manager will submit an AF Form 2583, Request for
Personnel Security Action, to 42 ABW/IP through the 42 SFS/S5R and 42 MDG, if a military
member. This notifies the authorized requestor to establish a shell through eQip. Individual is
then notified by security manager and proceeds to complete form. Once the eQip form is
completed, unit security manager will review it for errors. If correct, individual will print out
Archival Copy and Signature pages. Individual will release package and then sign forms in front
of unit security manager. The unit security manager will maintain this eQip package until they
are notified by 42 ABW/IP. The unit security manager will then bring entire package to 42
ABW/IP for submission.
3.11.1.4. The unit security manager must make a copy of an initial eQip package and retain in a
personnel file until investigation is complete. 42 ABW/IP will return the completed AF Form
2583 to the security manager to be retained in the individual’s personnel file until investigation is
completed.

7.9.5.5.1. (Added) The unit security manager is responsible for reviewing and printing their
unit’s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) roster, on a monthly basis to check for
personnel requiring periodic reinvestigations (PR). When personnel are improperly matched to a
security access coded position (for example, individual has a Secret clearance and is in a top
secret coded position) or personnel whose clearance eligibility shows as either unknown or
invalid, the security manager is responsible for correcting these problems within their unit as
quickly as possible.
8.2.1.1.3. (Added) Commanders/Staff Agency Chiefs/1st Sergeants are responsible for
notifying 42 ABW/IP prior to an individual being discharged “for cause” or for an unfavorable
