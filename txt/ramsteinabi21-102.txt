   discrepancy, “Suspected/Actual FOD to Engine #.” Notify MOC, stop all maintenance on
   the affected engine, and do not continue until authorized by the 86 MXG/CC or designated
   representative with concurrence of the Safety Investigation Office, wing FOD monitor, or
   QA. Note: 721 AMXS will follow established procedures outlined in their applicable
   operation instructions.
   27.6. For an engine bird strike, enter a “Red-X” in the AFTO Form 781A with the
   discrepancy, “Suspected/Actual Bird Strike Damage to Engine #.”
   27.7. Perform a hardware accountability inspection on the applicable aircraft, engine and
   components receiving FOD or suspected FOD damage.
   27.8. The following paragraphs (27.8.1-27.8.3) pertains to 86 AW assigned aircraft:
      27.8.1. If confirmed engine FOD, the appropriate impound authority will impound the
      engine and propeller and notify the MXG/CC, OG/CC or their representative of the
      incident. The aircraft should only be impounded if the FOD damage is not isolated to the
      engine. The propeller will remain impounded until Safety determines that it can be
      released with concurrence of the impoundment official and or the impoundment
      authority.
      27.8.2. Once it has been determined the damage is limited to the engine, the engine with
      propeller assembly may be removed with the authorization of the 86 MXG/CC or
      designated representative with concurrence of the Safety Investigation Office, wing FOD
      monitor, or QA.
      27.8.3. The impoundment official will develop an off equipment work package to
      document all maintenance and investigation findings discovered during inspection. The
      impoundment release authority will annotate on a locally generated form or in the daily
 18                                                    RAMSTEINABI21-102 16 JULY 2013


      summary record stating: “Investigation Complete. All corrective actions have been
      reviewed. Propeller/Engine released.” The release authority will sign the inspected by
      with a minimum signature and employee number and initial over the symbol.
   27.9. QA will secure the aircraft forms or engine work package for review.
   27.10. The Wing FOD monitor will initiate a FOD report and forward it to the AMC FOD
   manager within 24 hours of the incident. 721 AMXS FOD monitor will initiate reportable
   FOD report and forward to AMC FOD manager.
   27.11. With engine specialist assistance, the wing FOD monitor will inspect the damaged
   engine to determine if FOD entered the intake or material failure occurred internally. If there
   is no evidence of material failure, the aircraft and/or engine will be impounded.
   27.12. The impoundment official or other investigating office will interview personnel
   involved and take written statements, as necessary, of any recent action on the aircraft or
   engine to help determine the cause of FOD.
   27.13. The impoundment official or other investigating office will also inspect the aircraft
   and/or engine and associated equipment for missing hardware, panel, etc. to help determine
   the cause of the damage. Inspection areas should include, but not be limited to, cockpit
   areas, areas forward of the intakes, nose and main wheel well areas, top of the aircraft,
   shelter, aprons and taxiways.
   27.14. The chief of safety appoints an investigation officer for reportable FOD events under
   the provisions of AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation Reports, and controls all aspects of the
   investigation. The wing FOD monitor with QA assistance investigates FOD events not
   reportable under the provisions of AFI 91-204 with the assistance of engine specialists and/or
   propulsion flight.
28. FOD Prevention Incentive Program.
   28.1. The purpose of the wing’s FOD prevention incentive program is to recognize
   personnel for their participation in the prevention of FOD and to promote FOD prevention
   awareness. All awards are subject to change due to availability of gifts, sponsors, and
   adjustments implemented to the program. The awards are as follows:
   28.2. The Golden Bolt Award. The golden bolt will be placed monthly throughout the
   flightline and off-equipment areas. The placement of the bolt will be rotated through areas
       of responsibility to allow each participating squadron the opportunity to find the bolt at
   least once during the year.
   28.3. The FOD Poster of the Quarter Award. All personnel assigned to participating units
   may submit FOD posters. The poster must promote a strong FOD prevention message which
   may be hand-drawn or computer generated on 8½” x 11” white paper. If aircraft are depicted
   on the poster, they must be of the type locally assigned. Squadron FOD committee members
   will vote on the winning poster. Computer generated designs are acceptable and will be
   submitted along with the graphical file on disc or via e-mail. The designer of the winning
   poster will be recognized at the quarterly FOD meeting.
   28.4. The FOD Finder of the Quarter Award. Selections for this award are based on
   nominations submitted by supervisors, through their squadron FOD Monitors or alternates.
   Individuals submitted must have demonstrated exceptional FOD awareness and contributions
RAMSTEINABI21-102 16 JULY 2013                                                                19


   to the FOD prevention programs. If multiple submissions are made at the squadron level, the
   unit FOD representative will select the most deserving candidate for submission.
   Nominations will be in letter format with one nominee per letter. Nominations may be sent
   via, e-mail or FAX, or hand carried to the wing FOD monitor. Nomination letters must
   contain the nominee’s name, rank, organization, date of event, and a brief narrative.
   Nominations must be received by the wing FOD monitor prior to the last duty day of the
   quarter. The winner will be chosen by FOD committee members         by vote.
   28.5. FOD Unit of the Quarter. Plaque will be awarded to the unit achieving highest level of
   FOD prevention/awareness.
29. The 86 AW Squadron FOD Prevention Award.
   29.1. This award is based on the fiscal year calendar. It is awarded to the squadron that most
   significantly contributes to FOD awareness and prevention throughout the year. The
   following criteria will be taken in to consideration when selecting an award winner:
      29.1.1. The number of FOD Finder of the Quarter nominations.
      29.1.2. FOD Poster of the Quarter submissions.
      29.1.3. Significant foreign objects turned in to wing FOD monitor (may be photographs).
      29.1.4. Wing FOD monitor inspections pass rate (i.e. housekeeping, FOD walk follow-
      ups, vehicle, FOD board, etc.).
   29.2. The winning squadron will receive the 86 AW FOD plaque. The plaque will be
   presented during the last fiscal year quarterly FOD briefing by the 86 AW/CV.
