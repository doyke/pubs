This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting. It establishes procedures for the accounting of aircraft flying hours within
the 433D Airlift Wing. This instruction applies to the 433D Maintenance Group (MXG): Plans,
Scheduling and Documentation Office (PS&D) and the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC);
the 433D Operations Group (OG): 433D Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Current
Operations (433 OSS/OSO) and Aviation Resource Management (ARM); the 356th Airlift
Squadron (AS) Aviation Resource Management (SARM); and the 68th Airlift SARM. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision clarifies flying hour reconciliation processes and responsibilities in paragraph 2;
and has been updated to reflect updated publication formats.
1. Flying Hour Data Collection and Entry.
 2                                                             433AWI21-106 7 AUGUST 2013


     1.1. After the completion of each sortie generation, the aircraft commander will provide
     accurate and completed Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Forms 781, ARMS
     Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and AF Forms 4097, Aircraft Identification, to the
     MOC debriefer. Instructions for completing AF Forms 4097 are prescribed in AFI 11-2C-
     5V3, C-5 Operations Procedures, Chapter 12.
     1.2. The MOC debriefer will review the AFTO 781 and AF 4097 for completeness and
     identify any missing information or errors for immediate correction. Ensure that the pilot has
     initialed the AFTO 781 in the appropriated block (Block 38). Deliver both forms to the
     MOC.
     1.3. MOC will enter the AFTO 781 data into the Maintenance Information System (MIS)
     and deliver the AF 4097 to PS&D. Reconcile AFTO 781 data against MIS program
     report(s). Deliver a copy of the 781 and signed reconciled MIS report to Current Operations.
     Deliver the original AFTO 781 to the applicable SARM within 1 duty day or 24 hours of
     mission return to home station. Current Operations will maintain drop box in Command Post
     for debriefs occurring after normal business hours.
     1.4. PS&D will enter the AF 4097 data into the MIS. Use batch program 67034, Flying
     Hour Data Audit List, to verify that mission numbers and flight times are accurate. Also
     print a MIS 8038 (Option “Y”), Aircraft Flight Status Data, to verify the dates, mission
     numbers, flight times and landings. Correct any errors and file corrected copies. Original
     AF 4097s must be mailed to Tinker weekly.
2. Flying Hour Reconciliation.
     2.1. The SARM office(s) will validate all flying hours with training data prior to manual
     input or interface push to aviation resource management system during its post mission
     review according to AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, Paragraph 1.5.11.3.
     When differences occur in flying hour total time, the SARM(s) will contact Current
     Operations, PS&D and/or MOC, as required, for confirmation and correction(s) to be
     accomplished.
Note: The 433 OSS/OSO section is the OPR for tracking daily reconciliation of total flying
hours and sortie count and cumulative totals for the week/month to date. The OG Aerospace
Vehicle Utilization Monitor and the MXG Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Officer will also
compare and reconcile database entries daily.
     2.2. The 433 OSS/OSO will compute total flying hours accrued against the assigned aircraft
     mission(s) from the completed AFTO 781(s) and maintain the signed MIS reports for three
     months.
     2.3. The SARM office(s) will file the original 781, after input to ARM System database,
     with the Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office.
