This instruction implements a process to identify and monitor all contractor-occupied space on Tinker
AFB to ensure the efficient utilization of Air Force facilities and to ensure that no contracting actions are
implemented that are not supportable from a facilities perspective. This instruction applies to all
contracting actions (new, options, modifications, etc.) accomplished by Tinker AFB, other bases,
organizations, or military services who intend to have contractor personnel occupying space on Tinker
AFB, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the
AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s through the appropriate
functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

In order to reflect the base-wide applicability of this instruction, OC-ALC Form 534 has been replaced
by TINKERAFB Form 534. The form has had extensive revisions in order to designate a new office of
primary responsibility, reduce coordination requirements and to ensure that all necessary data elements
are captured. The text of the instruction has been revised to clarify previous ambiguities and to reflect
the changes to the Form 534 and its coordination and approval cycles.
1. General Information:
   1.1. Organizations and tenants requiring contractor services do not have the sole authority to
   commit Tinker AFB facility space to a contractor.       This commitment can only be made after
   proper coordination has been obtained in accordance with this Instruction.
   1.2. Organizations sponsoring contracts awarded by other bases or military services are required to
   notify those bases or military services of the requirement to follow this Instruction when contracts
   require space on Tinker AFB.

    1.3. Contractors are allowed the same amount of space as an Air Force organization providing the
    same function (same workload and staffing size).
    1.4. Contractor space allocations in administrative (i.e., office) areas must not exceed the base
    administrative space standard (110 square feet net organizational average) and must meet criteria
    outlined in AFH 32-1084. Square footage occupied by contractors will be included in sponsoring
    organization’s space reports.
    1.5. Contractor personnel must abide by all Tinker AFB policies and operating instructions,
    including all energy conservation measures.
    1.6. Amount of contractor-occupied space must be validated and approved prior to contracting
    action.
    1.7. The assignment of space to be occupied by a contractor in performing the requirements of a
    government contract on a government owned installation are governed by the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation, Part 45.   This space is considered to be Government Furnished Real Property or
    facilities.
    1.8. As per AFH 32-9002 and 32-9007, the Installation Commander is responsible for managing all
    Real Property resources on Tinker AFB. 72 ABW has designated the TAFB Facilities Board and its
    Space Working Group (chaired by 72 ABW/CEAR) as its agent for review and disposition of
    contractor space requests.
2. Procedure:
    2.1. Organizations who sponsor contractors (host or tenant) are responsible for reporting
    contractor space requirements and shall:
       2.1.1. Complete a TINKERAFB Form 534, ―           Contractor Space Requirement,‖ and provide a
       floor plan showing the location of all contractors referenced in the form.
       2.1.2. Submit the completed TINKERAFB Form 534 and floor plan to their organizational space
       manager for coordination/approval. NOTE: The organizational space manager may require
       additional internal coordination (e.g., from facility managers in subordinate offices) prior to
       approving the form; it is the responsibility of the sponsoring organization to be aware of and
       comply with these requirements.
       2.1.3. Forward the completed TINKERAFB Form 534 and floor plan to the Facilities Board
       Space Working Group (SWG) after organizational space manager coordination has been
       obtained. The Facilities Board SWG will not review any contractor space requirements that
       have not been validated by the organizational space manager for the major tenant to which the
       sponsoring activity belongs.
       2.1.4. Include the coordinated TINKERAFB Form 534 in the contract requirements package and
       forward to the Contracting Officer.
       2.1.5. Provide copy of the coordinated TINKERAFB Form 534 to the Tinker AFB Property
       Administrator (72 CONS/PKP).
       2.1.6. Report any increase or decrease of contractor-assigned space made after contract award
       immediately to Facilities Board SWG.         This action is required throughout the life of the
       contract to ensure accuracy of base records.
    2.2. Organizational space manager shall:
TINKERAFBI32-534 11 MARCH 2009                                                                     3


     2.2.1. Research space resources available within their organization and determine if they can be
     used to support the requirement identified on the TINKERAFB Form 534 (NOTE: Even if the
     requirement can be supported with internal resources, the space assignment must be approved in
     advance by the Facilities Board). Recommendations for support should be attached to the
     TINKERAFB Form 534.
     2.2.2. Validate and recommend approval of contractor space requirement by coordinating on the
     TINKERAFB Form 534.
     2.2.3. Forward the completed TINKERAFB Form 534 and floor plan to the Facilities Board
     SWG for review, disposition, or referral to the Facilities Board.
  2.3. The Facilities Board Space Working Group shall:
     2.3.1. Review submitted TINKERAFB Forms 534 and determine appropriate disposition.
     Forms that do not involve new space requirements may be eligible for immediate approval by the
     SWG; new requirements will be forwarded to the Facilities Board for disposition.
     2.3.2. Analyze available space resources and make recommendations to the Facilities Board for
     support of contractor space requirements.
     2.3.3. Validate and approve contractor space requirement by coordinating on the TINKERAFB
     Form 534. 72 ABW/CEAR will coordinate on approved forms as chair of the SWG.
     2.3.4. Return the form to the requesting organization.
     2.3.5. If the Facilities Board SWG cannot come to a consensus, the topic/issue will be moved to
     the next step in the process, the Facilities Board – with any dissenting opinions from members.
     A dissenting opinion can be any disagreement a member has with the Facilities Board SWG
     recommendation.
  2.4. Contracting Officer shall ensure the coordinated TINKERAFB Form 534 has been obtained
  prior to completion of acquisition planning or final Request for Proposal (RFP) release.
