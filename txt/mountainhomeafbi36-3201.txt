1. General:
     1.1. A member of the unit will escort personnel being processed for involuntary separation
     (general discharge or below) to all processing agencies. As a minimum, a responsible person
     in the grade of Staff Sergeant, or higher than the person being separated, will escort that
     member.
     1.2. Unit escort will ensure the person completes all actions before reporting to the Military
     Personnel Section for out processing and, in those cases involving barment, will facilitate
     their immediate removal from the base.
