This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 44-1, Medical Operations, and
prescribes the Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Program (AFCDTP). It provides an update to
guidance previously found in AFI36-810, Substance Abuse Prevention and Control, 22 Jul 1994.
It assigns responsibility for carrying out the program at installation level. This instruction
applies to all Air Force Title 5 federal civilian employees, who work on Air Force, Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve Bases; and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) when in a civilian
status; and to tentative selectees for testing designated positions (TDP). This instruction does not
apply to Title 32 National Guard Dual Status and Non Dual Status Technicians, who are
regulated by National Guard Technician Personnel Regulations and applicable regulations
promulgated by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. The program covers full-time, part-
time and intermittent Air Force Title 5 civilian employees who are U.S. citizens paid from
appropriated funds (APF) and nonappropriated funds (NAF). It implements Department of
Defense Directive (DoDD) 1010.4, Drug and Alcohol Abuse by DoD Personnel; DoDD 1010.9,
DoD Civilian Employee Drug Abuse Testing Program; Executive Order (EO) 12564, Drug-Free
Federal Workplace. This instruction requires the collection and maintenance of information

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change defines the waiver authority for this Instruction. It updates the roles of the
installation commander and the MTF commander relative to appointment and supervision of the
Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager. Guidance on severity of disciplinary action for
drug use was clarified. References to sample notification letters for employees assigned to
testing designated positions (TDPs) were corrected. Guidance on Integrated Delivery System
responsibilities was modified to reflect that substance abuse prevention should be incorporated in
the IDS comprehensive, coordinated plan for integrating and implementing community outreach
and prevention programs, Drug Demand Reduction Program staff will work through the IDS to
provide substance abuse training. Guidance on reasonable suspicion testing was clarified.
Guidance on mishap testing was reworded for clarity and guidance on direct observation
collections was updated. Selected attachments are renamed for improved clarity. To ensure
consistency between Air Force Instructions, the definition of Safety Mishap in Attachment 1 was
changed by removing the reference to sending urine samples to the Air Force-designated,
SAMSHA-certified laboratory, and replacing it with a reference to AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, for further guidance. Guidance on testing designated positions for
appropriated fund and non-appropriated fund civilian employees was consolidated into one
attachment that applies to both employee categories and is found in Attachment 2, Testing
Designated Positions. The previous Attachment 3, Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Civilian
Drug Testing Positions, was deleted. The wording in Attachment 6, Sample Letter – Employee
Notification of Drug Testing Resulting from an Accident or Safety Mishap, was changed to read
“…I have determined that your acts may have contributed to a safety mishap or accident…” to
prevent the assumption that the investigation has been completed. The titles of Attachments 4, 5,
and 6 were changed to improve clarity.

                                             Chapter 1

                   AIR FORCE CIVILIAN DRUG DEMAND REDUCTION

Section 1A—Program Policies

1.1. Overview.
     1.1.1. This instruction establishes Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Program (AFCDTP)
     objectives, policies, procedures, and implementing guidelines. The AFCDTP is designed to
     achieve a drug-free workplace, consistent with EO 12564 and 5 U.S.C. §7301.
     1.1.2. This instruction includes policies and procedures for providing assistance to
     employees with suspected or identified drug abuse problems, employee education and
     training, and the identification of illicit drug use through drug testing in conjunction with AFI
     44-120, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program and AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug
     Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program.
1.2. Air Force Policy Regarding Illicit Drug Use by Civilian Personnel.
     1.2.1. The Air Force, as a result of its national defense responsibilities, and the sensitive
     nature of its work, has a compelling obligation to eliminate illicit drug use from its
     workplace. Civilian employees of the Air Force must refrain from illicit drug use whether on
     or off-duty. Performing duties under the influence of illicit drugs adversely affects personal
     safety, risks damage to government property, significantly impairs day-to-day operations,
     and exposes sensitive information to potential compromise. Use of illicit drugs is
     inconsistent with the high standards of performance, discipline, and readiness necessary to
     accomplish the Air Force mission.
     1.2.2. The Air Force is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful
     accomplishment of the mission, and the need to maintain high employee productivity. The
     intent of the Air Force is to offer assistance to those civilian employees who need it, while
     sending a clear message that illicit drug use is incompatible with Federal service.

        1.4.7.9.1. The team consists of representatives of the ADAPT Program
        (Chairperson), the HRR, the individual’s supervisor, and other base agencies, as
        deemed appropriate.
        1.4.7.9.2. When requested by an employee, a rehabilitation team will convene to
        provide advice and assistance to supervisors and/or employees to facilitate counseling
        and/or rehabilitation efforts. During the course of counseling/rehabilitation,
        underlying issues may be identified, e.g., financial or family conflicts as well as
        problems in the work setting. Although the employee is ultimately responsible for
        his/her rehabilitation, the team may review the facts and make recommendations to
        the supervisor and/or employee. Such recommendations may include additional
        referrals, e.g., financial or family counseling, job training, work scheduling,
        reassignment and/or retirement options. When the employee has consented, in
        writing, to the release of confidential treatment information, the supervisor may
        request the team advice on the appropriateness of a treatment plan as well as whether
        the employee is making reasonable progress.
        1.4.7.9.3. Regardless of the referral and/or treatment options chosen, the employee
        remains solely responsible for his or her behavior. Assertions that the counselor
        failed to consider one or more of the above factors in making a referral will not
        constitute either an excuse for continuing to use illicit drugs or a defense against
        disciplinary action if the employee is identified for subsequent drug abuse.
     1.4.7.10. Unit Commander/Directorate
        1.4.7.10.1. Will appoint in writing a Trusted Agent who:

               punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or a
               Letter of Reprimand or similar administrative action (Letter of
               Admonishment, Letter of Counseling) for misconduct involving dishonesty,
               fraud, or drug abuse (including use, possession, or distribution). Prior to
               assigning an individual to serve as a Trusted Agent, the unit commander will
               review the individual’s Personnel Information File (PIF) or equivalent
               personnel record. Normally, misconduct, including drug abuse that occurred
               prior to entering active duty service in the Air Force should not be considered
               a bar to service as a Trusted Agent.
                 1.4.7.10.2.1.1.1. Commanders, on a case-by-case basis, make
                 determinations as to whether or not conduct is/was dishonest and/or
                 fraudulent, and may make exceptions to the rule articulated in paragraph
                 1.4.7.10.2.1.1 Commanders will receive advice from the servicing SJA in
                 situations in which it unclear as to whether past misconduct is disqualifying.

        Instruction. For either Downloaded Computer-Based Training or Live Training,
        commanders are responsible for designating a manager (Unit Training Manager or
        Ancillary Training Monitor) to track training and upload course completion data into
        Advanced Distribution Learning Services (ADLS) to ensure full credit. Each unit is
        responsible for providing an annual training report to the installation DDRPM by 31
        January for the previous calendar year with the number and percentage of new
        employees and new supervised trained, number and percentage of all supervisors
        trained, and the number and percentage of all employees trained. The Education and
        Training Flight should be involved in the process of meeting the requirements of this
        paragraph.

Section 1B—Scope of Testing

1.5. Applicability and Types of Testing.
   1.5.1. All specimens will be tested for evidence of consumption of drugs approved by the
   HHS for testing on an agency-wide basis. Drugs that are not on the panel of substances
   routinely tested for will be tested as requested on the chain of custody document with prior
   approval of AFMOA/SGHW. Prior to initiating reasonable suspicion testing, supervisors
   must receive the advice of the servicing SJA and servicing HRR.
   1.5.2. When conducting reasonable suspicion, post accident, or unsafe practice testing, the
   Air Force may have a urine specimen tested for any drug listed in Schedule I or II of the
   Controlled Substance Act. Decisions regarding testing for use of Schedule I or II controlled
   substances shall be made based on adequate evidence by the employee’s second level
   supervisor, after consultation with the servicing SJA and HRR.
   1.5.3. Types of Drug Testing
       1.5.3.1. Tentative Selectee Testing
          1.5.3.1.1. Includes all external applicants tentatively selected for assignment to TDP
          covered positions and current employees in a non-TDP tentatively selected for a TDP.
          Tentative selectees currently in a TDP within the federal or military services will not
          be required to take a drug test prior to moving to a new TDP.
              1.5.3.1.1.1. Vacancy announcements must contain a statement informing
              applicants that drug testing is a condition of employment. If vacancy
              announcements are not used, tentative selectees must be informed prior to
              finalizing the selection, and a written record of the notification must be
              maintained by the HRR and/or supervisor. In addition, each tentative selectee
              will be notified that appointment to the position will be contingent upon the
20                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


           receipt of notification that the specimen did not reveal evidence of illicit drug use.
           1.5.3.1.1.2. The Air Force will decline to extend a final offer of employment to
           any tentative selectee with a MRO verified/validated positive test result for illicit
           drugs and action may be initiated to bar such person from future employment with
           the agency under procedures specified in the Office of Personnel Management
           (OPM) Regulations. Air Force objections to preference eligible’s that are based
           on the results of a MRO verified/validated positive pre-employment drug screen
           are considered medical disqualifications or passovers. These objections are
           referred to OPM for adjudication. They SHOULD NOT be processed as
           suitability cases. The HRR will notify the applicant that the employment is
           denied on the basis of failure to pass the drug testing requirement. For those APF
           employees tested after appointment, procedures in AFI 36-704, Discipline and
           Adverse Actions or AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program as
           appropriate, must be used to take appropriate administrative action. For NAF
           employees tested after appointment, procedures in AFMAN 34-310,
           Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Management and Administration must be used
           to take appropriate administrative action.           The provisions pertaining to
           rehabilitation as outlined in Section H of this plan do not apply since employment
           is conditional on satisfactory completion of a drug test.
        1.5.3.1.2. Notification of Tentative Selectees
        1.5.3.1.2.1. Applicants being considered for positions designated as TDP will read
        and acknowledge notice that a condition of employment shall be the participation in
        random drug testing. (See samples at Attachments 5 and 6). Upon final selection,
        the notice will be filed in the OPF and a copy may also be filed in the Supervisor's
        Employee Work Folder for APF employees or equivalent for NAF employees.
           1.5.3.1.2.2. Applicants will be provided specific notice as to when and where to
           report for actual testing. For post appointment testing, the sample notice at
           Attachment 12 may be used. For pre-appointment testing, an individual notice
           should be prepared to include information as to how to access the collection site
           including phone numbers and any instructions appropriate to someone unfamiliar
           with the installation.
        1.5.3.1.3. Timing of Drug Testing
           1.5.3.1.3.1. For tentative selectees located within reasonable travel distance of the
           employing activity, a urine specimen for drug testing must be collected within 48
           hours after the applicant accepts a tentative offer of employment and prior to
           actual appointment. A reasonable travel distance will be determined by the
           employing activity.
           1.5.3.1.3.2. For tentative selectees located beyond a reasonable travel distance
           from the employing activity, urine specimen collection for drug testing may be
           undertaken at a DoD collection site designated by the employing activity within
           72 hours of reporting for employment.
     1.5.3.2. Random Testing
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                        21


        1.5.3.2.1. The Air Force will randomly test employees in positions that have been
        identified by Civilian Personnel as TDP.
           1.5.3.2.1.1. Individuals whose specimen is MRO-verified as positive for the
           presence of an illicit drug without legitimate reason will immediately be
           temporarily reassigned and denied access to classified information. The
           employee must be removed from the TDP. However, following consultation with
           the SJA and HRR, the squadron commander equivalent or higher may in his/her
           discretion, and as part of an employee rehabilitation program, allows an employee
           to return to duty in a sensitive position if the employee's return would not
           endanger public health or safety or national security.
           1.5.3.2.1.2. The Air Force will randomly test civilian employees at a minimum
           rate consistent with guidelines established by ASD (HA). HQ AFMOA/SGHW
           will review drug testing utilization through reports generated from the drug
           testing laboratory.
               1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Frequency of testing will be no less than two times per month.
               Selection of test days will be randomized through use of the Air Force Drug
               Testing Program Software (AFDTPS). Exemptions from the use of this
               software must be approved by HQ AFMOA/SGHW. Frequency of random
               drug testing must conform to levels established by the DoD and AF and must
               be based on a percentage of the TDP end strength. Installations with less than
               24 TDP may test at less than two times per month as long as randomization
               and 100 percent Fiscal Year (FY) requirement is met.
           1.5.3.2.1.3. The DDRPM and DTPAM will ensure that the names selected under
           random selection, as well as the times and date(s) of the testing, are closely
           guarded to ensure confidentiality until the actual testing date(s).
           1.5.3.2.1.4. The DDRPM or DTPAM will notify the employee’s commander/
           directorate head or designated representative (trusted agent), who in turn will
           notify the employee’s immediate supervisor. The supervisor will notify the
           employee in writing of the requirement to provide a urine specimen. A sample
           notification letter is provided at Attachment 12.
               1.5.3.2.1.4.1. The supervisor will notify the employee of the requirement to
               provide a urine specimen within two hours of the time of notification.
               Notification shall occur on the same day the test is scheduled, no earlier than
               one hour prior to the scheduled starting collection time. The supervisor will
               explain to the employee that the employee’s name was selected randomly for
               urinalysis testing.
               1.5.3.2.1.4.2. If the individual(s) selected for testing is/are not available, the
               lowest level supervisor available annotates a copy of the notification letter
               with an indication of the individual(s)’s status (leave, TDY, non-duty day) and
               forwards the status and return to duty date back to the DDRPM. The DDRPM
               may require the notification letter be forwarded to the second level or higher
               supervisor to verify the individual(s)’s status. The appropriate supervisor
               returns a copy of the notification letter to the DDRPM or DTPAM with
22                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


               annotations indicating the individual(s) is in leave status, TDY, or non-duty
               day. The DDRPM or DTPAM enters the employee’s return date in the
               random drug testing software program and sends another selection notification
               on the first scheduled testing day after the employee returns to duty.
                 1.5.3.2.1.4.2.1. Occasionally, selection and notification for collection of a
                 urine specimen comes at a time when an employee is engaged in a mission
                 critical task. Commanders and directorate heads may defer notification of
                 selection until selected employees are no longer engaged in mission critical
                 functions. For employees who are improperly deferred, the DDRPM should
                 report the inappropriate deferral to the commander of the individual who
                 made the improper deferment for appropriate action.
                 1.5.3.2.1.4.2.2. Supervisors may defer testing for employees on leave,
                 TDY, or non-duty day on the day of testing but the first-level supervisor
                 must ensure the employee is tested on the first selection day after they return
                 to duty (see Attachment 12).
               1.5.3.2.1.4.3. An employee whose random drug test is deferred will be
               subject to urine specimen collection on the next selection day within one hour
               of his/her notification. The employee will not be notified of his/her selection
               for urine specimen collection until after his/her return to duty. The supervisor
               of an employee whose collection has been deferred will coordinate with
               DDRPM/DTPAM prior to notifying an individual selected for testing.
        1.5.3.2.2. The DDRPM, after consulting with the HRR, will establish procedures for
        the testing of geographically-separated employees, employees who work off-peak
        shifts (i.e. alternate duty schedules), and other unique situations not covered above.
            1.5.3.2.2.1. The DDRPM, after consulting with the HRR, will establish
            procedures (when necessary) for the testing of geographically-separated
            employees to include coordination as necessary with the DDRPM at another
            location to arrange for testing of employees who work at off-site duty locations.
     1.5.3.3. Reasonable Suspicion Testing
        1.5.3.3.1. Reasonable suspicion is a specific and fact-based belief that an employee
        has engaged in illicit drug use, and that evidence of illicit drug use is presently in the
        employee’s body, drawn from specific and particularized facts, and reasonable
        inferences from those facts. Employees in TPD positions may be tested based on a
        reasonable suspicion of illicit drug use on or off duty. Employees in non-TDP
        positions may be tested based on reasonable suspicion of on-duty drug use or
        impairment. If an employee is suspected of illicit drug use or in possession of drug
        paraphernalia, the appropriate supervisor will gather all information, facts, and
        circumstances leading to, and supporting this suspicion. Reasonable suspicion may
        be based on, but is not limited to, the following criteria:
            1.5.3.3.1.1. Direct observation of illicit drug use or possession and/or physical
            symptoms of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Physical
            symptoms are based on the behavior, speech, appearance, and body odors of the
            employee.
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                        23


            1.5.3.3.1.2. A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior consistent with the
            use of illicit drugs where no other rational explanation or reason for the conduct is
            readily apparent.
            1.5.3.3.1.3. Evidence of drug-related impairment supported by hearsay from
            identified or unidentified sources supported by corroboration from a manager or
            supervisor with training and experience in the evaluation of drug-induced job
            impairment.
            1.5.3.3.1.4. Recent arrest or conviction for a drug-related offense, or the
            identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illicit
            drug possession, use or trafficking.
            1.5.3.3.1.5. Information of illicit drug use provided either by reliable and credible
            sources or independently corroborated.
            1.5.3.3.1.6. Evidence the employee has tampered with or avoided a recent or
            current drug test.
        1.5.3.3.2. A supervisor in the employee’s chain makes the determination, after
        coordination with the SJA, as to whether reasonable suspicion exists in any given
        case. The supervisor will prepare a written memorandum in a timely manner to
        include, at a minimum, the appropriate dates and times of reported drug-related
        incidents, the reliable/credible sources of information considered (i.e., the rationale
        leading to the test). The supervisor’s determination that a reasonable suspicion
        urinalysis is warranted must be coordinated with a higher level supervisor within the
        functional chain of supervision, the HRR, and an attorney from the servicing SJA's
        office. Once complete, the written memorandum supporting the reasonable suspicion
        urinalysis will be maintained by the DDRPM’s office for at least two years.
        1.5.3.3.3. The supervisor will notify the employee in writing of the requirement to
        provide a urine specimen under direct observation, when appropriate under paragraph
        1.18.2. The notice to the employee should specify that the basis for the test is
        reasonable suspicion of illicit drug use. A sample notification letter is provided at
        Attachment 8.
     1.5.3.4. For all mishaps defined as Class A, B, or nuclear by AFI 91-204, employees will
     be subject to testing for evidence of illicit drug use if the member’s supervisor reasonably
     concludes an employee’s conduct may have caused or contributed to the mishap.
     .Supervisors should consult organizational medical, legal, and safety experts in making
     this determination.
        1.5.3.4.1. A supervisor in the employee’s chain of command will gather all
        information, facts, and circumstances leading to and supporting this determination.
        The appropriate supervisor will promptly detail for the record how the circumstances
        meet the criteria warranting testing. A written memorandum will be prepared to
        include, at a minimum, the appropriate dates and times of the mishap, mishap
        classification, and the reliable/credible sources of information, leading to the
        conclusion that the employee’s conduct may have caused or contributed to the
        mishap. This determination will be coordinated with a higher level supervisor in the
        functional chain of supervision, the HRR, and an attorney from the SJA's office. The
 24                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


          supervisor will notify the employee in writing of the requirement to provide a urine
          specimen. The notice to the employee should specify that it is a safety/mishap-related
          drug test. A sample notification letter is provided at Attachment 7.
          1.5.3.4.2. The supervisor and collection site personnel will coordinate urine specimen
          collection with appropriate Safety personnel.
          1.5.3.4.3. To the maximum extent possible, samples should be sent IAW AFI 91-204,
          Safety Investigations and Reports.
      1.5.3.5. Voluntary Testing
          1.5.3.5.1. Employees not in TDP may volunteer for unannounced random testing by
          notifying the HRR. The HRR must, in-turn, notify the DDRPM or DTPAM.
          1.5.3.5.2. Volunteers will be included in the pool of TDP subject to random testing
          and be subject to the same conditions and procedures as outlined in this AFI.
          1.5.3.5.3. An employee who volunteers for the random testing program will remain
          in the TDP pool until the employee withdraws from participation by notifying the
          HRR. Volunteers will remain in the TDP pool for the duration of the position which
          the employee holds, or until the employee withdraws from participation by notifying
          the program liaison (PL) of such intent at least 48 hours prior to being scheduled for a
          random test.
      1.5.3.6. Rehabilitation (Follow-up) Testing
          1.5.3.6.1. All employees referred for counseling or treatment for illicit drug use will
          be subject to unannounced testing for a minimum of one year from the time of
          initiated rehabilitation services.
          1.5.3.6.2. Frequency and duration of testing will be determined by the Civilian
          Rehabilitation Team or as stipulated in an abeyance (last chance) agreement.
      1.5.3.7. Consent Testing
          1.5.3.7.1. After consultation with the SJA, a supervisor may ask any civilian
          employee to consent to provide a urine specimen for drug testing at any time. The
          consent must be knowing and voluntary. An employee who consents to providing a
          urine specimen whose specimen tests positive for an illicit drug without a legitimate
          medical reason is not exempt from disciplinary actions as defined in the Safe Haven
          Provision, paragraph 1.28, of this AFI.
          1.5.3.7.2. Whether collection of the specimen will be by direct observation will
          depend upon consent of the employee. A sample consent letter for obtaining a
          consent urinalysis is provided at Attachment 15.
          1.5.3.7.3. Consent testing must be annotated on the chain of custody form in step 1
          under "Other."

Section 1C—Designation of Testing Positions

1.6. Designation of Testing Designated Positions (TDP).
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                        25


   1.6.1. Attachment 2 lists testing designated positions subject to random drug testing. These
   positions involve work that impacts national security, public health and safety, protection of
   life and property, or otherwise require a high degree of trust and confidence.
   1.6.2. The Air Force reserves the right to add and/or delete categories and types of positions
   in Attachment 2 based on applicable law and policy.

Section 1D—Employee Notifications

1.7. Notice to Current Employees.
   1.7.1. The HRR must ensure all employees receive written notice when assigned to a TDP.
   This notice is normally provided upon the selection or entrance on duty. For those
   employees who do not have a notice on file, one must be provided. An employee whose
   position is newly designated as a TDP, or who moves from a non-TDP to a TDP, must be
   provided the appropriate notice specifically identifying the position to which he/she is being
   assigned. For employees transferring from one TDP to another TDP, the HRR shall ensure
   notice is maintained on file and re-issue notice if it cannot be located.
   1.7.2. The HRR must ensure a specific written notice is given to each employee in a TDP no
   later than 30 days before an installation’s drug testing program commences. Employees who
   have an appropriate notification on file for the position they occupy need not be provided
   additional notification upon implementation of this plan since the 30-day advance notice
   period requirement has been satisfied. Random testing may continue without interruption. A
   sample acknowledgment for HRR use is provided in Attachment 4.
   1.7.3. Employees who are currently not subject to testing and are tentatively identified for
   placement in a TDP will be provided written notice before the action to place the employee
   into the TDP is finalized (See sample at Attachment 5). The employee will not be subject to
   random testing for 30 days from the date the notice of testing was acknowledged.
       1.7.3.1. Vacancy announcements, if used for internal placements, must include a
       statement informing employees that drug testing is a requirement of the position being
       filled. If a vacancy announcement is not used, candidates must be informed of the testing
       requirement prior to management making a final placement determination. Failure to
       include this statement in the vacancy announcement will not preclude internal applicant
       testing, if advanced written notification is provided to the applicant.
          1.7.3.1.1. To receive further consideration for the position, the employee must sign
          the notice and agree to submit to urinalysis testing (See sample at Attachment 6).
          1.7.3.1.2. If after receipt of the notice, the employee refuses to provide a urine
          specimen as requested, or if illicit drugs are detected through a verified/validated
          positive test result, he/she will be denied further consideration for the position.
          Current employees of the agency may be subject to disciplinary action, including
          removal, if warranted by the facts of the situation.
1.8. Contents of Notices.
   1.8.1. Written notification to employees informing them that a position is designated for
   random testing will include:
 26                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


      1.8.1.1. Notice that the employee’s position, or one into which the employee is
      tentatively identified for placement, is a TDP or is identified to be a TDP.
      1.8.1.2. Notice of the availability and procedures necessary to obtain substance abuse
      counseling and treatment.
      1.8.1.3. Information regarding the opportunity to submit medical documentation that
      may support legitimate use of a specific drug.
      1.8.1.4. For those employees newly subject to random drug testing, notice that the
      employee will have the opportunity to voluntarily identify himself/herself as a user of
      illicit drugs and to receive counseling or treatment during the 30-day notice period under
      the “safe haven” provisions in Paragraph 1.28, and that the employee will be subject to
      random testing no earlier than 30 days following acknowledgment of new position
      designation as TDP.
      1.8.1.5. Each employee in a TDP will acknowledge in writing that he/she has received
      and read the notice which states the employee's position has been designated for random
      drug testing and that refusal to submit to testing may result in disciplinary action, up to,
      and including removal.
1.9. Employee Signed Acknowledgment.
   1.9.1. Written employee notifications with signed statements acknowledging receipt by the
   employee will be forwarded by the HRR to AFPC for retention in the OPF.
   1.9.2. If the employee refuses to sign the acknowledgment, the employee’s supervisor and
   additional witness will document on the acknowledgment form that the employee received
   the notice and refused to sign. The notification will be forwarded by the HRR to AFPC for
   retention in the OPF. A copy may also be maintained in the Supervisor’s Employee Work
   Folder. An employee's failure to sign the notice will not preclude testing that employee, or
   otherwise affect the implementation or execution of this program.

Section 1E—Technical Guidelines for Drug Testing

1.10. General Considerations.
   1.10.1. The Air Force will adhere to scientific and technical guidelines for drug testing
   programs outlined by HHS consistent with the authority granted by EO 12564, and the
   requirements of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
   1.10.2. Air Force collection personnel will be trained in rigorous analytical standards,
   quality assurance requirements, and strict confidentiality requirements for urinalysis
   procedures.
   1.10.3. All civilian specimens will be tested at an approved HHS-certified laboratory.
   1.10.4. Unless covered by exception below, any individual subject to testing under this
   program will be permitted to provide urine specimens in private, in a rest room stall or
   similar enclosure, so that the employee is not directly observed while providing the sample.
   1.10.5. Same-gendered collection site personnel (DDRPM or DTPAM or other trained
   observer) will observe the individual providing the urine specimen when collection site
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                            27


   personnel have reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the
   specimen to be provided when the individual is being tested due to reasonable suspicion
   testing; accident or safety mishap testing; rehabilitation testing following a laboratory
   verified/validated result; the facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is an illicit
   drug user; facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is under the influence of drugs
   at the time of the test; the individual has previously been found by the agency to be an illicit
   drug user; facts and circumstances suggest that the individual has equipment or implements
   capable of tampering with or altering urine samples; the individual has previously tampered
   with a sample; or, the temperature of the urine specimen is outside the acceptable range as
   established by HHS.
1.11. The DDRPM or DTPAM.
   1.11.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM performs essential steps in conducting a urine specimen
   collection for drug testing as established in the HHS Mandatory Guidelines.
   1.11.2. A specimen collector is an AF representative who instructs and assists individuals at
   a collection site and who receives and makes an initial examination of the urine specimen
   provided by those individuals.
   1.11.3. DDRPMs and DTPAMs must meet the same job qualification requirements as
   delineated in AFI 44-120, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program. DDRPMs and
   DTPAMs will have received training in collecting urine specimens IAW the HHS Mandatory
   Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs.
   1.11.4. In the interest of integrity, a donor cannot perform the functions of the DTPAM
   regarding his or her own urine specimen. The supervisor of a donor cannot perform the
   functions of the DTPAM unless there is no feasible alternative, as determined by the
   commander, in consultation with the SJA. The roles of the DTPAM and observer will be
   conducted in a way as to maximize integrity of the collection process.
   1.11.5. When a collection must be performed under direct observation, the observer must be
   the same gender as the donor. There is no exception to this requirement.
       1.11.5.1. DDRP staff will ensure that the escort and/or observer receive the
       observer/escort briefing prior to testing. See Attachments 16 and 17 for observer and
       escort briefings, respectively.
1.12. The Collection Site.
   1.12.1. A collection site may be a permanent or temporary facility located either at the work
   site or at a remote site. The term “collection site” refers to the entire facility used to collect
   the urine specimen, that is, the rest room or toilet stall and the work area used by the
   DDRPM or DTPAM.
   1.12.2. A collection site must at a minimum:
       1.12.2.1. Allow the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen.
       1.12.2.2. Have a source of water or moist towelettes for washing hands with water only
       located outside of the immediate area (e.g., stall) used by employees to produce urine
       specimens. The donor shall be instructed to wash with water only and dry his/her hands
       prior to urination.
28                                                                    AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


     1.12.2.3. Have a work area for the DDRPM or DTPAM.
     1.12.2.4. Allow the DDRPM or DTPAM to restrict access to the site during the
     collection.
  1.12.3. Any of the following could be used to collect urine specimens provided the area can
  be arranged to satisfy the minimum requirements listed above:
     1.12.3.1. All types of restrooms (e.g., male or female, employee, doctor’s office,
     hospital, and clinic).
     1.12.3.2. Mobile facility (e.g., a vehicle with an enclosed toilet).
  1.12.4. The DDRPM or DTPAM’s work area should be located outside the restroom.
  1.12.5. To ensure security at a collection site while collections are being conducted, the
  following measures must be taken:
     1.12.5.1. Restrict access to only authorized personnel.
     1.12.5.2. Restrict access to collection materials/supplies.
     1.12.5.3. Prohibit unobserved entrance/exit to/from the site.
     1.12.5.4. Provide for secure handling/storage of specimens from collection until
     shipment. Security and specimen handling procedures may vary significantly depending
     on whether the collection site is at a permanent or temporary location. When the
     collection site is a permanent facility that is used primarily for collections, all materials
     and supplies are readily available and there will normally be cabinets, lockers, or
     refrigerators that can be used to secure specimens prior to shipment to the laboratory.
     Additionally, all records are maintained at the permanent site with appropriate copies of
     documents being sent to the laboratory, Air Force offices with appropriate need to know,
     and MRO. For temporary or remote collection sites, all supplies are brought to the site
     and then the site is returned to its original condition and normal use. In these cases, the
     DDRPM or DTPAM will normally transport the records and specimens to another
     location (i.e., unless the specimens are shipped to the laboratory directly from the
     temporary collection site). This other location will then be used to store records, prepare
     specimens for shipment to the laboratory (if applicable), and distribute documents as
     required. With the transfer of records and specimens, which may occur when a
     temporary site is used, a primary concern for the DDRPM or DTPAM is to ensure that
     chain of custody is maintained for the specimens.
  1.12.6. In final preparation of the site, any water supply available in the collection site must
  be controlled to prevent the donor from attempting to dilute the specimen. This includes any
  water supply in an immediately adjacent area to which the donor may have access prior to
  handing the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM. A bluing agent must be added to the tank
  or toilet bowl that is accessible to the donor. The following are acceptable ways to control
  access to a water supply:
     1.12.6.1. Use tape to prevent opening/turning faucet handles.
     1.12.6.2. Close the shutoff valve for the water supply. If access to a water supply in the
     rest room cannot be controlled, the DDRPM or DTPAM may tell the donor that he or she
     will be listening at the entrance to the rest room for any sounds associated with the donor
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                        29


       attempting to use the available sources of water. Alternatively, the DDRPM or DTPAM
       may enter the rest room with the donor if the DDRPM or DTPAM is the same gender as
       the donor, but remains outside the toilet stall.
1.13. Collection Supplies.
   1.13.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM must ensure that the following supplies are available to
   conduct proper collections:
       1.13.1.1. Clean (single-use) wrapped or sealed, specimen bottles with appropriate
       caps/lids.
       1.13.1.2. Clean (single-use) wrapped or sealed, collection containers for each donor to
       urinate into. Use of a collection container is optional, but highly recommended, if the
       specimen bottle neck or opening is small.
       1.13.1.3. Temperature strips that can be attached to the exterior surface of collection
       containers or specimen bottles to measure the temperature within four minutes after the
       donor gives the specimen container/bottle to the DDRPM or DTPAM. If the temperature
       strip does not appear to be working properly, the DDRPM or DTPAM must take the
       specimen temperature with a temperature measuring device that has a sterile sleeve or
       other methodology to prevent contamination of the specimen.
       1.13.1.4. Appropriate temperature measuring device that can be used to measure a
       donor’s body temperature if the temperature of the specimen is outside of the range listed
       in the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (32-38
       C/90-100 F).
       1.13.1.5. Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms (CCF). See paragraph 1.14
       for instructions to complete CCFs.
       1.13.1.6. Tamper-evident labels/seals for the specimen bottles that have the same
       preprinted specimen ID number that appears on the CCF. The appropriate labels/seals
       are provided with each CCF. The tamper-evident seal also serves as a label; therefore, it
       will be referred to either as the tamper-evident label/seal or as the label/seal.
       1.13.1.7. Separate supply of tamper-evident seals. Occasionally, the tamper-evident
       label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because
       of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature and specimen bottle material).
       When this occurs, the DDRPM or DTPAM should have a separate tamper-evident seal
       that can be used to seal the specimen bottle. If after two attempts, the tamper-evident
       label/seal provided will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of
       environmental conditions then the sample will be disregarded and another opportunity to
       provide a sample will be scheduled.
       1.13.1.8. Leak-proof plastic bags in which sealed specimen bottles are placed prior to
       shipment to the laboratory.
       1.13.1.9. Absorbent material that is placed inside the leak-proof plastic bag in case the
       specimen bottle leaks during shipment.
       1.13.1.10. Shipping containers/mailers that can be labeled for transporting specimens to
       the laboratory and that can be securely sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected
 30                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


       tampering. The above items are supplied, as collection kits (i.e. each collection kit
       contains the items needed to collect a specimen from a donor and send it to a laboratory
       for testing).
       1.13.1.11. Bluing agent to add to water in the toilet bowl or tank to discourage
       adulteration or dilution of the specimen.
       1.13.1.12. DDRPM or DTPAM should have appropriate ID. The DDRPM or DTPAM is
       required to provide his or her ID if requested by the donor. The DDRPM or DTPAM is
       not required to provide any certification or other documentation to the donor proving the
       DTPAM’s training in the collection process.
       1.13.1.13. Storage box, area, or place where specimens can be stored before shipment to
       the laboratory. If a specimen is not immediately prepared for shipment after collection,
       chain of custody must be maintained by placing the specimen in a secured temporary
       location (e.g., inside a storage area that is always maintained within the line of sight of
       the DDRPM or DTPAM to ensure that no one has access to the specimen).
       1.13.1.14. HHS requires the DDRPM or DTPAM wear single-use disposable gloves
       while handling specimens. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
       published specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who may be exposed to
       potentially infectious body fluids (29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
       1910.1030).
1.14. Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF).
   1.14.1. All urine specimens must be collected while maintaining chain of custody. Chain of
   custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling of a specimen
   from the time a donor provides the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM until the results are
   reported by the designated drug testing laboratory.
   1.14.2. For all specimens collected, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved
   CCF, must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection site.
   1.14.3. The CCF consists of the following five copies.
       1.14.3.1. “Copy 1. Original.” Must accompany specimen to the laboratory.
       1.14.3.2. “Copy 2.” MRO copy.
       1.14.3.3. “Copy 3.” Collector copy.
       1.14.3.4. “Copy 4.” Supervisor copy, for inclusion, within the supervisor’s employee
       work folder.
       1.14.3.5. “Copy 5.” Donor copy.
   1.14.4. The reverse side of Copy 5 and Attachment 11 of this instruction provide guidance
   on completing the CCF.
1.15. Donor Identification (ID).
   1.15.1. The donor must be positively identified as the individual selected for testing.
   Acceptable methods of ID are:
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                           31


       1.15.1.1. State or Federal government-produced official photo ID (e.g., driver’s license
       or ID card, etc.); or
       1.15.1.2. Positive ID by a supervisor.
   1.15.2. The following are not acceptable ways to identify the donor:
       1.15.2.1. ID by a co-worker or another donor.
       1.15.2.2. Single non-photo ID card (e.g., social security card, credit card, union or other
       membership cards, pay vouchers, voter registration card).
1.16. Collection Steps.
   1.16.1. The following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the
   Mandatory Guidelines as established by HHS. Errors or omissions in some of the steps may
   result in a specimen being unacceptable for testing at the laboratory, or the results being
   declared invalid, upon review by the MRO.
       1.16.1.1. After preparing the collection site and verifying the ID of the donor, the
       DDRPM or DTPAM ensures that the required information is provided in Step 1 of the
       CCF. This includes:
          1.16.1.1.1. Submitting of unit’s name, address, and ID number (if applicable).
          1.16.1.1.2. MRO’s name and address.
          1.16.1.1.3. Donor’s social security number (SSN) or specimen ID number, if
          individual refuses to use SSN.
          1.16.1.1.4. Reason for test (i.e., random, reasonable suspicion, etc.).
          1.16.1.1.5. Tests to be performed (i.e., drugs for which the specimen will be tested).
          When conducting reasonable suspicion, post accident, or unsafe practice testing, the
          Air Force agency may have a urine specimen tested for any drug listed in Schedule I
          or II of the Controlled Substances Act.
          1.16.1.1.6. Collection’s site address.
          1.16.1.1.7. Collector’s phone number.
          1.16.1.1.8. Collector’s fax number.
       1.16.1.2. The DDRPM or DTPAM asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer
       clothing such as a coat or jacket that might conceal items or substances that could be used
       to tamper with or adulterate the donor’s urine specimen. The DDRPM or DTPAM shall
       ensure that all personal belongings such as a purse or briefcase remain with the outer
       garments. The donor may retain his or her wallet. The DDRPM or DTPAM directs the
       donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items to ensure that no items are
       present that could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used
       to adulterate the specimen, the donor places the items back into the pockets and the
       collection procedure continues. If the donor refuses to show the DDRPM or DTPAM the
       items in his or her pockets, this is considered a “refusal to test.” If an item is found that
       appears to be brought to the collection site with the intent to adulterate the specimen, a
       direct observation procedure shall be used. If the item appears to be inadvertently
32                                                                   AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


     brought to the collection site, the DDRPM or DTPAM shall secure the item and continue
     with the normal collection procedure.
     1.16.1.3. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort instructs the donor to wash (with water only)
     and dry his or her hands, preferably under the DTPAM’s or escort’s observation. The
     donor should not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could be
     used to adulterate or dilute the specimen.
     1.16.1.4. The DDRPM or DTPAM gives the donor the collection container or specimen
     bottle to be used from the available supply. If the container or specimen bottle is
     wrapped/sealed, either the DDRPM or DTPAM may unwrap or break the seal in the
     donor’s presence or the donor may unwrap or break the seal in the DDRPM or DTPAM’s
     presence.
     1.16.1.5. The specimen collection container should be unwrapped at this time. The
     specimen bottle should be unwrapped in the donor’s presence when the donor gives the
     specimen in the collection container to the DDRPM or DTPAM.
        1.16.1.5.1. If the collection container and specimen bottle are wrapped and/ or sealed
        together, only the collection container and/or specimen bottle should be taken into the
        restroom.
     1.16.1.6. The donor takes the collection container and/or specimen bottle into the
     restroom, toilet stall, or partitioned area to provide the specimen in private. The
     DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort instructs the donor not to flush the toilet or to use any
     source of water that could not be secured.
     1.16.1.7. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort should remind the donor to leave the
     restroom, toilet stall, or partitioned area as quickly as possible after the donor has voided
     into the collection container/specimen bottle.
     1.16.1.8. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort is required to read the temperature of the
     specimen to determine if it is in the acceptable range. The donor must minimize the time
     between voiding into the collection container/specimen bottle and leaving the restroom,
     toilet stall, or partitioned area.
     1.16.1.9. The donor gives the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM immediately upon
     leaving the restroom, toilet stall or partitioned area. The DDRPM or DTPAM will ensure
     the bottle is closed. The DDRPM, DTPAM, escort, and donor will maintain visual
     contact of the specimen until the seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid by the
     DDRPM and/or DTPAM.
     1.16.1.10. The DDRPM or DTPAM performs the following checks:
        1.16.1.10.1. Checks the specimen’s color and look for any signs of contaminants.
        Any unusual findings shall be noted on the CCF.
        1.16.1.10.2. Checks the specimen volume to ensure there is at least 30 ml, checks the
        temperature to ensure that it is within the acceptable range, and inspects the specimen
        for adulteration or substitution.
            1.16.1.10.2.1. If the volume is less than 30 ml and the temperature is within the
            acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                        33


            using a new kit.
            1.16.1.10.2.2. If the volume is less than 30 ml and the temperature is outside the
            acceptable range, the sample circumstances and “request the lab test the sample”
            will be annotated in the remarks on the collection form, and the specimen
            forwarded to the lab for testing and a second specimen is collected under direct
            observation using a new kit. A donor may volunteer to have his or her oral
            temperature taken to provide evidence to counter the reason to believe the donor
            may have altered or substituted the specimen caused by the specimen’s
            temperature falling outside the prescribed range.
            1.16.1.10.2.3. If the temperature is not within the acceptable range (i.e., 32-38
            C/90-100 F), another specimen is collected under direct observation and both
            specimens will be forwarded to the laboratory for testing. A donor may volunteer
            to have his or her oral temperature taken to provide evidence to counter the reason
            to believe the donor may have altered or substituted the specimen caused by the
            specimen’s temperature falling outside the prescribed range. The DDRPM or
            DTPAM will use a new CCF for the second specimen and will use new specimen
            containers and bottles.
            1.16.1.10.2.4. In either case when another specimen is to be collected, HHS
            guidelines permit giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink (not to
            exceed 24 ounces in 90 minutes) to provide a second specimen, distributed
            reasonably through a period until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount
            of urine.
        1.16.1.10.3. Reads the specimen temperature within four minutes of receiving the
        specimen and checks/marks the box on the CCF if the temperature is in the acceptable
        range or records the actual temperature on the CCF. If the donor voids into a
        collection container, the DDRPM or DTPAM reads the temperature before pouring
        the specimen into the specimen bottle.
        1.16.1.10.4. Inspects the specimen for adulteration or substitution.
            1.16.1.10.4.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM will inspect the specimen for any
            unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material or other signs of
            adulteration.
            1.16.1.10.4.2. If it is apparent on visual inspection that the donor has adulterated
            or substituted the specimen, the DDRPM or DTPAM will proceed to collect
            another specimen under direct observation following the above steps and both
            specimens will be forwarded to the laboratory for testing.               Under no
            circumstances is the DDRPM or DTPAM permitted to collect and add or combine
            urine from two separate voids.
     1.16.1.11. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or donor pours at least 30 mL of the specimen from
     the collection container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle. The
     DDRPM or DTPAM uses the “A” bottle, seal. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or donor also
     pours at least 15 mL of the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle,
     places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the “B” bottle, seal. The seal on each bottle must
34                                                                 AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


     be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying
     the seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottles.
     1.16.1.12. The DDRPM or DTPAM ensures the donor initials and the date is on the CCF
     seal. The DDRPM or DTPAM will place the CCF seal on the specimen bottle.
        1.16.1.12.1. Occasionally the tamper-evident seal provided with the CCF will not
        properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g.,
        moisture, temperature, and specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the DDRPM
        or DTPAM should still apply the tamper-evident seal provided with the CCF and then
        apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second
        seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF seal to avoid obscuring information
        on the CCF seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the DDRPM or
        DTPAM and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., the donor will be present when it
        is apparent that the CCF seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle;
        however, a seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after
        several minutes the seal begins to lift off along the edges). The DDRPM or DTPAM
        must also provide any appropriate comment on the “remarks” line of the CCF stating
        why the second seal was used.
        1.16.1.12.2. If while sealing and initialing the CCF seal the DDRPM or DTPAM or
        donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the DDRPM or DTPAM must apply a
        second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal
        should be placed perpendicular to the CCF seal to avoid obscuring information on the
        CCF seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the DDRPM or DTPAM
        and initialed by the donor. The DDRPM or DTPAM must also provide an
        appropriate comment on the “remarks” line stating why the second seal was used.
        1.16.1.12.3. Since the specimen bottle is now sealed and does not have to be under
        the donor’s direct observation at this point, the donor may wash his or her hands with
        soap and water or alcohol-based solution if he or she desires to do so.
     1.16.1.13. The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 (Step 5) of the CCF,
     and certifies that the specimen identified as having been collected from him or her is in
     fact the specimen that he or she provided by signing the certification statement and
     providing his or her date of birth, printed name and work telephone number.
        1.16.1.13.1. If the donor refuses to sign the form, the DDRPM or DTPAM must
        make a notation on the “remarks” line to that effect. The same procedure must be
        followed if the donor refuses to initial the label.
     1.16.1.14. The DDRPM or DTPAM completes the DDRPM or DTPAM certification
     section of the CCF by printing the name and address of the collection facility and the
     DDRPM or DTPAM’s duty telephone number; printing his or her name; signing the
     certification statement; and recording the date and time of the collection.
        1.16.1.14.1. To facilitate the collection process, the DDRPM or DTPAM may fill in
        the name and address of the collection facility and the DDRPM or DTPAM’s
        business telephone number on the spaces provided in Step 1 prior to starting the
        collection procedure.
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                          35


          1.16.1.14.2. In Step 2 on the CCF, the remarks block includes space to allow the
          DDRPM or DTPAM to record any remarks concerning the collection.
      1.16.1.15. The DDRPM or DTPAM signs the first line of the chain of custody block
      (Step 4) indicating he or she has received the specimen from the donor, and prints his or
      her name, date and time of collection.
      1.16.1.16. The DDRPM or DTPAM removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the
      donor. The donor may now leave the collection site.
      1.16.1.17. If the DDRPM or DTPAM plans to immediately seal the specimen bottle in a
      tamper-evident shipping container for shipment to the laboratory, the DDRPM or
      DTPAM signs and prints his or her name in the “specimen released by” block of the
      chain of custody and completes the “specimen received by” block by printing the specific
      name of the courier or shipping service and the date. The DDRPM or DTPAM also
      completes the “purpose of change” block by using an appropriate phrase to indicate the
      transfer of the specimen from the DDRPM or DTPAM to the courier or shipment service
      (e.g., shipment to [lab’s name]).
          1.16.1.17.1. If the specimen bottle is not immediately prepared for shipment or is
          transferred to another individual, the transfer to another individual or to temporary
          storage must be documented on the CCF.
          1.16.1.17.2. All actions involving a specimen prior to shipment must be documented
          on the CCF.
      1.16.1.18. The DDRPM or DTPAM places the specimen bottle and Copy 1 of the CCF
      inside an appropriate leak-proof plastic bag that serves as a secondary barrier to prevent
      any leakage from damaging the shipping container or documents.
      1.16.1.19. The DDRPM or DTPAM places the leak-proof plastic bag that contains the
      specimen bottle and CCF in an appropriate shipping container and seals the shipping
      container as appropriate.
          1.16.1.19.1. If the shipping container is not transported to the laboratory on the same
          day that the specimen was collected, the DDRPM or DTPAM should store the
          shipping container in a secure location until it is shipped to the laboratory. A secure
          location is protected by double locks (e.g. locked cabinet in a locked room) with
          access limited to the DTPAM.
      1.16.1.20. The DDRPM or DTPAM sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the
      supervisor. Copy 3 is retained by the DDRPM or DTPAM.
      1.16.1.21. Following each urine specimen collection, the DDRPM or DTPAM should
      check the collection site to ensure that the donor did not leave anything that could have
      been used by the donor or could be used by the next donor to adulterate or dilute a
      specimen. The toilet is flushed and then the DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort should add
      bluing to the toilet, in preparation, for     the    next collection.
1.17. Shy Bladder Collection.
   1.17.1. When a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen, the donor may have
   intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site, could not provide a specimen as
 36                                                                    AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


   directed by the collector, has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a
   specimen, or has a "shy bladder." The term "shy bladder" usually refers to an individual who
   is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby during the
   attempted urination.
   1.17.2. If a donor tells the collector, upon arrival at the collection site, that he or she cannot
   provide a specimen, the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless of the
   reason given.
   1.17.3. At the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor unwrap/open a
   collection container, the collector does the following:
       1.17.3.1. Requests the donor to try to provide a specimen.

Note: The donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor
comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container.

       1.17.3.2. Directs the donor to drink some fluids.
Note: The donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably through a
period of up to 3 hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine,
whichever occurs first.

Note: The donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency
representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process.

Note: If the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine
specimen, the collection procedure is discontinued and a "refusal to test" is noted on the
"Remarks" line of the CCF.
       1.17.3.3. Instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a
       sufficient quantity of specimen. The collector uses the CCF from the first attempt.
      Note: It is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one additional
      attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts.
       1.17.3.4. Maintains a record of the time of each attempt, whether there was no specimen
       provided or the quantity of specimen provided, and the total ounces of fluid given to the
       donor.
       1.17.3.5. Discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was used
       for the void, but retains the CCF.
Note: If there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt, the collection container may be
used for the next attempt.
   1.17.3.6. Discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a potential "shy
   bladder" situation if after a period of three hours (i.e., from the time the donor first
   demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen) the
   donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen.
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                       37


   1.17.3.7. Indicates "Shy Bladder" on the "Remarks" line of the CCF and attaches a copy of
   the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen. Copy 1 is discarded since no valid
   specimen was collected and the other copies of the CCF are distributed as appropriate.
1.18. Restrictions on Direct Observation Collections.
   1.18.1. A direct observation collection procedure is the same as a routine collection
   procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor
   urinate into the collection container. The determination that direct observation is necessary
   must be based on an individualized determination that the visual monitoring is warranted
   under the circumstances. The DDRPM or DTPAM shall review and concur, in advance, any
   decision with any collector to obtain a specimen under direct observation. A direct
   observation collection must be conducted by a DDRPM or DTPAM, or other trained
   observer, of the same gender as the donor. If the donor declines to have a direct observed
   collection, the collector reports a refusal to test.
   1.18.2. A direct observed collection procedure may only be used when:
       1.18.2.1. A previous or current drug test provided by the employee was reported as being
       diluted, or otherwise adulterated, the donor had substituted another specimen as his/her
       own, invalid, or the specimen was unsuitable for testing.
       1.18.2.2. The drug test is a rehabilitation or follow-up test.
       1.18.2.3. The DDRPM or DTPAM believes that the donor may alter or substitute the
       specimen to be provided.
       1.18.2.4. During a routine collection, the temperature of the specimen collected is
       outside the acceptable range (32-38 Celsius/90-100 degrees Fahrenheit), the DDRPM or
       DTPAM observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct indicated a
       possible attempt to dilute or substitute a specimen, or the collector believes that the
       specimen has been adulterated (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming
       when shaken, has smell of bleach).
   1.18.3. Chain of custody for a direct observation collection.
       1.18.3.1. There may be instances when the DDRPM or DTPAM is not able to serve as a
       direct observer (e.g., when the gender of the DDRPM or DTPAM is different from that of
       the donor). In these instances, the DDRPM or DTPAM must call upon another
       designated individual to act as the observer. When this occurs, the procedure for
       completing the chain of custody block on the CCF may be different from that used for a
       typical collection.
       1.18.3.2. In the event the observer actually receives the specimen from the donor, the
       observer must be included in the chain of custody under remarks or Memorandum for
       Record (MFR) to accompany the CCF.
1.19. Documentation Errors/Fatal Flaws.
   1.19.1. When an HHS-certified laboratory receives a specimen bottle and its associated
   CCF, it checks to see if the specimen ID number on the specimen bottle seal matches the
   number on the CCF, that the specimen bottle seal is intact, and that the CCF has been
   properly completed by the DDRPM or DTPAM.
 38                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


   1.19.2. Per HHS guidelines, the following discrepancies are considered to be fatal flaws and
   the laboratory must stop the testing process and reject the specimen for testing and indicate
   the reason for rejecting the specimen on the CCF:
       1.19.2.1. The specimen ID number on the specimen bottle seal does not match the
       specimen ID number on the CCF or the ID number is missing either on the CCF or on the
       specimen bottle seal;
       1.19.2.2. The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering on the
       specimen bottle from a single specimen collection or on the primary (Bottle A) specimen
       from a split specimen collection (and the split specimen cannot be designated as the
       primary (Bottle A) specimen);
       1.19.2.3. The collector's printed name and signature are omitted on the CCF; or
       1.19.2.4. There is an insufficient amount of urine for analysis in the specimen bottle
       from a single specimen collection or in the primary (Bottle A) specimen from a split
       specimen collection (unless the split specimen can be designated as the primary (Bottle
       A) specimen).
   1.19.3. Per HHS guidelines, the following discrepancies are considered to be correctable
   flaws:
       1.19.3.1. If a DDRPM or DTPAM failed to sign the CCF, the laboratory must attempt to
       recover the DDRPM’s or DTPAM's signature before reporting the test result. If the
       DDRPM or DTPAM can provide a MFR recovering the signature, the laboratory may
       report the test result for the specimen. If the laboratory cannot recover the DDRPM’s or
       DTPAM's signature, the laboratory must report a rejected for testing result and indicate
       the reason for the rejected for testing result on the CCF.
       1.19.3.2. If a specimen is submitted using a non-Federal form or an expired CCF, the
       laboratory must test the specimen and also attempt to obtain a MFR explaining why a
       non-Federal form or an expired CCF was used and ensure that the form used contains all
       the required information. If the laboratory cannot obtain a MFR from the DDRPM or
       DTPAM, the laboratory must report a rejected for testing result and indicate the reason
       for the rejected for testing result on the report to the MRO.
       1.19.3.3. Once contacted by the laboratory, the DDRPM or DTPAM should immediately
       respond to the laboratory indicating whether he/she can or cannot provide a memorandum
       to recover the discrepancy and/or error of omission. Responding slowly to a laboratory’s
       request for information regarding errors or discrepancies may lead to the laboratory
       discarding the specimen prior to testing.
1.20. Failure to Appear for Testing.
   1.20.1. Failure to appear for testing without a deferral may be considered refusal to
   participate in testing and may subject an employee to the full range of administrative and/or
   disciplinary actions, including but not limited to removal, and an applicant tentatively
   selected for a TDP to the cancellation of an offer of employment.
   1.20.2. If an individual fails to appear at the collection site at the assigned time, the DDRPM
   or DTPAM will notify the HRR. The supervisor and HRR will determine the course of
   action.
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                             39


Section 1F—Processing Test Results

1.21. Confidentiality of Test Results.
   1.21.1. The laboratory may disclose MRO verified/validated laboratory test results only to
   the MRO or the representative of the MRO.
   1.21.2. Any positive results the MRO verifies will be treated in a confidential manner.
   1.21.3. Test results will be protected IAW all applicable Federal laws, rules and regulations
   regarding confidentiality of records, including the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 42 C.F.R.,
   Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 2.
   1.21.4. The MRO may maintain only those records necessary for compliance with this
   instruction. Any records of the MRO, or the staff of the MRO, including drug test results,
   may be released to any management official for purposes of auditing the activities of the
   MRO, except that the disclosure of the results of any audit may not include personal
   identifying information on any employee.
   1.21.5. The by-name or other identifier results of a drug test on the employee may not be
   disclosed without the prior written consent of such employee, unless the disclosure would be:
       1.21.5.1. To the MRO.
       1.21.5.2. To any official whose duties necessitate review of the test results in an official
       capacity. Examples include but are not limited to: releasing information in order to
       investigate allegations resulting from grievances, appeals, and other complaints; to
       initiate or decide on disciplinary personnel action or to advise on such actions; or to
       initiate security clearance action against the employee. These officials commonly
       include: SJA, HRR, ADAPT, and commander/directorate head.
       1.21.5.3. Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or where required by
       the United States Government to defend against any challenge against any disciplinary
       action.
       1.21.5.4. Test results with all identifying information removed will also be made
       available to Air Force personnel, including the AFCDTP manager, for data collection and
       other activities necessary to ensure Air Force compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act
       of 1988.
       1.21.5.5. IAW the Privacy Act, 5USC 552a or as required by other federal law.
   1.21.6. In the case of a drug test result verified as positive, diluted, substituted or adulterated
   by the MRO IAW the HHS MRO Manual, information collected during the course of the
   MRO’s interview with the donor employee may be disclosed to any official whose duties
   include shaping management’s response to evidence of the employee’s apparent illicit drug
   use.
1.22. Opportunity to Justify a Laboratory-Verified Positive Test Result, Adulterated
Specimen Result or Specimen Not-Suitable-for-Testing Result.
   1.22.1. When a laboratory-verified positive result is returned by the laboratory, the MRO
   will perform the duties outlined by HHS guidelines (MRO Manual for Federal Workplace
   Drug Testing Programs, CSAP Technical Report #15) in order to validate the results. For
 40                                                                   AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


   example, the MRO may choose to conduct employee medical interviews, review employee
   medical history, or review any other biomedical factors.
   1.22.2. HHS-MRO Interview Procedure
      1.22.2.1. The MRO determines that the information on the CCF is correct and complete.
      The MRO makes telephone contact with the specimen donor associated with a non-
      negative test result (drug positive, substituted, adulterated or invalid).
      1.22.2.2. The MRO conducts an interview to discern any legitimate and substantiated
      reason for the non-negative drug test result.
      1.22.2.3. The MRO determines whether the drug test result should remain categorized
      the same as presented by the laboratory.
      1.22.2.4. The MRO reports validated result to the designated point of contact (POC) at
      the donor’s Air Force Installation.
      1.22.2.5. The MRO and POC maintain records of the result and donor information.
1.23. MRO Review of Medical Records.
   1.23.1. The MRO must review all medical records made available by the individual in
   determining whether a laboratory verified positive test could have resulted from legally
   prescribed medication. The MRO also may request the individual submit additional evidence
   to justify a laboratory verified positive drug test result received from a laboratory. Evidence
   to legitimize a positive result may include:
      1.23.1.1. A valid prescription.
      1.23.1.2. A verification from the individual’s physician of a valid prescription.
   1.23.2. Individuals are not entitled, however, to present evidence to the MRO in a trial-type
   administrative proceeding, although the MRO has the discretion to accept evidence in any
   manner the MRO deems most efficient or necessary.
   1.23.3. If the MRO determines there is no justification for the positive test result, the result
   will then become a MRO verified positive test result. The MRO staff will immediately
   contact the DDRPM upon obtaining a MRO verified/validated positive test result.
1.24. Reporting of Results Under the AFCDTP.
   1.24.1. The MRO staff will receive all laboratory test results and associated documents from
   the approved drug testing laboratory for all civilian employees in TDP, applicants, and
   quality control specimens.
   1.24.2. The MRO staff will:
      1.24.2.1. Match-up the laboratory results with the appropriate individual tests or quality
      control specimens.
      1.24.2.2. Review laboratory reports, chain of custody forms, and associated
      documentation for collection or specimen deficiencies which indicate the validity of the
      results may be scientifically insufficient because certain procedures were not followed or
      standards were not fully met.
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                          41


      1.24.2.3. Advise the AFCDTP manager of significant problems or concerns resulting
      from laboratory and collection site procedures or practices.
      1.24.2.4. Order a reanalysis of a specimen or special laboratory tests, if necessary.
      1.24.2.5. Recommend the AFCDTP manager arrange for retesting of employees or
      applicants tentatively selected for TDP when warranted.
      1.24.2.6. Review all laboratory verified positive laboratory results and contact/interview
      employees, applicants tentatively selected for TDP, physicians, and laboratory
      toxicologists as necessary to determine whether the results are consistent with the legal
      use of drugs.
      1.24.2.7. Obtain a copy of the laboratory quantitative result on all opiate positives before
      contacting the donor (this is intended as a review in order to ensure the laboratory box for
      morphine or codeine has been appropriately checked).
   1.24.3. Send the Air Force written reports on all MRO-verified positive drug test results and
   positive test results based on other than illicit drug use no later than the second business day
   after making such a determination. The MRO will verify all positive laboratory test results
   by interviewing the donor to determine whether there is an acceptable medical explanation. If
   the MRO determines there is no medical explanation for a positive result (i.e., the result
   cannot be explained through non-abusive use of a prescription or over-the-counter
   medication) such a result will be considered an MRO-verified positive test result. This MRO
   verified positive result will be documented as in writing and reported to the base-level
   DDRPM (or DTPAM).
   1.24.4. The MRO will prepare a separate written report on all MRO verified positive,
   invalid, unsuitable for testing, and adulterated results, including pertinent documentation,
   within three business days of receipt of all the information the MRO deems necessary to
   make a determination. The finalized report will be forwarded to the base-level DDRPM
   using secured and traceable methods such as certified or overnight mail.
      1.24.4.1. The DDRPM, after consulting with the HRR, will establish procedures for the
      retesting of all individuals who tested non-negative or positive for drug use prior to the
      employee returning to work.

Section 1G—Drug Testing Program Records

1.25. Maintenance and Confidentiality of Records.
   1.25.1. AFCDTP records will be maintained IAW all applicable Federal laws, rules and
   regulations regarding confidentiality of records, including the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
   and 42 C.F.R., Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 2.
   1.25.2. Case files on disciplinary actions for drug use are maintained IAW AFI 36-704,

   Alcohol Drug Abuse Prevention Treatment (ADAPT) Program, AFI 41-210, Patient
 42                                                                   AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


   Administrative Functions, and AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and Military
   Law.
   1.25.4. With written consent, the employee may authorize the disclosure of records to his or
   her employer for verification of treatment or for a general evaluation of treatment progress.
   Attachment 10 contains a sample form for obtaining consent to release patient information.
   1.25.5. Any employee who is the subject of a drug test will, upon written request, have
   access to any records relating to such drug test results.
   1.25.6. Except as authorized by law, an applicant not employed by the DoD and tentatively
   selected for a TDP will not be entitled to records relating to drug test results.

Section 1H—Findings of Drug Use Required Actions

1.26. Finding of Drug Use.
   1.26.1. An employee may be found to have used illicit drugs on the basis of any appropriate
   evidence including, but not limited to:
      1.26.1.1. Direct observation of drug use.
      1.26.1.2. Evidence obtained from an arrest or criminal conviction.
      1.26.1.3. A MRO verified positive test result for the presence of an illicit drug.
      1.26.1.4. An employee’s voluntary admission of usage of an illicit drug.
1.27. Mandatory Administrative and Disciplinary Actions.
   1.27.1. If the employee that used illicit drugs occupies a TDP, the employee must be
   removed from the position. However, at the discretion of the commander/directorate head,
   and while making satisfactory progress in treatment, an employee may return to duty in a
   TDP, if there are reasonable grounds to believe the employee will not engage in further use
   of illicit drugs endangering public health, safety, or national security. If the employee is
   returned to duty in a TDP he/she may not be excused from random testing.
   1.27.2. The supervisor directs an employee, in writing, to report to the EAP or ADAPT
   clinic (if EAP is unavailable) for initial substance abuse assessment subsequent to an MRO-
   verified drug positive test, a substance-related incident, or other reasonable suspicion of
   substance misuse. The notification will provide specifics of the appointment and advise the
   employee that attendance is mandatory. All notices will be coordinated with the servicing
   HRR. A sample notification letter is provided in Attachment 13.
   1.27.3. Supervisors are required to take appropriate action against any employee found to
   use illicit drugs in coordination with the HRR. Procedures must be consistent with
   applicable collective bargaining agreements and Air Force and DoD policy.
      1.27.3.1. Disciplinary actions may include the full range of actions as provided in the
      regulation/instruction that applies, given the type of employee in issue (APF or NAF).
      For example, AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions, and AFI 36-1001, Managing
      the Civilian Performance Program applies in cases involving APF employees; AFI 36-
      901, Air Force Senior Executive Resources (PA) applies in cases involving SES
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                           43


       employees; and AFMAN 34-310, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Management And
       Administration applies in cases involving NAF employees.
       1.27.3.2. As required by EO 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace, management will
       propose action to remove an employee for any one of the following:
          1.27.3.2.1. Refusing to obtain counseling or treatment through a treatment program
          as required by the EO after having been found to have engaged in illicit drug use; or
          1.27.3.2.2. Continued illicit drug use after a first offense of illicit drug use; or
          1.27.3.2.3. Altering or attempting to alter a urine specimen or substituting or
          attempting to substitute a specimen for their own or that of another employee or,
          1.27.3.2.4. Failure in a mandated and/or agreed upon medically approved drug
          rehabilitation program.
       1.27.3.3. In rehabilitation testing, employees are subject to unannounced testing for one
       year (minimum) from the time of a positive test. The frequency and duration of follow
       up testing will be determined by the Civilian Rehabilitation Team for APF employees
       and the HRR for NAF employees.
1.28. Safe Haven Provision.
   1.28.1. Disciplinary action for illicit drug use will not be initiated for any employee who
   meets ALL four of the following conditions: (1) voluntarily identifies himself/herself as a
   user of illicit drugs prior to being notified of the requirement to provide a specimen for
   testing or being identified through other means (i.e., drug testing, investigation); (2) obtains
   and cooperates with appropriate counseling or rehabilitation; (3) agrees to and signs a last
   chance or statement of agreement; and (4) thereafter refrains from illicit drug use. This does
   not preclude disciplinary action for other misconduct, i.e., possession of drugs or drug
   paraphernalia.
1.29. Employee Counseling and Assistance. 29.1. Employees who have self-identified as
having a substance abuse problem (which includes alcohol abuse or illicit drug use), or have
been identified through other means such as possessing drugs or drug use paraphernalia, or who
have been identified through drug testing, will be referred by their supervisor for counseling,
assessment, and referral for treatment as prescribed in Chapter 2.

Section 1I—Statistics

1.30. Statistical Information.
   1.30.1. The DDRPM (with input from ADAPT) will collect and compile anonymous
   statistical data for the following:
       1.30.1.1. Number of employee random tests, reasonable suspicion tests, accident or
       safety mishap tests, or follow-up tests.
       1.30.1.2. Number of confirmed positive tests.
       1.30.1.3. Number of employees who have been referred for:
          1.30.1.3.1. Initial substance abuse assessment.
 44                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


          1.30.1.3.2. Specimen tampering.

                                           Chapter 2

        SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING, ASSISTANCE AND REFERRALS

2.1. Overview.
   2.1.1. To ensure maximum workplace productivity through an alcohol misuse and drug-free
   workforce accomplished through a combination of deterrence, detection, and rehabilitation.
       2.1.1.1. Early intervention is essential to the effective operation of this program and the
       successful rehabilitation of employees. Therefore, supervisors must be alert to behaviors
       that could indicate a substance abuse problem (prior to the occurrence of alcohol-related
       misconduct or MRO-verified drug test positive) and advise employees they may
       voluntarily seek assessment and treatment referral services using the Safe Haven
       provision in section 1.28 of this AFI.
          2.1.1.2. Rehabilitation shall be offered to all employees identified as having a
          substance abuse problem (defined as: alcohol misuse, a MRO verified drug positive
          test result, and/or self-identified with a drug or alcohol problem), regardless of other
          administrative actions that may be pending or taken. Alcohol misuse is defined as
          alcohol-related misconduct that has a direct impact on work productivity. Even when
          the removal of the employee from the Federal Service is proposed, the Air Force will
          offer, at a minimum, assessment and treatment referral services. The civilian
          employee will be provided a one-time mandatory assessment and referral
          appointment. This assessment and referral appointment can be completed, at no cost
          to the civilian employee, through EAP or ADAPT, as space and services are
          available. At the employee’s expense this mandatory assessment and referral
          appointment can also be conducted by other appropriate healthcare providers (e.g.
          civilian health care providers). Follow-on counseling services, if needed, are
          available at the employee’s expense. The follow-up counseling services can be
          provided through the installation EAP (if available), through the ADAPT program (on
          space available as fee for service), or other appropriate private health care service
          providers.
              2.1.1.2.1. Employees may be allowed up to one hour (or more as necessitated by
              travel time) of duty time for each assessment and referral session up to a
              maximum of three hours during the assessment/referral phase of treatment. This
              applies only to assessment/referral and not follow-up treatment. Absences during
              duty hours for rehabilitation or treatment must be charged to the appropriate leave
              category according to law and Air Force leave regulations.
          2.1.1.3. Although the Air Force will encourage treatment and rehabilitation, it is the
          responsibility of every employee to refrain from substance abuse and take personal
          responsibility for rehabilitation when substance abuse problems occur.
2.2. Referral Process.
   2.2.1. Supervisors will advise employees on the availability of services when there is any
   reason to believe that there may be a substance abuse problem. This advice does not require
 48                                                                  AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


   an employee to admit to any problem, but merely offers appropriate assessment and referral
   to counseling and rehabilitation services.
      2.2.1.1. The DDRPM provides appropriate referral guidance to supervisors. Supervisors
      must direct employees to report for initial assessment and referral-for-treatment any time
      drug use is MRO-verified/validated and/or there is alcohol-related misconduct and then
      follow up to ensure completion. Verification and validation may also arise through the
      employee’s admission of substance abuse in addition to results from a substance abuse
      test authorized by this AFI. See Attachment 13 for a sample notice to the employee.
          2.2.1.1.1. Supervisors will notify the commander when an employee refuses to
          comply with a mandatory referral for counseling.
2.3. Employee Counseling and Assistance.
   2.3.1. EAP contractor personnel or ADAPT staff, provide and document initial substance
   abuse evaluation of all referred or self-identified employees. Employees will be advised of
   options for substance abuse counseling and treatment through referral agencies. To ensure
   that appropriate referrals are made, EAP and ADAPT personnel should consider the nature
   and severity of the problem, location of the treatment, cost of the treatment, intensity of the
   treatment environment, availability of inpatient/outpatient care, and other special needs, such
   as transportation, family issues, and child care. Documentation of the initial assessment must
   be IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program and
   AFI 41-210, Patient Administrative Functions.
      2.3.1.1. EAP and ADAPT personnel ensure medical and MH records of civilian
      personnel referred for assessment and/or treatment are appropriately updated to include:
      referral data, patient confidentiality and release of information, options for accepting or
      refusing treatment, assessment data, and appropriate treatment planning, case
      management, and/or clinical services provided.
      2.3.1.2. If seen in ADAPT, information in the medical record should include a thorough
      initial note outlining the results of assessment, and employee consented to
      release/diagnostic procedures. Subsequent contacts should also be reflected in brief notes
      in medical records indicating the nature and outcome of services provided.
      2.3.1.3. Changes in status, diagnosis, or treatment plan; initiation or change in
      medication; or termination of services should be thoroughly documented in the medical
      record.
      2.3.1.4. Referral Options. Employees may use a wide variety of treatment options to
      include:      community-based treatment programs (for uninsured or underinsured
      individuals), private providers covered by the employee’s health insurance, or military
      benefits, if applicable.
          2.3.1.4.1. Military-based counseling and/or treatment services may be provided on a
          space available, reimbursable basis depending on the eligibility status of the
          employee and IAW HHS/TRICARE guidelines outlined in AFH 41-11, Section E,
          Health Care for Eligible Civilians and Special Categories of Beneficiaries and Their
          Family Members. Employees are responsible for payment for these services which is
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                       49


          generally accomplished by submitting claims to their Federal Health Benefits System
          heath insurance provider.
2.4. Counselor Responsibilities.
   2.4.1. The ADAPT or contract counselor counsels the employee on the scope of services
   available for counseling, assessment, and referral.
       2.4.1.1. For the mandatory initial assessment appointment, the employee will be advised
       by way of documented initial informed consent that their supervisor will be notified that
       the employee attended the interview and the reporting and departing time of the
       employee.
       2.4.1.2. The employee is advised of what information will be disclosed to the supervisor
       at the beginning of the initial interview. At that time the counselor also tells the
       employee that strict rules govern the disclosure of substance abuse counseling
       information and how those rules apply to the position the employee holds.
          2.4.1.2.1. The employee will be provided a copy of the form, Consent for Release of
          Patient Information During or After Treatment or Rehabilitation (Attachment 10).
          The counselor will explain that the employee is not required to sign the release, but
          doing so will allow for the treatment provider to communicate progress back to the
          supervisor and the Civilian Rehabilitation Team. The information may then be
          considered in deciding on the appropriateness of various actions including discipline
          and continued assignments to testing designated or other sensitive positions. Release
          of this information also furthers the rehabilitation process by ensuring that the
          supervisor is involved in the process and serves to justify the use of sick leave for
          treatment and counseling.
   2.4.2. ADAPT personnel will advise employees that if they choose to use ADAPT services,
   a MH record and a medical record will be established to ensure professional accountability
   and to facilitate on-going assessment of the quality, appropriateness, and progress of
   rehabilitation.
   2.4.3. Regardless of options selected, employees will be encouraged to authorize the release
   of information to appropriate management officials to facilitate support for their treatment.
   Employees will be advised that release of such information is not mandatory.

                                          Attachment 2
     AIR FORCE APPROPRIATED AND NONAPPROPRIATED FUND CIVILIAN
            EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTING DESIGNATED POSITIONS

The Air Force has identified specific categories of positions whose incumbents will be subject to
drug testing according to the AFCDTP. These positions have duties and responsibilities
consistent with the parameters established by the EO, guidance issued by the Office of the
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and supplementary guidance issued by the Interagency
Coordinating Group (ICG) Executive Committee and by the Department of Justice, Civil
Division and the DoDD 1010.9, “DoD Civilian Employee Drug Abuse Testing Program.” The
Air Force has categorized positions as either Presumptive TDP, mandatory TDP, with local
authority to designate additional positions meeting the criteria; Preferred TDP, mandatory TDP
but requiring HQ USAF/A1 written approval to designate additional positions; or Discretionary
TDP, which require Air Force to consult with DoD before approving TDP positions under this
category.

Presumptive positions are identified by general criteria and specific occupational series/codes
when it is known that those positions meet the general criteria. Preferred positions are identified
by specific occupational series/codes. Positions in the applicable series/codes identified below
as Presumptive and Preferred will be TDP even if the employees are leaders or supervisors.

Positions identified as TDP under these procedures will be documented on the position
description with the statement “This is a drug testing designated position. The incumbent is
subject to random testing for drug use.”

Requests for revisions to TDP shall be forwarded from installation personnel offices to
AFPC/DPIE to HQ USAF/A1. HQ USAF/A1 shall send HQ AFMOA/SGHW, Air Force Legal
Services Agency/Central Labor Law Office (AFLSA/CLLO), and the Air Force Administrative
Law Division (AF/JAA) an information copy. HQ USAF/A1 will review the request and
forward Air Force approved requests to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
(ASD/HA) and/or the DoD Drug Coordinator for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support
(CDEP&S) for DoD approval.

Request packages should contain a statement describing the proposed changes, the official
position descriptions or a summary of the duties performed by the positions being recommended
for drug testing, and a written justification for each proposed TDP. In some cases group
justifications may suffice for positions that share common duties and fall under the same TDP
category.

The ASD/HA will approve the establishment of all test designated positions in coordination with
the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. ASD/HA will
work with the ONDCP for approval of requests.
 60                                                                    AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


Category I – Presumptive Included TDP

Category I positions are those that meet the criteria for presumptive TDP. Positions that meet
the criteria for Category I coverage are presumed to meet the ONDCP criteria and must be
locally identified as TDP even when they are not specifically identified in this plan by
occupational series/code.

Type I: Employees who carry firearms on a routine or recurring basis

At a minimum, positions in the following occupational series/codes will be reviewed and
designated as appropriate:

0083, Police

0085, Security Guard

1712, Training Instructor, Marksmanship

1811, Criminal Investigating

Justification: These positions are required to carry firearms on a daily or regular basis. There is
well developed law and a clear public interest in testing employees who are required to carry
firearms on a daily or regular basis. Furthermore, guidance from ONDCP requires such
positions to be Presumptive TDP.

Type 2: Motor vehicle operators

At a minimum, positions in the following occupational series/codes will be TDP:

0081, Fire Protection and Prevention, (driving duties)

5701, General Mobile Equipment Operating,

5703, Motor Vehicle Operating

AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                              61


In addition, positions in Recreation and Child/Youth Development that regularly drive
passengers on tours and field trips in the following occupational series/codes will be TDP:

0188, Recreation Specialist

0189, Recreation Aid and Assistant

1701, General Education and Development

1702, Education and Training Technician

Justification: The Air Force elects to designate all positions with driving duties for testing
regardless of number of passengers, cargo, size of vehicle, and limitations to driving on base
only. Typical Air Force installations are highly concentrated areas of hazardous and explosive
material, children in housing areas, and a significant number of vehicles carrying passengers
such as school buses and aircrew vehicles. The safety risk to an Air Force installation in
operation of light vehicles without passengers or hazardous materials is as great as the risk the
vehicles with a certain number of passengers or specifically carrying hazardous material.

Type 3: Aviation flight crewmembers and air-traffic controllers

Positions in the following occupational series/codes will be TDP:

0301, Air Commander

2152, Air Traffic Control

2181, Aircraft Operations

2183, Air Navigation

2185, Aircrew Technician

Justification: The above referenced series/codes represent positions that are either aviation
flight crew members or air traffic controllers. There is well developed law and a clear public
interest in testing positions that are aviation flight crew members or air traffic controllers.
Furthermore, guidance from the ONDCP requires such positions to be Presumptive TDP.

Railroad operating crews

Positions in the following occupational series/code will be TDP:

5737, Locomotive Engineering
 62                                                                    AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


Justification: The above referenced series/code presents positions that serve as railroad
operating crews. There is well developed law and a clear public interest in testing railroad
operating crews. Furthermore, guidance from the ONDCP requires such positions to be
Presumptive TDP.

Category II -- Preferred TDP

Category II positions require the Air Force to consult with ASD (HA) and the DoD Coordinator
for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support (CDEP&S) prior to identification as a TDP; therefore,
installations are prohibited from identifying any position which is not specifically identified in
this attachment by occupational series/code. These positions include those meeting the criteria
established in the Interagency Group Committee memorandum dated 2 August 1999, Guidance
for Selection of Testing Designated Positions, prepared by ONDCP for preferred TDP,
discretionary designations, and specifically disfavored positions.

These positions may not be designated as a TDP without specific authorization from HQ
USAF/A1.

Type 1: Health and safety responsibilities involving a potentially dangerous instrument or
machine

appropriate.

0101, Social Sciences

0180, Psychology

0181, Psychology Aid and Technician

0185, Social Work

0602, Medical Officer

0610, Nursing

Justification: Direct client care to known illicit drug users requires employee assistance
personnel to be free of illicit drug use to avoid compromise of the spirit and intent of the drug
testing program and to ensure that the care given is of the highest quality. Drug rehabilitation duties are
inconsistent with illicit drug use.
 66                                                                     AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


The Air Force has consulted with and obtained the concurrence of the ONDCP to designate the following
specific positions as TDP. Additional TDP may be added only after petitioning HQ USAF/A1.

Type 5: Personnel having access to truly sensitive information, i.e., national security
material

Positions requiring routine access to truly sensitive information that has the potential to damage
national interests if compromised will be identified as TDP. All positions and personnel
requiring access to Top Secret or higher are testing designated. Positions requiring access to
Secret, not meeting criteria for other Categories or Types of positions in this attachment must be
approved for testing designation by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (-Manpower and
Reserve Affairs) (SAF/MR). Requests should be sent to HQ AF/A1PC’s workflow box at
af.alpc.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Requests must include the rationale for testing and
justification. The justification must include

       1. A statement/description of possible negative consequences if an incumbent in that job
          were to abuse drugs. The statement must contain a clear nexus between the
          employee’s duties and the feared harm/damage to the organization or other personnel
          for each position.
       2. A copy of a current and properly executed job description must be provided, along
          with a schematic of the chain of supervision. The total number of employees covered
          will be provided. If the positions are being established or a change in the number of
          employees is expected, it must be so stated. Under no circumstances should the
          inclusion of a small number of employees be requested when rapid growth in that job
          class is forecast.
       3. MAJCOM/A1 and JA approval for each position under review prior to submission to
          AF/A1PC.

Justification: The use of illicit drugs demonstrates a disregard for the laws of the United States,
poor judgment, and exposes the individual to risks of extortion, thereby rendering such
individuals unsuitable for continued access to sensitive information. The Air Force elects to
identify all positions with routine access to truly sensitive national security information as TDP.
Such positions involve information that if disclosed could seriously damage national security
interests and jeopardize the lives of members of the United States armed services and allies.
Positions having access to official use, confidential or personally identifying information, not
meeting the truly-sensitive criteria, will not be designated. Additionally, positions will not be
designated for having “public trust” requirements or generalized requirements of integrity,
honesty, or responsibility.

critical position for nuclear weapons duty, or code D - controlled position for nuclear weapons
duty.

Justification: Positions involving access to nuclear weapons pose special risks to the national
security and safety. The consequences of any mishap are extraordinarily high and employees
must therefore be free of any substances, including but not limited to illicit drugs that could
impair judgment or performance.

Category III -- Discretionary TDP

Category III positions require the Air Force to consult with DoD and the Interagency
Coordinating Group (ICG) Executive Committee prior to identification as a TDP; therefore,

MEMORANDUM FOR (Employee Name - Incumbent of position newly designated as a TDP)
FROM: Civilian Personnel Flight
SUBJECT: Notice of Drug Testing as a Condition of Employment

1. The position of (Title, Series, and grade) to which you are assigned has been designated by
the Air Force as a testing designated position (TDP) under the Air Force Civilian Drug Testing
Program. For the purpose of this program, TDP are those positions sufficiently critical to the Air
Force mission or to the protection of public safety to warrant screening of the incumbent
employee as a job-related requirement to detect the presence of drugs. Illicit drug use by
employees in sensitive positions presents a clear threat to the mission of the Air Force, national
security, or public safety.

2. As a mandatory requirement for your continued employment in this TDP, it is required you
(a) refrain from the use of illicit drugs and (b) submit to urinalysis testing pursuant to AFI 44-
107, Air Force Civilian Drug Testing and Substance Abuse Program. You are directed to read
and become familiar with AFI 44-107. Therefore, 30 days after receipt of this notice, you will be
subject to urinalysis testing on an unannounced random basis.

3. You will receive specific instructions concerning when and where the test will be conducted
immediately prior to the test. You will be allowed individual privacy while providing the urine
specimen unless there is reason to believe the specimen may be or has been altered. The
collection, handling, and testing of the urine specimen will be conducted under chain of custody
procedures established by the Health and Human Services Technical Guidelines to ensure
accuracy of the test result. The quality of testing procedures is tightly controlled to ensure
results will be handled with the maximum respect for individual confidentiality.

4. If you refuse to furnish a urine specimen as directed, or if illicit drug use is detected through a
Medical Review Officer (MRO) verified/validated positive test result, you will have failed to
meet the mandatory employment requirement for this sensitive position. If you refuse to furnish
a urine specimen, or, if you provide a urine specimen that ultimately reflects the use of an illicit
drug you will be subject to disciplinary action, ranging from reprimand to removal. If you are
AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010                                                                              73


found to have used an illicit drug, you will be reassigned from the TDP. Additionally, you may
be disciplined, up to and including removal from Federal service, if you fail to participate in a
counseling or treatment program. However, even if you agree to participate in and subsequently
complete a counseling or treatment program, you may still be subject to disciplinary action,
which may include removal, depending on the totality of the circumstances of your situation.
Your agreement to participate in a counseling or treatment program will be one of the factors
considered in determining the level of discipline or disciplinary action imposed. Prescription
drugs authorized by a physician and verified by appropriate evidence are excluded from such
determinations. You will be given an opportunity to submit medical documentation to the MRO
in order to verify the legitimate use of specific drugs before any action will be taken. Absent
valid medical documentation, you may be removed from the Federal Service.

5. If you believe you may have a drug problem, you are encouraged to voluntarily seek
counseling or referral services by contacting the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at
(provide phone number) or, if an EAP is not locally available, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program office at (provide phone number and modify as
necessary for local situations). If you do self-identify and agree to provisions described in the
civilian drug testing program during this 30-day notice period, you will not be subject to
disciplinary action for past use.

provide a “Memorandum For Record (MFR)” to recover the discrepancy, the laboratory is
permitted to test the specimen, but must hold the results until the MFR is received. If the
discrepancy cannot be recovered by a MFR from the collection site, the laboratory may not test
the specimen and must indicate the reason on the “REMARKS” line. This notification also
alerts the collection site that an error has been made and that the collection site must implement
corrective action to prevent the recurrence of the discrepancy.

 b. The laboratory should include a copy of the MFR with its report to the MRO to ensure that
 the MRO is aware that the discrepancy has been recovered.

I _______________________________, state that _________________________ identified
himself/herself to me as a _________________________and advised me that I have the legal
right to either consent to provide a urine specimen pursuant to the Air Force Civilian Drug
Testing Program or to refuse to give my consent to provide such a specimen for testing. I
understand that if I consent to provide a urine specimen for drug testing, that any illicit drug
found in the specimen as a result of drug testing may not be used in a criminal action against me,

I am giving my consent voluntarily and of my own free will, without having been subjected to
coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement, and without any promise of reward,
benefit or immunity. The individuals collecting my urine specimen have my permission to have
my urine specimen tested as they determine appropriate for the presence of any drug. I have read
and understand this entire acknowledgement of my rights, and grant my consent for the search
and seizure of my bodily fluids.

      SAMPLE BRIEFING FOR URINE SPECIMEN COLLECTION OBSERVERS

ALL OBSERVERS WILL READ prior to observing the collection of urine specimens under
chain-of-custody.

Collection of forensic urine specimens for drug testing requires maintenance of a strict chain of
custody from the time chain of custody is initiated to shipping of the sealed urine specimen
container to the Forensic Drug Testing Laboratory.

Observers’ qualifications:
 - Observers may not serve as an observer on the same day they are selected for testing
 - Observers may not have adverse administrative or judicial history involving dishonesty, fraud
    or drug-related misconduct
 - Observers may not have an active UIF
 - Observers may not have prior convictions by court-martial or civilian court
 - Observers may not be presently facing criminal charges in any court, aside from offenses
wherein the defendant does not have the right to trial by jury (e.g. most speeding and parking
tickets)
 - Observers may not be facing pending adverse administrative action
 - Observers may not be within six months of either separation or retirement from Government
    service
 - Observers may not have medical condition(s) that will prevent them from performing their
duties as observers

Duties:

1.      If the observer at any time observes behavior suggesting the donor is attempting to avoid
testing or tamper with the specimen bottle, the/observer will immediately notify the DDRPM or
DTPAM.

2.      The observer escorts donor to the rest room. The donor will maintain custody of the
collection cup making sure collection cup remains in the sight of the OBSERVER at all times.

3.     Instruct the donor to wash his/her hands with water only before they provide the urine
specimen.

4.      During the collection process the OBSERVER directly observes the flow of urine from
the donor's body into the collection cup only under the limited circumstances permitted by this
Instruction.

5.     The observer must be allowed to observe the donor carry the collection cup to collection
site (DDRP) staff for reading temperature.

6.     The observer must never touch or handle collection container unless the collector is
serving as observer. After the donor has completed urinating into the collection container, the
donor and the observer leave the rest room. The donor hands the collection container directly to
 92                                                                    AFI44-107 7 APRIL 2010


the collector. The observer must maintain visual contact of the collection container until the
donor hands the container to the collector

7.      The donor must allow the observer to observe the urine specimen being poured by DDRP
from the collection cup into the specimen bottle, to observe DDRP staff tightly cap the bottle,
apply the bottle security seal with date and donor’s initials.

8. The observer will remain with the donor until a urine specimen has been accepted by
collection site (DDRP) staff. If the donor is unable to give a specimen immediately, the escort
must accompany the individual to get water, coffee, etc., as instructed by collection site (DDRP)
staff, until the specimen is provided.

9. The escort and the donor will be released to return to their duty section once the specimen
collection procedure is completed.

10. The Civilian Drug Testing Program is a mandatory Air Force Program. Collection site
personnel (DDRP staff) are merely carrying out Air Force directives. Abusive, abrasive or rude
behavior will not be tolerated and any occurrence will be reported to the employee’s, applicant’s
or escort’s supervisor and commander.

11. Any questions concerning these instructions should be directed to DDRP staff.


I certify that I have read and fully understand my duties and responsibilities and am fully
qualified to perform escort duties, as specified above. I also certify that I have been
verbally briefed, viewed a physical demonstration of the process for correctly collecting a
urine specimen, and been afforded ample opportunity to question the process to assure my
full understanding of my duties.

PLEASE PRINT. YOUR NAME MUST BE LEGIBLE FOR POSSIBLE USE IN COURT
PROCEEDINGS.

CAUTION!! Should you observe the donor passing urine over the hands or fingers, attempting
to block direct observation (when authorized), or attempting to tamper with the bottle, allow the
collection to be completed and report this suspicious behavior to the collector upon return to
the collection table.

collection location with no opportunity to prepare, circumvent, or adulterate the test and
does not void his/her bladder prior to providing a sample.

2.     The escort will inform the donor that the urine specimen collection procedure must be
completed promptly, as the temperature of the specimen must be read by the collector within
Four (4) MINUTES of the sample being provided. If the temperature is not read within 4
minutes the employee/applicant may be required to provide a new specimen under direct
observation.

3.      An escort stands outside the stall door thus affording the donor privacy while providing
the urine specimen.

4.   The escort must be allowed to observe the donor carry the collection cup to collection site
(DDRP) staff for reading temperature.

5.      The donor must allow the escort to observe the urine specimen being poured by DDRP

apply the bottle security seal with date and donor’s initials and prepare specimen for shipment.

6. If the escort at any time observes behavior suggesting the donor is attempting to avoid testing
or tamper with the specimen bottle, the escort will immediately notify the collection site
supervisor (DDRPM or DTPAM).

7. The escort will remain with the donor until a urine specimen has been accepted by collection
site (DDRP) staff. If the donor is unable to give a specimen immediately, the escort must
accompany the individual to get water, coffee, etc., as instructed by collection site (DDRP) staff,

                        SAMPLE SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTIONS

1. To ensure the civilian drug testing procedure is accomplished as smoothly and as quickly as
possible and to prevent the testing designated employee from having an opportunity to delay,
circumvent or adulterate the urine collection process, THE SUPERVISOR MUST ENSURE
THE FOLLOWING:

  a. When requested by the DDRP staff, provide a SAME SEX ESCORT to accompany the
  testing designated employee directly to the collection site and to remain with the employee
  until the collection procedure is completed. (If adequate DDRP staff is available, an escort
  from the unit may not be required. Under normal circumstances, the escort will not be
  required to actually observe the collection of the urine.)

  b. Ensure the employee and escort are fully aware that once they arrive at the collection site,
  THEY MAY NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE COLLECTION PROCEDURE IS COMPLETED.

  c. Ensure the employee is aware that he/she must have a PHOTO ID, e.g. Civilian ID Card or
  Driver’s License, in his/her possession when they arrive at the collection site.

  d. Ensure the employee has been briefed that the Civilian Drug Testing Program is an Air
  Force-directed program and an UNCOOPERATIVE OR ABRASIVE ATTITUDE will be
  reported by the DDRP staff through the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager to the
  employee’s supervisor and commander.

  e. Ensure the employee is aware that he/she should report to the collection site with a full
  bladder and be READY TO PROVIDE A URINE SPECIMEN in order to expedite the urine
  collection process. If the employee has recently voided, they should drink fluids prior to
  reporting to the collection site.

  f. A COPY OF THE “NOTICE TO REPORT FOR RANDOM DRUG TESTING,”
  SIGNED BY BOTH THE SUPERVISOR AND THE EMPLOYEE, MUST BE
  PROVIDED TO DDRP STAFF UPON ARRIVAL AT THE COLLECTION SITE. The
  original is filed in the Supervisor’s Record of Employee (971) as proof the employee was
  directed for testing by the supervisor.

2. Should the employee refuse to cooperate with the drug testing program, immediately notify
your supervisor, the undersigned, and your Employee/Management Relations Specialist.

3. Any questions may be directed to the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager or Drug
Demand Reduction Administrative Manager at [phone number].

   justify similar terms in any subsequent case.

4. This Agreement gives (employee name) a “last chance” opportunity to demonstrate that he
can be a dependable, productive employee. Should he not satisfactorily complete the

constitute the complete understanding between the parties. No other promises or agreements will
be binding unless in writing and signed by all parties. This agreement may be used as evidence
