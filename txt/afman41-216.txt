instructions (paragraph 3.11.3.). Note: The JMLFDC has delayed release of the PKI/CAC
upgrade to DMLSS version 3.1.2.. Projected release is 2012. Chapter 4, SS, material was
updated to show new fields and divided for better organization. DMLSS MTF/ORG service and

(paragraph 5.31.). AM information from Chapter 5 was moved to Chapter 8. Chapter 6 remains
CAIM with minor changes. Chapter 7 is now titled CS with information previously contained in
chapter 10. Chapter 8 now contains AM procedures with new information on delayed delivery
orders (paragraph 8.19.4.6.), primary and back-up PV‘s holding backorders (paragraph
8.19.4.7.), and deferred item order/ECAT contingency ordering (paragraph 8.19.5.). Chapter 9
remains EM and includes a new paragraph on equipment depreciation (paragraph 9.19.). MA
information changed slightly and was moved to Chapter 10. Chapter 11 remains Service
Contracts with minor changes. Chapter 12 remains FM with negligible change. Chapter 13,
Reports, is new material that covers DMLSS standard reports and their use. Information from
the previous chapter 13, Data Elements and Codes, can now be found in Attachment 10. Chapter
14, Inventory Control, is a new chapter that includes management procedures for controlling
warehouse and customer inventories. Attachment 1 remains the same with minor changes.
Attachment 2, DMLSS MTF/ORG – Service and Logistics Department Details contains new
material extracted from chapter 4. Attachment 3 is new information pertaining to DMLSS user
privileges. Attachment 4 contains new procedures relating to the new Distribution and
Transportation Module available in IM, AM, and EM. Attachment 5 is now IM Pending

                                            Chapter 1

                             GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION

1.1. Purpose. The objective of the DMLSS User Manual is to provide medical logistics
personnel with the information necessary to use the system effectively, including operation of
computer hardware used in support of the system. This manual, in compliance with DoDD
8500.01E, Department of Defense Information Assurance (IA), and AFSSI 5024, Volume I, The
Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Process, also provides a high-level description of the
security procedures and mechanisms used to minimize security risks to the operational
environment of the DMLSS system.
1.2. Scope. The responsibilities for the medical logistics policy and operation are contained in
AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support. This manual documents DMLSS procedures used in
support of materiel, including War Reserve Materiel (WRM) in the Medical-Dental Division
(MDD) of the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) and non-AFWCF materiel. The
procedures in this manual apply to all DMLSS activities. Deviation from these procedures can
only be authorized by Air Force Medical Operations Agency, Medical Logistics Division
(AFMOA/SGAL), Fort Detrick, MD.
1.3. Revisions. Revisions to this manual will be accomplished when processes or application
changes occur within DMLSS. When known or suspected errors exist in instructions,
procedures, text for preparation of input data, operation of computer hardware, audit procedures,
printed output products, or other related user products, notify the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR), AFMOA/SGALD, for assistance. Changes to this publication are not
official until validated, approved through official channels, and published as an official AF
publication.
1.4. System Purpose. DMLSS is used by logistics activities to maintain accountable records for
the AFWCF/MDD, in-use and stored equipment, WRM, facility infrastructure, and real property.
These records are updated by processing transactions based on medical materiel (MM) source
documents and are maintained IAW Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) T41-04, or internal computer program criteria.
1.5. Terms and Abbreviations. Attachment 1 contains an explanation of terms and
abbreviations used in this manual. Transaction code abbreviations are listed in Attachment 10,
Table A10.2.
1.6. Sensitivity. DMLSS is an inventory control and item accounting system that maintains data
related to the assets of medical logistics accounts. Although not classified, DMLSS processes or
handles unclassified and unclassified sensitive information that requires, as a minimum,
Controlled Access Protection (Class C2) compliant security mechanisms, procedures, and
documentation. The indiscriminate access to this data could provide an opportunity for theft,
leading to the compromise of inventory accuracy, customer service, and readiness capability.
1.7. System Security.
      1.7.1. Access to the Operating System. Access to the operating system is limited to Military
      Health Systems (MHS) Service Desk personnel and DMLSS developers. All other access is
      denied unless coordination with the MHS Service Desk requires base level intervention.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   21


   1.7.2. Access to the DMLSS Application. An individual must have a unique username and
   password or a Common Access Card (CAC) enabled account to gain access to DMLSS. The
   DMLSS System Administrator (SA) is responsible for assigning a username and initial
   password, or a username with CAC enabled access to each user. Users with passwords are
   responsible for modifying their individual password during initial login. Access to DMLSS
   is denied if an individual enters an invalid username and password. The username is disabled
   after three consecutive unsuccessful login attempts. If this occurs, the DMLSS SA must log
   into the DMLSS System Administration tool to reset the disabled user‘s password. Note: The
   DMLSS user is required to log into the system at least once every 30 days, and change their
   password every 60 days.
   1.7.3. Transaction Security. DMLSS provides the ability to limit the transactions a user is
   authorized to perform. User privileges in System Services (SS) allows SAs and Application
   Security Managers to assign existing roles by username or create specific roles by application
   for a username.
   1.7.4. Transaction Security Audit Trail. The username of the individual performing actions
   in DMLSS appears on the Source Document Control Report and within Transaction History.
   These reports are maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 09.00.
1.8. External Security. Establish procedures that limit access to information contained on
source documents, output products, and other data files to only those individuals having a valid
need. Some recommended actions for ensuring system security are as follows:
   1.8.1. Follow the password protocols for DMLSS and never disclose your password or CAC
   pin to anyone.
   1.8.2. Secure all medical logistics areas when unoccupied.
   1.8.3. Limit access to input source documents and output products to those individuals
   having a need-to-know.
   1.8.4. Secure all documentation pertaining to the accountability of controlled substances and
   precious metals and limit access to a need-to-know basis.
   1.8.5. To prevent unauthorized access to the system, log off terminals when not in use.
   Users that leave terminals logged on and unattended run the risk of having unauthorized
   transactions recorded against their username.
1.9. Privacy Act Data. As a standard business practice, DMLSS does not maintain any privacy
act data with the exception of information contained in the Equipment and Technology
Management (E&TM) Loan module. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 guidelines will be used for securing this information.
1.10. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
   1.10.1. AFI 41-217, Health Information Assurance For Military Treatment Facilities,
   implements the national standards for electronic healthcare transactions and national
   identifiers for providers, health plans, and employers for MTFs. It also addresses the security
   and privacy of health data.
   1.10.2. DMLSS requires patient‘s names when using the equipment/consumable loan
   program available in the E&TM module. The Administrative Simplification provisions of
 22                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      HIPAA, which includes privacy requirements, apply to health plans, health care
      clearinghouses, and health care providers that transmit individually identifiable health
      information in electronic form. The privacy requirements limit the release of protected
      health information without the individual‘s knowledge and consent beyond that required for
      the individual‘s health care. The individual‘s personal information must be securely guarded
      and carefully handled.
1.11. DMLSS System Navigation. The first window to appear after successfully logging on is
the DMLSS System - Navigation window. This window outlines all modules available in the
DMLSS AIS.
      1.11.1. Access to Modules. Access to a particular module or process must be granted by the
      SA prior to accessing DMLSS. Users may have access to some or all modules based on their
      work requirements. Users can access any module appearing in bold text. A single click on
      the module name will launch the module.

          to utilize this site to submit trouble tickets and request assistance with difficulties
          encountered while using DMLSS.
       1.11.3.3. What‘s New. The What‘s New option explains new and updated functionality
       that has changed since the last major DMLSS release.
       1.11.3.4. About. Under the menu bar, click ―Help‖ and select ―About‖ to view local
       DMLSS system information. Current release, build number, host name, operating
       platform, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and server name are listed in this menu. This
       information is useful when establishing new remote user access or submitting a trouble
       ticket to the MHS Service Desk.
1.12. Module Menu Toolbars. Module menu toolbars are similar to the toolbar in the DMLSS
System – Navigation Window, however they contain added dropdown menus with additional
features. These toolbars include File, Navigate, Utilities, Window, and Help dropdown menus.
   1.12.1. DMLSS Window Options. Each module within DMLSS contains a window
   dropdown menu that offers user options for customizing desktop views.
       1.12.1.1. Tile Horizontal. This option allows users to display open windows from top to
       bottom.
       1.12.1.2. Tile Vertical. Select this option to view open windows from left to right.

       view, partially overlaying each other.
   1.12.2. Customize Toolbars. This option allows a user to customize the horizontal toolbar.
   The settings are specific to the user‘s login and the computer being used at the time the
   setting is applied. Only 16 toolbar items may be utilized at a time. Those using this
   function will benefit by viewing frequently used icons versus only seeing the default icons.
1.13. Shortcuts.
   1.13.1. Icons. Modules utilize shortcut icons similar to those found in other windows-based
   programs. Icons are identified with a picture and are shortcuts placed on the horizontal and
   vertical toolbars for frequently used processes. The horizontal toolbar shortcuts are used to
   access specific processes within the module. The vertical toolbar shortcuts are used to access
   specific actions within a process window.
   1.13.2. Buttons. Process buttons are available in many of the application windows. Buttons
   are identified with the name of the process function for which the button is used.

      1.13.3. Hot Key. DMLSS modules utilize shortcuts called hot keys to access processes by
      depressing a key or series of keystrokes to access a specific process. These types of shortcuts
      are found in the Navigate menu following the process name or in the Help menu.
1.14. Messages. DMLSS will display messages to users for input, output, information, or
system errors. System error messages have a text field allowing the user to type specific details
that led to the error. Users can then print the error and text field circumstances. System error
messages should be reported to the DMLSS SA or to the MHS Service Desk when they occur.
1.15. Additional Screen Help. Each application within DMLSS contains a DMLSS Help icon
on the vertical toolbar. By selecting this icon, a Help window appears displaying instructional
information associated to the process or function currently open in DMLSS. For example, if the
Equipment Management (EM) Inbox screen is open and the help contents option is selected an
online help window with an overview of the EM Inbox is displayed. Essentially, DMLSS Help
contains information similar to that covered in this manual.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    25


                                           Chapter 2

              DOCUMENT CONTROL AND FINANCIAL PROCEDURES

Section 2A—Documentation and Reports

2.1. Document Number Construction.
   2.1.1. Each document number consists of a 6-position DoD Activity Address Code/ Stock
   Record Account Number (DODAAC/SRAN) or customer account number, a 4 -position
   Julian date, and a 4-position serial number.
   2.1.2. The DODAAC/SRAN assigned to Logistics (LOG) transactions is the same
   DODAAC entered in the LOG detail record within SS. The customer account number
   assigned reflects the customer that generated the transaction.
   2.1.3. The Julian date assigned to a document number is based on the DMLSS processing
   date. For example, if you generate an action requiring a document number and the ―as of‖
   date in DMLSS is 1 July 2011, the system will assign 1182 for the Julian date portion of the
   document number.
   2.1.4. The serial number is assigned from one of the major serial number blocks found in
   Figure 2.1. These serial number blocks relate to broad categories of transactions (due-ins,
   issues, gains, losses, etc.). Each major block is further divided based on specific types of
   transactions. This method uniquely identifies each transaction processed and allows for
   sequential filing of all supporting documents for a specific type of transaction in Serial Block
   Limitations. The number of transactions processed on a specific day cannot exceed the
   numeric limitation for a serial number block in DMLSS. When all document serial numbers
   for a specific document block have been used and additional document serial numbers are
   needed for the same Julian calendar date, the system will begin assigning numbers from the
   beginning of the document block using the next Julian date.
2.2. Computer Assigned Document Numbers.
   2.2.1. In most instances, DMLSS assigns document numbers to transactions as they process
   through the system. The first transaction processed each day is assigned the first serial
   number from the appropriate block and as more transactions of the same type are processed
   during the day the serial number is incremented by one. For example, the first issue
   processed each day is assigned a serial number of 3000; the next issue is assigned 3001.
   Some transactions only use one serial number, even if multiple transactions are processed.
   They include:
      2.2.1.1. Catalog Start. Catalog revision type transactions are assigned serial number
      8997.
      2.2.1.2. Internal Transfers. Assigned serial number is 8998.
      2.2.1.3. Inventory Adjustments. All IAL/IAG actions are assigned serial number 8999.
2.3. Manually Assigned Document Numbers.
   2.3.1. In some instances, DMLSS users manually assign a document number before
   processing the transaction in DMLSS. For example, an item that is physically ordered before
 26                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      the transaction is processed in DMLSS is manually assigned a document number using the
      7000-7499 serial block.
      2.3.2. Record manually assigned document numbers on an informal document register such
      as an AF Form 36, Supply Document Register (Manual), an equivalent form, or an electronic
      spreadsheet. This action helps ensure document numbers are not duplicated.
      2.3.3. The informal register may be destroyed upon quality control of the Source Document
      Control Report IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 04.00.
      2.3.4. When manually assigning a document number to a requisition, the Julian date
      assigned needs to be the date the requisition was forwarded to the procurement source.

Figure 2.1. DMLSS Document Number Blocks.




2.4. Quality Control (QC).
      2.4.1. Supporting documents must be compared to the Source Document Control Report
      (SDCR) and MEMO Document Register prior to filing in the permanent document file. See
      Attachment 10, Table A10.3, for a consolidated table of IM and EM transaction codes cross-
      referenced to their appropriate quality control document, supporting documentation,
      transaction type, and document number block.
         2.4.1.1. SDCR. This report is produced upon request from the IM Reports module and
         lists all transactions with a DMLSS assigned document number in the specified date
         range, with the exception of catalog change actions (Figure 2.2.).
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  27


Figure 2.2. Source Document Control Report.




          2.4.1.1.1. To access this list, select Source Document Control Report from the
          Reports option in the IM navigate dropdown menu or click the Reports button located
          on the horizontal toolbar. Enter a date range and select a scope in the selection
          criteria window.
          2.4.1.1.2. This report is available in four parts: Receipts/Cancellations, Orders,
          Gains/Losses, and Funds. Use the Specify Report Selection Criteria window to print
          individual or all parts as required (Figure 2.3.). Transactions appear on the report in
          document number sequence within each section. Transaction totals are available on
          the last page of each section.

Figure 2.3. Specify Report Selection Criteria – Source Document Control Report.




      2.4.1.2. MEMO Document Register. This report is used to quality control actions
      affecting medical equipment. It lists transactions that have been assigned a document
      number and have been processed in DMLSS. This report is available under the Standard
      Inquiry section of the EM Reports module.
   2.4.2. Both the SDCR and MEMO Document Register should be requested immediately
   prior to or just after the end-of-day (EOD) process, and once it is produced, this report
   becomes a source document that is used to perform QC.
   2.4.3. QC is performed by verifying each source document against the SDCR or Document
   Register. At a minimum, each document should be checked for validity and completeness.
   If an error is found, annotate the corrective action required on the original source document
   and process necessary changes in DMLSS. Use the next available SDCR or EM Document
   Register to verify the corrective action(s) processed correctly.
2.5. Preparing Supporting Documents for File. Before placing a source document in the
permanent file, you must:
 28                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      2.5.1. Check for validity and completeness.
      2.5.2. Compare it to the SDCR or EM Document Register for accuracy and verify the
      transaction is completed.
      2.5.3. Ensure the document number is annotated on the supporting document.
      2.5.4. Annotate the processing date on the document. This information is helpful while
      accomplishing research and during audit procedures.
2.6. Filing Supporting Documents.
      2.6.1. Filing Method. File supporting documents in serial number sequence by Julian date.
      Maintain separate folders or filing areas for each block or sub block. For example, one folder
      for serial numbers 0001-2999 (receipts) and another for serial numbers 7500-7999 (excess).
      2.6.2. Filing Supporting Computer Listings. Additional guidance for filing computer listings
      is accessible from the AFRIMS website via the AF portal.
      2.6.3. Temporary Listings. Some DMLSS system output is classified as temporary and the
      distribution instructions for these items are designed to be flexible enough to satisfy local
      procedures and conditions. Temporary listings can be found in the different reports modules
      and DMLSS inboxes, i.e., the IM Status Edits Report, and each of these reports normally
      require some sort of DMLSS corrective action. These ―working‖-type listings are
      maintained in a temporary file until corrective actions have been completed and verified or
      until a new list is received IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 02.00. This process provides managers
      the option of retaining previous versions of the list containing items being worked or
      replacing them with a more current list.
      2.6.4. Permanent Listings. The term ―permanent‖ is used to distinguish listings that must be
      maintained for a designated period of time. Distribution instructions in this manual indicate
      which listings need to be retained in a permanent file. Specific retention periods are
      addressed in and maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R. For example, the SDCR is stored
      within the DMLSS server for all current and previous year actions. AFRIMS reflects that
      this document may be destroyed one year after closeout of the fiscal year (FY) to which they
      pertain. DMLSS will automatically purge these documents when the specified time
      requirements are met.
      2.6.5. Retention of SDCRs and Document Registers. After all quality control actions are
      completed and verified, printed control reports may be discarded; however, current and
      previous year SDCRs and Document Registers must be available for review and audit
      purposes. These reports are maintained within the DMLSS server and are retrievable anytime
      by accessing either the Reports modules in IM or EM.

Section 2B—Finance Procedures

2.7. Financial Overview. This section contains information and instructions on financial
processing and procedures. This includes:
      2.7.1. An explanation of the DMLSS organization and financial structure
      2.7.2. Procedures for loading funds in DMLSS
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 29


   2.7.3. Procedures for DMLSS EOP management and the Finance interface process
   2.7.4. An explanation of the Funds Control System and the Enterprise Business System
   2.7.5. Procedures for financial reconciliation
2.8. Organizational Structure. In DMLSS, the organizational structure is built, and funds
management takes place within the SS module. There are three elements to the hierarchal ORG
relationship, as shown in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4. Organization Relationship.




   2.8.1. MTF. A singular record, to which all other organization records are related. Within
   DMLSS, the MTF is also considered an Organization or ―Org.‖ Every DMLSS activity has a
   ―host‖ ORG ID that relates to their host DODAAC described within paragraph 2.1.2. It is
   also quite typically that DMLSS accounts establish multiple MTFs or Orgs in order to
   manage tenant organizations or remote facilities.
   2.8.2. Department (DEPT). Subset of the MTF or ORG record. Within the hierarchy, the
   MTF may have a relationship with multiple DEPTs; however, a DEPT can only be related to
   one MTF/ORG.
   2.8.3. SVC/CUST. Subset of the DEPT. DEPTs may have a relationship to multiple
   SVC/CUSTs; however, a SVC/CUST can only be related to one DEPT and one ORG.
   Additionally, SVC/CUSTs can be directly linked to the MTF with no DEPT relationship.
   The exception is that SVC/CUSTs must be linked to a DEPT to be used in the Facility
   Management (FM) module.
   2.8.4. Detachments. Detachments are considered separate units but can also be set up as
   organizations (ORGs). Primary examples are Air National Guard (ANG) and AF Reserve
   units.
   2.8.5. Refer to Chapter 4, System Services, paragraph 4.2. for additional procedures relating
   to managing the DMLSS organizational structure.
2.9. Financial Structure. Medical Materiel utilizes the Air Force Working Capital Fund
(AFWCF)/Medical Dental Division (MDD) revolving fund as the line of accounting used to
purchase commodities from external Sources of Supply (SOSs). These funds are identified with
 30                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


a 6B fund code and a cumulative balance is shown in DMLSS through the LOG fund. The MDD
reimbursement comes indirectly from the ordering organization‘s Operations and Maintenance
(O&M)(fund code 2X, 30, etc.) funds. These funds are loaded in DMLSS through the use of a
project center and associated Element of Resource (EORs) and managed with expense centers
and their associated EORs.
      2.9.1. LOG Fund.
         2.9.1.1. The LOG fund displays the fund position of the LOG activity. The AF LOG
         fund code should be 6B reflecting a cash source of the AFWCF/MDD. Exceptions to this
         rule apply to ANG and AFCENT DMLSS units which have dedicated O&M funding
         streams. Any other fund code for LOG must be coordinated with AFMOA/SGALD
         before loading into DMLSS.
         2.9.1.2. DMLSS also tracks financial balances within the LOG fund detail. The
         available financial balance is computed using the following formula: Target –
         (Obligations + Commitments + Credits) = Available Balance. However, because the
         AFWCF is a revolving fund, AF policy does not require a target entry. If a LOG fund
         target were entered, this amount cannot be exceeded when processing orders, price
         changes, or receipts. Target amounts are cumulative for the current FY and reset to zero
         during EOFY processing. Note: Active AFWCF/MDD accounts will not enter a LOG
         fund target. The LOG fund field in DMLSS is for information only.
         2.9.1.3. The LOG fund defaults to element of resource code 600 – Default Logistics
         Fund.
         2.9.1.4. Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.9.3. for additional procedures relating to the
         DMLSS LOG fund.
      2.9.2. Project Center. The project center is used to manage customer funds within DMLSS
      and should be considered equal to the Project Fund Management Record for DFAS
      coordination. These funds are controlled at the Element of Resource (EOR) level within the
      project center. Project centers can be related to a DEPT or to a SVS/CUST indirectly
      through the expense center. Note: EOR is a DMLSS (and Army) term. Outside of DMLSS,
      the AF uses Element of Expense & Investment Code (EEIC).
         2.9.2.1. Existing project center identification (ID) numbers are not changed in DMLSS;
         however, some data such as the project center name, target, and EOR target can be
         revised.
         2.9.2.2. New project centers can be created at anytime. To create a new MM project
         center, select ―MM Project Center‖ from the Navigate menu in SS. Enter the new project
         center, project center name, and project center target (if available). After saving, the
         project center is added to the project center table and is available when creating new
         expense centers or re-associating an existing expense center to a different project center.
      2.9.3. Expense Center. The expense center is the funding ―checkbook‖ for the SVC/CUST
      and should be considered equal to the Responsibility Center/Cost Center for DFAS
      coordination. The expense center hosts all EORs and provides a breakdown of expenditures
      and fund balances for the associated SVC/CUSTs. Activities can associate multiple expense
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    31


  centers to accommodate local business practices. While it is possible to load fund targets at
  the expense center tier, AF business requires funds targets be loaded at the project center tier.
     2.9.3.1. Funds are updated by transactions at the EOR level and then rolled up to the
     associated project center. SVC/CUSTs may have multiple expense centers, but can only
     have one default expense center. It is recommended that only one expense center be
     assigned per customer. An expense center can only be related to one project center at a
     time. If a user changes the project center associated to the expense center, all values,
     except the target value, are transferred to the new project center. This is not
     recommended as it can cause problems for DFAS, and any change must be coordinated
     between DFAS, RMO, and Medical Logistics in advance.
     2.9.3.2. Expense Center Changes. To keep financial records straight, existing expense
     center ID numbers are not changed; however, data such as the expense center name, and
     if applicable, target and EOR targets can be revised.
     2.9.3.3. Changes Associated with EOFY. Select ―Expense Center ― from the Navigate
     menu in SS. Enter the new expense center ID, expense center name, and associated
     project center. After saving, the expense center is added to the expense center table. The
     new expense center will be viewable in the nonassociate window when selecting expense
     centers for a SVC/CUST.
         2.9.3.3.1. After the EOFY processes, the new expense center can be set as the default
         within the SVC/CUST detail. Open the SVC/CUST detail, select the new expense
         center and associate it to the SVC/CUST. In the Default Expense Center field, select
         the new expense center and click ―Save.‖ The expense center is now associated to the
         customer.
         2.9.3.3.2. When a new expense center is associated to a service customer, the catalog
         records must be updated to reflect the new expense center. The expense center
         records can be updated in mass by selecting ―Change Expense Centers‖ from the
         Navigate menu in SS. Enter the SVC/CUST ID that is being changed followed by the
         old (from) and new (to) expense centers. Click the ―Process‖ icon to process the
         changes. All customer catalog records will be changed to reflect the new expense
         center.
         2.9.3.3.3. If the old expense center is no longer required, select the old expense
         center and view the details. Mark the old expense center for deletion and return to the
         SVC/CUST window. If there is no due-in/due-out information on file for the old
         expense center the expense center may be unassociated. If there are active due-outs
         still tied to the old Expense Center and DMLSS prohibits deletion, check the
         ―Retired‖ indicator within the Expense Center detail screen. Doing so prohibits
         DMLSS from using the Expense Center against any future customer objections.
     2.9.3.4. Changes at Other Times. When changing expense centers during the fiscal year,
     open the SVC/CUST detail and from the funding tab click the ―New‖ button located
     between the associate and nonassociate expense center boxes. Enter the new expense
     center ID, expense center name, and associated project center. After saving, the expense
     center is added to the expense center table and will be automatically added to the
     associate expense center box.

             2.9.3.4.1. In the default expense center field, select the new expense center and click
             ―Save.‖ The expense center is now the new default expense center for the
             SVS/CUST.
             2.9.3.4.2. If the old expense center is no longer required, select the old expense
             center and view the details. Mark the old expense center for deletion and return to the
             SVC/CUST window. If there is no due-in/due-out information on file for the old
             expense center, the expense center may be unassociated. If there are active due-outs
             still tied to the old Expense Center and DMLSS prohibits deletion, check the
             ―Retired‖ indicator within the Expense Center detail screen. Doing so prohibits
             DMLSS from using the Expense Center against any future customer objections.
             2.9.3.4.3. When a new expense center is associated to a SVC/CUST, the catalog
             records must be updated to reflect the new expense center. The expense center
             records can be updated in mass by selecting ―Change Expense Centers‖ from the
             Navigate menu in SS. Enter the SVC/CUST ID that is being changed followed by the
             old (from) and new (to) expense centers. Click the ―Process‖ icon to process the
             changes. All customer catalog records will be changed to reflect the new expense
             center.
      2.9.4. EOR. This element is used to manage and track funds at the EOR commodity class
      level. All EORs are automatically related to all expense and project centers. The values in
      project center EOR records equal the total value of the EOR of all the related expense
      centers. Every MTF catalog record is linked to a specific EOR by assignment of a specific
      commodity class when building and modifying catalog records. A translation table showing
      what EOR is assigned to each commodity class is available in the Table Maintenance Utility
      (TMU) within SS.
2.10. Establishing Organization and Fund Relationships.
      2.10.1. Establishing and revising ORG and fund record relationships are accomplished in the
      SS module. Changes to the ORG relationship occur when directed by the DFAS Field Site,
      Accounting and Finance Office (AFO), or your Resource Management Office (RMO). These
      changes must never be processed without supporting documentation and coordination. Use
      these documents to QC the DMLSS transaction on the SDCR and retain the documents in
      file.
      2.10.2. Medical Logistics personnel will coordinate with the appropriate DFAS Field Site
      point of contact prior to establishing or revising expense centers. They will provide DFAS
      with a project center number, the expense center number and the line of accounting. Proper
      supporting documentation includes either the funding document or an email message
      reflecting the project center, expense center and line of accounting. The expense center and
      line of accounting can be obtained from the MTF‘s RMO or RA.
      2.10.3. Upon receipt of supporting documentation, DFAS will load the project center and the
      new/revised expense center into the Standard Material Accounting System (SMAS) and the
      General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS-BQ) within 4-8 business hours. DFAS will
      notify the DMLSS user by email when they can load the expense center in DMLSS and start
      ordering supplies and/or equipment. Ensuring these procedures are followed will reduce
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    33


   and/or prevent transactions from rejecting in SMAS thereby improving the accuracy of your
   financial reports.
   2.10.4. Once these elements are established in DMLSS, funds can be assigned in the form of
   project center and expense center detail records.
   2.10.5. The SVC/CUST ID manages the accounts detail records in DMLSS. This ID
   number is not passed out of DMLSS for any financial processing. The SVC/CUST ID is a
   unique identifier that can be any six-digit prefix the MTF assigns. Typically, it is the same as
   the expense center; however, bases may elect to change this code to reflect any six-digit
   prefix. Examples of this prefix would be MEPRS code prefixed with numeric fillers
   (AAXB01) or the customer‘s office symbol with numeric fillers if required (SGSNOB).
   2.10.6. All customer catalog records, transaction history, and issue consumption are tied to
   the SVC/CUST. It is for this reason that once the SVC/CUST is set, there is no need for
   change. Creating a new SVC/CUST to replace an existing SVC/CUST would result in lost
   historical records for the customer. Once a SVC/CUST is established, it must be tied to at
   least one expense center.
   2.10.7. Administrative targets may be activated at any level of the expense center.
   Activation is case-by-case based on your local business practices or guidance found in AFI
   41-209. Administrative targets within the expense center are the expense center target field
   and the target amount for each EOR. This is strictly an administrative action. The funds are
   controlled by the target flag setting in the MTF ORG record.
   2.10.8. Fund targets should be loaded at the project center level, representing the highest
   level in the fund relationship. The project center window looks similar to the expense center
   window; however, it collects all of the financial data from the associated expense centers.
   Funds are increased and decreased from this window and can be stratified between the EORs.
   These changes should not be accomplished without documentation and coordination with the
   unit‘s RMO. Use the funds load sheet format shown in Table 2.1 or similar variation to serve
   as a source and QC document for each fund load. Note: Fund transfers between EORs 604
   and 615 do not require coordination.

     2.10.9. The project center target is sensitive to external SOS and can be exceeded for back
     order releases resulting from receipts. The target flag is set in the MTF/Unit detail record
     and should be set to ―PROJ EOR.‖ The targets must be entered for each project center and
     EOR code at this level. If they are not, a zero default target is enabled and the SVC/CUST
     will be unable to order.
2.11. DMLSS Funds Management.
     2.11.1. Management of funds in DMLSS is critical to system operations. The funds module
     in SS provides medical logistics and resource management the flexibility to manage most
     aspects of the MTF‘s funding for medical supplies and medical equipment. DMLSS funds
     management allows the ability to:
         2.11.1.1. View and manage funds through expense centers, project centers, and the LOG
         fund.
         2.11.1.2. Gather information on EORs and commodity classes.
         2.11.1.3. View and manage details such as commitments, obligations, and target
         amounts.
         2.11.1.4. View and manage both AM and OP funds.
         2.11.1.5. Maintain documentation on expense/project center transactions including fund
         loads (ESP, ADP, RPM, ECC, and RCC transactions). QC these documents to the funds
         portion of the SDCR and retain the documents in file (paragraph 2.4.).
     2.11.2. AM Fund. Use the AM Funds module to maintain funds associated to ―Log Owned‖
     (AFWCF) WRM assemblages. AM funds are appropriated in writing by AFMOA/SGAL for
     the purpose of purchasing new materiel or replacing existing materiel for AFWCF WRM
     assemblages.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   35


      2.11.2.1. Each AM fund detail record reflects current fund balances for the
      assemblage(s) associated to that AM fund record.
      2.11.2.2. Current AF policy dictates that only one assembly will be associated to each
      AM fund record.
      2.11.2.3. The available AM funds balance is computed using the following formula:
      Fund target – (commitments + obligations + receipts + returns) + R-sales.
   2.11.3. OP Fund. OP funds are classified as funds used to purchase Capital Equipment
   (CE); meaning, equipment with an acquisition cost greater than $249,999.99. An OP fund
   record must be established before CE requisitions can be processed in DMLSS.
      2.11.3.1. OP funds are rarely distributed to the bases but a ―pseudo‖ fund record must be
      loaded in DMLSS to allow processing of orders. Because OP funds can span a period of
      three FYs, DMLSS allows fund managers to establish and update OP fund targets for
      three FYs (current year plus two previous years.). DMLSS maintains OP fund records
      for eight years; three active and five inactive.
      2.11.3.2. The available OP balance is computed using the following formula: Program
      target – (committed + obligations).
2.12. The EOP Process.
   2.12.1. Use the different EOP processes to close out one business period and begin another.
   These processes are necessary to activate required processes, transmit files, produce
   necessary reports, back up records, and purge information no longer needed in the system.
   2.12.2. Use the EOP processing instructions found in Chapter 3, System Administration
   (paragraphs 3.12.3.-3.12.7.3.) and the End of Period Process Management window in SS
   (paragraph 4.25.-4.25.4.) to manage the end-of-day (EOD), end-of-month (EOM), and end-
   of-fiscal year (EOFY or EOY) processing cycles in DMLSS.
   2.12.3. EOD. The EOD process closes a business period and begins another. EOD is set to
   process automatically Monday through Friday at a predetermined start time. The daily
   process transmits requisition orders, posts incoming status to due-in records, performs
   follow-up processes, purges aged data, generates management reports, and performs a
   database backup. During EOD processing, DMLSS compiles financial data and sorts that
   data into several different files that are interfaced with the DFAS system. These files reflect
   transactions that have affected financial balances since the previous EOD process. The files
   are separated by Obligations (both LOG and customer), Receipts, Sales, Inventory
   Adjustments, and the Project Center balances.
      2.12.3.1. DMLSS creates up to five finance files during the EOD. The files are listed
      below and can be retrieved and viewed by accessing Materiel Management Reports
      within Business Objects (BOs) from the DMLSS main menu.
          2.12.3.1.1. 821 – ObligationsInDFAS_AF.
          2.12.3.1.2. 861 – ReceiptsInDFAS_AF.
          2.12.3.1.3. 812 – SalesInDFAS_AF.
          2.12.3.1.4. 846 – InventoryInDFAS_AF.
36                                                         AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


            2.12.3.1.5. 814 – ProjectCenterDetail_AF.
        2.12.3.2. During the EOD process, transactions are summarized by SOS type and DFAS
        document number. Transactions are written to one of the EOD files listed in paragraph
        2.12.3.1. and transmitted to DFAS. An EDI 527R transaction is transmitted for each PV
        receipt, by call number, and processed in DMLSS during the EOD period. An EDI 527E
        is transmitted for each ECAT receipt by call number.
        2.12.3.3. During the EOD, the DFAS process is activated and all transaction files are
        read. These finance transaction files are created and sent to DFAS from the DMLSS
        DCM module. The DCM keeps a record of all transmissions. DMLSS standard
        reports/BOs can be used to view financial reports for audit trails to line item level.
     2.12.4. EOM. The EOM process closes a monthly business period and begins a new
     monthly business period. The EOM is set to run automatically immediately following the
     last EOD of the month. The monthly process includes, but is not limited to, automatic
     leveling, purging of aged data, generation of management reports, and a backup of the
     database.
        2.12.4.1. During EOM processing, the finance file contains all the LOG due-in records
        and all the customer due-out records in DMLSS. Finance uses the Due-In/Due-Out
        Reconciliation file at the end of each EOM cycle to reconcile DFAS‘ data. Also during
        the EOM, the equipment that meets depreciation requirements is reported to GAFS-R via
        the Depreciation Report. This includes any gains, losses, and monthly depreciation
        amounts.
        2.12.4.2. Two files specifically produced for the monthly EOP are listed below and can
        be retrieved and viewed by accessing Materiel Management within BO from the DMLSS
        main menu.
            2.12.4.2.1. 864 – Due-In/Due-Out Reconciliation file.
            2.12.4.2.2. 821P – Depreciation file.
        2.12.4.3. Additionally, the Balance Report by Accounting Requirement Code &
        Stratification Report, Equipment Balance Report, and Due-In/Due-out Files are produced.
        These files are sent to DFAS and/or AFMOA/SGAL from the DMLSS DCM module.
        The DCM keeps a record of all transmissions. BOs can be used to view financial reports
        for audit trails to line item level.
     2.12.5. EOFY. The EOFY automatically processes after the September EOM. During the
     EOFY processing, all expense centers, project centers, and LOG fund records are reset to a
     zero balance. The LOG fund then repopulates obligations and commitments with the current
     active due-in dollar value for all external orders. The AM fund records are disassociated
     from the current year fund records and the available balance is adjusted to zero. The
     following actions automatically occur as part of the EOFY process:
        2.12.5.1. Financial records are reset.      All customer/expense and project center fund
        targets and balances are reset to zero.
        2.12.5.2. Inactive customers are deleted.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                37


       2.12.5.3. The EOFY Funds Report is generated detailing the position of the LOG fund
       and all project and expense centers.
       2.12.5.4. The FY indicator is changed and new FY financial records are started.
       2.12.5.5. A database backup is performed.
   2.12.6. Additional EOFY Procedures. In conjunction with the DMLSS automated EOY
   process, take the following into consideration:
       2.12.6.1. Obtain and adhere to all instructions received from AFMOA/SGAL.
       2.12.6.2. In IM, ensure all delivery lists are completed prior to processing the last
       September EOD or the issue transactions will not pass to Finance, which will cause
       issues posting in the new FY.
       2.12.6.3. In IM, process all AFWCF/MDD GPC receipts and issues. Each cardholder
       should reconcile purchases in the GPC register and select the ―DFAS‖ (Money Bag)
       button to ensure all Purchase Card Adjustments (PCAs) transactions are processed in the
       current FY and passed to DFAS. Note: PCAs should only be generated as a result of
       authorized transportation charges. Reference Chapter 7 for details.
       2.12.6.4. Forward the Balance List by ARC and Stratification (Strat) Report to your
       Finance POC as soon as possible. Note: Only send the FY ARC 1 & ARC 2. Line 11 of
       this report indicates medical logistics ending inventory for the reported period.
       2.12.6.5. The Medical Materiel Management Report (MMMR) is produced by Finance.
       Line 11 should be reconciled to Line 11 of the ARC Report. The ending balances on the
       30 September MMMR (Pages 1 & 2) Line 11 must agree with Line 11 of the ARC
       Report (ARC 1 & 2). It is absolutely necessary for you to coordinate closely with your
       Finance POC to ensure differences are identified and corrected so the MMMR agrees
       with the ARC.
       2.12.6.6. Validate that the new surcharge has been updated. This is typically
       accomplished by a DMLSS datapatch. To manually update or validate the new
       surcharge, open SS in DMLSS; select ―Search‖; click dropdown on Type; select
       ―Materiel Mgt‖ from dropdown menu; select ―Search‖ on the right-hand side menu and
       then, select ―Detail.‖ Update the Surcharge field accordingly.
       2.12.6.7. Either RMO or LOG loads expense and project center targets upon receipt from
       the resource manager. Customers cannot place orders until this is accomplished.
2.13. Flow of the Financial Interface. After the DMLSS financial processing is complete, the
DCM, viewable in SS, routes the financial files to the DLA Transaction Services (formerly
DAASC) where the Electronic Commerce/EDI files (EC/EDI) formats are translated into a
recognizable format and passed to the DFAS databases at Ogden. The depreciation file is then
routed to GAFS-R in the EC/EDI format. This internet protocol (IP) address and password for
DLA Transaction Services are configured into the DCM Configuration module within SS.
   2.13.1. DFAS Daily Process Flow. Orders, receipts, sales, inventory updates, cancellations,
   target changes, etc. occur daily in DMLSS. The DMLSS DFAS process runs during the
   EOD, reading the transaction history and collecting all transactions that affect a financial
   balance Figure 2.5.
 38                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         2.13.1.1. The DCM converts the financial data into EC/EDI files and transmits them
         through DLA Transaction Services.
         2.13.1.2. DLA Transaction Services converts each EC/EDI transaction set into a user
         defined DFAS file (ABJFTF with a sequence number) and sends those files to the
         appropriate DFAS system. Files that are unreadable by DLA Transaction Services are
         returned to the sending base as a transmission error in DCM. Files that fail to transmit
         will show up in the IM Inbox with a message of either Financial Failure or Transmission
         Failure. The DCM monitor at the MTF will need to resend failed files. Format Failures
         and Financial Failures will need to be analyzed and corrected by JMLFDC.
         2.13.1.3. After the DFAS system receives and verifies the data, SMAS processes the
         ABJFTF file and performs the appropriate General Ledger Account (GLA) updates.

Figure 2.5. DFAS Daily Process Flow.




      2.13.2. DFAS Monthly Process Flow. The DFAS process runs during the EOM process and
      reads the due-in and due-out table. The monthly Due-In/Due-Out EC/EDI 864 reconciliation
      file is created and is maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 04.00.
         2.13.2.1. The file is queued in the DCM for transmission to DLA Transaction Services
         who converts the EC/EDI transactions into a user-defined DFAS ABJDIF file and sends
         it to the DFAS system.
         2.13.2.2. SMAS processes the ABJDIF file, sends a copy to IAPS, and performs the due-
         in and due-out reconciliation. This is to verify the due-in and due-out records exist in
         SMAS and IAPS. Any due-in record differences between DMLSS and DFAS are
         identified on a SMAS or IAPS Report and SMAS/IAPS personnel should take the
         appropriate action to correct the difference with the assistance of Logistics personnel (if
         required). The due-out values by expense center are totaled and compared to the Funds
         Control function of SMAS. Any differences are posted as RDO transactions and passed
         onto GAFS-R for expense center due-out (obligation) updates Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6. DFAS Monthly Process Flow.




2.14. Funds Control System. DMLSS finance files are first received and processed against the
DFAS‘ Funds Control portion of the SMAS. The Funds Control System performs the following
functions:
   2.14.1. Performs initial edit checks of the transactions. Note: DMLSS transaction codes are
   translated by Funds Control into a Transaction Identification Code ―TRIC‖ which could be
   different then what shows in DMLSS.
   2.14.2. Updates financial data based upon transactions sent from DMLSS.
   2.14.3. Routes the transactions to either SMAS or the Integrated Accounts Payable System
   (IAPS). Vendor Pay (local purchase) type of transactions are passed to IAPS. This includes
   ESD, RRD, RND, and price changes for items ordered via Contracting, Blanket Purchase
   Agreements (BPAs), and Decentralized BPAs (DPBAs). All other transactions are processed
   by SMAS. SMAS updates the General Ledger Account (GLA) records and passes on
   customer obligation and expense transactions to the General Accounting Finance System-
   Rehost (GAFS-R).
2.15. SMAS. The following categories of transactions are processed by SMAS:
   2.15.1. Transactions related to inter-fund billing (billings between government agencies).
   These transactions include ESD, PCZ, RRD, and DQC type transactions for all sources not
   handled by IAPS. SMAS also processes the above transactions for purchase card buys and
   maintains due-ins until receipt. Government Purchase Card (GPC) receipts delete the due-in
   and post the receipt value to a suspense accounts payable general ledger account (GLA). The
   payment of GPCs is accomplished through IAPS with the payment information passed to
   SMAS to reduce the GPC suspense accounts payable account and update other appropriate
   general ledger accounts.
   2.15.2. All transactions that affect financial inventory balances (general ledger account
   codes (GLACs) and stratification of the AFWCF/MDD stock record account are processed
   by SMAS. This includes inventory increases, decreases, and price changes as well as issues,
   receipts, and all adjustments.
2.16. IAPS. Due-in and receipt transactions related to local purchase through BPA/DBPA and
Contracting (SOS Type Code ―CON‖) are first routed to IAPS for processing and then to SMAS
for GLA updating. Transaction rejects in IAPS are not passed to SMAS for posting until the
reject is corrected and processed.

2.17. Enterprise Business System (EBS). The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) uses the
automated EBS to account for electronic orders, receipts, and invoices associated to materiel
purchased from a DLA source. DLA sources consist of Prime Vendor (PV), ECAT, and other
depot orders using SOS code ―SMS.‖ Electronic Data Interface (EDI) files are transmitted to
EBS and vendor by DMLSS.
      2.17.1. The following files are transmitted from DMLSS to EBS and/or vendors during each
      End of Period (EOP) process: (The transfer status should be monitored daily using the SS
      DMLSS Communication Manager (DCM) feature referenced in Chapter 4, paragraph 4.20.)
         2.17.1.1. EDI 850 – Requisition file (vendor and EBS). This occurs when the order is
         placed. Non-submit orders send only a pseudo 850 to EBS.
         2.17.1.2. EDI 527R – PV receipt/cancellation file by call number (EBS only). This file
         contains line item detail receipt records.
         2.17.1.3. EDI 527E – ECAT receipt file (EBS only). This file contains line item detail
         receipt records.
         2.17.1.4. EDI 860 – Cancellation request file (vendor and EBS).
      2.17.2. The following files are transmitted to EBS and/or DMLSS from vendors: (These
      files appear in DCM and must be monitored daily to ensure successful processing of
      incoming status.)
         2.17.2.1. EDI 855 – Order confirmation file (DMLSS and EBS).
         2.17.2.2. EDI 856 – Shipping confirmation file (DMLSS and EBS).
         2.17.2.3. EDI 865 – Cancellation confirmation file (sent to DMLSS and then DMLSS
         sends cancellation to EBS using the 527R file).
2.18. Improving Financial Management Effectiveness. DMLSS users have a responsibility
to protect both the AFWCF/MDD and the MTF O&M resources. Effective use of the following
DMLSS processes and management tools make this possible.
      2.18.1. Catalog Records. Understand the relevance of building correct catalog records and
      updating fields correctly before processing transactions in DMLSS. Pay particular attention
      to the following:
         2.18.1.1. Refund Code. AFWCF/MDD customer‘s orders must be funded with only a
         few exceptions (i.e. requested TRIMED excess). Thus, DMLSS default for customer
         orders/issues are ―reimbursable/refundable‖ (refund code R). Logisticians must have
         authorization to change the default from refund code ―R‖ to ―N‖ (non-refundable). Note:
         When building catalog records in DMLSS, logisticians can select/check the ―free‖
         indicator box. This action automatically defaults the refund code to ―N‖ for both
         AFWCF/MDD receipts and customer orders/issues. Remember, refund code ―N‖ issue
         transactions must be authorized.
         2.18.1.2. SOS Type Code. A catalog record must be linked to a Source of Supply (SOS)
         code in order to execute orders in DMLSS. Within the SOS code, logisticians must select
         a SOS Type code. The SOS Type code determines what SOS code is passed to DFAS and
         which DFAS system the transaction is routed to for updates (SMAS, IAPS, etc.), in turn,
         it directly effects obligations, billing, and reporting.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                41


  2.18.2. Status Updates. Review status carefully. It is very important to review, work, and
  process ―status edits‖ because they communicate what is coming or actions that have taken
  place. For example, logistics orders an item from GSA. DLA Transactions Services reviews
  it to see if the request can be obtained in the DoD supply chain. If the DoD can supply the
  item, the order is rerouted to that DoD agency and DLA Transaction Services sends status to
  the ordering account of the ―reroute‖ so they can update their records (SOS). If logistics
  doesn‘t update DMLSS with the ―new‖ source and DMLSS then sends a follow-up back to
  the original source (GSA in this example), GSA will send ―BF‖ status which means ―no
  record of your requisition.‖ A status of ―BF‖ cancels the due-in and logistics will likely
  reorder and eventually receive two orders instead of one. This creates ―excess.‖
  2.18.3. Promptly communicate and resolve erroneous DMLSS transactions with Finance.
  All DMLSS (AFWCF/MDD) transactions that affect balances, price changes, or inventory
  stratifications pass to DFAS for financial updates. These DFAS ―financials‖ are the
  AFWCF/MDD official records that are reported to AF, DoD, and Congress. For this reason,
  knowing the correct transaction to process for a given action is very important. For example,
  processing a combination price and unit of issue change transaction which requires ratios
  can cause your account to increase (or decrease) inventory in the millions or billions of
  dollars if accomplished incorrectly. Transactions were developed for a specific reason and
  should be used for those purposes.
  2.18.4. QC the Funds portion of the SDCR (paragraph 2.4.).
  2.18.5. Monitor the DCM daily to verify financial files are transmitted to DFAS without
  error. (Chapter 4, paragraph 4.20).
  2.18.6. Report discrepancies found when comparing the monthly BalanceInDFAS_AF
  Report to the Medical Materiel Management Report (MMMR).
  2.18.7. Utilize DMLSS standard reports along with DMLSS DFAS BO reports will assist
  with reconciling with DFAS. DFAS BO reports can be accessed from the DMLSS main
  navigation window. Click ―BO‖ and select the Materiel Management subheading. The BO
  program opens and displays the BO Standard Report viewer. You can select a report from
  the viewer or close the viewer to create your own report. The following is a list of DFAS
  reports available in this view option:
     2.18.7.1. Sales in DFAS. Identifies sales transactions transmitted for an entered date
     range. Reports the transaction codes and the document numbers used to create the sales
     transaction. DMLSS sales and issue transactions can and will be rolled together, when
     predetermined information is identical, to create one interface sales transaction. This
     report will show the interface transaction to SMAS as well as the DMLSS detail
     transaction that make up the single sales transaction.
     2.18.7.2. Obligations in DFAS. Identifies obligation transactions transmitted for an
     entered date range. The obligation transactions include increases, decreases, and price
     changes to LOG obligations and customer obligations. LOG obligations are orders to
     outside sources. Customer obligations are orders to LOG. The report will reflect the
     obligation transaction update sent to DFAS and the DMLSS transactions that make up the
     obligation transaction. This report will reflect transactional information along with the
     document numbers used to create the obligation transaction.
42                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


     2.18.7.3. 527R Tailored Vendor Relationship (TVR) PV Receipts By Call. Lists PV
     orders by call number. This report contains the call number, contract number, SOS code,
     transmission indicator, and total price. Once PV receipts are processed in DMLSS, the
     527R is generated after three EOD cycles. Receipts are not reversible once the 527R is
     generated.
     2.18.7.4. DFAS Document Number. Enter the DFAS document number and receive a
     listing of all transactions and their document numbers that make up that transaction.
     2.18.7.5. Receipts in DFAS. Identifies receipt transactions transmitted for an entered
     date range. Reports the transaction codes and the document numbers used to create the
     receipt transaction. These are LOG receipt actions and are normally one for one.
     2.18.7.6. Inventory in DFAS. Identifies inventory transactions transmitted for an entered
     date range. The report will show the transaction passed to SMAS and the DMLSS
     transactions that are rolled together to make up the inventory transaction. For example,
     instead of 100 PCZ transactions, DMLSS will pass a single net change transaction. The
     old price or new price will be .01 and the opposite price will be the net change plus a
     penny. This report will reflect transactional information along with the document
     numbers used to create the inventory transaction.
     2.18.7.7. Balance List by Accountability Requirements Code (ARC) Stratification. The
     Balance List by ARC Stratification reflects the DMLSS inventory balance position for
     the selected month. The BO report name is BalanceInDFAS_AF. The report resembles
     the DFAS‘ MMMR and is maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 31.00.
     2.18.7.8. Project Funds Management Record (PFMRs). In DFAS, report will reflect the
     project center‘s detail status that has been reported to DFAS.
     2.18.7.9. Depreciation in DFAS Report. Depreciation in DFAS Report will reflect the
     EM Module transactions used to make up the values reported to GAFS-R in the
     depreciation interface.
     2.18.7.10. Expense Center Details and Project Center Detail Reports. The Expense
     Center Details and Project Center Detail Reports will show the transactions for the date
     range entered that affected the funds for that date range. If the beginning of the FY date
     is used as a start date and the current date is used as an end date, the values should match
     details in the Expense/Project Center Fund record displayed in SS.
     2.18.7.11. AM Funds Detail Report. The AM Funds Detail Report will do the same
     thing for AM funds that the expense center and project center reports do for customer
     funds.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  43


                                          Chapter 3

                            SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION (SA)

3.1. Scope. This chapter contains instructions for site system administrators managing the
DMLSS automated information system (AIS). Also, specific information is provided to ensure
the secure operation of the DMLSS AIS by using system privileges and protective mechanisms.
These safeguards control access to administrative functions, help avoid security violations, and
minimize the opportunity for improper use of administrative functions that would compromise
the trusted computing base (TCB) and user security.
3.2. SA Responsibilities. The MLFC ensures a primary and alternate SA are assigned in the
DMLSS AIS. Site SAs have to complete various tasks in order to keep the server secure and the
database operating smoothly (see Table 3.1.). The following paragraphs include additional
responsibilities performed on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

Table 3.1. System Backups and Maintenance Procedures.

 Daily              DMLSS performs the daily EOP automatically. Ensure a backup tape is
                    inserted into the tape drive after each EOP cycle and retain 3 weeks‘ worth
                    of backup tapes. This equates to 15 tapes for those bases that process EOP
                    cycles Monday – Friday (paragraph 3.15). Note: Sites with the newer
                    Dell PowerEdge R710 server/LTO Ultrium 3/4 tape drive should refer to
                    paragraph 3.15.

 Weekly             Clean once per week. Use each cleaning tape for 30 cleanings.

 Monthly            DMLSS performs the monthly EOP automatically. Note: Monthly EOP
                    data is written to the same tape as the final daily of the month. Additional
                    tapes or storage requirements are not required.
                    Audit Backup – See below.

 Audit              Run on the 1st day of each month or more often (as directed in the SA
                    Tool) depending on the size of the facility. Store audit backups for one
                    year, and up to seven years, if possible. Approximately 12-20 are required
                    each year depending on the size of the facility. Note: Sites with the newer
                    Dell PowerEdge R710 server/LTO Ultrium 3/4 tape drive should refer to
                    paragraph 3.14.2.1..

 System recovery    No system recovery tape is needed for OTR servers.

 System reboot      The server should be rebooted once each month and whenever directed to
                    do so by AFMOA/SGALD or JMLFDC (paragraph 3.8.8.1.).

   3.2.1. Daily Responsibilities. In addition to the requirements in Table 3.1., SAs should
   perform the following ongoing or daily activities:
44                                                       AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


        3.2.1.1. User Management. This function includes adding new users, unlocking users,
        and resetting passwords. Adding new users to the DMLSS environment will likely be
        one of the most frequent tasks you will perform as an SA. (paragraph 3.5. and 3.7.).
        3.2.1.2. Peripheral Device Management.      This includes managing printers and other
        devices (paragraph 3.9.).
        3.2.1.3. Monitor Services and Process Dates. A list of services and process dates appear
        on the System Administration home window. Each of the services or processes listed has
        a corresponding message and colored box to indicate its status. Together, the table
        provides a complete overview of the server‘s resources and whether or not DMLSS
        processing is up-to-date (paragraph 3.4.2.3.).
        3.2.1.4. Manage Backups. Backups are the first line of defense against the loss of
        valuable information. The DMLSS server and database files are automatically backed up
        daily at 23:40 PM, Monday through Friday (paragraph 3.14.).
        3.2.1.5. Manage Tutorial Databases: DMLSS tutorial databases are ―sanitized‖ copies of
        your production database and may be used for practicing or testing of procedures without
        affecting actual DMLSS conditions. Orders will not actually be transmitted as the IP
        addresses for your trading partners have been removed. DMLSS SAs manage these
        tutorial databases (paragraph 3.11.3.).
        3.2.1.6. Facility Management Responsibilities. SAs with a Facilities Management
        Administrator role assigned in the SA Tool have additional responsibilities assigned in
        the SA Tool (paragraph 3.13.).
     3.2.2. Weekly Responsibilities. The SA should clean the tape drive and monitor disk usage
     on a weekly basis (paragraphs 3.8. and 3.16.).
     3.2.3. Monthly Responsibilities. Refer to Table 3.1. and paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15.
     3.2.4. Additional Responsibilities.
        3.2.4.1. Site SAs must provide initial and annual DMLSS specific training to users
        emphasizing security, awareness, and training.
        3.2.4.2. IAW AFI 41-209, paragraph 1.2.6.1.4., site SA‘s must ensure appropriate
        management controls are in place to minimize occurrences of fraud, negligence, and
        theft. Specifically, SAs should develop policy/procedures regarding DMLSS access, to
        include the following:
            3.2.4.2.1. Ensure DMLSS users (including Medical Logistics, custodians, clinicians,
            etc.) do not have access to functions outside of their scope and span of control.
            Review the organizational chart and compare it to the User Summary or equivalent
            report. To the fullest extent possible, determine that single person(s) are not
            responsible for all functions. Note: Organizations with limited resources to segregate
            duties should have compensating controls, such as supervisory review of transactions
            performed. For example, periodically run the ―Receipts and DueIns by Same User‖
            BO report.
            3.2.4.2.2. Review a system-generated list of inactive logon IDs, and determine why
            access for these users has not been terminated. SA‘s can produce list of DMLSS
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   45


          users (e.g. use the ―Status_of_DMLSS_Users‖ standard report located in the System
          Services universe or the DMLSS Users Summary) to verify deletion of unwanted
          accounts.
          3.2.4.2.3. Verify that all unnecessary accounts are deleted. This includes terminated
          employees or users with emergency/temporary access to DMLSS.
       3.2.4.3. As warranted, monitor the security of DMLSS using the Database Audit Report
       located in the SA Tool.
       3.2.4.4. Verify EOP tapes are produced on a daily basis and a tape back-up system is in
       place. This includes 3 weeks of backup tapes (15 tapes), at least 1 year of audit tapes (12
       tapes), and an inventory record of backup tapes. A tape back-up system should consider
       when and how files are rotated off site (e.g. advancing natural disaster, etc.), retention
       periods, and security involved in transport.
3.3. DMLSS Website (Intranet). The DMLSS server at each site has a portion allocated as a
Web server area, referred to as the DMLSS website. This is the area where the SA Tool resides,
as well as other important links.
3.4. SA Tool Overview. The SA Tool is the backbone of DMLSS that supports personnel as
they perform DMLSS tasks. It provides the ability to manage the server, its external devices,
backup the database, and manage DMLSS users. All of these responsibilities are maintained in a
secure environment.
   3.4.1. Access the DMLSS server webpage. In the Internet Explorer address line, enter
   https:// and the server name or internet protocol (IP) address of your DMLSS server. Read
   the DoD notice and consent banner and select the ―Click Here to Continue‖ button.
       3.4.1.1. DMLSS Start Page. The DMLSS Start Page (Figure 3.1.) displays when you
       access the webpage for your DMLSS server. SAs use this page to install DMLSS
       software, log on to the SA Tool, and access standard links. Note: Users do not have to
       log-in to access the DMLSS Start Page. All users may access user documentation or use
       Assign User CAC information.

Figure 3.1. DMLSS Start Page.

        3.4.1.2. All SA Tool screens contain a navigation pane on the left side containing Task
        Areas, Quick Links, and DMLSS Links. Task Areas contain links to other menus, where
        SA activities are performed. Options vary in this section depending on the links chosen.
     3.4.2. Access the DMLSS SA Tool. In the Navigation pane, under the list of Quick Links,
     click ―SA Tool.‖ The DMLSS System Administration window opens (Figure 3.2). Use this
     page to log on to the SA Tool or change a password. SAs enter their username and password
     in the indicated fields and then click the Log In button. The DMLSS SA Home window
     displays.

Figure 3.2. DMLSS System Administration Window.




        3.4.2.1. The System Administration Home window (Figure 3.3) displays after logging
        onto the SA Tool. Just like the DMLSS home page, the Navigation Pane includes a list
        of Task Areas, Quick Links, and DMLSS Links; however, the Task Area in the SA Tool
        has additional menus that are used to manage SA activities. Each page contains a title and
        description in the header, along with path used to get to the current page. Whenever you
        are within the SA Tool, you can click on the DMLSS logo to return to the SA Home
        window. Note: If the SA Tool is not used for a few minutes, the session expires, and
        users are prompted to log in again. Remember to log off. Navigating to another website
        does not log you off automatically. To log off on any page in the SA Tool, simply click
        ―Exit‖ on the list of Quick Links located on the left side navigation pane.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  47


Figure 3.3. System Administration Home Window.




      3.4.2.2. SAs have full access to all the menus in the SA Tool, with the exception of the
      FM menu. Only those with the FM Administrator role will also have access to the
      Facility Management menu. Standard user cannot access the SA Tool, but a standard
      user with the FM Administrator role will have access to the FM menu.
      3.4.2.3. Services and Process Dates. The list of Services and Process Dates are both
      critical sections on the System Administration home window. As the name indicates,
      ―Services‖ shows the services available on the server, while ―Process Dates‖ displays the
      most recent dates that particular processes have run on the server. Monitoring both of
      these areas is a key responsibility of the SA.
         3.4.2.3.1. If Services/Process Dates are enabled, working, or up-to-date, a green box
         is displayed. A yellow box indicates a warning. If resources are disabled, at a critical
         stage, or processes have not run, a red box appears. For example, the Volume status
         box reports available disk space. If one of the two drives falls below 20%, the
         Volume status box will turn yellow. If the volume falls below 10%, the box turns
         red. In both instances, the message *Contact the MHS helpdesk* appears.
         3.4.2.3.2. Any non-green status needs to be addressed immediately. Also, in some
         cases, the precise value or entry is not significant, but variances from the routine
         should be investigated or reported to the MHS Service Desk.
         3.4.2.3.3. Clicking on the red box with a yellow star will display the page within the
         SA Tool where the problem might be resolved or where more information might be
         available.
         3.4.2.3.4. Scheduler Status reflects the number of DMLSS-related jobs currently
         running in the scheduler (database). They are listed to the right of the Enabled/Green
 48                                                         AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


            status. If the number of jobs is greater than zero, the text is clickable and will display
            the new View Running Scheduler Jobs page when clicked.
            3.4.2.3.5. Audit Backups. Periodically, a message under Process Dates indicates the
            backup threshold has been reached with a status of ―Backup of Audit Required, Last
            Status,‖ followed by the date the last backup was run and a red indicator. If this
            occurs, the user should go to the Manage Backups menu and click the ―Backup Audit
            Data‖ menu item (paragraph 3.14.2).
3.5. Manage Users. The first drop down menu in the SA Tool Task Area is Manage Users
(Figure 3.4.). It is used to manage the accounts of DMLSS users by including some of the most
common tasks performed by SAs. The following options are available from this menu:

Figure 3.4. SA Manage Users Menu.




      3.5.1. Create DMLSS User Account (Figure 3.5.). Use this function to set-up new DMLSS
      user accounts. Each DMLSS user must have a unique account consisting of a username and
      password, or a username with approved access via CAC, to use the system. As of 30
      September 2010, DoD Policy JTF-GNO CTO 07-15 Rev 1 requires you to use a CAC to log
      in. Exceptions are allowed only by arrangement with the local DMLSS SA. Note: The
      JMLFDC has delayed release of the DMLSS version 3.1.2., PKI/CAC upgrade. Projected
      release is 2012.

Figure 3.5. Create DMLSS User Account page.




         3.5.1.1. Username requirements. The assigned username must contain no more than
         eight characters. The unique name may be all alphabetic characters, or a mix of
         alphabetic and numeric characters provided the first digit is an alphabetic character.
         Usernames cannot contain any special characters, hyphens, periods, or underscore.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    49


      3.5.1.2. Password requirements. SAs have the option of creating a password that is used
      with the username to gain access to DMLSS. Passwords should be exactly 15 characters
      in length since PDAs/HHTs do not allow for passwords longer than 15 characters.
      Additionally, they must contain at least two numeric characters, at least two alphabetic
      uppercase letters, at least two alphabetic lowercase letters, and have at least two printable
      special characters (not the same). Additionally, a new password may not be any of the
      last 10 passwords used with the associated username.
      3.5.1.3. Create a password enabled user. After entering a valid username and initial
      password, select the correct user type−User or Admin. Then add any of the three user
      roles that apply−Database Audit Reviewer, System Audit Reviewer, and/or Facilities
      Management Administrator. After selecting the user type and user roles, click ―Create
      User.‖ DMLSS provides a message screen informing the SA whether or not the account
      was created or if any errors occurred. The most common reasons for failure are the new
      password does not meet the password creation rules, a typing error may have occurred
      when typing in the password twice, or the username already exists. Click ―OK‖ to
      continue. Note: New users must change their temporary password at the next login.
      3.5.1.4. Create a CAC-enabled user. SAs may choose to create a new user account with
      access via the CAC by first establishing a username and then checking the Allow access
      via CAC box. Select the correct user type−User or Admin, and then add any of the three
      user roles that apply−Database Audit Reviewer, System Audit Reviewer, and/or Facilities
      Management Administrator. After selecting the user type and user roles, click ―Create
      User.‖ DMLSS provides a message screen informing the SA whether the account was
      created or any errors that occurred. Click ―OK‖ to continue. Note: Once a user is CAC-
      enabled, they will not be able to log-in via a user ID and password.
          3.5.1.4.1. After the DMLSS SA successfully creates a CAC-enabled user, the new
          user accesses the DMLSS Start Page and selects the ―Assign User CAC information‖
          link located under Common Activities. The Assign User CAC information screen
          appears (Figure 3.6.) and the user enters their Username and clicks ―Submit.‖ After
          the results message ―Success: Please close this window‖ appears, click the ―X‖ in the
          upper right corner to close the window.

Figure 3.6. Assign User CAC information screen.




          3.5.1.4.2. After a user assigns their CAC information, the SA returns to the Manage
          Users menu and selects Manage CAC Access. From this screen, the SA performs a
          search for the new user. Using the View and update CAC access screen (Figure 3.7.),
 50                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             the SA selects the user(s) and then clicks the ―Approve selected user‖ link from the
             list of update actions. Note: The CAC status must be ―Pending‖ before it can be
             approved. On the approve message screen click ―Yes‖ or ―No.‖ On the Manage
             CAC Access screen under the message, ―The following users have been approved for
             CAC access,‖ click ―OK.‖ The Manage CAC Access screen will display with the
             CAC status ―Approved.‖ The DMLSS SA can exit the SA Tool.

Figure 3.7. View And Update CAC Access Screen.




      3.5.2. Manage DMLSS User Accounts. This option allows the administrator to perform a
      variety of management functions, such as updating roles, resetting passwords, locking and
      unlocking users, promoting, demoting or deleting users, and reactivating or expiring user
      accounts.
         3.5.2.1. The User Search screen (Figure 3.8.) is the first screen displayed and its purpose
         is to allow the user an opportunity to narrow the search results to a more concise list
         based upon the needs of the requestor. By entering a value in the Search Criteria entry
         field and/or selecting the type of user desired from the drop down menu, a more narrow
         answer field can be produced. The default for type of user is All Users. This allows an
         SA to either view or print a list of all active and expired users associated to the DMLSS
         database. Other types include: Active users, Locked Users, Expired Users, Locked and
         Expired Users, System Administrators, FM Administrators, or Audit Reviewers

Figure 3.8. User Search Criteria Screen.




         3.5.2.2. After a query is executed, the search results are provided together with columns
         of status that assist SAs with the management, security and integrity of the DMLSS
         system (Figure 3.9.). A Print button is also available to launch a PDF version of the list
         which can be viewed and printed.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   51


Figure 3.9. Manage DMLSS User Accounts/Search Results Screen.




      3.5.2.3. Once the list of users is displayed. all of the user actions also become available
      for use. They are: set temporary password, lock users, promote users, reactivate users,
      update roles, delete users, unlock users, demote users, expire users, and unlock all users.
         3.5.2.3.1. Set temporary password. Use this function to set a temporary password for
         one or more selected usernames. This process forces a password change the next
         time the user logs into DMLSS.
         3.5.2.3.2. Delete users. This option allows the SA to delete selected user accounts
         (for example, when a user is transferred to another assignment or location). All roles
         and applications should be removed in the application prior to deleting the user on the
         server or else the system will ―ghost‖ users on the application side. Database access
         permissions are revoked when a user account is deleted, and users cannot log onto the
         DMLSS server. If necessary, users can be recreated. To delete a user account, click
         ―Manage DMLSS User Accounts‖ and then display the user(s). Select the users and
         click ―Delete Users.‖ Click ―Yes‖ on the prompt, ―Are you sure you want to delete
         the following users?‖, and a confirmation message displays indicating the user was
         deleted. You can also delete a user account through the Manage User Accounts in
         DMLSS window. SAs cannot delete their own account; another SA-level user must
         perform this action.
         3.5.2.3.3. Lock users. This function allows the SA to lock selected users. The user
         receives the message, ―Your account is locked.‖ Locked users cannot log onto the
         DMLSS system. To regain access, they must have the SA unlock their username.
         SAs can perform a search to identify all ―Locked Users.‖ As a result, username status
         and lock date fields will appear on the search results screen.
         3.5.2.3.4. Unlock users. Use this function to unlock selected users.
         3.5.2.3.5. Promote users. This option allows an existing user to be promoted to SA
         status. If a user has been a logistics user, but is moving to a position with System
         Administrator responsibilities, use this function instead of creating a separate account.
         3.5.2.3.6. Demote users. This function allows a SA to demote an existing SA to
         logistics user level status. If a user has been a DMLSS SA, but is moving to a
         position with no SA responsibilities, use this function rather than creating a separate
         account. SAs may not demote themselves to a typical-user level; another SA-level
         user must perform the action.
         3.5.2.3.7. Reactivate users. Use this option to reactivate selected inactive DMLSS
         users. An inactive user account is one in which the users password is expired. Note:
         The DMLSS user is required to log into the system at least once every 30 days, and
         change their password every 60 days.
 52                                                         AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             3.5.2.3.8. Expire users. Use this option to expire passwords of selected DMLSS
             users. An inactive user account is one in which the users password has expired. This
             list also reflects the number of days since expiration. A SA would use this list to
             determine which accounts require reactivation and which accounts should be deleted.
             3.5.2.3.9. Update roles. Use this option to update auditor roles for the selected
             DMLSS users. The available roles for DMLSS users are Database Audit Reviewer,
             System Audit Reviewer, and Facilities Management Administrator. Check the
             appropriate box(es) on the Manage DMLSS User Accounts/Update roles–update
             screen and click the Update roles button.
             3.5.2.3.10. Unlock all users. Use this option to unlock selected users.
      3.5.3. List Connected Users. To view the List Connected Users, select the List Connected
      Users option in the Manage User menu. SAs can view or print the Connected UsersID along
      with Program, Server, Start Time and Duration information.
      3.5.4. Manage Dormant Users. To view the Manage Dormant Users select the Manage
      Dormant Users link in the Manage User menu. The results screen offers the opportunity to
      delete selected dormant users.
      3.5.5. Manage Dormant User Period. This option allows the SA to define the number of
      days a user account must be inactive to be displayed on the Manage Dormant Users page.
      Type the new dormant days setting and click the ―Save Days Dormant Settings‖ button. The
      default is set at 180 days.
      3.5.6. Disconnect Users. Click the ―Disconnect all Users‖ bar to disconnect all users that are
      currently using the DMLSS Client application.
      3.5.7. Manage CAC Access. This screen together with the Create a DMLSS user option
      provides a full range of management options for controlling the CAC process. This window
      is used to approve selected users, reject selected users, reset CAC information, enable C AC
      usage and disable CAC usage (Figure 3.10.).

Figure 3.10. Manage CAC Access Results Screen.




         3.5.7.1. Create a new CAC-enabled user. (paragraphs 3.5.1.4.-3.5.1.4.2).
         3.5.7.2. CAC-enable an existing user. To CAC-enable an existing user, the SA first
         performs a search in the Manage CAC access. Using the results, the SA marks the
         checkbox of the selected user(s) and clicks the enable CAC usage link located above the
         search results. Two confirmation screens follow−click the ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ button on the
         first screen; click ―OK‖ on the next.
             3.5.7.2.1. Once the DMLSS SA completes this step, he/she notifies the new user(s).
             The user then opens the browser with his/her CAC card in the reader and accesses the
             DMLSS Start Page. Under the Common Activities section the user will click the
             ―Assign User CAC information.‖ The next screen, Assign User CAC information
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   53


           screen, is used to associate a DMLSS username with his/her CAC. To do this, enter
           the Username and click ―Submit.‖ If the process was successful, a screen appears
           with a results message of ―Success: Please close the window.‖
           3.5.7.2.2. After the User completes the Assign User CAC procedures, the DMLSS
           SA accesses the Manage CAC access task area, selects the user(s) and clicks the
           ―Approve selected users‖ link. The CAC status must be ―Pending‖ to be approved.
           Two confirmation screens follow–click ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ on the first screen; click ―OK‖
           on the next. After this action, the Manage CAC screen displays with CAC status of
           Approved.
       3.5.7.3. Reject selected users. The SA rejects CAC-username pairings if they are
       invalid. If the recorded CAC certificate‘s distinguished name is not a match for the user,
       the SA must reject it. It might also be necessary to reject the request if the SA cannot
       validate the user as someone that should have access via CAC. Only users with status
       ―Pending‖ may be rejected. On the Users screen, select the user(s) and click the ―Reject
       selected user‘s‖ option. Two confirmation screens follow – click ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ on the
       first screen and ―OK‖ on the next. After this action, the Manage CAC screen displays
       with CAC status of ―Rejected.‖
       3.5.7.4. Reset CAC information. The DMLSS SA uses this option to reset the certificate
       distinguished name information associated with an account. On the Users screen select
       the user(s) and then click the ―Reset CAC information‖ option. Two confirmation
       screens follow – click ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ on the first screen and ―OK‖ on the next. After this
       action, the Manage CAC screen displays with CAC status of Enabled, not approved.
       From this point, refer to and follow the instructions outlined in paragraphs 3.5.7.2.1. and
       3.5.7.2.2.
       3.5.7.5. Disable CAC usage. Use this function to disable selected user(s). On the Users
       screen select the user(s) and then click the ―Disable CAC usage‖ option. Two
       confirmation screens follow – click ―Yes‖ or ‖No‖ on the first screen and ―OK‖ on the

         3.12.1.3. Start UDR Load. In the event that the UDR Delta Process (paragraph 3.12.2.)
         cannot be used, contact the MHS Service Desk to request that either a DMLSS Extract
         CD-ROM be sent by overnight mail, or that the latest UDR table extract be laid on your
         DMLSS server. If the table extract file is applied, instructions for processing will also be
         furnished by either the MHS Service Desk or AFMOA/SGALD. Use the CD-ROM and
         start a full UDR load by specifying the CD Drive to be used and clicking ―Start‖ to
         initiate the UDR process.
      3.12.2. Manage Delta UDR. The UDR Delta Process is a web-based process that uploads
      catalog updates to the DMLSS production servers. In this screen, status is provided to see
      when the last UDR Delta Run processed with additional buttons to view UDR delta logs, set
      the automatic indicator, enable/disable the delta process, view detailed properties, and start
      the UDR load.
         3.12.2.1. In general, the UDR Delta Process should be enabled and set to Auto.
         However, in the Manage Delta UDR window, SAs can click ―Set to Auto‖ or ―Set to
         Manual.‖ The UDR Delta Properties group will be updated to indicate whether UDR
         Delta is set to run automatically.

      3.12.3. DMLSS End of Period (EOP) Processes. DMLSS EOP processing automatically
      provides the necessary reports, activates the required processes, backs up the required
      records, and purges the information no longer needed in the system. Note: Use this
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                65


   information in addition to the EOP processing instructions found in Chapter 2, Document
   Control and Financial Procedures, (paragraph 2.12.) and the End of Period Process
   Management window in SS (paragraph 4.25.-4.25.4.) to manage the end-of-day (EOD), end-
   of-month (EOM), and end-of-fiscal year (EOFY or EOY) processing cycles in DMLSS.
   3.12.4. View Logs. Use this link to view or print logs for the EOP process. This window
   shows a summary for each of the next scheduled EOP processes. It also provides EOP status
   for the daily, monthly, and yearly runs with ―View History‖ and ―View Detail Log.‖ SAs
   can view or print the detail log data in PDF format. FM has its own EOP processes that run
   independently of the general DMLSS EOP processes.
   3.12.5. Run Daily EOP Process. End-of-Day (EOD) processing transmits unsent executed
   orders, posts incoming status to due-in records, performs follow-up processes, produces the
   receipt file and transmits it to legacy systems, purges aged data, generates management
   reports, and performs a database backup. Normally, each of this process is run automatically
   based on a schedule set up in SS. However, you can also start the processes manually from
   the Run Daily EOP Process window (Figure 3.23). SAs may only process a manual EOD
   when first directed to do so by either the MHS Service Desk or AFMOA/SGALD.

Figure 3.23. Run Daily EOP Process Window.




      3.12.5.1. Reset Lock. In general, the DMLSS EOP processes run automatically, and
      when they are running, users are locked out of the DMLSS applications. This button
      allows the SA to override the lockout process, so that users can still use DMLSS, even
      though the EOP processes have been started. Contact the MHS Service Desk first, and
      then click ―Reset Lock‖ to reset the EOP lock. If successful, the message ―EOP locks
      have been reset‖ appears. If the Status of End-of-Period indicator is ‗Running‘ and
      Status of End-of-Period Locked are ‗Locked‘ the message, ―Warning: EOP status
      indicates that EOP is both running and locked. Clicking Override EOP Locks below will
      reset both flags and may leave EOP data in an invalid state‖ appears with another set of
      buttons to confirm the override EOP locks or Cancel.
      3.12.5.2. This window also allows the SA to enable or disable the EOD process. In
      general, the DMLSS EOD process is run automatically, and should be enabled. To
      change this process, click the appropriate ―Enable EOD‖ or ―Disable EOD‖ button.
      3.12.5.3. SAs can also use the Run Daily EOP Process screen to start the EOD process
      manually by selecting ―Start‖ located below the Action [Process MM Daily] heading. A
      user message is automatically sent out to other DMLSS users, to warn them that the EOD

        process will begin in ten minutes. After ten minutes, the process begins, and users are
        locked out of the DMLSS application suite until the EOD is complete. SAs may only
        process a manual EOD when first directed to do so by either the MHS Service Desk or
        AFMOA/SGALD.
     3.12.6. Run Monthly EOP Process. End-of-Month (EOM) processing includes automatic
     leveling, purging of aged data, generation of management reports, and a backup of the
     database. Normally, each of this process is run automatically based on a schedule set up in
     SS. However, you can also use the SA Tool to start the processes manually. SAs may only
     process a manual EOM when first directed to do so by either the MHS Service Desk or
     AFMOA/SGALD.
        3.12.6.1. Reset Lock. In general, the DMLSS EOP processes run automatically, and
        when they are running, users are locked out of the DMLSS applications. This button
        allows the SA to override the lockout process, so that users can still use DMLSS, even
        though the EOP processes have been started. Contact the MHS Service Desk first and
        then click ―Reset Lock‖ to reset the EOP lock. If successful, the message ―EOP locks
        have been reset‖ appears. If the Status of End-of-Period indicator is ‗Running‘ and
        Status of End-of-Period Locked are ‗Locked‘ the message, ―Warning: EOP status
        indicates that EOP is both running and locked. Clicking Override EOP Locks below will
        reset both flags and may leave EOP data in an invalid state‖ appears with another set of
        buttons to confirm the override EOP locks or Cancel.
        3.12.6.2. This window also allows the SA to enable or disable the EOM process. In
        general, the DMLSS EOM process is run automatically, and should be enabled. To
        change this process, click the appropriate ―Enable EOM‖ or ―Disable EOM‖ button.
        3.12.6.3. SAs can use the Run Monthly EOP Process screen to start the EOM process
        manually by selecting ―Start‖ located below the Action [Process MM Monthly] heading.
        A user message is automatically sent out to other DMLSS users, to warn them that the
        EOM process will begin in ten minutes. After ten minutes, the process begins, and users
        are locked out of the DMLSS application suite until the EOM is complete. Click on the
        proper checkboxes at the bottom of the page to run the desired process(es). SAs may
        only process a manual EOM when first directed to do so by either the MHS Service Desk
        or AFMOA/SGALD.
     3.12.7. Run Yearly EOP Process. End-of-Year (EOY) processing resets financial records,
     starts new fiscal year financial records, database backup, generates a report detailing the
     position of the log fund and all project centers and expense centers, cancels any orders that
     have not been submitted for processing, cancels any IOUs that do not have any associated
     due-in, and zeroes out targets for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funded organizations.
     Normally, this process is run automatically based on a schedule set up in SS. If the EOY
     process has failed, contact the MHS Service Desk immediately. Under no circumstance
     should you ever manually start the EOY cycle, unless directed to do so by either the MHS
     Service Desk or AFMOA/SGALD.
        3.12.7.1. Reset Lock. In general, the DMLSS EOP processes run automatically, and
        when they are running, users are locked out of the DMLSS applications. This button
        allows the SA to override the lockout process, so that users can still use DMLSS, even
        though the EOP processes have been started. Contact the MHS Service Desk first, and
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  67


       then click ―Reset Lock‖ to reset the EOP lock. If successful, the message ―EOP locks
       have been reset‖ appears. If the Status of End-of-Period indicator is ‗Running‘ and
       Status of End-of-Period Locked are ‗Locked‘ the message, ―Warning: EOP status
       indicates that EOP is both running and locked. Clicking Override EOP Locks below will
       reset both flags and may leave EOP data in an invalid state‖ appears with another set of
       buttons to confirm the override EOP locks or Cancel.
       3.12.7.2. This window also allows the SA to enable or disable the EOY process. In
       general, the DMLSS EOY process is run automatically, and should be enabled. To
       change this process, click the appropriate ―Enable EOY‖ or ―Disable EOY.‖ button.
       3.12.7.3. SAs can use the Run Yearly EOP Process screen to start the EOY process
       manually by selecting ―Start‖ located below the Action [Process MM Yearly] heading. A
       user message is automatically sent out to other DMLSS users, to warn them that the EOY
       process will begin in ten minutes. After ten minutes, the process begins, and users are
       locked out of the DMLSS application suite until the EOY is complete. Click the proper
       checkboxes at the bottom of the page to run the desired process(es). Under no
       circumstance should you ever manually start the EOY cycle, unless directed to do so by
       either the MHS Service Desk or AFMOA/SGALD.
   3.12.8. Prime Vendor Interface (PVI) Import. Prime Vendor Requisition Status data can
   either be imported from a removable storage device on the DMLSS Server, or from a file on
   your workstation. Use this option to copy a file from a client machine or database server to
   the DCM input table. Inside the import window, select the import source: ―Server‖ or ―My
   Machine.‖ If importing from the server, select the removable storage device from the
   dropdown list in the Source group. If importing from your local machine, click ―Browse‖ to
   select the file to import. Click the >>Copy>> button to import the file.
   3.12.9. PVI Export. Prime Vendor Requisition Status data can either be exported to a
   removable storage device on the DMLSS Server, or to a file on your workstation. Use this
   process to copy a file from the DCM table to the server or client machine. If you are
   exporting to the server, connect or insert the storage media. Inside the export window, select
   the export destination: ―Server‖ or ―My Machine,‖ and then select the files to copy from the
   Source List. If exporting to the server, select the removable storage device from the drop
   down list in the Destination group. If exporting to your local machine, then click the
   >>Export>> to open a dialog box and specify the export location. Note: AF policy does not
   allow the use of removable storage devices.
   3.12.10. View PVI Logs. To view the PVI logs, click ―View PVI Logs‖ in the Manage
   Medical Materiel window. A PDF file displays in your browser, with the log information for
   PVI. You can view or print the log.
3.13. Facility Management Menu. The Facility Management menu allows users to perform
FM-specific management functions such as running manual end-of-period processes, exporting
FM data to the Joint Medical Asset Repository (JMAR), and managing users who have access to
upload/delete computer aided design (CAD) drawings in the DMLSS database (Figure 3.24). To
access the Facility Management menu you must be a DMLSS SA or have the ―Facilities
Management Administrator‖ role assigned to your user ID within the SA Tool. To access this
window, click ―Facility Management‖ under the list of Task Areas.

Figure 3.24. Facility Management Menu Window.




      3.13.1. Run Nightly End-of-Period. FM EOP processing runs independently of the general
      DMLSS EOP processing. FM EOD processing is also called the nightly process. It normally
      runs automatically at 1 minute after midnight every day, 365 days per year. If the FM Nightly
      fails due to a power outage, server problem, etc., you may run it manually using this menu
      option. Use this link to start the process manually by clicking ―Start‖ under the Action
      [Process FM Nightly] heading in the Run Nightly End-of-Period window.
      3.13.2. Run Monthly End-of-Period. FM End-of-month (EOM) processing is also called the
      monthly process. The EOM process performs two specific tasks. It creates the ―PM
      Scheduled Work Pending‖ reminder message and the ―RC Scheduled Work Pending‖
      reminder. The FM EOM process normally runs automatically at 00:01 AM. If the FM
      Monthly fails due to a power outage, server problem, etc., you may run it manually using this
      menu option. Use this link to start the process manually by clicking ―Start‖ under the Action
      [Process FM Monthly] heading in the Run Monthly End-of-Period window.
      3.13.3. Export FM Data to JMAR. The Export FM Data to JMAR process performs the
      single task of sending updated data on Facility Inventory, Real Property Installed Equipment
      (RPIE) Inventory, Room Inventory, Projects, and Requirements to the DoD JMAR. The
      ―Export FM Data to JMAR‖ process normally runs automatically as part of the Medical
      Materiel (MM) Monthly EOP process, which runs at the date/time established for each month
      in the EOP module of System Services. However, if the MM Monthly process fails due to a
      power outage, server problem etc., the SA may run the ―Export FM Data to JMAR‖ process
      manually using this menu option. To export FM data to JMAR, select ―Export FM Data to
      JMAR‖ and then click ―Start‖ under the Action [Process JMAR Export] heading.
      3.13.4. View or Purge End of Period Logs. SAs use this option to view the process logs,
      identify any errors that may have occurred, and purge process logs. In this window, the FM
      EOP status is displayed with three options for each process: view automatic process logs,
      view manual process logs, and purge logs. Click the desired button and a PDF file displays in
      your browser, with the process logs. You can view or print the logs.
      3.13.5. Manage FM CAD Administrators. This option is used to assign users to the FM
      CAD Administrator group. Users who belong to this group and have the FM CAD
      Administrator role (within the System Services UP Assign module) assigned to their user ID
      will be able to perform specific tasks related to the management of the electronic CAD
      drawings in the DMLSS-FM system.
      3.13.6. Display FM Help Information. Use this link to display FM help information. A PDF
      file download window appears. You can view or print the information.
3.14. Manage Backups Menu. The DMLSS server and database files are automatically backed
up daily at 23:40 PM. If an automatic backup fails, or if you are preparing to upgrade the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    69


DMLSS software, you can also run the backups manually. In the Manage Backups window
(Figure 3.25.), SAs can run backups and view the backup logs. To access this window, click
―Manage Backups‖ under the list of Task Areas.

Figure 3.25. Manage Backups Menu Window.




   3.14.1. Manage Backup Settings. Use the Manage Backup Settings link to select the days of
   the week that backups are scheduled to run. To change the Backup Process Settings, simply
   mark the checkbox(es) of the day(s) of the week that backups should run. Users can
   select/deselect individual days, or click on the ―Select all days‖ button to select all days, or
   the ―Clear all days‖ button to deselect all days. After selections are complete, click ―Save
   Settings.‖ Note: Backups should be scheduled Tuesday through Saturday, unless directed
   otherwise by AFMOA/SGALD or JMLFDC.
   3.14.2. Backup Audit Data. The Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requires
   that Oracle Database Audit records, Oracle Archive Logs, OS Event Logs, and Web Server
   Logs be backed up and kept for a period of 1 year. DMLSS provides sites with the capability
   of periodically backing up this Audit data to tape.
      3.14.2.1. This audit data is stored on the file system under D:\STIG_AUDITS. Once this
      directory reaches a threshold of 25 gigabytes (GB), a flag is set in the database. The next
      time an SA uses the SATOOL, the ―Home Page‖ will display a red indicator box, beside
      the text reading ―Last Audit Log backup.‖ This red box indicates that it is time to backup
      the sites audit data. It is important to note that there is currently a five day grace period
      that the SA has in order to complete this Audit backup. On the sixth day the audit data
      will be purged from the file system in order to conserve space and the next cycle will
      start. The SA could choose to backup the Audit Data before the 25 GB threshold is
      reached by navigating to the ―Audit Backup Page‖ and running the backup as described
      above. This is not recommended because more Audit tapes than necessary will be
      required throughout the year. Note: Sites with the newer Dell PowerEdge R710
      server/LTO Ultrium 3/4 tape drive should use the LTO Ultrium 3/4 Data Cartridge
      backup tape and the LTO Ultrium cleaning tapes. One tape (1.6 terabyte capacity) can
      hold 6 months of audit backups.
      3.14.2.2. SAs initiate the backup by properly labeling a tape designated for the audit
      backup, inserting the tape into the server, and clicking ―Backup Audit Log‖ on the Audit
      Backup Page. It will take about 2.5 hours to backup 25 GB. The <Refresh Status> button
      will keep the SA apprised of the elapsed time.
   3.14.3. Backup DB/Server. The DMLSS server is configured to automatically back up the
   file systems on a nightly basis. The Database Scheduler will archive and empty the Windows
   Event Logs nightly, and there is no administration required at the site. Event logs are
   automatically archived and cleared nightly.

         3.14.3.1. SAs insert a tape in the tape drive each day to ensure the backup information is
         available if required. Each activity should have a three week rotation of tapes at a
         minimum.
         3.14.3.2. To view a detailed log of the most recent backup of DMLSS server and
         database files, click ―Backup DB/Server.‖ A frame appears in your browser with backup
         details and log information for the last 2 database backup attempts (Figure 3.26.). Click
         ―Print‖ and a PDF file appears in your browser with the log. You can view or print the
         log.

Figure 3.26. Backup DB/Server Window.




         3.14.3.3. When a backup processes successfully, the tape automatically ejects. When the
         tape fails to eject, the common cause is that the backup failed. Verify whether or not the
         automatic backup worked. If it failed, use the Backup DB/Server window to perform a
         manual backup. Initiate the backup by properly labeling a tape designated for the
         database/server backup, insert the tape into the server, select ―TAPE‖ from the Backup
         Device dropdown menu and click ―Start Backup.‖
         3.14.3.4. If you need to recover a file system, contact the MHS Service Desk. A systems
         administrator at MHS who is responsible for recovering file systems can perform this
         task remotely in coordination with you. The SA Tool does not provide this capability.
3.15. Data Tapes.
      3.15.1. Only DDS5, 4mm (72GB) Digital Audiotape (DAT) tapes should be used in the
      DMLSS system, to ensure that the data fits on one data tape. Note: Sites with the newer
      Dell PowerEdge R710 server/LTO Ultrium 3/4 tape drive should use the LTO Ultrium 3/4
      Data Cartridge backup tape and the LTO Ultrium cleaning tapes. LT0 tapes are inserted into
      the tape drive and stay there for one week storing 5 consecutive end-of-day backups onto the
      1.6 terabyte LTO4 backup tape prior to ejecting.
      3.15.2. Data tapes that are used frequently wear out and lose their recording ability. SAs
      should track the life of these tapes and create a replacement schedule where all tapes are
      replaced according to manufacturer specification. For example, if the manufacturer states
      their tapes are tested to withstand a minimum of 100 full backups, and there is a three week
      rotation, calculate an appropriate replacement schedule. Replacing them every year would
      greatly underutilize each tape. In this scenario, replacing them at three years would be more
      cost effective and still not extend them beyond their life expectancy.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  71


   3.15.3. Tape backups will fail if the tape is set to write-protect. Do not set backup tapes to
   write-protect unless you are directed to do so by the Military Health Systems (MHS) service
   desk or DMLSS program personnel. Make sure labels are stuck to the cartridge in the label
   areas, and do not stick more than one label onto each label area. Extra labels can cause the
   cartridges to jam in the tape drive.
   3.15.4. Backup tapes should be stored in a secure location away from the DMLSS server,
   and safeguarded against fire, moisture, high electrical currents, and reuse. Label all used
   tapes with the type and date of backup, DMLSS build number, and the name of the person
   performing the backup.
3.16. Cleaning Tape Drives.
   3.16.1. The DAT tape drive(s) on the DMLSS server should be cleaned at least once a week
   using a Dell compatible DAT72 cleaning tape (see note in paragraph 3.15.1). Specifically,
   for the DAT tape drive, 4 Millimeter (mm) head cleaning tape or comparable is
   recommended. To use this type of tape, simply insert the tape into the tape drive. The tape
   runs automatically for 30-60 seconds, and then self-ejects. If it doesn‗t self-eject, eject it
   manually. Note: Sites with the newer Dell PowerEdge R710 server/LTO Ultrium 3/4 tape
   drive should use the LTO Ultrium 3/4 Data Cartridge backup tape and the LTO Ultrium
   cleaning tapes.
   3.16.2. The number of cleanings that any particular DAT72 (magnetic) cleaner provides
   varies from brand to brand. When the cartridges are worn out, it is the responsibility of the
   site to order additional tape drive cleaning supplies.
3.17. Troubleshooting. If you have questions or problems with DMLSS, use the following
resources (in order) to find solutions:
   3.17.1. For network-related problems, contact your local network administration support
   group.
   3.17.2. For DMLSS-related problems, contact the regional DMLSS SA or MHS Service
   Desk.
   3.17.3. For problems with equipment purchased under the Dell contract, the MHS Service
   Desk can contact Dell for support.
   3.17.4. For problems with equipment not purchased under the Dell contract, use the
   appropriate contract vehicle in place for that specific piece of equipment.
3.18. MHS Service Desk. The MHS Service Desk assists the DMLSS System Administrator in
resolving problems with the application software, and relays hardware and operating system
software-related problems to Dell. When calling the MHS Service Desk, you will be asked to
provide the following information:
   3.18.1. Application being used [for example, Inventory Management (IM), FM, Customer
   Support (CS) or PVI].
   3.18.2. User‘s name.
   3.18.3. User‘s location (that is, hospital name).
   3.18.4. User‘s telephone number.

      3.18.5. Description of problem.
      3.18.6. Hardware failure (workstation or server).
      3.18.7. Server serial number.
      3.18.8. Software failure (workstation or server).
      3.18.9. Detailed explanation of all error messages displayed.
      3.18.10. The MHS Service Desk will assign a ticket number to the problem call. Please
      make a note of this ticket number for future reference.
3.19. RF Networks.
      3.19.1. RF Networks manage communication between the DMLSS system and the RF
      hardware, such as Hand Held Terminals using RF technology. Air Force sites use the 2.4
      GHz PDAs and existing RF local area network (LAN) infrastructure. The range of the 2.4
      GHz Access Point devices is quite limited (typically 200 to 300 feet) and resides within the
      base perimeter.
      3.19.2. Each Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) has a single RF network. An RF controller
      attached to the MTF‘s LAN communicates to a series of base radio units, which can transmit
      and receive data to and from any PDA on the MTF site.
3.20. System Access Points Security. The DMLSS system must be configured properly to take
advantage of all security features. For optimal security, use the DMLSS-recommended settings
on your Access Points and PDAs.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  73

                                 SYSTEM SERVICES (SS)

4.1. Purpose.
   4.1.1. SS encompasses many of the controls required for users to navigate throughout
   DMLSS. On the server side, SS automatically supports several types of background
   processing for all DMLSS applications. On the PC application side, SS does the following:
       4.1.1.1. Supports security for the other applications (User Privileges). The DMLSS SA
       provides the appropriate level of access to the system when medical logistics personnel
       and supply or equipment custodians require access to DMLSS. Specific privileges are
       assigned to users based on the information obtained from the DMLSS System User
       Appointment Letter. The SA or Application Security Manager must be familiar with the
       management of user privileges before attempting to assign user privileges. Instructions
       for loading new users is explained in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.5. and Chapter 4, paragraph
       4.17.
       4.1.1.2. Controls the data accessed in the TMU application, archive management, and
       MTF/Organizational setup and management.
       4.1.1.3. Allows SAs to monitor and interact with some processes generally managed on
       the server; such as EOP processing and DCM.
   4.1.2. Some thought and care should be given prior to assigning privileges for the SS
   module. Most of the SS functions play a direct role in how the DMLSS organizational
   structure, funds, document control, EOPs, and interfaces are managed. It is highly
   recommended that only experienced logisticians with knowledge and training be afforded
   privileges to these functions.
4.2. Organizational Structure. Materiel and funds managers must be familiar with the
organizational structure in DMLSS. The three main components to this structure, MTF/Unit
(ORGs), DEPTs, and SVC/CUSTs, are based on a set of hierarchal rules and parent-child
relationships (The financial aspect of this design is covered in Chapter 2, Document Control and
Financial Procedures, paragraph 2.8.). Use the Tree View, Search, MTF/Unit, Department and
Service/Customer modules to understand, and review or make changes to your MTF's
organization structure.
4.3. DMLSS Auditable Changes. Business rules require several processes of the MTF/Unit
module to be audited by DMLSS. Certain changes made in these audited areas are captured
along with the date, user ID, and other information viewable from the Transaction History
window. Document numbers are also viewable when the transaction is saved.
   4.3.1. ECC and RCC transaction codes are used for this requirement and are generated when
   establishing and revising records within the logistics‘ department and service detail records,
   plus MTF/Unit, Department, and SVC/CUST detail records.
   4.3.2. The transaction codes are intended for user-initiated additions or changes that affect
   the following data elements: Appropriation Fund type code, default expense centers, ORG
   IDs, ORG types, materiel ownership codes, and level algorithm changes.

4.4. Tree View. The Tree View Record Selection window displays a hierarchy view of all
MTF/Units and suborganizations that DMLSS manages for your site. Use TreeView to browse
your site‘s organizational structure, open an organizational record, print the TreeView display, or
move a SVC/CUST from one DEPT or MTF/Unit to another. TreeView icons represent the
associated customer level within the MTF. Figure 4.1, reflects the TreeView icons and proper
hierarchal structure using ORG, DEPT, and SVC/CUST.

Figure 4.1. Tree View and Hierarchal Structure of ORG, DEPT, and SVC.




      4.4.1. ORG. MTF/Unit (Org) records are the highest level within the organizational
      structure. The main MTF/Unit that supports the logistics DEPT is the log account −
      identified by an ORG type code of ―LOG‖ and ―(LOG)‖ at the end of its name. The Log org
      has the Stock Record Account (SRA) DODAAC assigned as the Organizational ID. Other
      ORGs may be created to identify units supported by the SRA and/or MTF such as ANG and
      Reserve units. Within the Tree View, ORGs are identified by a full pie.
      4.4.2. Department. Department is the next level within the hierarchal structure. One or
      more departments can be assigned to a single ORG. This level of the structure further
      identifies the local MTF‘s organizational assignment of its SVC/CUSTs. Within TreeView,
      Departments are identified with a half pie.
      4.4.3. SVC/CUST. The SVC/CUST is the lowest level within the organizational structure.
      The SVC/CUST directly identifies a customer being supported by LOG under the ―host‖ or
      other ORG. The SVC/CUST must be associated to an ORG but it is highly recommended
      that all SVC/CUSTs be associated to a department that is, in turn, associated to an ORG.
      Within TreeView, SVC/CUSTs are identified with a quarter pie.
4.5. Search. The SS Search function provides a method to search for MTF/Unit or
suborganization records to review, update, and/or print lists of organizational records. The
Organizational Search window appears by clicking the ―Search‖ icon located on the horizontal
toolbar or by selecting ―Search‖ from the SS Navigate menu. Search criteria available for use
includes: ID (SVC/CUST, ORG, or DEPT ID), Name, Type (Customer Type), Identifies for Ext
Cust, MOF Cust, Reachback, and Spoke, Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System
(MEPRS) Code, Office Symbol, Unit Identification Code (UIC) (assigned to Maintenance
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  75


Activities), and Cost Center. All records are displayed if search fields are left empty/blank and
the search icon located on the vertical toolbar is selected. Double click on a specific
organizational record or highlight the record and click on the ―Details‖ button located on the
vertical toolbar to view and/or modify details of that record.
4.6. MTF/Unit. Multiple MTF/Unit (ORG) records can be created and maintained in a single
DMLSS database; however, only one can be assigned as the LOG (FMxxxx). The LOG DEPT is
also associated to all other logistics services, i.e. Medical Maintenance Activity (MA). Note:
See Attachment 2, DMLSS MTF/ORG – Service and Logistics Department Details for a
complete description of these details. The information and associations that you edit or create
here affect many things throughout the DMLSS system. As a user of MTF/Org, you have the
following qualifications. To ensure the integrity of the organizational structure, it is
recommended that only Medical Logistics Flight Commanders, Medical Logistics
Superintendents, and/or the Medical Logistics Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)
be afforded the authority to create new and modify existing MTF/Unit records. Prior to creating
an MTF/Unit detail record, review the on-line help function to identify required information and
validate all data prior to creating the detail record.
   4.6.1. Creating New MTF/Unit (ORG) Records. To create a new ORG record, select
   ―MTF/Unit‖ from the SS Navigate dropdown menu. The Basic tab of the MTF/Unit Detail –
   (New) window appears. Follow recommendations explained in paragraph 4.6 to create a new
   ORG record. Note: Existing ORG records can also be accessed from this window by using
   the Find button located on the vertical toolbar.
       4.6.1.1. Basic Tab. At a minimum, complete all required fields. While the Target Flag
       is not identified as a mandatory field, AF activities must set the Target Flag to ―Proj
       EOR.‖ At the bottom of the basic tab, all new MTF/Unit (ORG) details must be
       associated to the correct Primary Support Activities. Refer to Attachment 2, DMLSS
       MTF/Org – Service and LOG Dept Details for a description of each service detail. Upon
       saving data in the Basic tab, the remaining tabs become available.
       4.6.1.2. Department Tab. In the DEPT tab, use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to associate
       and/or disassociate DEPTs to/from the MTF/Unit. Click the ―Details‖ button between
       the windows to view an existing DEPT‘s record. Click the ―New‖ button to create a new
       DEPT. If both the associated and nonassociated boxes are empty, then no DEPTs were
       linked to the MTF/Unit when the new DEPT record was created.
       4.6.1.3. SVC/CUST Tab. In the SVC/CUST tab, use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to
       associate and/or disassociate SVC/CUSTs to/from the MTF/Unit. Click the ―Details‖
       button between the windows to view an existing SVC/CUST‘s record. Click the ―New‖
       button to create a new SVC/CUST. If both the associated and nonassociated boxes are
       empty, then no SVC/CUST records were linked to the MTF/Unit and/or DEPT when the
       new SVC/CUST record was created.
       4.6.1.4. FM Installations Tab. In the FM Installations tab, use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to
       associate and/or disassociate an FM installation to/from the MTF/Unit. An FM
       installation should always be associated to the LOG DEPT but it is not necessary to be
       associated to MTF/Unit records assigned as ORG types.
 76                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         4.6.1.5. Assemblages Tab. The Assemblage tab provides a list of assemblages
         associated to the MTF/Unit. If no assemblages are associated to the MTF/Unit then this
         tab is not available.
      4.6.2. Existing MTF/Unit Detail Records. Using the Search function, access existing
      MTF/Unit (ORG) detail records by selecting ―ORG – Med Facility/MTF‖ in the Type field
      and then clicking on the ―Search‖ icon. All ORG records are displayed in the Organizational
      Search selection window. This list includes the LOG DEPT record. To access only the LOG
      DEPT record using the Search function, select ―LOG – Logistics Dept‖ in the Type‖ field
      and click ―Search.‖ Double click a record or highlight one and click on the ―Detail‖ button
      to access the MTF/Unit Detail window for the specified ORG. Existing ORG records can be
      modified and/or marked for deletion. To undelete an ORG record, click in the Mark For
      Deletion box to remove the check and the ORG record becomes usable.
4.7. Department. Departments are in the center of the organizational structure. Using the LOG
DEPT (MTF/Unit record) as an example, you could create a Department for each squadron
within the MTF (i.e. Aerospace Medical Squadron, Dental Squadron, Medical Operations
Squadron, and Medical Support Squadron) that are associated to the LOG MTF/Unit.
      4.7.1. Creating New Departments. To create a new Department record, select ―Department‖
      from the SS Navigate dropdown menu. The Department Detail – New window appears.
      Follow recommendations explained in paragraph 4.6. when creating new records. An
      existing MTF/Unit or ORG record must be immediately associated to the new Department.
      Upon associating to a MTF/Unit record, certain data fields in the Department record will
      automatically populate and the remaining fields become available. After saving data in the
      Basic tab, the SVC/Cust and Funding tabs become available. Note: Existing Department
      records can also be accessed from this window by using the Find button located on the
      vertical toolbar.
         4.7.1.1. Basic Tab. The DEPT ID, Name, and Military Service fields are the only
         mandatory fields in the Basic tab; however, all fields should contain valid information if
         possible. Theoretically, the DEPT ID should correlate to the DEPT Name (i.e. DEPT ID
         ―MDSS01‖ could be used to identify the DEPT Name ―Medical Support Squadron‖).
         Once data is saved to the Basic tab, the SVC/CUST and Funding tabs become available.
         4.7.1.2. SVC/CUST Tab. Use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to associate and/or unassociate
         existing SVC/CUST records to the DEPT. Select the ―Detail‖ button to view detailed
         data for SVC/CUST records. Select the ―New‖ button to create a new SVC/CUST
         record.
         4.7.1.3. Funding Tab. Use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to associate and/or unassociate
         existing project center records to the DEPT. Select the ―Detail‖ button to view detailed
         data for a project center record. Select the ―New‖ button to create a new project center
         record. Refer to paragraphs 4.10. and 4.14. for an explanation on creating new project
         centers.
      4.7.2. Existing Departments. Using the SS Search function, select ―DEPT – Department‖ in
      the Type field and click on the ―Search‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. All existing
      DEPT records are displayed in the Query/List Record Selection window. A check in the
      ―DEL‖ column indicates that the DEPT record is marked for deletion and cannot be used. To
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  77


   access a DEPT record, double click a record or highlight one and click on the ―Detail‖
   button. In the DEPT Detail window, data fields can be modified and the DEPT can be
   marked for deletion by checking the ―Mark for Deletion‖ box. To undelete a DEPT, click in
   the same box to remove the check and the DEPT becomes available for use.
4.8. Service/Customers. Service/Customers are at the bottom of the organizational structure.
These types of records should be associated to a Department. For example, Service/Customer
(SVC/CUST ID) accounts xx5245, xx5761, and xx5741 could be associated to the Medical
Support Squadron department and in turn, associated to the LOG MTF/Unit record.
Additionally, the Service/Customer is at the lowest end of the financial structure; meaning all
Service/Customer accounts must be associated to an expense center and that expense center must
be associated to a project center. These relationships are considered ―one-to-many‖ relationships
because multiple customers can be associated to a single expense center and multiple expense
centers can be associated to a single project center. Customer requests are not allowed if any of
these links are broken.
   4.8.1. Creating New Service/Customers. To create a new Service/Customer record, select
   ―Service/Customer‖ from the SS Navigate dropdown menu. DMLSS immediately prompts
   you to assign the associated MTF/Unit and Department. While the department association is
   not mandatory, it is highly recommended that one be associated at this time to maintain a
   clear and concise organizational structure. Upon associating to a MTF/Unit and department,
   the Service/Customer Detail (New) window appears (Figure 4.2.). Upon entering and saving
   mandatory data in the Basic and Materiel tabs, the Funding tab becomes available. The
   Submission tab becomes available if either the ―Reachback‖ or ―DCAM‖ indicators are
   checked on the basic tab. If the Svc/Customer is associated to a customer owned
   assemblage, the Assemblage tab becomes available listing all associated assemblages. Note:
   Existing Service/Customer records can also be accessed from this window by using the Find
   button located on the vertical toolbar.

Figure 4.2. Service/Customer Detail – (New) – Basic Tab.




      4.8.1.1. Basic Tab. The SVC/CUST ID, SVC/CUST Name, and Military Service fields
      are the only mandatory fields in the Basic tab; however, all fields should contain valid
      information if possible. Associate the custodian‘s POC record in the POC field.
      Custodians should be assigned POC type codes DMLSS User and Custodian.
      4.8.1.2. Materiel Tab (Figure 4.3.). The Default Location field is the only mandatory
      field in the Materiel tab; however, all fields should be completed if possible. A Default
      location must be assigned prior to saving changes and making the remaining tabs
      available.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                79


Figure 4.3. Service/Customer Detail – (New) – Materiel Tab.




          4.8.1.2.1. Computation Method. Policy prescribes the computation option should
          always be set to ―Days of Stock.‖
          4.8.1.2.2. Days/Inv. Freq. The days and inventory defaults are set to 7 and 3 days
          respectively. These numbers indicate how many days of stock the customer will
          maintain and how many times within that period the customer will conduct an
          inventory (produce an order). For example, if the defaults are maintained, the
          customer will produce 3 orders within each 7 day period.
          4.8.1.2.3. Inventory Method. In most instances, ―Order Quantity‖ is assigned for all
          customers. Inventory Method ―Shelf Count‖ can be assigned when stricter inventory
          control is required.
          4.8.1.2.4. Default Location. The ―Default Location‖ is a mandatory entry that should
          identify the customer‘s main supply storage area. This should coincide with the
          ―Delivery Location‖ located in the Basic tab (identifies where logistics delivers
          supply requests).
          4.8.1.2.5. Ship to Address. The shipping data is only relevant to CAIM SOS
          accounts (Maintenance Activities) that are authorized to place orders to a SOS.
          4.8.1.2.6. CAIM SOS. The CAIM SOS indicator identifies whether or not the
          customer is authorized to sell materiel to other internal customers and can therefore
          bypass LOG by placing supply orders directly to a SOS. The only authorized CAIM
          SOS customer for AF logistics accounts is the MA. The Medical Logistics Flight
          Chief is responsible for determining whether or not the MA is authorized to order
          direct. If the MA is coded as a CAIM SOS, DMLSS prompts the user for a SOS
          Code, Estimated Lead Days, and CAIM SOS Name. Upon saving, the SOS Code box
          in the Materiel tab is populated.
80                                                  AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


     4.8.1.2.7. Advice Code. This code only affects CAIM SOS activities. The system
     default Advice Code is ―2D‖ which stands for ―Furnish Exact Quantity.‖
     AFMOA/SGALD recommends accepting the default unless otherwise directed by
     MHS Service Desk personnel. A list of authorized advice codes is visible in TMU by
     selecting IM and then the Advice Code table.
     4.8.1.2.8. Signal Code. This code only affects CAIM SOS activities. The system
     default Signal Code is ―A,‖ which stands for ―Ship to Requisitioner; Bill to
     Requisitioner.‖    AFMOA/SGALD recommends accepting the default unless
     otherwise directed by MHS Service Desk personnel. A list of authorized signal codes
     is visible in TMU under IM, then selecting the Signal Code (MILSTRIP) table.
     4.8.1.2.9. Auto Due-out. This checkbox is available only if the CAIM SOS
     checkbox is selected. Selecting this checkbox causes due-out quantities to be
     increased to match the due-in quantities if the unit of sale (U/S) is not equal to the
     unit of purchase (U/P). It only applies to catalog records assigned ―Core‖ or ―Static‖
     level type and the location records are marked for ―Resale.‖
     4.8.1.2.10. Verify Receipts. Current AF policy is to not check the verify receipts
     checkbox. When this checkbox is not selected, DMLSS automatically updates
     balance records with the quantities shown on the internal source's receipt. When
     LOG processes receipts and generates the delivery list, DMLSS automatically
     processes receipts for CAIM customers, changes the status of those receipts from
     active to inactive, and updates the customer‘s estimated OH balance. Note: This is
     mandatory for a CAIM SOS. If selected, this checkbox ensures that the user
     receiving supplies verifies the receipt against what is actually received; therefore, the
     CAIM receipt must be manually processed.
     4.8.1.2.11. Verify Orders. When selected, this checkbox indicates that the customer
     must manually verify individual orders within the CAIM Build/Process/Submit
     module before submitting them to LOG. This option is not recommended because it
     impedes a customer‘s normal ordering procedures. Note: ―Verify Orders‖ is
     mandatory for CAIM SOS activities.
     4.8.1.2.12. Kill Prime Vendor Pharmaceutical (PVP) Due-outs. This function is used
     only in conjunction with the PVP Direct option. When this box is checked, any time
     a due-in from PVP is reduced or cancelled, a like amount of customer due-outs is
     reduced or cancelled.
     4.8.1.2.13. PVP Direct. Select this checkbox if the customer is authorized to order
     directly from the PVP. When this option is used, the customer‘s orders are rolled into
     separate call numbers and are not commingled with other customer requirements.
     Coordinate with JMLFDC prior to selecting this option.
     4.8.1.2.14. Prime Vendor Medical/Surgical (PVM) Direct. Select this checkbox if
     the customer is authorized to order directly from the PVM. When this option is used,
     the customer‘s orders are rolled into separate call numbers and are not commingled
     with other customer requirements. Coordinate with JMLFDC prior to selecting this
     option.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                81


        4.8.1.2.15. Auto Source. The Auto Source code is used when the customer is coded
        as a Reachback Customer (located in the Basic tab). If this checkbox is selected, and
        an item does not have a catalog record for the Reachback PV (RPV), the item will
        automatically be sourced to LOG‘s default supplier.
        4.8.1.2.16. Reachback Issue. The Reachback Issue checkbox is used when the
        customer is coded as a Reachback Customer (located in the Basic tab). If this
        checkbox is selected, local inventory is used to satisfy customer demands rather than
        forwarding those demands directly to a SOS.
        4.8.1.2.17. Operating Room Management Application (ORMA) Customer. Select
        this indicator to identify a customer as an ORMA customer. This option requires
        specific interface configurations and should only be accomplished with direction from
        MHS Service Desk personnel.
        4.8.1.2.18. Spoke Issue. Click to mark a service customer as a Spoke Customer.
        4.8.1.2.19. Authorized Source of Supply. The Authorized SOS field is only used for
        CAIM SOS customers or customers authorized PVP Direct and/or PVM Direct. MAs
        are the only authorized CAIM SOS accounts for AF activities. Use the Edit button to
        add the SOS codes in which the customer is authorized to purchase materiel without
        going through LOG. The Medical Logistics Flight Commander is the responsible
        approval authority.
        4.8.1.2.20. MTF Restrictions. Use the MTF Restrictions tab to restrict the customer
        from requesting certain types of materiel. If the customer is restricted against
        ordering an item, the customer cannot create a CAIM catalog record for the item. For
        example, to restrict the customer from creating catalog records and requesting
        controlled substances, add the MTF restrictions for Code Q and R. These restrictions
        directly relate the assigned Controlled Item Inventory Code (CIIC) within each
        catalog record. Use the edit button to associate and unassociate restrictions.
        4.8.1.2.21. Special Requirements. Use the Special Requirements tab to further
        identify customer restrictions. For example, if the customer is not authorized to
        request precious metals, add special requirement code M to this tab. These
        restrictions directly relate the assigned CIIC within each catalog record. Use the edit
        button to associate and unassociate restrictions.
        4.8.1.2.22. Controlled Item Inventory Restrictions. Use this tab to further identify
        customer restrictions. For example, if the customer is not authorized to request
        controlled pharmaceuticals, add codes ―Q‖ and ―R‖ to this tab. These restrictions
        directly relate the assigned CIIC within each catalog record. Use the edit button to
        associate and unassociate these restrictions.
     4.8.1.3. Funding Tab (Figure 4.4.). Use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to associate and/or
     unassociate existing expense center records to the SVC/CUST. Select the ―Detail‖ button
     to view detailed data for an expense center record. Select the ―New‖ button to create a
     new expense center record. Refer to paragraph 4.13. for an explanation on creating new
     expense centers. The ―Target Flag‖ should be set to ―Proj EOR‖ for all AF SVC/CUST
     records unless otherwise directed (may be locally directed).
 82                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 4.4. Service/Customer Detail – (New) – Funding Tab.




          4.8.1.3.1. Target Flag. The target flag instructs DMLSS to enforce a target amount at
          the project center, expense center, or EOR level. The setting prevents orders at this
          level and all subordinate levels from exceeding the established financial target
          amounts. The target flag for all AF customers should be set at ―Proj EOR.‖
          However, if the resource manager agrees to load and manage funds within DMLSS,
          he/she may elect to set the target flag to ―Exp EOR.‖
             4.8.1.3.1.1. Project EOR (PROJ EOR). DMLSS validates funds availability at
             the project center and EOR level. For example, if a customer associated to project
             center 001 (via the expense center relationship) is placing an order for $500 worth
             of supplies; then project center 001 must have an available balance of at least
             $500 in EOR 604.
             4.8.1.3.1.2. Project (PROJ). Do not use Proj unless otherwise directed by higher
             authority. The target amounts set for each project center cannot be exceeded by
             the project center‘s dependent SVC/CUSTs. DMLSS validates funds availability
             at the project center level regardless of which EOR the funds are available.
             4.8.1.3.1.3. Expense EOR (EXP EOR). DMLSS validates funds availability at
             the expense center and EOR level. For example, if a customer associated to
             expense center 355610 is placing a pharmaceutical order for $5,000; then expense
             center 355610 must have an available balance of at least $5,000 dollars in EOR
             615.
             4.8.1.3.1.4. Expense (EXP). Do not use Exp unless otherwise directed by higher
             authority. The target amounts set for each expense center cannot be exceeded by
             the expense center‘s dependent customers. DMLSS validates funds availability at
             the expense center level regardless of which EOR the funds are available.
             4.8.1.3.1.5. NONE. The target flag should not be set to NONE unless otherwise
             directed by higher authority. When the target flag is set to NONE, DMLSS does
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 83


              not validate funds availability when obligations occur. In other words, the
              associated expense and project centers are allowed to go negative.
          4.8.1.3.2. Detail Billing Required. Use this field to indicate whether or not detailed
          billing is required for this customer. This indicator only affects CAIM SOS
          customers and generally is not used.
          4.8.1.3.3. Maximum Order Limit. Use this field to restrict the price limit for any one
          item ordered by the customer.
          4.8.1.3.4. Default Expense Center.       Because SVC/CUST accounts can be
          simultaneously associated to multiple expense centers, a default expense center must
          be identified. The association identifies which expense and project center funds
          validation will occur when the customer obligates funds.
      4.8.1.4. Submission Tab. This tab is only available if the SVC/CUST account is coded
      as a Reachback, DCAM, External, or Spoke customer. All of the aforementioned
      indicators reside in the Basic tab. Reachback, DCAM, and external customers are
      considered ―external‖ to the local MTF and mission requirements dictate that orders be
      filled by special procedures in the IM application. A Spoke customer is one who has an
      operating DODAAC on another DMLSS server and procures materiel from the ―Hub‖
      account. In order for the spoke customer to become active in DMLSS, the ―Hub‖
      indicator must be set within the MM Service detail.
      4.8.1.5. Assemblage Tab. The Assemblage tab is visible if the SVC/CUST account is
      associated to customer owned assemblages in the AM module. Modifications are not
      allowed in this window.
4.9. Funds.
   4.9.1. Management of funds in DMLSS is critical to system operations and can dramatically
   impact the MTF and how medical logistics operates if not properly managed. The funds
   module provides medical logistics and resource management the flexibility to manage most
   aspects of the MTF‘s funding. DMLSS funds management allows the ability to:
      4.9.1.1. View and manage funds through expense centers, project centers, and the LOG
      fund.
      4.9.1.2. Gather information on EORs and commodity classes.
      4.9.1.3. View and manage details such as commitments, obligations, and target amounts.
      4.9.1.4. View and manage AM and OP funds.
   4.9.2. Select ―Funds‖ from the SS navigate dropdown menu or click the ―Funds‖ icon
   located on the horizontal toolbar to access the Funds-Search window. Fund managers can
   search for records by Fund Center Number, Fund Center Name, or Fund Type (i.e. S-Log
   Fund, P-Project Center, E-Expense Center). To retrieve all fund records, leave all search
   criteria fields blank and select the ―Search‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar.
   4.9.3. LOG Fund.
      4.9.3.1. The LOG fund detail window displays all funding for the Default Logistics Fund
      and is associated to EOR 600. Other criteria associated with the LOG fund are:
 84                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         4.9.3.1.1. The target cannot be exceeded with orders, price changes, and/or receipts.
         4.9.3.1.2. The default uses one Account Processing Code (APC) and EOR.
         4.9.3.1.3. The target amount is cumulative for the FY.
         4.9.3.1.4. The target is reset to zero during EOFY processing.
      4.9.3.2. Log Fund Detail – Log – AF Working Capital Fund window (Figure 4.5.). The
      upper portion of the window displays information from the LOG fund as well as funds
      disbursements. The LOG Fund ID and Fund Code must be present.

Figure 4.5. Log Fund Detail – Log – AF Working Capital Fund Window.




      4.9.3.3. The LOG fund target restricts the amount of funds a logistics account is allowed
      to obligate during the FY and prevents negative balances based on the target and
      available balance. Although the LOG Fund Target can be modified in the upper window,
      AF activities have no need and are not required to set a fund target for the
      AFWCF/MDD. The target flag indicator for the LOG fund is located in the
      Appropriation tab of the MM Service Detail record. If it were used, the LOG fund is the
      primary level target and the extended totals of all project centers could not exceed the
      LOG fund targets. It is important to work closely with the MTF RMO to ensure that
      funding is set up and managed correctly.
      4.9.3.4. The Direct Update field controls how funds will update in DMLSS. The AF has
      adopted the policy that the Direct Update field will be checked for all MTFs. If the box
      is checked, funds are updated at the time of transaction execution. If the box is
      unchecked, the LOG fund account is reconciled either manually by tallying funds lower
      window or during the next EOD process.
      4.9.3.5. The middle window displays the EOR and all current funding information.
      These fields may be updated as needed for financial book adjustments; however, it is
      important not to change any information on this screen without the proper authorization
      and documentation. Changes to these fields directly impact the funds availability for
      your MTF and the AFWCF/MDD. When these fields are modified, the corresponding
      fields in the upper window are updated to reflect the new figures.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  85


       4.9.3.6. The lower window displays the cumulative figures for the LOG fund when the
       Direct Update field is unchecked. Materiel Managers must manually update the LOG
       fund accounting when this option is selected. To update the LOG fund, click the
       ―Reconcile‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. The figures in the lower window are
       then moved to the upper window and posted to the LOG Fund Detail.
       4.9.3.7. For more information on the financial structure including the LOG fund, project
       centers, and expense centers, refer to Chapter 2, Document Control and Financial
       Procedures, paragraph 2.9.
4.10. Project Center. Project center fund records provide visibility of fund management at the
project center level. They are associated to SVC/CUSTs indirectly through an expense center.
Project center transactions are internally audited by the system; meaning, DMLSS captures the
type of change along with the date, user ID, and other information. This data is recorded in the
Transaction History using transaction code ESP.
   4.10.1. Accessing an Existing Project Center. To access an existing project center, either
   select ―Funds‖ from the SS Navigate menu or click the ―Funds‖ icon located on the
   horizontal toolbar. The Funding-Search window appears. This window can be used to
   search all fund records. To retrieve a project center fund record, do one of the following:
       4.10.1.1. Enter the project center ID into the Fund Center field and click ―Search.‖
       4.10.1.2. Enter the project center name into the Fund Center Name field and click
       ―Search.‖
       4.10.1.3. Select ―P-MM Project Center‖ in the Fund Type dropdown menu and click
       ―Search.‖ This option retrieves all project center records.
       4.10.1.4. All fund records are retrieved by clicking the ―Search‖ icon when all three
       search criteria fields are empty.
   4.10.2. The MM Project Center Detail window (Figure 4.6.) contains all financial
   information unique to the selected project center. The financial manager can view current
   totals for commitments, obligations, available balances, credits, sales, and surcharge figures
   for the selected project center. Related expense centers are visible by selecting the ―Exp
   Ctrs‖ box.
 86                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 4.6. MM Project Center Detail Window.




      4.10.2.1. Updates to project center name, project center target amounts, and target
      amounts for individual EORs within the project are accomplished in this window. The
      financial manager (assigned required privileges) can update fund targets or expenditures
      by clicking the field to be updated and changing the totals. The screen does not ―auto
      refresh‖ after the update. Changes will be visible after logging out and returning to the
      window.
      4.10.2.2. Use the increase, decrease, and move buttons to modify project center fund
      targets.
         4.10.2.2.1. Increase – Use the increase button to load initial or add additional project
         center fund targets. Load the total project center target being added in the Amount
         field and associate the target(s) to the applicable EOR(s).
         4.10.2.2.2. Decrease – Use the decrease button to decrement the target amount.
         Enter the total amount being removed in the Amount field and identify the EOR(s) in
         which that amount is being removed.
         4.10.2.2.3. Move – Use the move button to move a target amount from one EOR to
         another.
      4.10.2.3. Primarily, the project center target and EOR target amounts are the only fields
      that should require updating. When a fund load is completed, the (Sum) EOR Target
      Amounts field should equal the Project Center Target field.
      4.10.2.4. DMLSS automatically calculates the commitments, credits, expenses,
      obligations, R-sales, N-sales, and surcharges for each project center.
      4.10.2.5. Check the Marked for Deletion checkbox to mark a project center fund record
      for deletion. Usually, DFAS or your resource advisor will direct this action if/when the
      project center is no longer required. A record that is marked for deletion still appears in
      the system but does not support any further financial activity. The project center is
      removed during EOFY processing as long as there are no financial ties. If there are still
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  87


       financial obligations that were not cleared prior to EOFY, the project center will remain
       visible in DMLSS but will continue rejecting additional financial activity.
   4.10.3. To view additional project centers, click the ―Find‖ button to open the Project Center
   Search window. Enter a project center to view or click ―Search‖ to view a list of all project
   centers. Select the project center and click the ―Details‖ button to view the project centers
   information.
   4.10.4. For more information on the financial structure including the LOG fund, project
   centers, and expense centers, refer to Chapter 2, Document Control and Financial Procedures,
   paragraph 2.9.. Refer to paragraph 4.14. when creating new project centers.
4.11. Expense Center. Expense centers capture funding data from associated SVC/CUST
records, which is rolled up to the associated project center. Expense centers can have program
targets the same as project centers. These targets represent the expense centers budget. Expense
center transactions are internally audited by the system; meaning, DMLSS captures the type of
change along with the date, user ID, and other information. This data is recorded in the
Transaction History using transaction code ESP.
   4.11.1. Accessing an Existing Expense Center. To access an existing expense center, either
   select ―Funds‖ from the SS Navigate menu or click the ―Funds‖ icon located on the
   horizontal toolbar. The Funding-Search window appears. This window can be used to
   search all fund records. To retrieve an expense center fund record, do one of the following:
       4.11.1.1. Enter the expense center ID into the Fund Center field and click ―Search.‖
       4.11.1.2. Enter the expense center name into the Fund Center Name field and click
       ―Search.‖
       4.11.1.3. Select ―E-MM Expense Center‖ in the Fund Type dropdown menu and click
       ―Search.‖ This option retrieves all expense center records.
       4.11.1.4. All fund records are retrieved by clicking the Search icon when all three search
       criteria fields are empty.
   4.11.2. The Expense Center Detail window (Figure 4.7.) is similar to the Project Center
   Detail window. The financial manager can view current totals for commitments, obligations,
   available balances, credits, sales, and surcharge figures for the selected expense center.
   Select the ―SVC/CUST‖ box located in the Related Items window to see a list of
   SVC/CUSTs associated to the selected expense center.

Figure 4.7. MM Expense Center Detail Window.




      4.11.2.1. Updates to expense center name, expense center target amounts, and target
      amounts for individual EORs within the expense center are accomplished in this window.
      While the military service and fund fields are editable, fund managers should not change
      these settings without proper authorization and documentation. The financial manager
      (assigned required privileges) can update fund targets or expenditures by clicking the
      field to be updated and changing the totals. The screen does not ―auto refresh‖ after the
      update. Changes will be visible after logging out and returning to the window.
      4.11.2.2. If necessary, fund managers can change an expense center from one project
      center to another. When changing project centers, all financial data is moved to the new
      project center. A message box warning of the change precedes the action. Changing an
      expense center to a different project center should only be accomplished when approved
      by your resource advisor and coordinated with DFAS. Documentation should be
      received and maintained for all changes.
      4.11.2.3. DMLSS automatically calculates the commitments, credits, expenses,
      obligations, R-sales, N-sales, and surcharges for each expense center.
      4.11.2.4. Use the increase, decrease, and move buttons to modify expense center fund
      targets.
         4.11.2.4.1. Increase – Use the increase button to load initial or add additional
         expense center fund targets. Load the total expense center target being added in the
         ―Amount‖ field and associate the target(s) to the applicable EOR(s).
         4.11.2.4.2. Decrease – Use the decrease button to decrement the target amount.
         Enter the total amount being removed in the ―Amount‖ field and identify the EOR(s)
         in which that amount is being removed.
         4.11.2.4.3. Move – Use the move button to move a target amount from one EOR to
         another.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  89


      4.11.2.5. Normally, the expense center target and EOR target amounts are the only fields
      that should require updating. When a fund load is completed, the ―(Sum) EOR Target
      Amounts‖ field should equal the ―Expense Center Target‖ field.
      4.11.2.6. Retired Indicator Checkbox. Use this checkbox to designate retired expense
      centers. This indicator identifies a cost center that is no longer intended for use but
      cannot be marked for deletion until due-outs and/or equipment data records have been
      removed. When checked, the Expense Center is ineligible for selection in all ordering
      processes such as IM Customer Requests, Offline Nonsubmit orders, Nonroutine issues,
      etc.
      4.11.2.7. Marked for Deletion Checkbox. Check the Marked for Deletion checkbox to
      mark an expense center fund record for deletion. Usually, DFAS or your resource
      advisor will direct this action if/when the expense center is no longer required. A record
      that is marked for deletion still appears in the system but does not support any further
      financial activity. The expense center is removed during EOFY processing as long as
      there are no financial ties. If there are still financial obligations not cleared prior to
      EOFY, the expense center will remain visible in DMLSS but will continue rejecting
      additional financial activity.
   4.11.3. To view additional expense centers, click the ―Find‖ button to open the Expense
   Center Search window. Enter an expense center to view or click ―Search‖ to view a list of all
   expense centers. Select the expense center and click the Details button to view the expense
   center‘s information.
   4.11.4. For more information on the financial structure including the LOG fund, project
   centers, and expense centers, refer to Chapter 2, paragraph 2.9. Refer to paragraph 4.15.
   when creating new expense centers.
4.12. AM Funds. Use the AM Funds module to maintain funds associated to WRM
assemblages. AM funds are appropriated in writing by AFMOA/SGAL for the purpose of
purchasing new materiel or replacing existing materiel for WRM assemblages.
   4.12.1. Creating a New AM Fund Record. In the AM Funds-Search window, click the ―New
   Fund‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar. The AM Funding-New window appears and
   allows the funds manager to create a new fund record for the current FY. The MTF/Unit,
   Fund Number, Target, and Type Funding fields are the only mandatory fields; however, the
   appropriate data should be entered into all fields if possible. Use the fields as follows:
      4.12.1.1. MTF/Unit – Select the DODAAC if the associated assemblage is LOG owned.
      If the assemblage is owned by a detached unit, select the MTF/Unit assigned to that
      detachment.
      4.12.1.2. Fiscal Year (FY) – Defaults to current FY.
      4.12.1.3. Fund Number – Load fund number supplied in the funding authorization
      document and maintain IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 24.00.
      4.12.1.4. Type Funding – Always assign ―Stock Fund‖ unless otherwise directed by
      higher authority.
      4.12.1.5. Target – Load the dollar amount referenced in the funding authorization letter.
90                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


        4.12.1.6. Fund Source – Load ―AFMOA.‖
        4.12.1.7. Description – Load the description provided on the funding authorization
        document or one that corresponds to the assemblage in which the funds will be
        associated.
        4.12.1.8. Associate to Assemblage – The AM fund record must be associated to the
        appropriate assemblage(s) before WRM personnel can process orders and/or
        replenishments to obligate funds. Assemblages with no check mark in the ―Assoc‖ box
        are eligible for association to the AM Fund record,
        4.12.1.9. Save changes prior to exiting.
        4.12.1.10. Once the new AM fund record is saved, search for and access the record to
        modify the Build Control Number (BCN) field. Load the associated assemblage‘s
        Maximum Repair Limit (MRL) Recnum into the BCN field. This data is provided on the
        funding authorization document. If the assemblage has not been funded, the information
        is available on the Medical Resource Letter (MRL).
     4.12.2. Accessing an Existing AM Fund Record. In the AM Fund-Search window, enter at
     least the MTF/Unit and FY of the desired fund record. Additional search criteria can be
     entered to narrow the search results. The search results window displays all AM fund
     records and assemblages associated to the defined search criteria.
        4.12.2.1. Viewing the AM Funding-Search window:
           4.12.2.1.1. A check is present in the Associated (Assoc) box if the fund record is
           associated to an assemblage and the assemblage is identified in the same row.
           4.12.2.1.2. A check is not present in the Assoc box and the assemblage data fields
           contain dashes if the fund record is not associated to an assemblage.
           4.12.2.1.3. The AM fund data fields are blank for assemblages listed that are not
           associated to a fund record.
        4.12.2.2. To view summary details of an AM fund record, highlight the desired record
        and click on the ―View Assm‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar. The AM Funding-
        Assemblage Detail window provides an up-to-date view of the assemblage‘s fund target,
        available balance, commitments, obligations, receipts, surcharges, and R-sales. The
        associated assemblage data is also listed at the bottom of the screen. This option is a
        convenient way to provide quick funding status to supervisors, MAJCOM, or
        AFMOA/SGAL. Even though the R-Sales field is editable, managers should never
        manually update this field without proper authorization and documentation from
        AFMOA/SGALO.
        4.12.2.3. To edit an AM fund record, either double-click on the desired record or
        highlight it and select ―Edit Fund‖ from the vertical toolbar. In the AM Funding-Revised
        window, fund managers can view fund details as well as make modifications to the fund
        record. In addition, the fund record can be associated to an assemblage. All assemblages
        that are not associated to a fund record appear at the bottom of the window. To increase
        or decrease funds, enter the dollar amount (with decimal point) in the Amount field and
        click the ―Increase‖ or ―Decrease‖ buttons. The funds target adjusts accordingly. Enter
        the fund source or who forwarded the money to your activity; AFMOA/SGAL or
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  91


      MAJCOM. Enter the reason for the funding in the Description field (i.e. ―Cover
      Assemblage Shortages‖ or ―Initial funds load for new project‖). Click ―Save‖ to accept
      the edits. The window will reflect the new information after the save.
      4.12.2.4. AM fund increases and decreases generate an ADP transaction that is written to
      the Transaction History file. The ADP transaction captures the target adjustment
      (whether positive or negative figure), assigns Fund Type of ―AM Funds,‖ assigns the
      fund number to the ID field, and the owning ORG is listed in the name field. The
      document is made up of the DODAAC, Julian date, and serial number beginning with F
      and 001, 002, 003, etc. The serial number resets after each EOP processing cycle.
      4.12.2.5. To associate funds to assemblages, select the desired fund record in the AM—
      Funding Search window and click the ―Edit‖ button. In the AM—Funding Revised
      window, place a check in the Assoc checkbox to identify which assemblages are to be
      associated to the fund record and click ―Save.‖ Upon refreshing the AM—Funding
      Search window, the new association is displayed.
4.13. OP Funds.
   4.13.1. OP funds are classified as funds used to purchase capital equipment; meaning,
   equipment with an acquisition cost greater than $249,999.99. An OP fund record must be
   established before capital equipment requisitions can be processed in DMLSS. Because OP
   funds can span a period of three FYs, DMLSS allows fund managers to establish and update
   OP fund targets for three FYs (current year plus two previous years.). OP funds are rarely
   distributed to the bases but a ―pseudo‖ fund record must be loaded in DMLSS to allow
   processing of orders. DMLSS maintains OP fund records for eight years; three active and
   five inactive.
   4.13.2. Establishing a New OP Fund Record. In the OP Fund-Search window, select the
   ―New Fund‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar to establish a new OP fund record. In the
   OP Funds Detail-New window, enter all required information as follows:
      4.13.2.1. Fiscal Year (FY) – Funds can be loaded for current plus two previous FYs.
      Enter the applicable FY IAW the funding authorization letter.
      4.13.2.2. MTF/Unit – Load the applicable organization.
      4.13.2.3. Fund Code – Always enter ―2F‖ unless otherwise directed by higher authority.
      4.13.2.4. BLIC - Not used.
      4.13.2.5. Proj Code – Not used.
      4.13.2.6. Appropriation (APPN) 1 – Enter the appropriation number IAW the funding
      authorization letter.
      4.13.2.7. APPN 2 – Enter secondary appropriations number if funding is received from
      multiple sources.
      4.13.2.8. Target – Enter target amount indicated on the funding authorization letter.
      4.13.2.9. Reference – Enter reference number from the funding authorization letter.

         4.13.2.10. EOR Target Amount – Enter same value that was entered into the Target field.
         Funds must be added to the EOR target amount in order to process equipment requests.
         The EOR for capital equipment defaults to 144.
         4.13.2.11. Save changes.
      4.13.3. Accessing/Modifying an Existing OP Fund Record. Click ―OP Funds‖ from the SS
      Navigate menu or click the ―OP Funds‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to access the
      OP Funds-Search window. Search for OP funds by FY and fund code or leave these fields
      blank and click ―Search‖ to view all OP Funds balances by FY. The search results window
      displays the FY, fund code, commitments, obligations, and available balance for each fund
      record. Either double-click on the desired fund record or highlight it and select the ―Detail‖
      button located on the vertical toolbar to access a Fund Records Details. The OP-Funds-
      Detail window contains two tabs: Funds Ledger and Funds Status tabs.
         4.13.3.1. Funds Ledger Tab. The Funds Ledger tab allows the fund manager to edit an
         existing OP fund record (and create a new one). The OP Funds-Detail window includes
         the same information as the OP Fund-New window, but also includes a Funding
         Reference that is comparable to an electronic checkbook keeping track of all monetary
         transactions associated to the fund record. Fund target increases and decreases are also
         accomplished here.
             4.13.3.1.1. Click the ―Increase‖ or ―Decrease‖ button to add or remove target
             amounts to or from the OP fund record. Enter the adjustment amount referenced on
             the funding authorization letter in the Amount field, the applicable reference, and
             click ―Save.‖ Upon saving, the OP fund target field and the funding reference history
             is updated with the transaction information for audit purposes. The EOR Target
             Amount must be updated by entering the new total OP fund target amount. When
             completed, verify the dollar value in the ―(Sum) EOR Target Amounts‖ field is equal
             to the OP fund ―Target‖ field.
             4.13.3.1.2. When the fund updates occur, an ADP transaction is written to the
             Transaction History file. The ADP transaction captures the target adjustment
             (whether positive or negative figure), assigns Fund Type of ―OP Fund,‖ and assigns
             Fund Code of ―2F.‖ The document is made up of the DODAAC, Julian date, and
             serial number beginning with F and 001, 002, 003, etc. The serial number resets after
             each EOP processing cycle.
         4.13.3.2. Funds Status Tab. The Funds Status tab displays OP fund records details along
         with equipment request data linked to the OP fund record. This tab is updated with all
         changes that occur to an OP purchase.
4.14. Project Center. To create a new project center, select ―Project Center‖ from the SS
Navigate dropdown menu. A project center ID and name must be entered in the MM Project
Center Detail-New window. A fund target can be loaded at this time but it is not mandatory.
4.15. Expense Center. To create a new expense center, select ―Expense Center‖ from the SS
Navigate dropdown menu. An expense center ID, military service, fund code (defaults to 2X),
and expense center name must be entered in the MM Expense Center Detail-New window.
Additionally, the expense center must be associated to a project center at this time. An expense
center target can be loaded at this time but it is not mandatory.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 93


4.16. POC.
   4.16.1. A POC is a point of contact in the organizational record. Keeping valid and current
   POC information on all users is an important part of administering DMLSS.        The POC
   window allows authorized users to search, view, edit, add, and delete POC information as
   necessary. The POC is usually responsible for managing the area that the organizational
   record describes (i.e. a SVC/CUST account, a DEPT, or a MTF/Unit). POC information is
   entered into the POC Detail Update – (New) Window (Figure 4.8.) and is available for
   association to the organizational records.

Figure 4.8. POC Detail Update – (New) Window.




   4.16.2. Select ―POC‖ from the SS Navigate dropdown menus to access the POC Detail
   window. The last name, first name, title, phone number, and email address are the only
   mandatory data fields for new records; however, all data fields should be completed if
   possible. If the POC‘s address is not already loaded in the DMLSS address table, click the
   ―Jump To‖ button to load the POC‘s address and associate it to his/her record. Note:
   DMLSS 3.1.2 GENIV establishes an electronic interface between DMLSS and Wide Area
   Work Flow (WAWF) that generates a Receipt Acceptance (EDI 861) to WAWF in addition
   to sending the Receipt (EDI 527) to DLA Troop Support. The Receipt Acceptance contains
   POC information to include the receiver‘s name, phone number, e-mail address, and user ID.
   Users must enter accurate first/last names, phone numbers without parenthesis, spaces, or
   dashes, and a valid .mil email address.
   4.16.3. Use the ―<‖ and ―>‖ buttons to associate and/or unassociate the types of services the
   POC is assigned to perform. Most custodians and customers should be assigned Custodian
   and DMLSS User POC types. User‘s may be assigned multiple POC types. Some of the
   common types are:
      4.16.3.1. BPA Ordering Official – Assign this type to the logistics official authorized to
      approve BPA orders. Use in conjunction with the POC listed in the MM service detail
 94                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         record. When both are used, the POC‘s name will print on all DD Form 1155s for BPA
         purchases.
         4.16.3.2. DBPA Approval Authority – Assign this type to the logistics official authorized
         to approve DBPA orders. Use in conjunction with the POC listed in the MM service
         detail record. When both are used, the POC‘s name is printed on all DD Form 1155s for
         DBPA purchases.
         4.16.3.3. EM Service – Associate this POC type to the assigned MEMO officer.
         4.16.3.4. Facility Management – Assign to the facility manager.
         4.16.3.5. Maintenance Staff – Associate to all maintenance personnel.
         4.16.3.6. Custodian – Associate this type to all assigned equipment and supply
         custodians.
         4.16.3.7. DMLSS User – Associate this POC type to routine DMLSS users.
      4.16.4. The Associated ORG records fields are not updated in this window. If the POC is a
      primary custodian for a SVC/CUST, DEPT, or ORG, then this field is updated by entering
      the customer‘s POC information in the SVS/CUST, DEPT, or MTF/ORG window using the
      SS search function as described in paragraph 4.5. For example, if the POC record added is
      for the new custodian of 355662, associate POC types Custodian and DMLSS User. Then,
      using the SS Search function, load the new POC information in the SVC/CUST detail record
      for 355662. Then, when accessing the POC record, the associated SVC/CUST ID is
      displayed in the Associated Organization Records field.
      4.16.5. System administrators should make corrections to the POC field when changes are
      required for any SVC/CUST, DEPT, or ORG data to ensure the most current information is
      available.
4.17. User Privilege (UP) Assignment.
      4.17.1. A user‘s access to DMLSS is determined by the applications and roles privileges
      assigned to their User ID. The roles assigned to users grant and/or restrict access to certain
      modules and functions within the system and ultimately protect the database from
      unauthorized access. In the UP Assign window, an authorized user can assign one or more
      applications and/or roles to a another user. Only those with Security Manager roles are
      authorized to access UP Assign and grant privileges to other users. Normally, this is
      assigned to the designated SA. The SA should have a basic knowledge about what each role
      performs before assigning a role to a user. See Attachment 3, DMLSS User Privilege Role
      Management, for a complete table of standard roles, descriptions, and general application
      rules.
      4.17.2. Select ―User Priv-Assignment‖ from the Navigate menu or click the ―UP Assign‖
      button on the horizontal toolbar to open the User Privilege—Assignment window (Figure
      4.9.). The window is divided into the following sections:
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  95


Figure 4.9. User Priv – Assignment Window.




      4.17.2.1. Username (top left). Select a name from a list of users stored in the DMLSS
      server. This is the user ID of the person being assigned privileges.
      4.17.2.2. Application Administrator (top right). This is the login name of the person who
      was assigned with Application Security Manager rights for the selected module. This
      field cannot be changed.
      4.17.2.3. Applications (middle left). These are the applications assigned to the selected
      user.
      4.17.2.4. Roles (middle). Roles are assigned for each application and identify which
      tables and functions a user has access to within the application. A centrally managed set
      of generic roles are available for use; however, locally managed roles can be developed
      to meet more specific business practices.
      4.17.2.5. Assemblages/SVC/CUST ID/Maintenance Activity (middle right).            The
      selected application determines what information is shown in this field. For all
      applications except MA and AM, the SVC/CUST ID the user is assigned and has access
      to is displayed in this box. For AM, assigned assemblages are displayed and in MA, the
      primary maintenance activity is shown. Note: This area is blank for new users unless
      they are a SA.
   4.17.3. To assign applications to a user, select a user name and click the ―Applications‖
   button on the vertical toolbar. Associate applications to the user by selecting the
   application(s) and clicking the ―<‖ button between the window boxes. To select all
   applications click the ―<<‖ button. If an application needs to be disassociated, highlight the
   application in the associated box and click the ―>‖ button. Changes must be saved to take
   effect.
   4.17.4. Next, assign roles to a user by selecting an application and click the ―Roles‖ button.
   Roles are selected by application. Associate role(s) to users by selecting the role(s) and
   clicking the ―<‖ button between the window boxes. Click the ―<<‖ button to a ssign all
96                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


     available roles. To disassociate a role(s), highlight the role in the associated box and click
     the ―>‖ button. Use the ―>>‖ button to unassociate all roles. Changes must be saved to take
     effect.
     4.17.5. Associate SVC/CUST(s), Assemblage(s), EM, FM and MA activities. In addition to
     assigned roles, users must also be privileged to access SVC/CUST(s) and Assemblage(s). If
     a user is granted roles in the EM, FM, or MA, then they are required to be assigned to the
     corresponding activity.
        4.17.5.1. SVC/CUST(s) can only be assigned via the CAIM, Customer Service (CS), or
        IM modules. To do so, click the SVC/CUST button on the vertical toolbar. Associate
        SVC/CUST to the user by selecting the SVC/CUST(s) and clicking the ―<‖ button
        between the window boxes. To assign all SVC/CUST(s) click the ―<<‖ button. Use the
        ―>‖ and ―>>‖ buttons to unassociate SVC/CUST(s) as needed. Changes must be saved
        prior to being applied. Only authorized custodians may have access to their own
        customer ID(s). Medical logistics personnel may have access to all customers IDs if
        determined in local business practices.
        4.17.5.2. Assemblages can only be assigned within the AM application. To assign
        assemblages to a new user, click ―Assemblage‖ located on the vertical toolbar. Select the
        assemblages being assigned to the user and click the ―<‖ button between the window
        boxes. To select all assemblages, click the ―<<‖ button. Use the ―>‖ or ―>>‖ button to
        unassociate assemblage(s) when necessary. Changes must be saved prior to being
        applied. Only medical logistics personnel should be granted access to LOG owned
        assemblages. Some custodians will require access to customer owned assemblages
        assigned to their SVC/CUST ID. Some users may be authorized viewing privileges if
        determined in local business practices.
        4.17.5.3. To associate an EM activity to a user, highlight ―Equipment Management‖ in
        the Application window. Click on the ―EM‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar. Use the
        ―<‖ button to associate the appropriate EM activity and save changes.
        4.17.5.4. To associate a FM activity to a user, highlight ―Facility Management‖ in the
        Application window. Click on the ―FM‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar. Use the
        ―<‖ button to associate the appropriate FM activity and save changes.
        4.17.5.5. To assign a MA to a user, highlight ―Maintenance Activity‖ in the Application
        window. Click the ―MA‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Use ―<‖ button to
        associate the appropriate MA activity and save changes. A user can only be associated to
        one MA at a time.
     4.17.6. Associated Pending Actions. In addition to assigning roles, you can associate
     particular AM, CAIM, or IM pending action messages in the Pending Action window. This
     way, for example, the user who is responsible for receipts can automatically get any receipts-
     related pending action messages in their Inbox, while a user who has nothing to do with
     receipts, never sees these pending actions. To manage pending actions, click the Pend
     Action button on the vertical toolbar. Associate pending actions to users by selecting the
     desired pending action and clicking the ―<‖ button between the window boxes. Click the
     ―<<‖ button to assign all available pending actions. To disassociate a pending action(s),
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   97


   highlight the role in the associated box and click the ―>‖ button. Use the ―>>‖ button to
   unassociate all pending actions. Changes must be saved to take effect.
   4.17.7. Changes to roles and privileges are updated upon exiting (clicking Close) the UP
   Assign module. If users are logged on when the changes are made, they must exit DMLSS
   and log back into the application to gain access to new changes.
   4.17.8. Overview. Within UP Assign, the Overview button located on the vertical toolbar
   provides a way to preview or print a list of users granted privileges to specific applications,
   roles within specific applications, associated SVC/CUST ID(s), assemblages, or Maintenance
   Activities. The list is helpful when determining which users have what privileges when
   updates to roles and privileges are required.
   4.17.9. User Information. By clicking the ―User Information‖ icon located on the vertical
   toolbar, the SA can view the user information associated to the user ID identified in the
   Username box.
      4.17.9.1. All fields of the user information box require input. Users should ensure they
      complete all fields with accurate information. The address fields are not mandatory but
      are provided for customers that may be geographically separated from the MTF. The
      address information is helpful when delivering supplies and equipment or when mailing
      items or information is required.
      4.17.9.2. Both the User and Address Information fields should reflect the most current
      information. The SA should periodically review DMLSS users to validate their need to
      access the system and to verify their user information is accurate.
4.18. User Privileges – Management.
   4.18.1. Roles within each DMLSS application can be created or deleted, and existing roles
   may be modified by changing the attributes of the resources of that role. The User Priv –
   Management function is used to view, add, modify, and/or delete roles by application. To do
   so, a user must be designated as a SA or an application security manager role to gain access
   to the User Priv–Management window.
   4.18.2. To access the User Privilege—Management window (Figure 4.10.), select ―User
   Priv—Management‖ from the Navigate menu or click the ―UP Manage‖ button located on
   the horizontal toolbar. The window has three sections:
 98                                                         AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 4.10. User Priv – Management Window.




         4.18.2.1. Applications. These are the different applications associated with DMLSS.
         Each application has assigned roles, which in-turn have resources assigned to them.
         4.18.2.2. Roles. Roles are parts of an application that structure what a user may do
         within a specific application.
         4.18.2.3. Resource. The smallest piece of an application. Each resource defines how the
         user can perform a specific task within a role. A resource includes four elements in its
         make-up: read, update, create, and delete. Resources also contain the following
         attributes/privileges:
             4.18.2.3.1. Read. Read is the lowest level of the resource granted to users that only
             allows the ability to read the information associated to a specific resource.
             4.18.2.3.2. Update. Update allows users to update, change, or modify information
             for selected records associated to the specific resource.
             4.18.2.3.3. Create. Create allows users to create new record information associated
             with a specific resource.
             4.18.2.3.4. Delete. Delete is the highest level of resource privileges allowing users to
             delete selected records or information associated with a specific resource.
      4.18.3. Modifying Roles. Modifications can be made to existing resource data if the data is
      visible and not subdued. DMLSS or centrally managed roles (roles that appear ―grayed out‖)
      cannot be modified or deleted. Select an application and role to view the associated resource
      data. You can give or take away resource privileges to the read, update, create, or delete
      fields as necessary. The following rules apply when you assign resources to a role:
         4.18.3.1. Delete is the highest level privilege, and read is the lowest. The order of
         precedence is: delete, create, update, then read. When a privilege is selected for a
         resource all the lower privileges are automatically selected. For example, if you select
         update for a resource, read is automatically selected. The last column in the table ―Cust
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  99


      Req‖ (Customer Required), is assigned Yes or No indicating whether or not SVC/CUSTs
      must be assigned in order to use that role.
   4.18.4. Adding Roles. In some cases, the resources assigned to a role may not accommodate
   local business practices. Therefore, an option is available to add roles and resources to
   different applications.
      4.18.4.1. Add a role by clicking the ―Add Role‖ button located on the vertical toolbar
      within the User Priv – Management window. The Add Role - {associated application
      name} window opens. Enter the new role name and select the resource elements and
      privileges to be associated to the role.
      4.18.4.2. Remember that privileges are a ―high-low‖ assigning process. If you want to
      give a user delete privileges, the system will also assign create, update, and read
      privileges to the resource. If you select update, the system will assign read privileges to
      the resource.
      4.18.4.3. Click ―Save‖ to move the new role to the Roles box in the User Priv-
      Management window.
   4.18.5. Deleting Roles. Roles that are no longer required can be deleted by selecting the role
   and clicking the ―Delete Role‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Centrally managed
   roles cannot be deleted. In addition, locally developed roles must be disassociated from all
   users before being deleted.
   4.18.6. Auditing. The Auditing function provides the ability to check which users were in
   the system, when, how long, and/or problems associated with connecting. It can also be used
   to track what application(s) a user accessed, when it was accessed, and for how long. Select
   the ―Auditing‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to access the Application Auditing
   window. Administrators can search by user name, application, activity, or hostname. When
   the search completes, the user name, date/time, application, activity, description, and host
   name are displayed in the Application Auditing window.
4.19. Table Maintenance Utility (TMU).
   4.19.1. TMU provides a centralized listing of all the values and codes used throughout
   DMLSS applications. Use TMU to view, add, or delete data elements that appear in the
   different applications. To view tables in TMU, users must have the appropriate TMU
   resource(s) assigned to their user ID. These privileges are assigned using the ―UP Assign‖
   function explained in paragraph 4.17.
   4.19.2. At each MTF, one or more individuals should be assigned to manage these tables.
   Before being assigned this task, the individual should have some basic knowledge of medical
   logistics data elements and codes including DLA and military specific codes, such as advice
   codes and device codes.
   4.19.3. There are three types of tables viewable in this window:
      4.19.3.1. DMLSS Wide (Centralized): These tables are not editable since the
      information must remain common across all MTFs.
      4.19.3.2. DMLSS and Site Managed: Some of the data in these tables vary depending on
      the site. The table contains common information (centralized) for all MTFs; however,
100                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      users can edit, add, and delete local (decentralized) information based on their common
      business practices and terminology.
      4.19.3.3. Site Data: These decentralized tables contain data unique to the local MTF and
      they are completely editable.
  4.19.4. To view or modify a TMU table, first select an application from the Application
  dropdown menu and then select a table from the list. The table type is displayed for each
  table; DMLSS Wide, Site Data, or DMLSS & Site Managed. Table information that cannot
  be modified is displayed with a gray background. Upon saving changes, the new data is
  included in the table and is visible in the application fields.
  4.19.5. The following is a list of special rules that must be followed when updating certain
  tables within TMU.
      4.19.5.1. The Currency Code table/SS application. Changes made on the currency code
      table in TMU are audited by the system.
      4.19.5.2. The Document Number Configuration table. The following guidelines apply to
      the CAIM‘s Document Number Configuration table in the TMU/SS application:
         4.19.5.2.1. All data entered, with the exception of fund numbers, must consist of four
         numeric digits. If the number entered has less than four digits, the system
         automatically adds zeros to make a four-digit number. For example, 4 is changed to
         0004 and 25 is changed to 0025.
         4.19.5.2.2. The pattern of an End number must match the pattern of the Start number.
         If one is totally numeric, the other must be also. If the Start or End number in a fund
         range is alphanumeric (one letter and three numbers), the other must be as well.
         4.19.5.2.3. The End number must always be larger than the Start number.
         4.19.5.2.4. When the user enters a new Start number/End number range, the system
         checks to see whether the new value range overlaps with an existing range. If so, a
         message to correct the new range is displayed.
         4.19.5.2.5. When a number range has not yet been used by the system, the Last
         Number Used and Date fields do not contain any data. These fields are protected by
         the system and cannot be changed by the user.
         4.19.5.2.6. When the Start/End number range is changed for a grouping that contains
         data in the Last number and Date fields, the system determines if the Last number and
         the Date should be updated. If the current Last number does not fall within the new
         Start/End range, the Last number is set equal to the new Start number and the Date is
         incremented by one day. If the new range does encompass the current Last number,
         the system makes no changes to the Last number or Date field.
      4.19.5.3. The Registration Table in the TMU/SS application is a list of all the PCs at the
      MTF site that have logged into DMLSS. Messages sent by the site SA from the System
      Admin Tool are then received on all PCs listed in the table. Although this table is of the
      Site Data (editable) type, you may not edit or add any entries, only delete an entry (which
      will prevent that PC from receiving messages). Only DMLSS can make entries (when a
      user first logs onto the system) or changes (updating the IP address, date updated, and
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 101


       build number as users log on again). If you remove an entry and a user logs onto DMLSS
       from that PC, it is again added to this table. The system automatically deletes any PC
       that has not accessed DMLSS in 30 days.
       4.19.5.4. The Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) Maintenance Procedure table
       located in the TMU/FM application allows users to select a maintenance procedure from
       the dropdown field in order to view, add, or print the steps to that procedure.
       4.19.5.5. The RPIE Nomenclature table found in the TMU/FM table allows users to add
       a new nomenclature by clicking the ―Insert‖ button on the vertical toolbar.
4.20. DMLSS Communications Management (DCM). DCM is an automated tool within
DMLSS used to transmit data to external agencies. Information flowing from DMLSS includes
requisition files, financial data, and Prime Vendor Usage information. DCM is also the conduit
for receiving transmission of incoming status files, and it provides tools that allow SAs to
monitor progress of these files and to troubleshoot any errors. DMLSS retains transaction files
in DCM for the current and one previous month (or 62 days). Point-of-Use (POU) transaction
files are retained for seven days. Financial transaction files are retained in the system until
archived, depending on the file this can range from 90 to 365 days.
   4.20.1. DCM Search.
       4.20.1.1. DMLSS' primary connection method is the DLA Transaction Services value
       added network (VAN), using file transfer protocol (FTP) via secured ―https‖ mode. DLA
       Transaction Services forwards these transactions to the DLA Troop Support for PV
       payments, to the DFAS for non-PV payments, and to Point-of-Use (POU) systems. Use
       the DCM Search function to view these transaction files and manage the interface of
       DMLSS with these systems. Specifically, use this window to check the status of files and
       submit or resubmit files that failed to transmit.
       4.20.1.2. Select ―DCM Search‖ from the SS Navigate dropdown menu or click on the
       ―DCM Search‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access DCM Search. The DCM
       Search window (Figure 4.11.) provides multiple search options. Enter specific and
       detailed search criteria to narrow search results or minimize search criteria to receive a
       broad range of search results. The available search fields are as follows:
102                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 4.11. DCM Search Window.




         4.20.1.2.1. Call/Sequence/Block Number. This dropdown provides a list of all call
         numbers and financial sequence numbers that have processed through DCM.
         4.20.1.2.2. Method. Identifies how the transaction files are processed (i.e. FTP or
         Print).
         4.20.1.2.3. Form. Use the dropdown to select the file format used to transmit the file
         (i.e. Military Standard Requisitioning & Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP), American
         National Standard Institute (ANSI), EDI, etc.).
         4.20.1.2.4. Contract Number. Use to search for transaction files associated to a
         specific contract number. For example, enter ―FOA-REPORT‖ if you want the
         system to locate and display report data transmitted to AFMOA/SGALD during a
         particular EOP session.
         4.20.1.2.5. Source of Supply. Use to search for transaction files associated to a SOS.
         4.20.1.2.6. Status Code. Identifies the status of the file as it passed through DCM
         (i.e. Complete, Error, In-Progress, Transmitted).
         4.20.1.2.7. Process Code. These are codes assigned to provide more information on
         the status of the orders as it passes through DCM.
         4.20.1.2.8. User ID. Use to search for a specific user ID used to transmit a file.
         Note: Financial files record user ID ―DFAS.‖
         4.20.1.2.9. Begin Date. Identifies the begin date of the search. A blank begin date
         will include all dates.
         4.20.1.2.10. End Date. Identifies the end date of the search. A blank end date
         defaults to the current date.
      4.20.1.3. Determining Transmission Status. When searching transaction file history in
      DCM Search, look for three separate lines indicating the entire life cycle of the file was
      successful (applies to most file types). Using outbound transmissions as an example,
      look for (1) Process code ―ARCORGFL;‖ description ―ARCHIVED ORIGINAL FILE;‖
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  103


     (2) process code ―FMTGOOD;‖ description ―FILE WAS SUCCESSFULLY
     FORMATTED;‖ and (3) process code ―TMTGOOD;‖ description ―TRANSMITION
     SUCCESSFUL.‖ This sequence indicates the file was successfully archived, formatted,
     and then transmitted. If for any reason you are unsure of what action to take, contact the
     MHS Service Desk for guidance.
        4.20.1.3.1. Process Code Description (Desc). In the Search results window, highlight
        a transaction file and select the ―Desc‖ icon on the vertical toolbar to view the
        description of the process code associated to that transaction file. (i.e. For process
        code ―FMTGOOD‖ the description is ―File was successfully formatted.‖)
        4.20.1.3.2. View File. Highlight a file and select the View option located on the
        vertical toolbar to see the physical file as it is formatted and submitted to its intended
        source.
        4.20.1.3.3. To identify formatting errors or failed transmissions, monitor the Status
        code for ―ERROR‖ and the corresponding process code. The process code for that
        item indicates in which stage the error occurred. In either case, the SA should
        troubleshoot problems with the LAN, interface connectivity, or an incorrect IP
        address, login, or password. All electronic communications activities are required to
        periodically update passwords so you may need to contact the activity and verify
        current passwords. The SA should track/monitor password update schedules to
        prevent transmission failures.
     4.20.1.4. Resubmission Options. Review DCM search daily to ensure all transaction
     files are successfully transmitted and received as a result of the previous day‘s business.
     (i.e., requisition files to PV, DLA, financial files transferred to DFAS, and incoming
     status files from an SOS.) In particular, verify financial files are transmitted to DFAS
     daily without error. To accomplish this, enter the previous day's date in the Begin Date
     Field and click ―Search.‖ Review the status and process codes to verify all transaction
     files transmitted successfully. If transaction files did not successfully transmit, verify
     with the systems office that the network is up and your ports and firewalls are open.
     Upon verification, use the Submit or Resubmit options to retransmit the transaction files.
     Users must be judicious on which file/s require retransmission. For example, if an
     electronic Prime Vendor order fails to transmit, and the acquisitions manager elects to
     cancel the order, and re-accomplish the order ―manually,‖ the EDI 850 should not be
     retransmitted. This will result in a duplication of orders. When DCM is down
     completely for an extended period of time, the logistics account should activate manual
     supply operations as outlined in AFI 41-209. Manual orders to Prime Sources will result
     in the creation of a ―pseudo‖ EDI 850 image which ultimately goes to DLA Troop
     Support. When DCM connections are restored, these files will require retransmission.
     DLA Troop Support requires this data in order to build their order profile between the
     MTF and the Prime Vendor.
        4.20.1.4.1. Resubmit. In most instances, when a transaction file failed to transmit
        due to network connectivity problems or another reason not related to the IP address,
        login, or password, use the Resubmit function located on the vertical toolbar to
        retransmit that file during the next EOD process.
104                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         4.20.1.4.2. Financial Resubmit (Fin Resub). For financial files (contract number is
         ―FINANCIAL-xxx‖), if the transmission failure is due to an incorrect IP address,
         login, and password, use the Fin Resub function on the vertical toolbar to rebuild the
         transaction file and retransmit to DFAS. The Financial Resubmit is used in this case
         because the IP address, login, and password are embedded into the financial file;
         therefore, if any of this data changes, the file must be rebuilt. If a financial file
         transfer fails for any other reason, use the Resubmit option to retransmit the existing
         file without rebuilding a new one.
   4.20.2. Configure/Revise DCM Interfaces.
      4.20.2.1. DCM must be configured before any DCM transactions can occur. These
      parameters are already set in DMLSS, and modification to any DCM communication info
      should be limited to the SA when instructed by systems support. Fields will be blank
      unless the site receives instructions to update or load information. To set the
      configuration parameters, select the ―Configure‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar in
      the DCM Search window. The list of DCM Interface select criteria (transaction files
      available for interfacing with external systems) is listed in the top left corner of the DCM
      Configuration window. Use the DCM Configuration window (Figure 4.12.) to establish
      and/or edit electronic interfaces.

Figure 4.12. DCM Configurations Window.




      4.20.2.2. DCM also assists accounts in monitoring DFAS document numbers, controls
      the DCM outgoing transmissions, and activates the DFAS transaction process within
      DMLSS.
      4.20.2.3. Select (highlight) the interface file name to be configured. The interface
      settings vary depending on the file. Outlined below are some default settings for some of
      the common interface settings and explanations on how these interfaces interact.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                105


        4.20.2.3.1. Set the Send option to ―Yes‖ if the transaction file is to be electronically
        transmitted during the EOD process. The IP Address, Login ID, and Password are
        mandatory data fields when the Send option is ―Yes.‖
        4.20.2.3.2. Set the Send option to ―No‖ if the transaction file is not being
        electronically transmitted. Check ―No‖ when a recipient has asked to temporarily
        suspend transmissions, but make sure to return the send action to ―Yes‖ when
        transmissions can resume.
        4.20.2.3.3. When configuring the DFAS interface, set the Active and Send indicators
        to ―Yes.‖ By doing so, DMLSS generates financial transaction files during each
        EOD process. It does not create a transaction when there is no user activity recorded.
        If you select ―No‖ for the Active indicator, financial data transactions are suspended.
        Setting the Send option to ―Yes‖ ensures financial data is transmitted to DFAS daily.
     4.20.2.4. DFAS and FOA Excess interface options also have a Communications Routing
     Identifier (COMMRI) list table that identifies the site exchanging information with DLA
     Transaction Services (formerly DAASC). It is important to keep these COMMRIs up-to-
     date to ensure electronic data transfers do not fail. The three COMMRI types that must
     be entered are:
        4.20.2.4.1. AFMOA – The DLA Transaction Services assigned COMMRI for
        AFMLO is RUQAAEC. DO NOT change this COMMRI unless instructed to do so
        by AFMOA/SGALD.
        4.20.2.4.2. DAASC - RUSAZZA is the COMMRI assigned to DAASC. All
        electronic transmission data sent from the MTF is routed through DLA Transaction
        Services. They screen the data to determine if the transmission is clean and the data
        conforms to the standard file setup. If there are problems with a transmission file,
        DLA Transaction Services will not forward the file to the intended recipient.
        4.20.2.4.3. DMLSS – Each medical logistics activity generating electronic
        communications is assigned a COMMRI. The COMMRI loaded in the DMLSS
        COMMRI field uniquely identifies the site. DLA Transaction Services refers to this
        COMMRI as the Data Pattern COMMRI. This COMMRI is different for each MTF
        and is listed on the DLA Transaction Services website. A shortcut to their website is
        available from the AFML website via the supply tab/links tab.
     4.20.2.5. The DFAS Interface contains a non-editable field for the finance sequence
     number. This number is a sequence number assigned to all finance transmission header
     records and cannot be duplicated. Finance uses these sequence numbers to keep track of
     the MTF‘s financial transmissions that update the MTF‘s financial records. If DFAS
     provides notification that a sequence number is missing, use the DCM Search as
     explained in paragraph 4.19.1. to resubmit the applicable file.
  4.20.3. DCM Monitor.
     4.20.3.1. The DCM Monitor provides SAs a quick status view of the most current DCM
     transaction. Select ―DCM Monitor‖ from the SS Navigate dropdown menu or click the
     ―Monitor‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access the DCM Monitor.
 106                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       4.20.3.2. The SA determines what files appear in DCM Monitor by specifying how many
       days of transactions appear and how often updates are desired. The DCM Monitor lists
       only those files meeting the set criteria. Use the DCM Search function to see additional
       files.
       4.20.3.3. The Resubmit, View File, and Desc (description) functions work the same as
       described in paragraph 4.24.1., DCM Search. The DCM Monitor should be checked
       daily to minimize delays for services as well as financial and status updates.
4.21. EOP Process Management. Use the EOP Process Management window to view and
update the EOP process schedule (Figure 4.13.). To access, select ―End of Period Process
Management‖ from the SS navigate dropdown menu or click the ―EOP‖ button located on the
horizontal toolbar. Note: Use this information along with the EOP processing instructions
found in Chapter 2, Document Control and Financial Procedures, paragraph 2.12., and Chapter 3,
System Administration, paragraphs 3.12.3.-3.12.7.3. to further manage the end-of-day (EOD),
end-of-month (EOM), and end-of-fiscal year (EOFY or EOY) processing cycles in DMLSS.

Figure 4.13. EOP Process Management Window.




   4.21.1. EOP Cycles.
       4.21.1.1. EOD. The EOD automatically processes Monday through Friday at the
       designated ―Start Time‖ and on Saturdays and Sundays when the EOP on Saturday
       and/or Sunday indicators are selected.
       4.21.1.2. EOM. The EOM process automatically begins once the last EOD process for
       that month completes successfully.
       4.21.1.3. EOY. The EOY process corresponds to the EOFY, and runs automatically on
       30 September after the EOD and EOM processes are complete. If the September EOM
       process has not been completed, the EOY process completes the September EOM before
       beginning.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                107


   4.21.2. EOP Settings. The current FY, process start time, EOM process date, and last update
   fields are displayed. Users assigned the MM Security Manager role are authorized to update
   data fields with a white background.
       4.21.2.1. FY – Always set to current FY. Not editable.
       4.21.2.2. Start Time – Identifies the start time applied to all EOP cycles.
          4.21.2.2.1. SAs have an option to change the start time so EOP processes begin at a
          more convenient time. Do not change the EOP Start Time once that time has been
          reached or during the EOP process. The system becomes corrupt and then requires
          intervention from the MHS Service Desk to continue normal processing.
          4.21.2.2.2. Refrain from changing the time if its within a 30-minute window of the
          original start time in order to avoid potential system complications. For example, if
          your EOP is scheduled to start at 16:05 hrs., do not attempt to alter the start time
          moments before it is scheduled to begin, e.g., updating the EOP start time @ 16:04
          hrs. Attempting to adjust the start time may result in a conflict between scheduled
          Command Run On (CRON) cycles. In addition, avoid setting start times that start
          precisely at the top of the hour (19:00, 20:00, 21:00, etc.) or on any 15 minute
          increment after the top of the hour (20:15, 21:30, 22:45). DMLSS has imbedded
          CRON cycles designed to automatically process incoming status, POU files, etc, and
          encroaching on these CRON cycles leads to a potential threat of failure to launch the
          EOP. Adjust your start times accordingly (Example: 21:06, 22:09, etc.).
       4.21.2.3. EOP on Saturday/Sunday – If checked, DMLSS automatically processes an
       EOD on Saturday and/or Sunday at the assigned start time. As a general rule, EOPs are
       not processed on Saturdays and Sundays. If necessary, notify DFAS prior to processing
       EOPs on these days. In addition, coordinate with DLA Troop Support as PV orders and
       receipts could be transmitted to the BSM system over the weekend.
       4.21.2.4. EOM Process Dates – The EOM process dates should always equal the last day
       of each calendar month to include Saturdays and Sundays. Once an EOM has processed,
       that field is uneditable until the next FY.
       4.21.2.5. Last Updated – These fields identify the user ID of the DMLSS user who last
       updated the EOP data and reflects the date and time the update was accomplished.
4.22. Record Management. The Record Management function is strictly used by FM
personnel for setting FM records to inactive in the FM database. In order to use this function,
users must be assigned the SS ―SS Expert‖ role or a customized role, usually titled one of the
following: SS ―FM Related,‖ SS ―FM TMU Inactive,‖ or SS ―FM Inactive.‖
   4.22.1. Assigning the inactive status to a record allows it to be separated from the active
   records. The amount of data the application stores and the amount that the user must look
   through needs to be up to date at all times. Thus, it is important to keep the system updated
   and when it becomes necessary, records must be set to inactive so that the information is
   maintained for historical purposes.
   4.22.2. To access the Record Management window, click ―Record Management‖ from the
   Navigate menu or click the ―Record Mgt‖ button on the toolbar. Select ―Set Inactive‖ or
   ―Set Active‖ from the Action window. Select the items that you want to activate/inactivate
108                                                       AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


  from the Achievable Objects section in the window. On the right side of the window, select
  the actual object(s) to be set active/inactive and click the ―Process Rqst‖ button on the
  vertical toolbar. A message will be displayed to confirm that the action was processed. If
  the message indicates there were problems, ensure that the process met the guidelines stated
  in the previous paragraphs.
  4.22.3. Data must meet specific guidelines before being set to inactive. DMLSS displays a
  message stating what must be done before the inactive command can be processed. The
  following object types and rules apply to the inactivating and activating of FM objects:
      4.22.3.1. Facility. DMLSS checks for active work requests, projects, and FM
      requirements that have a relationship with the specified facility. If a relationship exists
      with any of these, the system displays a warning prompt identifying the type and number
      of relationships that exist. Any active rooms and RPIE that a facility may have will
      automatically be set to inactive along with the facility.
      4.22.3.2. Installation. All associated facilities must already be set inactive.
      4.22.3.3. Maintenance Procedure. The linked Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedule (if
      any) must have a valid end date; there must not be any scheduled work in the Work
      Projected table. When set inactive, all related schedules are deleted.
      4.22.3.4. Organization.      Organizations cannot be referenced in/on any active
      installations, facilities, POCs, specialty shops, RPIs, PM schedules, work requests,
      projects, Regulatory Compliance (RC) requirements, or FM requirements.
      4.22.3.5. POC. POCs cannot be referenced in/on any active installations, facilities,
      specialty shops, RPIEs, work requests, projects, or FM requirements.
      4.22.3.6. Project. All associated work requests will also be set inactive.
      4.22.3.7. RC Procedure. Only those RC procedures, which are not being utilized, are
      allowed to be set inactive.
      4.22.3.8. RC/Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
      Requirement. The RC requirement must have a valid end date and there must not be any
      scheduled work in the Work Projected table.
      4.22.3.9. RPIE. The RPIE cannot be a parent to any child RPIE nor have active work
      requests or projects. If it is a parent RPIE, you must first set the child to inactive.
      4.22.3.10. Requirement. A requirement must have the status of closed or cancelled in
      order to be set inactive.
      4.22.3.11. Room. All associated work requests, RPIE, and projects must already be set
      inactive and the room must not be linked to a drawing.
      4.22.3.12. Work Request. A work request must have the status of closed or cancelled in
      order to be set inactive. It cannot be associated with an active project. Work request(s)
      that are associated to open projects will not appear in the list. Associated closed projects
      are not set inactive with the work requests.
  4.22.4. When a record is set to inactive, it no longer appears in query results or other lists
  within the FM application. Exceptions: Users can search inactive records in the Work
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   109


   Request module, and inactive objects may be viewed using a BO query as long as they are
   not excluded. Inactive records may also be set back to active so they can be accessed
   through the FM application and updated if needed.
4.23. Change Expense Center. Within DMLSS, a customer‘s catalog records (item locations)
are associated to the expense center similarly to the way the catalog records are associated to the
SVC/CUST. Use the Change Expense Center function to process a mass update to expense
center record associations, rather than processing one at a time. The process is similar to
associating/disassociating expense centers under the SVC/CUST Detail window.
4.24. Assign Customer to SOS. This window is used to associate an SOS with multiple
SVC/CUST accounts (in mass). Associating a SOS to a customer authorizes that customer to
bypass LOG and place orders directly to the SOS. Since MAs are the only authorized CAIM
SOS for AF accounts, this option should not be used.
4.25. Assign Customers to User IDs. Use this option to associate or unassociate a SVC/CUST
to users in mass. This function is helpful when a new SVC/CUST is established and the SA
needs to simultaneously assign that new customer to multiple users.
4.26. Assign Role to User IDs. This mass update feature allows administrators to
simultaneously associate or unassociate a single role to or from multiple users. This function
may be beneficial when new system roles are added to DMLSS as a result of a software upgrade.
4.27. Assign Assemblages to User IDs. Use this option to associate or unassociate AM
assemblages to users in mass. This option is useful when newly assigned assemblage(s) have
been gained into DMLSS and multiple users require privileges to those assemblage(s).
4.28. Standard Reports. The SS application contains several ‗canned‘ reports available for
managing operating funds and AM funds as well as monitoring and managing system user
accounts. Refer to Chapter 13, DMLSS Reports, for an explanation of selected reports contained
in the SS application.
 110                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013

                              INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

5.1. Purpose. Inventory Management (IM) provides customers and materiel managers with a
seamless, automated capability to manage inventory from the time a customer starts the search
for a supply item to when the materiel is issued for consumption. It accommodates any required
redistribution or disposal actions. It also provides the functionality to establish formal
AFWCF/MDD and/or Operations and Maintenance (O&M) accounts with perpetual inventory
management.
   5.1.1. IM Inbox. For privileged users, the IM Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the
   IM application from the DMLSS System Navigation window. It can also be viewed by
   selecting ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities menu (see paragraph 5.31.1.). Users must be assigned
   the IM User Pending Action privilege and be associated to pending actions for the inbox to
   appear. It contains many pending actions that are either advisory in nature or require user
   action. DMLSS automatically removes some action items from the inbox upon processing,
   while other advisory notices should be removed or deleted upon review and when no longer
   needed. A detailed list of IM pending actions and their recommended use is available in
   Attachment 5. At a minimum, all pending actions should be reviewed and worked daily to
   ensure proper management of all assemblages.
   5.1.2. The IM main window also appears once the IM application is launched from the
   DMLSS System Navigation window. In this window, users can access the modules and
   functionalities of IM mainly through the menu options. In some cases, you can also use the
   buttons on the horizontal toolbar at the top of the window to open IM module windows.
   While on any IM primary window, you have access to the same menu bar and horizontal
   toolbar buttons. Each module window, however, displays a unique set of vertical toolbar
   buttons on the right side of these windows.
   5.1.3. The modules covered in the remainder of this chapter are in the same order as they
   appear in the Navigate and Utilities dropdown menus located on the menu toolbar.
5.2. New MTF Catalog Records. Building catalog records is very important to all aspects of
system use as well as AF and DoD standardization processes. Users benefit by loading all
available data into the catalog record upon creation. The New Catalog Item functionality is
accessible from the Navigate menu. Located within this function is the capability to add catalog
records to the MTF and customer catalogs. The preferred method to follow when adding a
catalog record to the MTF is to first search the UDR and DMLSS Master file for existing catalog
information (paragraph 5.3.). Change the ―Scope‖ to ―Contracted‖ Items‖ and enter pertinent
data to be used when conducting the search. The system displays all matches retrieved based on
the data entered. Create a new MTF catalog record when no matching records are retrieved.
   5.2.1. Adding a MTF Catalog Record Using Catalog Search.
       5.2.1.1. Items are added to the MTF Catalog using either the Cat Search icon on the
       horizontal toolbar or selecting New Catalog Item and then MTF Catalog Item from the
       Navigate menu. Search scopes (Figure 5.1.) must be set to Contracted items before
       choosing Sourced/Unsourced items since this option presents the best possible monetary
       savings over open market items. Carefully screen and exhaust the list of potential
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                          111


      contracted items before considering noncontracted sources. Note: The ECAT scope was
      removed. ECAT product and sourcing data now exist within the Medical Master Catalog.

Figure 5.1. Catalog Search, Scopes.




      5.2.1.2. Record(s) matching the search criteria are displayed upon execution of the
      search.
      5.2.1.3. To create a new MTF catalog record, highlight the desired record and select
      ―Add MTF‖ from the vertical toolbar. Upon doing so, the new MTF Catalog record is
      displayed in the Basic tab view (Figure 5.2.).

Figure 5.2. MTF Catalog Record, Basic Tab.

      5.2.1.4. Basic Tab.
         5.2.1.4.1. Insert known data into the required (those with red dots) and optional
         fields. The MTF Restrictions, Special Restrictions, and Destruction Method fields
         require special attention and this data should be loaded if applicable. Save changes
         once all data is entered and the remaining tabs will become available.
         5.2.1.4.2. Item Identification (ID). The Item ID field is used to assign an ID number
         to an item. This field allows up to 32 positions; however, the assigned item ID should
         directly correlate with the item. For example, a National Drug Code (NDC)
         specifically identifies a pharmaceutical. Additionally, the local warehouse stocking
         configuration should be considered because, in most cases, materiel is stocked in item
         ID sequence.
             5.2.1.4.2.1. To maintain standardization and database integrity, follow these rules
             when assigning an item ID:
                 5.2.1.4.2.1.1. Do not use item nomenclature.
                 5.2.1.4.2.1.2. Avoid special characters such as (, # $ @ ! % & *) and spaces.
                 Using special characters makes database searches/matches impossible.
                 5.2.1.4.2.1.3. Avoid making multiple catalog records for the same item.
                 Search for an existing record before creating a new one.
                 5.2.1.4.2.1.4. Do not prefix the item ID with terms or acronyms like ―ISBN,‖
                 ―Cat Nr,‖ etc.
             5.2.1.4.2.2. Utilize the following hierarchy/level of precedence when assigning
             item IDs:
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.1. National Stock Number (NSN).
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.2. If no NSN, use NDC.
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.3. If no NSN or NDC, then use Universal Product Number (UPN).
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.4. If no NSN, NDC, or UPN, then use the MFG‘s Part Number.
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.5. If none of the above, use the Vendor‘s Catalog Number (VCN).
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.6. As a last resort, assign a local (LOC) item ID.
                 5.2.1.4.2.2.7. Use the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for all
                 books.
         5.2.1.4.3. Commodity Class (CC). The CC identifies the item‘s commodity type.
         Use the following rules to assign the appropriate CC:
             5.2.1.4.3.1. Pharmaceutical – Use for drugs/pharmaceuticals related to Federal
             Stock Classes (FSC) 6505, 6508, or NDC‘s. Pharmaceuticals expend to EOR
             615.
             5.2.1.4.3.2. Repair Part Medical/Nonmedical – Medical/Nonmedical parts for
             equipment.
             5.2.1.4.3.3. Supply WRM SG Managed – Assign this CC to WRM supply items
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           113


          that are centrally managed by AFMOA/SGAL. This CC expends funds to EOR
          604. All receipts and issues associated to this CC are respectively coded as
          reimbursable and refundable.
          5.2.1.4.3.4. Supply Durable Medical/Nonmedical – Use for medical/nonmedical
          durable supply items. Medical examples include scissors and IV poles while
          nonmedical examples include calculators and pencil sharpeners.
          5.2.1.4.3.5. Supply Expendable Medical/Nonmedical – Medical/nonmedical
          items that are not durable. Items are usually expended, consumed, or used one
          time then discarded. Examples of medical items are bandages and gauze.
          Examples of nonmedical items are paper and scotch tape.
          5.2.1.4.3.6. Equipment  Capital   Medical/Nonmedical      –    Assign    to
          medical/nonmedical equipment with a purchase cost greater than $249,999.99.
          Capital equipment is associated to OP funds centrally managed at
          AFMOA/SGAL.
          5.2.1.4.3.7. Equipment     Durable     Medical/Nonmedical      –    Assign   to
          medical/nonmedical supplies when medical maintenance, warranty management,
          or the accountability of highly pilferable items is required. Durable equipment
          expends to EOR 604. Note: Any item, regardless of cost, that meets the criteria
          for equipment as defined in AFI 41-209, paragraph 7.2.3.2., should be coded as
          Equipment Expense rather than Equipment Durable.
          5.2.1.4.3.8. Equipment Durable WRM SG Managed – Use for WRM SG
          Managed equipment durable items that are centrally managed and purchased by
          AFMOA/SGAL. The CC for these items is associated to EOR 604, if and when
          these WRM items are sold off. All associated receipts and issues are respectfully
          coded as reimbursable and refundable.
          5.2.1.4.3.9. Equipment     Expense     Medical/Nonmedical      –    Use     for
          medical/nonmedical equipment with a unit cost less than $250,000 that meets the
          criteria outlined in AFI 41-209, paragraph 7.2.3.2. The CC for these items is
          associated to EOR 624.
          5.2.1.4.3.10. Equipment Expense WRM SG Managed - Use for WRM SG
          Managed medical/nonmedical equipment with a unit cost less than $250,000 that
          meets the criteria outlined in AFI 41-209, paragraph 7.2.3.2. This CC expends
          funds to EOR 624, if and when these WRM items are sold off. All receipts and
          issues associated to this CC are respectively coded as reimbursable and
          refundable.
       5.2.1.4.4. National Stock Number (NSN). A NSN is a 13 digit numerical number
       assigned centrally for global use and is recognized throughout the DoD. Load the
       contiguous number into this field. Do not use dashes, spaces, prefixes, or suffixes.
       Exception: The AF considers ―NCM‖ and ―UM‖ numbers valid NSNs (i.e.
       6515NCM040423 and 6515011498842UM).
114                                               AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      5.2.1.4.5. National Drug Code (NDC). The NDC should be entered into this field for
      items coded with a Commodity Class of ―Pharmaceutical.‖ Load the 11 digit
      contiguous number into this field. Do not use dashes, spaces, prefixes, or suffixes.
      5.2.1.4.6. Short Item Description. Use the Short Item Description field to provide a
      basic item description. This field allows for 40 alpha/numeric characters. Avoid
      using special characters such as (, # $ @ ! % & *). Using special characters makes
      database searches/matches impossible.       Note:    Short Item Descriptions are
      ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of
      DPV, DLA, or ECA. This field can only be modified via the daily UDR feed. The
      following displays an example of a Short Item Description:
         5.2.1.4.6.1. Main Noun – i.e. Forceps.
         5.2.1.4.6.2. Descriptive data – what kind of forceps, i.e. Kelly Hemo Curved
         CRS.
         5.2.1.4.6.3. Sizing data – i.e. 5IN.
         5.2.1.4.6.4. Complete Short Item Description – ―FORCEPS KELLY HEMO
         CURVED CRS 5IN.‖
      5.2.1.4.7. Long Item Description. The Long Item Description field is used to expand
      on the Short Item Description. Use up to 254 alpha/numeric characters for the long
      description. Using the example from 5.2.1.4.6.4., the description could be expanded
      to ―FORCEPS KELLY HEMOSTATIC CURVED CHROME RESISTANT STEEL
      5 INCHES LONG.‖ Note: Long Item Descriptions are ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS
      users if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or ECA. This
      field can only be modified via the daily UDR feed.
      5.2.1.4.8. Manufacturer‘s Name (Mfg Name). Use this field to identify the Mfg‘s
      name. The Mfg name identifies who made the product; it is not the same as a vendor
      or distributor name. A centralized Mfg‘s table is internally maintained in DMLSS.
      All new Mfg names must be added to this table prior to use. Note: The
      Manufacturer‘s name is ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users if the catalog record is
      sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or ECA. This field can only be modified via
      the daily UDR feed.
      5.2.1.4.9. Manufacturer‘s Catalog Number (Manufacturer Cat No). The item ID
      number assigned by the MFG should be loaded in this field. This number is not the
      same as the PV Order Number (PVON) or VCN. If the item is a pharmaceutical, the
      MFG‘s catalog number is the same as the NDC. Note: The Manufacturer‘s Catalog
      Number (Manufacturer Cat No.) is ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users if the catalog
      record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or ECA. This field can only be
      modified via the daily UDR feed.
      5.2.1.4.10. Hazardous Material. Use the dropdown options to identify each of these
      management areas as Yes, No, or Unknown. Note: DMLSS 3.1.2. replaces the
      hazardous material code with the hazardous material indicator. This element now
      consists of a simple Y (yes), N (no) or U (unknown).
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               115


       5.2.1.4.11. Cold Chain, Green, and Latex Dropdown Menus. Use the dropdown
       options to identify each of these management areas as Yes, No, or Unknown.
       5.2.1.4.12. Controlled Item Inventory Code (CIIC). The CIIC is used to assess
       special storage and handling requirements. Assigning a CIIC limits the distribution
       of the item to authorized customers. The two most notable codes are code R
       (schedule I and II controlled substances and precious metals) and Q (schedule III, IV,
       and V controlled substances).
       5.2.1.4.13. MTF Restrictions. Within the Basic tab, select the ―MTF Restrictions‖
       button to associate restrictions to an item. Assign MTF Restrictions to limit
       distribution of an item to authorized customers and to identify special storage and
       handling procedures. Available MTF Restriction codes and descriptions are available
       within the TMU table located in SS.
       5.2.1.4.14. Special Requirements.     Within the basic tab, select the ―Special
       Requirements‖ button to associate special requirements unique to an item. Assign
       special requirements to further specify an items distribution, storage, and handling
       requirements. Available special requirement codes and descriptions are available
       within the TMU table located in SS.
       5.2.1.4.15. Destruction Methods. Use the ―Destruction Methods‖ button to assign
       the appropriate method of destruction. The assigned method will print on destruction
       documents generated for that item ID. Destruction codes are visible within the TMU
       table located in SS.
       5.2.1.4.16. Add Like. The Add Like functionality provides users an avenue to build
       a new catalog record that is similar to an existing catalog record. First, locate and
       open the MTF detail for the existing record, and then select the ―Add Like‖ icon from
       the vertical toolbar. The system opens a new catalog record and replicates the basic
       data except for the item ID. To complete the action, insert a new item ID, click
       ―Save‖ and then complete the remaining catalog record tabs.
       5.2.1.4.17. WRM Prime Substitute Relationship. The WRM Prime/Sub (P/S) icon is
       used to establish P/S relationships for specific WRM assemblages. In order to create a
       new P/S or edit an existing P/S relationship, enter the substitute item ID at the bottom
       of the screen. Next, either associate or unassociate an assemblage and apply or delete
       ratios. Upon saving the information, DMLSS immediately updates the information in
       the applicable AM assemblages.
       5.2.1.4.18. Add Equivalent (Add Equ). The Add Equivalent function is used to view
       system identified equivalent items. Potential equivalents are matched using the item
       description and cataloging data such as NDC, MFG Cat Nbr, etc. Click on the ―Add
       Equ‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar to view a list of potential equivalents.
       Highlight the acceptable equivalent(s) and click ―OK.‖ Upon completion, the
       associated equivalent is listed in the Acceptable Equivalent tab.
       5.2.1.4.19. Adding New SOS‘s. The SOS Catalog tab has been combined into the
       Basic tab of the MTF Catalog. Use the ―ADD‖ button to establish a new SOS. At a
       minimum, one SOS should be added when creating a new MTF catalog record. The
       source‘s SOS Code must be associated to the item ID prior to establishing due-ins.
116                                                  AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      Note: The LOG SOS (local RIC) is always loaded so the customer can order from
      LOG. Once completed, the default SOS field in the LOG Cat tab will automatically
      update from UNK to the valid SOS. If multiple SOSs are added, DMLSS treats the
      very first SOS created as the ―default‖ SOS for LOG. If additional SOS‘s are built,
      the user will need to decide which SOS should be utilized as the default and make the
      appropriate change in the LOG Cat tab.
      5.2.1.4.20. Editing SOS Information. Upon associating to a SOS(s), additional
      information becomes available in the lower section of the screen. Mandatory fields
      are determined by the source and SOS type code. The U/P price, U/P, vendor item
      type, and vendor item number are always required. This information is unique to the
      selected SOS in the top window. Point to or highlight a SOS to view detailed data
      associated to that source.
         5.2.1.4.20.1. Primary Source. If the assigned SOS is a contracting office (SOS
         Type Code equals ―CON‖), then this is a mandatory field. The vendor‘s name,
         POC information, and ordering address are mandatory. The data loaded into these
         fields should identify the source which you recommend Contracting purchase the
         item from.
         5.2.1.4.20.2. FSC. The FSC is mandatory if the assigned SOS is a contracting
         source, SOS Type Code ―CON.‖ A list of FSCs is available in the DLA
         Customer Assistance handbook or at DLA‘s website, http://www.dla.mil/.
      5.2.1.4.21. Vendor Item Type. The Vendor Item Number field is used to dictate
      what type of ―item qualifier‖ is sent to the vendor within the requisition set. If LOG
      electronically interfaces with the vendor, this information is written to the requisition
      file and submitted to the vendor upon placing orders. For example, when ordering a
      pharmaceutical using the NDC number, the vendor item type would be ―NDC‖ and
      the 11 digit, numeric NDC number would be loaded into the Vendor Item Number
      field. Note: The Vendor item type is ―restricted‖ to the valid type on the contract
      purchase agreement if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or
      ECA. This field can only be modified via the daily UDR feed. Available Type
      Vendor Item descriptions are:
         5.2.1.4.21.1. HIBCC – Health Industry Business Community Council.
         5.2.1.4.21.2. ISBN - International Standard Book Number.
         5.2.1.4.21.3. MFG/PN - Manufacturer's Part Number.
         5.2.1.4.21.4. NDC - National Drug Code.
         5.2.1.4.21.5. NSN - National Stock Number.
         5.2.1.4.21.6. UCC/EA – Uniform Code Council, similar to UPN or Universal
         Product Code (UPC).
         5.2.1.4.21.7. VCN - Vendors Catalog Number.
      5.2.1.4.22. Pricing Agreement Number. The Pricing Agreement Number field is the
      placeholder for Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) numbers. The DAPA is
      the DoD National Contract number associated with that particular item. This is a
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                117


       mandatory field for all items assigned a DRS delivery method. The DAPA number is
       a primary vehicle for informing a Prime Vendor that these items should be
       delivered/invoiced at the specified DAPA price provided the vendor honors that
       manufacturer‘s DAPA. As mentioned previously, the system separates orders by
       delivery method. The system further separates LOG orders by DAPA number when
       the source‘s SOS type code is a Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support (DLA
       Troop Support) PV (DPV) and the delivery method is DRS. Note: The Pricing
       Agreement Number field is ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users if the catalog record is
       sourced to an SOS type of ―DPV‖ and the delivery method is DRS. This field can
       only be modified via the daily UDR feed.
       5.2.1.4.23. U/P. The U/P dropdown only displays codes loaded in the Packaging tab
       with the U/P indicator checked. Note: The U/P is ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users
       if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or ECA. This field can
       only be modified via the daily UDR feed.
       5.2.1.4.24. Unit of Purchase Price (U/P Price). Load the U/P price for the selected
       source. Each associated SOS may sell the item at a different price. The U/P price
       will default to $.01 if actual price is not loaded. When/if the U/P price is adjusted and
       changes saved, the new data is written to the Packaging tab and DMLSS recalculates
       all packaging and unit pricing ratios. Note: The U/P is ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS
       users if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA, or ECA. This
       field can only be modified via the daily UDR feed.
       5.2.1.4.25. Delivery Methods: Delivery methods are assigned to items being
       purchased from a PV. The available codes will vary depending on the PV type,
       whether it is pharmaceutical or medical/surgical. The delivery methods available for
       PVP and PVM are as follows:
          5.2.1.4.25.1. PVP Delivery Methods.
              5.2.1.4.25.1.1. JIT – Just-In-Time.
              5.2.1.4.25.1.2. DRS – Drop Shipment.
          5.2.1.4.25.2. PVM Delivery Methods.
              5.2.1.4.25.2.1. USE – Usage Item.
              5.2.1.4.25.2.2. NUS – Non-Usage Item.
              5.2.1.4.25.2.3. DRS – Drop Shipment.
          5.2.1.4.25.3. DMLSS automatically separates LOG orders according to the
          assigned Delivery Method. For example, if LOG orders exist for PVM and that
          order contains both USE and NUS items, the system will sort the USE items into
          one order and the NUS items into another order. A separate call number is
          assigned to each order.
       5.2.1.4.26. Estimated Monthly Usage. When usage must be reported to the vendor,
       enter the estimated monthly usage quantity into this field. The estimated usage must
       be at least one for items assigned a delivery method of JIT and USE because these are
       recognized as recurring purchases.

         5.2.1.4.27. Report PV Usage. The Report PV Usage box is used to identify items
         that require usage quantities to be reported to the vendor. Note: If the Send Usage
         box in the SOS record is not checked, usage will not be reported to the vendor.
         5.2.1.4.28. ECAT. The ECAT Supplier ID and Catalog ID become mandatory fields
         for items associated to an ECAT type source. Note: The ECAT Supplier ID and
         ECAT Catalog ID, are ―uneditable‖ to the DMLSS users if the catalog record is
         sourced to an SOS type of ―ECA.‖ This field can only be modified via the daily UDR
         feed.
      5.2.1.5. Locked Catalog Fields. In DMLSS 3.1.2./Gen IV, certain catalog fields will be
      ―LOCKED‖ when that record is associated to the Medical Master Catalog (MMC).
      Every item ordered from a PV or ECAT must be associated to the MMC, and those items
      ordered from a PV must have a pricing agreement.
         5.2.1.5.1. These include the short and long item descriptions, manufacturer name,
         manufacturer catalog number, national drug code, and national stock number are
         locked once they are associated to the Medical Master Catalog (MMC). Note: Item
         descriptions can be edited by the user; however, when reported externally and in pre-
         built ad-hoc reports, the MMC descriptions shall be used.
         5.2.1.5.2. Products sourced to a PV will have all fields locked with the exception of
         unit of purchase, delivery method, and estimated monthly usage.
             5.2.1.5.2.1. The delivery methods are restricted to NUS, USE, and DRS for
             PVM, USE is not available for a MOF contract.
             5.2.1.5.2.2. PVP uses delivery methods of JIT and DRS.
         5.2.1.5.3. Products sourced to ECAT and DLA will have all sourcing fields locked.
      5.2.1.6. Packaging Tab/Pop-up Window. In DMLSS 3.1.2., the packaging tab moved to
      a Jump To button that is located next to the U/P field in the SOS CAT detail. Only
      packaging configurations available from the particular SOS chosen may be selected.
      Within the Packaging tab (Figure 5.3.), users can add, delete, or ‗breakdown‘ U/Ps. This
      data directly relates to the Ordering Information and Inventory Information located
      within the LOG Cat tab. The Order Information identifies the U/P and U/P Quantity in
      which the item is purchased from the default SOS. The Inventory Information (Unit of
      Sale) identifies how the item inventory is maintained and the U/S and U/S Quantity.
      Within this tab, users can add higher levels of packaging or break a package into smaller
      units. However, all U/Ps must be equally divisible by the U/M Quantity identified in the
      Inventory Information box in the LOG Cat tab. For example: The item ID is currently
      purchased in Box (BX) of 100 from the vendor; however, another SOS sells the same
      item in a larger U/P (Case of 500). By clicking on the "Add" button, the user can select
      "CS." The new ratio quantity must be 5. The U/P checkbox/column identifies all units
      that are available for purchase from the default SOS. The LOG Inventory Unit (Log U/S)
      may or may not be marked as available for purchase for the SOS. Use the Ratio entry to
      identify how many individual units equate to the LOG Inventory Unit. The U/M
      Quantity is used to calculate the Unit Price (lowest measure) for the specified
      (highlighted) unit. Additional packaging details such as the height, weight, length, unit
      size, etc. can also be entered to further describe the package. Note: The U/P value for
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  119


      ―LOG‖ is ―uneditable‖ to DMLSS users if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of
      DPV, DLA, or ECA. This field can only be modified via the daily UDR feed.

Figure 5.3. MTF Catalog Record, Packaging (Tab) Window.




         5.2.1.6.1. Unit of Purchase (U/P). The U/P identifies the unit in which the item is
         purchased.
         5.2.1.6.2. Unit of Measure Quantity (U/M Qty). The U/M Qty identifies the quantity
         within the U/P. This data is used to compute the unit of measure (U/M) price in price
         comparisons and catalog searches. With few exceptions, the U/M Qty should only
         equal ―1‖ if the U/P is ―EA.‖ If purchasing a bottle of Aspirin containing 100 tablets,
         the U/P is ―BT‖ and the U/M Qty is ―100.‖ If purchasing a 16 ounce bottle of
         Isopropyl Alcohol, the U/P is ―BT‖ and the U/M Qty is ―16.‖ The U/M quantity field
         is editable by adjusting the "ratio" associated to the U/P. Once saved, this updates
         information displayed within the Packaging and LOG Cat tabs.
      5.2.1.7. Technical Tab. Information contained in the Technical tab (Figure 5.4.) will
      vary depending on the assigned CC. Equipment, pharmaceutical, repair parts, service,
      and supply commodity types require unique technical information. The Technical tab
      allows users to enter an item expiration type, shelf life code, and other important
      information unique to the item. Three ―local‖ fields exist for site specific use. The first,
      titled ―Local Field‖ is displayed in the Basic tab. The other two, ―Local Field 2‖ and
      ―Local Field 3,‖ are located in the Technical tab. It is recommended that the Materiel
      Manager or Superintendent define a standardized use for these fields prior to use to
      eliminate confusion and inconsistency.
 120                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 5.4. MTF Catalog Record, Technical Tab.




       5.2.1.8. Acceptable Equivalent Tab (Figure 5.5.). Use this tab to identify VINs that are
       acceptable equivalents to that particular item.              Acceptable equivalents are
       interchangeable exact equivalents that have been approved for automatic substitution and
       contain the same intermediate package quantities as the primary item. Use the ―Add‖
       radio button to associate additional equivalents. The barcode numbers for the item ID
       and acceptable equivalents are also stored in this tab and aid the receiving process.

Figure 5.5. MTF Catalog Record, Acceptable Equivalent Tab.




       5.2.1.9. Customer Catalog Tab. The Customer Catalog tab (Figure 5.6.) identifies which
       customers contain the item on their Customer Catalog. These are customers that are
       currently or have previously requested the item from LOG. The U/P, U/S, and EOH, are
       displayed in this screen. The item may be added or deleted from Customer Catalog(s) in
       this screen. Additionally, existing records can be edited.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 121


Figure 5.6. MTF Catalog Record, Cust Cat Tab.




      5.2.1.10. LOG Catalog Tab.
         5.2.1.10.1. The LOG Catalog tab (Figure 5.7.) is used to identify information unique
         to the logistics account. A default SOS other than UNK should always be associated
         to MTF catalog records. Only SOS(s) added to the basic tab will appear for selection
         in this field. When the system identifies a requirement for this item, it will appear in
         LOG Orders to be purchased from this default SOS code.

Figure 5.7. MTF Catalog Record, Log Cat Tab.
122                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


        5.2.1.10.2. CAIM balances, CAIM WRM balances, LOG Owned WRM Balances,
        Leveling, and Excess can be reviewed by selecting the appropriate radio button.
        5.2.1.10.3. The Ordering Information U/P, U/P Quantity, and U/P Price reflect how
        LOG purchases the item from the default SOS.
        5.2.1.10.4. The Inventory Information identifies the package size in which the item
        inventory is maintained as well as the U/S. The Unit (i.e. EA, PG, CS, etc.) must be
        entered on the Packaging tab using the Break Unit function in order to be assigned as
        the Inventory Unit (IU). DMLSS prompts the user to recalculate levels (realign
        up/down) and demands when the U/P or the IU is changed.
        5.2.1.10.5. Inventory Unit/Adjusted U/S. The IU, formerly known as the U/S, is
        located in the Inventory Information box of the LOG Catalog tab window. DMLSS
        allows for purchasing an item using one U/P and stocking and selling it using another
        U/S. Note: LOG sells materiel in the same U/M used for inventory purposes.
        Materiel managers can adjust the packaging or ―breakdown‖ an item into smaller IU,
        maximizing stock rotation and consumption. Adjusting the U/S also accommodates
        customers with limited storage space. Items cannot be adjusted while due-ins and/or
        due-outs exist. Also, an item with a U/P Quantity equal to ―1‖ cannot be adjusted.
        An item is considered adjusted when the U/P, assigned in the SOS Catalog tab, and
        the IU are different. Figure 5.1 reflects one possible scenario. Notice the U/P is BX
        of 100 and the IU is PG of 10.
        5.2.1.10.6. Select the ―Leveling‖ option to view and/or update LOG operating level
        type, level, and ROP.
            5.2.1.10.6.1. Select a Level Type of Core, Static, or Stockless. While under
            normal circumstances, it is desirable to allow the system to perform inventory
            control, there are conditions that warrant local control of stock levels. Below are
            some examples of situations that would warrant non-computer controlled levels.
               5.2.1.10.6.1.1. New items that do not have consistent issue consumption or
               pipeline time data recorded.
               5.2.1.10.6.1.2. Items with erratic issue consumption.
               5.2.1.10.6.1.3. An item that is being phased out of inventory.
               5.2.1.10.6.1.4. Special items that must be maintained at a specific level
               regardless of low or infrequent demands.
               5.2.1.10.6.1.5. Mission changes that have an immediate impact on issue
               consumption.
            5.2.1.10.6.2. While it is adjustable, AF policy states the Computation Method for
            all items should be set to ―Days of Stock.‖ The Estimated Monthly Usage field
            for PV items can also be viewed here. In addition, the History Begin Date
            (HBD), last six pipeline dates and days, and the last 24 months of consumption
            history are recorded in the Leveling window.
            5.2.1.10.6.3. Refer to Chapter 14, Inventory Control, for additional information.
  5.2.2. Creating a New MTF Catalog.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 123


      5.2.2.1. Items not listed on the UDR or DMLSS Extract and items that do not have
      existing equivalent records require a new MTF Catalog item record. To add a new MTF
      Catalog record, access the Navigate option from the menu bar or by using DMLSS
      shortcut ―Ctrl+Shift+F2.‖ The requirements to build a new catalog record are the same
      as creating a catalog record using the search option. Refer to section 5.2.1. for details.
      5.2.2.2. Personnel creating new catalog records should have thorough knowledge of the
      item prior to building the record. As explained in paragraph 5.2., all required fields must
      be completed properly so DMLSS will propagate all related tables and fields with reliable
      data. Entering and saving additional data, such as the MFG‘s name, MFG‘s part number,
      NDC, NSN, etc. are essential to a smooth acquisitions process. Basically, to be
      successful all essential data should be entered into the catalog record.
   5.2.3. Customer Catalog Item. To access, select New Catalog Item from the Navigate menu
   and then click ―Customer Catalog Item.‖ Enter the required information (fields with red
   dots). Most of the fields populate with information from the MTF catalog record once the
   item is added to the customer catalog. Validate existing conversion information, inventory
   value, and issuing information. Once the customer‘s catalog record is saved, add the
   customer‘s level if required and save the changes. Catalog records may also be added to a
   customer‘s catalog using the Cust Cat tab of the MTF detail record.
5.3. Catalog Search.
   5.3.1. Select ―Catalog Search‖ from the Navigate menu or select the ―Cat Search‖ icon
   located on the horizontal toolbar to access this function.
   5.3.2. The Catalog Search module is used for adding, retrieving, editing, and storing catalog
   information. Use the Catalog Search module to conduct research on products currently used
   by a MTF as well as on new items the facility is considering for use. The search provides
   MTF personnel information such as item costs, available sources, and unique characteristics
   associated with particular products. The DMLSS catalog search function combines a
   multitude of catalogs into an easy-to-use automated tool that provides information on the
   majority of products from both commercial and DoD sources to include items already
   managed within the MTF.
      5.3.2.1. The Catalog Search window contains multiple search tabs and allows individuals
      to search the database for information using basic, advanced, or categorical search
      criteria. The maximum number of records DMLSS will retrieve during each search is
      500. The system defaults to the first 500 matches. Users can adjust the search limit
      lower than 500 records but not greater than this limit. The limit is enforced to minimize
      server demands and to maximize server performance. In order to search for "inactive"
      (Deleted) catalog records, the user must check the "deleted" box.
      5.3.2.2. Data may be entered into multiple fields to minimize search results. Some of the
      search fields may or may not be available for use depending on the selected scope.
   5.3.3. Basic Search Tab.
      5.3.3.1. In DMLSS 3.1.2, individual or multiple catalog records can be accessed with a
      basic search. When using this option, the system displays all catalog records containing
      the keyword or number requested. The Basic Search tab (Figure 5.8.) contains search
 124                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       and filter options. Use the Search By box to enter keywords or numbers. Multiple
       words are allowed in the description field, and the search will query both the short or
       long item description. The Number field searches the Item ID, NDC, NSN, GTIN,
       PVON, manufacturer catalog number or Vendor Item Number, and ECAT Numbers.

Figure 5.8. Catalog Search, Basic Search Tab.




       5.3.3.2. The Filter By box allows the user to filter by the pricing agreement or PV.
       These dropdown menus show all pricing agreements or PVs actionable by that particular
       site.
   5.3.4. Advanced Search Tab. The advanced search tab (Figure 5.9.) offers searchable fields
   differ based on the selected scope.

Figure 5.9. Catalog Search, Advanced Search Tab (Local Catalog Related Search Fields).




       5.3.4.1. A search can be conducted for either active or deleted records when the selected
       scope is LOG Catalog, MTF Catalog, or Customer Catalog. DMLSS will search and
       retrieve only active records if both the active and deleted boxes are unchecked. DMLSS
       responds with the message ―NO RECORDS FOUND‖ if no matches are located. If
       records are available, DMLSS totals the records and displays them under the Search
       System Results tab.
       5.3.4.2. Customer Catalog Scope. A customer ID must be selected prior to searching for
       a catalog record within a specific Customer Catalog.
   5.3.5. Categorical Search Tab.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                125


      5.3.5.1. A search can be processed for items classified as either Pharmaceutical or
      Medical/Surgical. The Pharmaceutical categorical search uses the American Hospital
      Formulary Service (AHFS) classification to provide groupings of items.               The
      Medical/Surgical search uses the Cardinal Healthcare (formerly Supplyline) classification
      system to provide groupings of items.
      5.3.5.2. To conduct a search, select a category and sub-category from the list, then click
      ―Search‖ from the vertical toolbar. DMLSS responds with the message ―NO RECORDS
      FOUND‖ if no matches are located. If matches are retrieved, DMLSS totals the records
      and displays them under the Search System Results tab.
   5.3.6. Search Result Detail Tab. If records are available, DMLSS totals the records and
   displays them under the Search Results Detail tab (Figure 5.10.). DMLSS responds with the
   message ―NO RECORDS FOUND‖ if no matches are located. Modify the search criteria
   and retry if the expected results are not received.

Figure 5.10. Catalog Search, Search Result Detail Tab.




      5.3.6.1. Drop Shipments Fee Indicator. With DMLSS 3.1.2/GEN IV, the catalog flags a
      PVM item if it can be ordered only via a drop shipment and if there are additional fees
      associated with it. Also, in the future under EBS, the vendors will be able to submit the
      drop shipment fees, if authorized, on the electronic Invoice (EDI 810).
5.4. Review MTF Catalog Changes.
   5.4.1. MTF Catalog changes are a result of changes made automatically by UDR updates
   and those accepted by users. Select ―Review MTF Catalog Changes‖ from the Navigate
   menu to review affected catalog records. Select an ―As of Date‖ from the menu once the
   window is open.
   5.4.2. MTF Catalog Changes. This option is used to search, view, and/or print catalog
   update data that has already processed. The system displays all catalog data for each record
   being displayed. However, the following data fields directly identify potential updates.
   Focusing on these data fields will allow technicians to efficiently complete this task.
      5.4.2.1. Element Changed - Identifies catalog data field to be updated.
      5.4.2.2. From - Displays existing data to be replaced.
 126                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       5.4.2.3. To - Displays new data to be placed in the identified element field.
   5.4.3. Recommended MTF Catalog Changes. Use this option to search, view, print, accept,
   and/or reject potential MTF Catalog record updates. These are recommendations that the site
   has not previously accepted, rejected, or suppressed. The information appears on either a
   critical or noncritical tab.
       5.4.3.1. Critical tab examples include the expiration type code and shelf life code.
       5.4.3.2. Non-critical tab examples include the device code and item descriptions.
   5.4.4. Work potential catalog updates daily if possible, in order to maintain current data and
   standardize records DoD-wide. However, users may choose to suppress a suggested change
   for up to 12 months.
5.5. Mass MTF Catalog Changes.
   5.5.1. The Mass MTF Catalog Changes function allows users to simultaneously apply the
   same update to multiple catalog records. Select ―Mass MTF Catalog Changes‖ from the
   Navigate menu to access this function.
   5.5.2. First, identify the catalog records requiring update. Enter the criteria for the desired
   records and click ―Search.‖ In the lower section of the window, select the items to be
   changed. Click ―Select All‖ to select the entire list.
   5.5.3. Next, in the top section of the window, identify the new data value(s) to be applied to
   the selected catalog records. The following data may be mass updated using this function.
       5.5.3.1. Manufacturer (See the Note below in 5.5.3.5.).
       5.5.3.2. Hazmat Code (See the Note below in 5.5.3.5.).
       5.5.3.3. Location.
       5.5.3.4. Standardized.
       5.5.3.5. Note: The Manufacturer and Hazmat Code are uneditable to the DMLSS users
       if the catalog record is sourced to an SOS type of DPV, DLA or ECA. This field can
       only be modified via the daily UDR feed.
   5.5.4. Click ―Apply‖ to affect the changes, then ―Save‖ to process the changes. Select
   ―Print‖ from the vertical toolbar to obtain a printed report of catalog record updates.
5.6. Source of Supply (SOS).
   5.6.1. New SOS. Utilize the New SOS option to create a new SOS. From the Navigate
   menu, select ―SOS,‖ then click ―New SOS‖ or use the DMLSS shortcut ―Ctrl+Shift+F4‖ to
   access this function. It can also be accessed by selecting the ―SOS‖ icon on the horizontal
   toolbar, then click ―New.‖ A SOS record must be created for every vendor and associated to
   the respective MTF/LOG catalog record(s) prior to processing orders through the system for
   each vendor. Users should search for existing SOS catalog records prior to adding new
   records. This will help minimize duplicate SOS records. Once the SOS catalog record is
   established, each item being purchased from that vendor must be linked to the SOS. Refer to
   section 5.2.1.4.19. for MTF Catalog record/SOS updates. If the new source is an official
   DoD contracting office and the SOS Type Code is equal to ―CON,‖ then the contracting
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 127


   office‘s DODAAC is required. A list of contracting office‘s DODAACs is located in the
   TMU in SS. It is titled ―CON DODAAC‖ and is located in the IM application.
      5.6.1.1. Example. The vendor is Beck-Lee, Inc. and the vendor‘s data (Figure 5.11) was
      obtained from the DBPA Report located on the AFML website.

Figure 5.11. Vendor Data from DBPA Report.




      5.6.1.2. Basic Tab. Use the Basic Tab (Figure 5.12.) to identify the supplier‘s name,
      SOS type code, SOS code, and additional purchase, delivery, and receipt information.
      Mandatory data fields are marked with a red dot. All other available data should be
      loaded and saved in the Basic tab as it is important to the purchasing and billing process.

Figure 5.12. Source of Supply – (New), Basic Tab.




          5.6.1.2.1. Applying the correct SOS type code is crucial. The SOS type code dictates
          what data is required in the additional tabs. Once saved, this code cannot be changed.
          If a mistake is made, click ―Close‖ to exit the window and do not save changes.
          Open the New SOS function to start over. The following further identifies the
          available SOS type codes:
             5.6.1.2.1.1. BPA – Blanket Purchase Agreement (Local).
             5.6.1.2.1.2. CON – A recognized government contacting office.
             5.6.1.2.1.3. DBP – Decentralized Blanket Purchase Agreement.
             5.6.1.2.1.4. DLA – Defense Logistics Agency.

         5.6.1.2.1.8. GSA – General Services Administration.
         5.6.1.2.1.9. NON – Non-Contracted (Only GPC orders).
         5.6.1.2.1.10. RPV – Reachback DLATS Prime Vendor.
         5.6.1.2.1.11. VPV – Veteran‘s Admin PV.
         5.6.1.2.1.12. HUB - HUB source of Supply.
      5.6.1.2.2. For SOS type code ―NON,‖ DMLSS offers an Auto Assign function that
      can be used to auto populate the SOS code for non-contracted sources. This option
      will assign the next sequential SOS code available based on criteria loaded in SS.
      When this option is selected, all required fields populate with the exception of the
      Supplier‘s Name. DMLSS interprets non-contracted sources as if all purchases will
      be paid for using the GPC; therefore, the ―Accepts Purchase Card‖ box is checked.
      The default payment method is the user‘s GPC and all orders are written to the users‘
      Purchase Card Register upon submitting orders.
      5.6.1.2.3. Enter the average delivery time from vendor into the Estimated Lead Days
      field.
      5.6.1.2.4. The Acknowledgement Hours field is defaulted to 2 hours. The data in this
      field is only applicable when DMLSS electronically interfaces with the vendor.
      Logistics personnel should modify this field when necessary. If an order is not
      confirmed by the vendor within this time frame, the system will write the order
      information to the Troubled Due-in Report that appears in the IM Inbox. For
      example, the PV SOSs default to 2 hours based on contract terms. If a different
      vendor confirms the order in 2 days, then the default should be set to 48 hours.
      5.6.1.2.5. If the ―Accept Purchase Card‖ box is checked, all orders to that SOS will
      default to GPC payment method and all purchases will write to the user‘s Purchase
      Card Register. It is highly advised that the Accept Purchase Card indicator not be
      checked for SOS type code ―DBP.‖ The rationale is that these vendors already have a
      negotiated contract vehicle in place. Using a GPC to facilitate procurement only adds
      additional work at the back end of the process (reconciliation). The user must have a
      GPC and have GPC Holder privileges assigned in DMLSS prior to processing orders
      to vendors that accept GPC payments. An override option exists in the orders module
      and should be utilized when processing non-GPC payment method orders.
      5.6.1.2.6. Enter the vendor‘s assigned Dunn & Bradstreet Serial Number (DUNS)
      number into the Vendor ID field. The financial interface process uses this number to
      identify vendors.
      5.6.1.2.7. When the SOS Type code is equal to ―CON,‖ the DODAAC and Primary
      Source fields become mandatory in the SOS Catalog tab of each item‘s catalog record
      associated to a contracting SOS.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 129


          5.6.1.2.8. A Stockless indicator exists in the Basic Tab of all SOS records. When
          activated/checked, all catalog records without a LOG level, and associated to that
          SOS Code are considered Stockless unless otherwise modified. Item IDs containing a
          level quantity > 0, are not affected. Newly established catalog records associated to a
          stockless SOS will default to Level Type of Stockless. The level type for catalog
          records associated to a stockless SOS can be manually changed to Core or Static.
          When the Stockless option is inactivated/unchecked, all catalog records with a level
          type of Stockless will be reassigned to level type of Static. Items with an existing
          level will maintain their existing level type.
          5.6.1.2.9. The BPN ID, DUNS Suffix code, and Trading Partner code are applicable
          to the Army and used for within the General Fund Enterprise Business System
          (GFEBS).
      5.6.1.3. Submission Tab.
          5.6.1.3.1. Use the Submission tab (Figure 5.13.) to identify how orders are usually
          submitted to the vendor. The available default submission methods will vary
          depending on the assigned SOS type code. For example, an electronic submission
          method FTP will be available for SOS type code DPV but not for NON. The
          assigned Default Submission Method dictates which fields are mandatory within this
          tab. However, it is highly suggested that all available data be loaded into the data
          fields. This tab offers a great way to maintain vendor contact information such as
          phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, etc. regardless of the submission
          method.

Figure 5.13. Source of Supply – (New), Submission Tab.




          5.6.1.3.2. Login and password information must be obtained from the SOS. IAW
          systems security measures, the passwords will not be visible to system users. Also,
          current security protocols dictate that most passwords are changed every 90 days.
          Keep this in mind when interface problems occur with the vendor.
      5.6.1.4. Contract Tab.
 130                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          5.6.1.4.1. The Contract tab (Figure 5.14) will only appear for contracted sources.
          They are SOS type codes BPA, DBP, DPV, and VPV. Loading contract information
          is essential. Be sure to enter the correct contract number when loading data in the
          Contract Number field as this data is populated in EDI requisition files as well as
          appearing on DD Form 1155s (i.e. use ―O‖s and ―zeroes‖ properly). When
          processing orders, the system will automatically assign the next available call number
          for that source when the Auto Generate Call Number box is checked. The user is
          required to load the beginning and ending call numbers. Recommend using ―0001‖
          through ―9999‖ unless otherwise designated. The Last Call Number Used field will
          update as orders are processed to the vendor.

Figure 5.14. Source of Supply – (New), SOS Contract Tab (Current Contract).




          5.6.1.4.2. The contract start and end dates are always dictated by the negotiated
          contract. However, the start and end dates loaded for the ―Current Contract‖ and the
          ―Next Contract‖ will vary depending on the source type. For example, if loading
          contract data for a PV, the Start Date and End Date should coincide with the contract.
          If the source has a DBPA, then the start and end dates should coincide with the FY
          because at the beginning of each FY, the ―FY‖ portion of the contract number
          changes.
          5.6.1.4.3. When a contract is within 60 days of expiration, a notification of the
          impending contract termination appears in the IM Cannot Activate Next Contract
          pending action. It is important to act promptly because if the end date passes without
          action, the SOS can no longer be used.
          5.6.1.4.4. When exercising option years, access the SOS record and update the
          contract ending date. This only refers to contracts that will maintain the exact same
          contract number. If the contract number changes, use the Next Contract function (e.g.
          DBPAs).
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               131


          5.6.1.4.5. Once the new contract is activated there is no way to reactivate or access
          the old contract. Users may also manually activate the new contract by selecting the
          ―Activate Next Contract‖ button. The end date of the current contract and the start
          date of the new contract cannot overlap when manually activating the next contract.
          5.6.1.4.6. Loading and Using the Secondary PV Contracts.
             5.6.1.4.6.1. Activate and load the secondary PV contract by accessing the TMU
             table in SS, then select the SS application. Open the Secondary PV Selection
             table and change the secondary field to ―YES‖ for the appropriate secondary PV
             contractor. Note: Only select the secondary PV assigned to your respective
             region. Save the updated data then open the SOS module in the IM application.
             5.6.1.4.6.2. Create a new SOS record for the secondary PV. Use SOS Type
             ―DPV‖ and the SOS code ―PV_.‖ You can enter the next sequential number not
             in use. For example, PV1 and PV2 are currently dedicated for Back-up
             MEDSURG and Pharmaceutical vendors worldwide. If you currently have no
             backup MEDSURG or Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor, assign the SOS codes of
             PV1 and PV2 respectfully. If your server already has PV1 and PV2 established,
             then proceed assigning PV3 and so on.
             5.6.1.4.6.3. In the basic tab of the primary PV, select the ―Backup PV SOS‖ for
             the Secondary PV from the drop down menu.
             5.6.1.4.6.4. The secondary PV is now active and available for use. A SOS record
             must be loaded for the secondary PV in order to process orders to that vendor.
             The secondary PV may not be used as the default LOG SOS value.
      5.6.1.5. Address Tab.
          5.6.1.5.1. Three different addresses can be maintained in the Address tab (Figure
          5.15). It is advisable to load the address data for both Ordering and Remit To
          addresses even if they are the same. The Find radio button can be used to search the
          database for existing addresses. If an existing address already exists, select the
          address and the Address Tab fields will update with the existing address.

Figure 5.15. Source of Supply – (New), Address Tab (Order/Remit to Addresses).
 132                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          5.6.1.5.2. Select the ―Shipping Address‖ box to load or edit the shipping address.
          This address should be the site‘s ship to address or the address the materiel is to be
          delivered.
       5.6.1.6. POC Tab. The POC tab (Figure 5.16.) offers an automated means to document
       all known contact information. It also provides a centralized storage area for that data. If
       utilized properly, purchasing agents will have the necessary contact data available to
       them when processing orders to that vendor. These data fields are not mandatory until
       data is entered into at least one field.

Figure 5.16. Source of Supply – (New), POC Tab.




       5.6.1.7. Environment Tab.
          5.6.1.7.1. The OPR and safety levels that correspond with annual sales for the
          associated SOS are located in this tab. Figure 5.17. lists the default values for these
          fields. If any of these fields are changed, a radio button titled ―Reset to Default‖ will
          appear. Click this button to reset the OPR and safety levels to system default values.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             133


Figure 5.17. Source of Supply – (New), SOS Environment Tab.




         5.6.1.7.2. The OPR and safety levels maintained in the Environment tab are utilized
         to calculate item levels for item IDs associated to the SOS. Refer to Chapter 14 for
         level and calculation formulas.
   5.6.2. Search SOS.
      5.6.2.1. Access the SOS Search window from the Navigate menu or by clicking on the
      ―SOS‖ icon on the horizontal toolbar. Users should always search for existing SOS
      records prior to adding a new SOS record to eliminate duplicate records. Use the Search
      SOS option to view and edit vendor data as necessary. Remember, once the SOS Type
      Code is saved it cannot be changed.
      5.6.2.2. Conducting a search for an existing SOS record can be accomplished using a
      few different methods. The first option is to search by SOS code. Another option is to
      search by SOS type code. Users can also conduct a search using the supplier‘s name.
      Finally, all SOS records can be viewed by clicking the ―Search‖ icon on the vertical
      toolbar.
      5.6.2.3. The data maintained in the SOS record is directly relevant to the information
      printed on the DD Form 1155. The following links some of the pertinent information to
      the forms:
         5.6.2.3.1. Block 1 – Contract/Purchase Order/Amendment Number:
             5.6.2.3.1.1. If the SOS type code is not equal to BPA, DBP, DPV, or VPV then
             the SOS code from the Basic tab is displayed.
             5.6.2.3.1.2. The contract number from the contract tab is displayed if the SOS
             type code is BPA, DBP, DPV, or VPV.
         5.6.2.3.2. Block 6 – Issued By data is retrieved from the MM Service Ship to
         Address located in SS.
         5.6.2.3.3. Block 7 – Remit to Address is pulled from the Remit To address in the
         Address Tab.
 134                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


           5.6.2.3.4. Block 9 – Contractor information:
              5.6.2.3.4.1. Supplier name is retrieved from the Basic tab.
              5.6.2.3.4.2. The address reflected in block 9 is the Order Address loaded in the
              Address Tab.
              5.6.2.3.4.3. The phone number is retrieved from the POC Tab.
              5.6.2.3.4.4. The SOS Code is written to the ―Code‖ box in block 9.
           5.6.2.3.5. Block 14 – Ship To data is retrieved from the MM Service ship to address
           located in SS.
           5.6.2.3.6. Block 15 - The payment address information in block 15 should reflect the
           paying DFAS office‘s information. It is retrieved from the Bill To address located in
           the MM Service detail record within SS. The ―Supplementary Addr/Bill to
           DODAAC‖ located on the basic tab of the MM Service detail record is printed in the
           ―Code‖ field in block 15. The DODAAC is required so vendors can properly load
           billing information into the WAWF application.
5.7. Purchase Card. Use the Purchase Card module for adding, retrieving, editing, and storing
GPC information. This module also enables AOs and GPC holders to monitor purchase card use
and reconcile purchases against monthly bank statements. Privileges and roles required to access
purchase card functions must be assigned in the SS module prior to use.
   5.7.1. Purchase Card Status.
       5.7.1.1. The Purchase Card Status inquiry provides a method for GPC holders and AOs
       to manage the purchase card program. Users can view or print status for all GPC holders
       or search for an individual GPC holder. Check the ―Include Deleted Cards‖ box to view
       GPC data marked for deletion.
       5.7.1.2. The Purchase Card Status Summary screen displays GPC management data in
       account number sequence and includes the following data:
           5.7.1.2.1. PC Alias – Reflects either the last four digits of the purchase card number
           or a combination of the DMLSS user ID and sequence
           5.7.1.2.2. Account Name – Reflects the card holder‘s name and should match the
           name printed on the actual purchase card (i.e. VISA).
           5.7.1.2.3. Holder ID – Same as user ID.
           5.7.1.2.4. Holder Name – Same as name loaded in user POC table.
           5.7.1.2.5. Register Status – This field identifies the working status of the GPC
           holder‘s register. Use this field to determine whether the cardholder is reconciling the
           register. The Register Status field will be either Working or Executed.
           5.7.1.2.6. Current Statement Date – Reflects the bank statement date of the last
           reconciliation. Managers should review this date to verify reconciliations are current.
           5.7.1.2.7. Primary GPC – Identifies whether or not the card is designated as the
           primary GPC for the cardholder.
           5.7.1.2.8. Ownership – Will always equal ―LOG.‖
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               135


        5.7.1.2.9. Type – Will always equal ―Stock.‖ Purchase cards issued for commercial
        services are not loaded in DMLSS.
        5.7.1.2.10. Deleted – Identifies whether or not a card is marked for deletion.
  5.7.2. Deleted Purchase Cards. This module reflects all Purchase Cards, by PC Alias,
  Account Name, and cardholder which have been retired/deleted.
  5.7.3. New Purchase Card.
     5.7.3.1. The data for all users assigned a GPC must be added to DMLSS prior to that
     user processing GPC purchases. DMLSS automatically associates purchases to the user‘s
     Purchase Card Register when placing orders to vendors that accept the purchase card
     payment method, refer to paragraph 5.6.1.2.5. At this time, the DMLSS SA should
     assign purchase card privileges commensurate with the cardholder.
     5.7.3.2. From the IM Navigate menu, select ―Purchase Card,‖ then ―New Purchase Card‖
     to add new cardholder data. The Purchase Card-New window contains multiple panels.
     The AO initially enters the following information and upon clicking ―Save‖ enters the
     cardholder‘s 16-digit account number.
        5.7.3.2.1. In the Cardholder Information panel, select the GPC holder‘s DMLSS user
        ID from the dropdown list. When the user ID is selected, the user‘s name, as it is
        loaded in DMLSS, will be displayed in the adjacent Name field.
        5.7.3.2.2. In the Purchase Card Information panel, enter the following information:
            5.7.3.2.2.1. Card Name – Enter the applicable bank name in this field.
            5.7.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date – Enter the expiration date as it appears on the front
            of the user‘s credit card. However, DMLSS requires a four-digit year. If the
            expiration date is 07/12, then enter 07/2012.
            5.7.3.2.2.3. Primary Indicator – In some instances a purchasing agent may be
            assigned multiple GPCs. In this situation, check this indicator to identify the
            user‘s primary card. All purchases will default to the user‘s primary card within
            the IM Orders module. An Override option exists in the Order module so the
            purchase agent can associate purchases to an alternate GPC when appropriate.
            5.7.3.2.2.4. Delete Indicator – This option is not accessible unless a card is
            already established. Mark a card for deletion using the Search Purchase Card
            option.
        5.7.3.2.3. Purchase Card Information panel.
            5.7.3.2.3.1. Enter the appropriate dollar limits in the Per Order and Per Month
            fields. This information should correspond with limits approved by the Base
            Purchase Card administrator.
            5.7.3.2.3.2. The Default Contract Number Field will auto populate with an "I"
            and a four digit alphanumeric combination, i.e., UT01. The last four digits can be
            changed to reflect the last four digits of the users GPC account number, i.e.,
            I3456. This field is editable; however, it is highly recommended that users
            maintain the system default. If the contract number is modified, be certain to
136                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             maintain an ―I‖ in the first position. The ―I‖ is an indicator recognized by Finance
             as a GPC purchase and all detail records will bypass IAPS and populate SMAS.
         5.7.3.2.4. Funds Panel. The fund type within the Funds window will always be
         associated to ―Stock Fund‖ for AF users. The Ownership Code in the Ownership
         window will always be associated to LOG for AF users.
         5.7.3.2.5. Customers Panel. Data within the Customer window is not editable for AF
         sites. The expense center defaults to LOG, the CC defaults to ―blank,‖ and the
         customer ID is defaulted to the site‘s DODAAC.
         5.7.3.2.6. In the Approving Official panel, select the AO‘s DMLSS user ID from the
         dropdown box. When the user ID is selected the user‘s name, as it is loaded in
         DMLSS, will be displayed in the adjacent Name field.
      5.7.3.3. Click ―Save‖ from the vertical toolbar once all data is entered into the Purchase
      Card-New window. Upon saving, the window name will change to Purchase Card
      (account number). In this window, the AO initially enters the 16-digit account number.
      The cardholder is required to confirm the 16-digit account number when he/she first
      accesses the account in DMLSS. Once confirmed, the card number is not legible and
      becomes encrypted.
  5.7.4. Search Purchase Card. From the Navigate menu, select ―Purchase Card,‖ then
  ―Search Purchase Card‖ to access this function. Use the Search Purchase Card option to
  access existing GPC records. Purchase card information can be viewed, edited, and printed
  once retrieved. Use this option to mark a record for deletion or undelete a user‘s purchase
  card. Detailed data associated to a deleted card remains visible until all actions associated to
  the purchase card are complete and all transactions are reconciled.
  5.7.5. Purchase Card Register.
      5.7.5.1. The Purchase Card Register is accessible by selecting ―Navigate,‖ ―Purchase
      Card,‖ then ―Purchase Card Register.‖ Cardholders use the Purchase Card Register to
      manage their purchase and receipt transactions. It can also be used by AOs to monitor
      each cardholder‘s actions.
      5.7.5.2. A Purchase Card Register may be accessed by either searching for an
      individual‘s user ID, PC Alias, or selecting ―Deleted.‖ Use the dropdown box in the
      Account field to identify which Purchase Card Register is to be viewed. The statement
      month defaults to the last month reconciled but can be changed when necessary. Two
      Purchase Card Register modes are available: Reconcile and Read-Only. Use the
      Reconcile mode to access GPC transactions that have not been reconciled and interfaced
      with DFAS or ―Executed.‖ Use the Read-Only mode to access transactions that have
      already been interfaced with DFAS or ―Executed.‖ When using this mode, the register
      separates and saves transaction data according to the month and year the reconciliation
      was completed. The registers for both modes reflect the same data.
      5.7.5.3. The Purchase Card Register window (Figure 5.18.) is divided into three sections.
      The upper section contains the GPC information, middle portion displays the actual
      Purchase Card Call Register, and the bottom section displays the other information.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 137


Figure 5.18. Purchase Card Register window.




         5.7.5.3.1. Purchase Card Information. The GPC information displayed in this section
         directly correlates to the cardholder‘s GPC record.
             5.7.5.3.1.1. The Current Statement is the date populated by the user in the Select
             the Purchase Card Account to Reconcile window.
             5.7.5.3.1.2. Users may enter the bank statement total from the monthly credit
             card statement into this field; however, this field is optional. If used, DMLSS will
             compare the bank statement total to the DMLSS statement total and populate an
             out of balance amount. A price value error exists if these values differ. In this
             instance, the user must research each transaction to verify the DMLSS price
             matches the price charged to the credit card.
             5.7.5.3.1.3. Default Statement Amount box. The Order Total will populate in full
             to the Current Statement Amount and Total Balance Paid fields when the Default
             Statement Amount box is checked.
             5.7.5.3.1.4. The Register Status can be either Working or Executed. The status
             defaults to ―Working‖ during the reconciliation process and changes to
             ―Executed‖ upon completing the reconciliation process.
         5.7.5.3.2. Purchase Card Call Register. Use the Purchase Card Call Register to
         reconcile purchases once the charges are applied to the cardholder‘s bank statement.
         Cardholders are required to reconcile charges in DMLSS at least monthly, but they
         can also reconcile multiple times during a statement period. The reconciliation
         process is twofold, customers should reconcile with DMLSS and their applicable
         banking agency. As a general rule, the DMLSS Purchase Card Register can be
         reconciled upon receipt and the banking statement can be verified and approved upon
         billing.
             5.7.5.3.2.1. All GPC orders processed by users assigned as GPC holders are
             automatically written to the Purchase Card Call Register of the user who is logged
             into DMLSS at the time. GPC orders are generated in either IM or AM. Detail
             records cannot be manually added to the Purchase Card Register. Notable

             Purchase Card Register fields are as follows:
                5.7.5.3.2.1.1. Reconcile – Defaults to open/unchecked when added to the
                register. This box is checked when the detail record is selected for
                reconciliation.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.2. Reconciliation Code – N = New; P = Partial; D = Disputed; and
                Y = Complete (Figure 5.19).

                services (Should always be Materiel for AF).
                5.7.5.3.2.1.5. Order Total – Total order amount.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.6. Order Status – Receipt Status; Open = not received, and Closed
                = received.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.7. Current Statement Amount – Amount being reconciled; should
                match bank statement.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.8. Previous Balance Paid – Amount of previous reconciliation;
                associated to a previous partial reconciliation.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.9. Total Balance Paid – Current and past amounts reconciled.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.10. Order Adjustment – Purchase Card adjustment amount; should
                only be used for unknown shipping charges.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.11. Order Date – Date order was processed in DMLSS.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.12. Order Call Number – Auto generated upon procurement;
                assigned per SOS.
                5.7.5.3.2.1.13. SOS Code – SOS code.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             139


              5.7.5.3.2.1.14. Contract Number – Will either be the SOS code or contract
              number. If SOS type code is NON the SOS code will populate this field. If
              contracted SOS, the contract number will populate this field.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.15. Supplier Name – Vendor name from SOS record.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.16. Purchase Card Call Number – Auto assigned; assigned per
              cardholder.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.17. Vendor Reference Number – Same as order confirmation
              number. Data must be documented during the procurement process to appear.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.18. DFAS Document Number – Document number posted by
              DFAS. Only populates after reconciliation process is complete and interface
              with Finance is completed.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.19. DFAS Trans Date – Date DFAS document number is posted
              by Finance.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.20. Order Strat Type – OPR = Operational; WRM = War Reserve
              Materiel.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.21. Customer of Origin ID – Identifies who purchased the product,
              normally will equal local DODAAC.
              5.7.5.3.2.1.22. Customer of Origin Name – Further identifies who purchased
              the product, normally will be Medical Materiel.
          5.7.5.3.2.2. Register Status – Either Working or Complete. Defaults to Working
          during reconciliation process. Change to Complete after monthly reconciliation.
       5.7.5.3.3. Order Information Tabs.
          5.7.5.3.3.1. The Order Detail Tab provides an overview of a selected order detail
          and is populated directly from the Purchase Card Register. The order
          reconciliation action and statement amount are entered into this tab during the
          reconciliation process. See Figure 5.19. for available Reconciliation Action
          codes.
          5.7.5.3.3.2. The Statement History Tab reflects the history of reconciliation
          actions against each purchase detail when actions are other than ―Y.‖ The Void
          function is also available in this tab. This function allows cardholders to void
          actions when changes need to be made against a specific call. When a call is
          "voided" and there were previous PCA transactions linked to the call, the system
          will generate new PCA transactions containing dollar amounts that result in a net
          overall PCA value of $0.00.
          5.7.5.3.3.3. The PCA Information tab reflects purchase card adjustment
          transactions that processed to either obligate additional funds or deobligate funds
          in order to finalize the purchase and reconciliation process. PCAs are considered
          pending and are applied to an expense center and SVC/CUST ID after the
          DFAS/Execute icon from the vertical toolbar is selected. Users should generate
          PCAs as a result of unknown shipping costs at the time of order. Correct detail
          price changes using the Price Correction function within Transaction History.

      5.7.5.4. Reconciling PC Orders.
         5.7.5.4.1. Select the account to reconcile by user ID or GPC Alias. Set the Register
         Mode to ―Reconcile‖ to access the active Purchase Card Register. All active order
         detail records are displayed in the Purchase Card Call Register.
         5.7.5.4.2. Select a detail order record to reconcile by entering a check in the
         Reconcile checkbox. Additional order information for the highlighted GPC detail
         appears in the Order Detail tab. The order reconciliation information box becomes
         active allowing updates to the Reconciliation Action and Statement Amount fields.
         5.7.5.4.3. Select the Order Reconciliation Action code based on the status of the
         order. A detailed list of codes is available in figure 5.19.
         5.7.5.4.4. Complete Order Reconciliation. Select one of the following action codes
         to finalize the reconciliation process.
             5.7.5.4.4.1. Select action code ―Y‖ if no discrepancies exist and the order is
             complete. The statement date field in the GPC detail record is updated with the
             statement date (month, yyyy).
             5.7.5.4.4.2. Enter the statement amount.
             5.7.5.4.4.3. If the statement amount equals the order total, the remaining balance
             will change to an order adjustment of $0.00.
             5.7.5.4.4.4. If the statement amount does not match the order total, the PCA
             window will open. PCA transactions were designed to assess unknown shipping
             charges when the order was submitted. Use the price correction function in
             Transaction History for all other price adjustments. The PCA is associated to the
             SVC/CUST ID and expense center if only one is associated to the order. If
             multiple accounts are associated to the order, the system requires the user to link
             the PCA to one or more of the associated expense centers and SVC/CUST IDs. If
             applying adjustments to multiple accounts, the user must also annotate the dollar
             value being applied to each expense center and SVC/CUST ID. GPC adjustments
             can only be applied to an expense center and SVC/CUST ID that was associated
             to the order.
             5.7.5.4.4.5. A positive PCA is generated if the statement total is greater than the
             order total. Funds are deducted from the expense center(s).
             5.7.5.4.4.6. A negative PCA is generated if the statement total is less than the
             order total. Funds are credited to the expense center(s).
             5.7.5.4.4.7. The current statement amount is updated to the statement price and
             all adjustments are entered in the order adjustment field.
             5.7.5.4.4.8. Click ―Save‖ to continue processing or ―Close‖ to exit the
             Reconciliation Register. As explained in paragraph 5.7.5.3.3.3., PCAs are
             considered pending at this point in the reconciliation process. Select the
             ―DFAS/Execute‖ icon from the vertical toolbar to process and apply PCAs to the
             expense center and SVC/CUST ID. The PCA transaction commits, obligates, and
             expenses funds, as well as interfaces with DFAS at this time. GPC holders are
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            141


          encouraged to complete the DFAS Execute procedure in a timely manner. Failure
          to complete will result in a posting of the call/s to the IM Delinquent Purchase
          Card Reconciliation Report, Part 2. PCA transactions obligate from ―current‖
          year funds. Failure to initiate the DFAS process could impact future year funds,
          i.e, order reconciled in September; however, the DFAS button is not pushed until
          November.
          5.7.5.4.4.9. A detail record with an order status of ―Open‖ cannot be completed
          with action code ―Y.‖ An order status of ―Open‖ indicates the item(s) on the
          order have not been received, therefore, cannot be reconciled as complete.
       5.7.5.4.5. Partial Order Reconciliation. Select action code ―P‖ to process a partial
       reconciliation. The statement date field is automatically updated.
          5.7.5.4.5.1. Enter the bank statement amount.
          5.7.5.4.5.2. The GPC details reconciliation code is updated to ―P-Partial‖ and the
          current statement amount is changed to the entered amount. The remaining
          balance in the Order Reconciliation is adjusted to reflect the remaining due-in
          balance.
          5.7.5.4.5.3. The Statement History tab is updated with the partial payment
          information upon saving updates.
          5.7.5.4.5.4. To make changes to a partially reconciled order, the user must first
          open the Statement History tab and void the original partial receipt. Voiding the
          receipt resets the receipt to a reconciliation code of ―N-New‖ and allows for
          necessary adjustments. The void action is recorded in the Statement History tab.
          5.7.5.4.5.5. Cardholders can process multiple partial reconciliations for a single
          detail record. A reconciliation code of ―Y – Complete‖ is applied to the final
          transaction.
          5.7.5.4.5.6. Use the ―Notes‖ icon on the vertical toolbar to document all
          information relevant to the order. Cardholders should document information such
          as date contacted, POC‘s name, memorandum of discussion, follow-up actions,
          etc. Once a note(s) is added, the Notes icon looks like an open notebook.
       5.7.5.4.6. Disputed Order Reconciliation. Use reconciliation code ―D‖ to document a
       disputed order. The statement date field in the GPC purchase detail is updated with
       the statement date (month, yyyy).
          5.7.5.4.6.1. The reconciliation code is changed to ―D – Disputed.‖
          5.7.5.4.6.2. Enter the statement amount. A natural tendency is to enter ―zero‖
          because an item was either not received or it was damaged upon receipt. The
          statement amount cannot be zero because the vendor billed the cardholder‘s
          account. Enter the amount from the billing statement and contact the vendor and
          GPC company to resolve the dispute.
          5.7.5.4.6.3. The price entered will populate the statement amount field. The price
          entered should equal the billing statement and the amount Finance will pay.
          5.7.5.4.6.4. Because the order is coded as Disputed, the system allows for fund
142                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             adjustments upon resolving the dispute.       All actions are documented in the
             Statement History tab.
             5.7.5.4.6.5. Use the Notes icon on the vertical toolbar to document all
             information relevant to the order. Cardholders should document information such
             as date contacted, POC‘s name, memorandum of discussion, follow-up actions,
             etc. Once a note(s) is added, the Notes icon looks like an open notebook.
         5.7.5.4.7. Process Credit. Select reconciliation action code ―C – Credit‖ and enter
         the statement amount to process credits. Credits are posted to the cardholder‘s
         statement as disputes are resolved. When this happens, the appropriate Purchase Card
         Register Detail Record must be updated and completed.
             5.7.5.4.7.1. A PCA transaction is generated and documented in the PCA
             Information tab. As discussed in paragraph 5.7.5.3.3.3., PCAs are considered
             pending at this point in the reconciliation process. Select the ―DFAS/Execute‖
             icon from the vertical toolbar to process and apply PCAs to the expense center
             and SVC/CUST ID. The PCA transaction commits, obligates, and expenses
             funds, as well as interfaces with DFAS at this time.
             5.7.5.4.7.2. Select ―Save‖ to finalize the reconciliation. The process is complete
             when the funds data is passed to DFAS.
      5.7.5.5. DFAS Icon. Users must select the DFAS icon from the vertical toolbar once the
      monthly reconciliation is verified, correct, and complete. By clicking the DFAS icon, all
      pending financial transactions are processed and detail records are interfaced with
      Finance.
         5.7.5.5.1. Once selected, DMLSS will display the DFAS submissions window for the
         statement month. The user ID, card number, and reconciliation totals are displayed.
         The message ―This action is not reversible! Do you wish to continue?‖ appears.
         Choose one of the following actions:
         5.7.5.5.2. Select ―Yes‖ to submit details to DFAS.
         5.7.5.5.3. Select ―Cancel‖ to verify reconciliation totals.
      5.7.5.6. Trans History Icon/Price Correction Tool. The PCA transaction was designed to
      assess unknown shipping charges when the order was submitted. Use the price correction
      tool in Transaction History to correct receipt prices. The PCA transaction commits,
      obligates, and expenses current FY (CFY) customer and LOG funds only. Fund
      obligations/deobligations are linked to the date the PCA is processed, not the date of the
      original order.
      5.7.5.7. Find Calls Icon. The Find Calls function provides a method to search for
      specific detail records by Order or GPC Reconciliation criteria. This function can be
      helpful to cardholders who generate a large number of GPC purchases.
      5.7.5.8. Edit Alias Icon. The Edit Alias function provides a method to document a
      vendor‘s ―Alias.‖ In some instances, the vendor name that appears on the GPC statement
      is not the same as the Supplier‘s Name in the SOS record.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  143


         5.7.5.8.1. For example, the cardholder purchases materiel from ―Tazman Ind,‖ but
         ―Tazman Ind‖ does not appear on the monthly GPC statement. However, a company
         named ―Aussi Subsidiaries‖ is charging the same dollar amount. After researching,
         the cardholder finds that ―Aussi Subsidiaries‖ handles billing for ―Tazman Ind.‖ In
         this instance, the cardholder should use the Edit Alias icon to document the alias
         name, ―Aussi Subsidiaries.‖
         5.7.5.8.2. All cardholders have visibility of alias names once they are saved.
     5.7.5.9. Closed GPC records. Completed detail records are restratified to ―Closed‖
     during the EOD process. To access these records, search the cardholder‘s Purchase Card
     Register using Register Mode ―Read Only.‖
  5.7.6. Purchase Card Register Report.
     5.7.6.1. The Purchase Card Register Report provides a method for cardholders and/or
     AOs to retrieve GPC acquisition data based on selected search criteria. Because this data
     is retrievable at any time, cardholders are not required to maintain a manual Purchase
     Card Register. If a local requirement dictates a hardcopy of the register must be
     maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 31.00, then each cardholder can print a monthly
     report for permanent filing.
     5.7.6.2. The date range can be specified for either order date or statement date. The date
     range will return all order detail records meeting the date range criteria. A message
     indicating there was no data for retrieval will be received if there were no orders for the
     date range.
     5.7.6.3. The report can be sorted in either purchase card call or contract call sequence.
     The GPC call number is assigned sequentially for each cardholder. The contract call
     number is sequentially assigned for each SOS.
     5.7.6.4. The report calculates a total extended price for all Order Detail Records
     retrieved.
  5.7.7. Delinquent Purchase Card Reconciliation Report.
     5.7.7.1. The Delinquent Purchase Card Reconciliation Report is used to identify closed
     orders that are not reconciled (receipt has processed) and to identify reconciled orders
     that have not been interfaced with Finance (DFAS button not selected). Cardholders and
     AOs should use this report to verify GPC purchases are being reconciled in a timely
     manner and to minimize aged due-ins.
     5.7.7.2. This report is separated into two parts:
         5.7.7.2.1. Part I lists closed orders that have not been reconciled by the cardholder for
         a specified period of time. The search criteria is defaulted to 60 days. Generally
         speaking, if the materiel has been received, the cardholder should reconcile the order
         within 30 days.
         5.7.7.2.2. Part II lists reconciled orders that have not been interfaced with Finance.
         Items listed in part II have been reconciled, but the DFAS icon has not been selected.
         As discussed in paragraph 5.7.5.5., the reconciliation process is not complete until the
         DFAS icon is selected.
 144                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   5.7.8. Purchase Card Transfer.
       5.7.8.1. The Purchase Card Transfer process allows a user, preferable an AO, to transfer
       an order from one cardholder to another. This action will remove the detailed record
       from the ―old‖ cardholder‘s Purchase Card Register and apply it to the ―new‖
       cardholder‘s Purchase Card Register.
       5.7.8.2. From the Navigate menu, select ―Purchase Card,‖ then ―Purchase Card
       Transfer.‖ Enter required information and click ―Transfer‖ located on the vertical
       toolbar. DMLSS locks both Purchase Card Registers until the transfer is complete.
       5.7.8.3. The following rules must be met before the transfer will occur:
          5.7.8.3.1. A transfer will not process if the order has been reconciled (Reconciliation
          Action Code equal to Y or C.).
          5.7.8.3.2. Both purchase cards must be assigned the same fund type.
          5.7.8.3.3. Both purchase cards must be assigned the same ownership code.
          5.7.8.3.4. The ―To‖ purchase card must be privileged to process orders for that
          customer.
          5.7.8.3.5. The transfer will not process if the ―To‖ purchase card has already been
          reconciled for the date reconciled on the Order Detail Record.
          5.7.8.3.6. Transfers will not occur if the order has been submitted to Finance but
          DFAS has not processed the transaction.
          5.7.8.3.7. Transfers will not process if the order amount exceeds the ―To‖ GPC limit.
   5.7.9. AO Purchase Card Transfer.
       5.7.9.1. The AO Purchase Card Transfer function allows privileged users a quick and
       easy method of reassigning cardholders from one AO to another. From the Navigate
       menu, select ―Purchase Card,‖ then ―AO Purchase Card‖ to access this option. Transfers
       will take affect once the EOD process is complete. The AO Purchase Card Transfer
       window is separated into two windows.
          5.7.9.1.1. The left window displays a list of AOs and the cardholders currently
          assigned to each AO. Also listed are cardholders that are not assigned to an AO.
          5.7.9.1.2. The right window lists the AO‘s user ID, name, and status. Currently
          assigned cardholders are also listed in this window.
       5.7.9.2. Highlight the ―From‖ AO so the assigned cardholders appear in the right
       window.
       5.7.9.3. Simply ―drag and drop‖ the cardholder from the ―old‖ AO in the right window to
       the ―new‖ AO‘s user ID in the left window. Click ―Save‖ when finished.
5.8. Physical Inventory.
   5.8.1. Physical Inventory Process Overview. The Physical Inventory module enables users
   to freeze assets for inventory, perform inventories, adjust balances, document inventories,
   review inventory documents, and cancel inventories. Select ―Physical Inventories‖ from the
   Navigate menu to access the Physical Inventories module. A typical inventory process
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               145


   begins with selecting a set of items and locking them for inventory. The system produces
   count lists that are assigned to teams for conducting inventory counts. After all required
   counts are completed, potential overages and shortages are documented for research. The
   inventory can be finalized after research has been completed. Some tasks related to physical
   inventories are:
      5.8.1.1. Cancel Inventory.
      5.8.1.2. Search Inventories for Specific Item.
      5.8.1.3. View Count List Details.
      5.8.1.4. View Statistics.
      5.8.1.5. View Other Item Locations.
      5.8.1.6. Add Item to Inventory.
      5.8.1.7. Add Post-Inventory Action.
      5.8.1.8. View Transaction History.
      5.8.1.9. Print Inventory Research Report.
   5.8.2. Select Inventory Segment.
      5.8.2.1. Access the Select Inventory Segment window (Figure 5.20.) to select items to
      lock for inventory. Locked items are assigned to inventory segments in item ID
      sequence. The size of each segment depends on the number of items locked for
      inventory. If the number of items locked is less than 1000, each segment is 50 items. If
      the number of items locked is greater than 1000, each segment is 100 items. Items may
      be selected by:

             5.8.2.1.2.2. Assemblage Instance.
      5.8.2.2. The Select Inventory Segment window contains the following tabs. These tabs
      look slightly different, depending on the scope of your search (IM or AM), but the basic
      functionality is the same.
         5.8.2.2.1. Search Tab – Identifies the inventory scope.
         5.8.2.2.2. Search Results Tab – View the selected records. To lock the selected
         records for physical inventory, click ―Process Inv‖ on the vertical toolbar. On the
         Process Successful message prompt, note the inventory control number (ICN) and
         click ―OK.‖
  5.8.3. Control Number Status.
      5.8.3.1. The Control Number Status window displays the current processing status of all
      inventories that are in progress and provides the capability to cancel an inventory. The
      processing status of a given inventory may be any of the following:
         5.8.3.1.1. Counting – All counts are not complete.
         5.8.3.1.2. Research – All counts completed, required research not completed.
         5.8.3.1.3. Finalization – All required actions completed, ready to finalize.
      5.8.3.2. While counting is in progress, the Count List Detail window is available by
      double clicking an inventory control number or via the Detail icon on the vertical toolbar.
      The Count List Detail window displays each count list and its current status. Physical
      Inventory tasks available from the Control Number Status window are:
         5.8.3.2.1. Cancel Inventory.
         5.8.3.2.2. Search Inventories for Specific Item (by Item ID or Item Desc).
         5.8.3.2.3. View Count List Details.
  5.8.4. Generate Count Lists. DMLSS assigns an ICN upon initiating a physical inventory.
  Use the Generate Count Lists and Assign Teams Criteria (Figure 5.21.) and Generate Count
  Lists and Assign Teams to IM Inventory Control Number (Figure 5.22.) screens to produce
  inventory count lists, assign those lists to count teams, and view the distribution of items by
  team or count list. DMLSS automatically creates one Count list and one Assigned team. You
  can add count teams and the number of lists required for inventory segment. To add count
  list(s) click ―Add Count List‖ and click ―Add Team‖ to add team(s). Up to 26 count teams
  (Team A through Z) are available for an inventory. Assign a count list number and team to
  each line item in the list. This can be done line item by line item or you can select multiple
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            147


   rows. Highlight rows and select count list from dropdown. Click ―Apply‖ and when all rows
   are assigned, click ―Save.‖ DMLSS does not track user IDs or names to a particular count
   team. If required, document this information on a letter and file with other completed
   inventory documentation. The View Statistics task is available from this window.

      5.8.4.1. On the Navigate menu select ―Physical Inventory,‖ select ―Reports‖ and then
      ―Inventory Count List‖ from the Reports. Select the ICN from the dropdown menu if
      more than one control number. Select ―Count List‖ to print to select either individual
      lists or all lists at once.
      5.8.4.2. Complete the physical inventory. When all inventory is complete, you may
      enter inventory counts.
   5.8.5. Enter Counts.
      5.8.5.1. The Criteria for Entering Counts window and the Enter Counts Physical
      Inventory (Figure 5.23) window allow users to select an assigned ICN and enter
 148                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       inventory counts, add items to the current inventory, and view other item locations. The
       typical process consists of selecting a Count List number and retrieving those items for
       count entry. The search criteria is slightly different for AM and IM inventories, but the
       basic functionality is the same for both. Items may be retrieved based on any
       combination of available elements. Speed buttons at the bottom of the Enter Counts
       window are provided to either remove all entered counts or perpetuate the last count
       forward. Counts may be entered one at a time or the speed buttons can be used to
       perpetuate the last counts forward. If using the speed buttons, rows can be updated by
       exception. The count entry functions are slightly different for AM and IM inventories,
       but the basic functionality is the same for both. For IM scope, enter the 1 st, 2nd , or 3rd
       item counts. For the AM Scope, enter the 1 st, 2nd , or 3rd item counts and update QA data.
       Click ―Save‖ on the vertical toolbar.

Figure 5.23. Enter Counts for Physical Inventory Window.




       5.8.5.2. How DMLSS processes inventory counts.
          5.8.5.2.1. Counts are processed once all item locations are counted. Alternate
          location entries, not the primary, are identified with an asterisks (*) after the quantity.
          5.8.5.2.2. Once all location quantities are entered into DMLSS, the sum of all counts
          is compared to the DMLSS inventory balance.
          5.8.5.2.3. The item is unlocked and removed from inventory if they agree.
          5.8.5.2.4. If the counts disagree with the inventory balance and the value of the
          potential inventory adjustment is greater than the count criteria value, the system
          forces another count. Up to three counts are required. The count criteria value is
          accessible in SS, TMU, and IM Physical Inventory Adjustments. Items meeting these
          criteria are visible in the Research Discrepancies window.
          5.8.5.2.5. No further counts are required if the counts disagree with the inventory
          balance and the value of the potential inventory adjustment is below the count criteria
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                149


          value. If the count criteria value is not met, DMLSS generates a pending gain or loss
          transaction. This condition could occur on the 1 st, 2nd , or 3rd count.
      5.8.5.3. Tasks available from the Enter Counts window include:
          5.8.5.3.1. View Other Item Locations.
          5.8.5.3.2. Add Item to Inventory.
   5.8.6. Research Discrepancies.
      5.8.6.1. Use the Research Discrepancies window to view items requiring research or to
      enter a final inventory count. Final counts are required when none of the previous counts
      agree with the inventory balance. Research is required when the potential adjustment
      amount is greater than the count criteria value. First, select the ICN or any combination
      of elements from the dropdown list in the Criteria for Entering Research window. From
      the list you can select one, some, or all items to process. Note: Use ―CTRL‖ or ―Shift‖ to
      select multiple records for processing. Click ―Process‖ on the vertical toolbar. The
      Research Inventory Gains and Losses for AM Inventory screen displays (Figure 5.24).

Figure 5.24. Research Inventory Gains and Losses for IM Inventory Window.




      5.8.6.2. Potential inventory gains and losses are visible in the Research Inventory Gains
      and Losses window. Users can preview potential gains and losses, enter final counts, add
      an adjustment reason, document required post-inventory actions, review transaction
      history, and print an Inventory Research Report. If the final count entered agrees with
      the recorded balance, the item is unlocked and removed from inventory. An adjustment
      reason is required for all items with CII Code of J, R, or Q, and when the potential
      inventory adjustment value is greater than the count criteria value. The adjustment
      reason will print on the Inventory Adjustment Voucher. A Post-Inventory Action feature
      is available to document required post inventory actions.
          5.8.6.2.1. The following are examples of inventory conditions that require research:
             5.8.6.2.1.1. The inventory balance is 12 and previous count reflects 24 are on the
             shelf. Researchers discover a receipt for 12 has not been processed. Enter a final
150                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             count of 12 and process the receipt after the inventory is closed.
             5.8.6.2.1.2. The inventory balance is 12 and previous count reflect 27 are on the
             shelf. Researchers discover an out-shipment loss for 12 was processed in the
             system, but the materiel was not removed from the storage location and out-
             shipped. In this case, enter a final count of 15 and a Post-Inventory Action as a
             reminder to pull 12 from the storage location and ship them. DMLSS will
             generate a potential inventory adjustment gain for remaining three.
      5.8.6.3. Inventory tasks available from the Research Discrepancy window are:
         5.8.6.3.1. Add Post-Inventory Action.
         5.8.6.3.2. Review Transaction History.
         5.8.6.3.3. Print Inventory Research Report.
  5.8.7. Finalize Inventory. Use the Finalize Inventory window to preview the Inventory
  Accuracy Analysis Report, finalize an inventory, and review completed inventory
  documents. DMLSS processes pending inventory adjustment gains and losses. An inventory
  cannot be finalized until:
      5.8.7.1. All items are counted and counts entered into DMLSS.
      5.8.7.2. All required research is completed.
      5.8.7.3. On the Finalize Inventories; Post Transactions screen users can preview before
      finalizing by clicking the Preview icon on the vertical toolbar. The IM-Preview Inventory
      Accuracy Analysis screen appears.
      5.8.7.4. On the Finalize Inventories; Post Transactions screen click ―Finalize‖ on the
      vertical toolbar. On the Inventory Management prompt message click ―Yes/No.‖ On the
      Inventory Management Final Counts message prompt, click Yes/No. The inventory will
      be removed from the IM- Finalize Inventories; Post Transactions screen. Click ―Close‖
      on the vertical toolbar.
  5.8.8. Reports. The following Physical Inventory Reports are available either during or after
  the inventory is finalized. The inventory manager is advised to print these reports and file
  them in a binder as part of the complete Physical Inventory Report. DMLSS stores inventory
  reports for three years; however, the dates posted on the reports are updated to the date the
  report is requested and printed. Maintain these reports IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 13.00.
      5.8.8.1. Inventory Accuracy Analysis - Identifies the gain/loss amount and the accuracy
      of each inventory segment.

AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 151


       5.8.8.7. Post-Inventory Actions Report - Reflects required post-inventory actions.
       5.8.8.8. Potential Inventory Discrepancy Report - Identifies the gain/loss transactions
       that would result based on the current count information. This report is reviewable prior
       to finalizing an inventory.
       5.8.8.9. Preview Inventory Accuracy Analysis - Identifies the gain/loss amount and the
       accuracy of each inventory segment that would result if an inventory were finalized with
       current counts.
5.9. Destructions.
   5.9.1. Use the IM Destructions module to process all materiel destructions. Select
   ―Destructions‖ from the Navigate menu to access this module. The appropriate Destruction
   Method(s) must be associated to the MTF Catalog record prior to processing destructions.
   5.9.2. Once the Destructions window is open, complete all required fields at a minimum. A
   red dot identifies required fields. Save data upon completion. DMLSS will prompt users to
   print the destruction document(s) when closing the Destruction window. Click ―Yes‖ to print
   all destruction documents. If ―No‖ is selected, users can access the IM Reports module to
   reprint the documents. Destruction documents are maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R
   13.00.
   5.9.3. Materiel may be destroyed in-house or as part of a contracted service. Both in-house
   and contracted destructions require the same level of visibility. If a contractor performs the
   destructions, signed documents transferring materiel to the vendor and destruction
   certification after destruction occurs are still required. All destruction procedures must
   comply with national, state, and local environmental protections laws. Consult the
   Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) section to ensure these laws are adhered to, regardless
   of who and where the destructions are performed.
5.10. Commercial Returns.
   5.10.1. Process Overview.
       5.10.1.1. The DMLSS Commercial Returns module is specifically designed to manage
       the Reverse Distribution process through a third party vendor (i.e. E.Z. Returns, R.X.
       Returns, etc.). Do not use the Commercial Returns module for direct vendor returns.
       From the Navigate menu, select ―Commercial Returns‖ to access this module.
       5.10.1.2. Use the Return Item(s) window to initiate materiel returns. The Manage Return
       Item(s) window is utilized to assign call numbers upon pick-up, update and track item
       return status, as well as pending credit and check value. The following Return Status
       codes and descriptions are used to track materiel in the Commercial Returns module.
          5.10.1.2.1. R – Ready for Pick-Up. Computer assigned from Return Item(s) when
          item is selected for return. When a pickup date is arranged with the 3 rd party vendor,
          the DMLSS user highlights all applicable rows for the items. The user then clicks
          ―Pickup‖ on the vertical toolbar, assigns a call number, associates all records, and
          clicks ―Process.‖ The user has the option to print a Commercial Return Report.
          Upon completion of this task, the status code is adjusted to reflect ―P – Disposition
          Pending.‖

         5.10.1.2.2. P – Disposition Pending. Computer assigned once an item is returned for
         credit determination.
         5.10.1.2.3. X – Check Pending. User assigned when notification is received that a
         check will be issued for the returned goods.
         5.10.1.2.4. Y – Credit Pending. User assigned once notification is received that
         credit will be issued for the returned goods.
         5.10.1.2.5. D – Complete Destroyed. User assigned if status is received from the
         vendor that the item was destroyed.
         5.10.1.2.6. C – Complete Check. User assigned upon check receipt.
         5.10.1.2.7. T – Complete Credit. User assigned upon receipt of credit. Also, use this
         status code to record replacement stock that is issued from a non-PV source.
         5.10.1.2.8. V – Complete PV Credit. User assigned once credit is posted to the PV
         credit account and verified.
  5.10.2. Return Item(s). Selecting item(s) for reverse distribution is the first step in the
  Commercial Returns process. From the Return Item(s) window use the ―>‖ button to return
  individual items or the ―>>‖ button to return multiple items. A nonrefundable CRL is
  generated for all items tagged for return and they are assigned Return Status code ―R-Ready
  for Pick-Up.‖ Once an item is selected, use the Manage Return Item(s) module to track the
  status and complete the process.
  5.10.3. Managed Return Item(s).
      5.10.3.1. The next step in the process is to identify the item(s) that are ready for pick-up
      and assign a call number. In the Manage Return Item(s) window, search for detail
      records by document number, item ID, return status code, or call number. Click ―ALL‖
      radio button to view all items. DMLSS limits the search results window to 500 records
      so use the search criteria options to narrow the search when necessary.
      5.10.3.2. The Search Results window displays all records that match the selected criteria.
      Detailed management data is displayed in the upper part of the window when a record is
      selected or highlighted.
      5.10.3.3. Select all items being returned and click the ―Pickup‖ button on the vertical
      toolbar (Refer to paragraph 5.10.3.5.1.). From the Manage Return Items—Pick-Up
      window, enter the call number assigned to the return and associate all records to the call
      number by clicking the ―>‖ button for a single item or the ―>>‖ button for all items.
      Click ―Save‖ after all items are associated. The Return Status code is updated to P-
      Disposition Pending and the Commercial Return Report is printed.
      5.10.3.4. The Commercial Return Report lists all items returned under the assigned call
      number and provides total dollar value of the call. Detailed management data for each
      line item is also included. For WRM items, the MFG, MFG date, lot number, expiration
      date, and catalog number are included.
      5.10.3.5. The vertical toolbar offers multiple options once the Return Status code is
      updated to P-Disposition Pending. These options allow users to manage the status of
      each return item and close a return record upon completion.

       5.10.3.5.1. Pick-up Icon.
          5.10.3.5.1.1. The Pick-Up Icon is only visible for items assigned a Return Status
          code of R-Ready for Pick-Up and P-Disposition Pending. As discussed in
          paragraph 5.10.3.3, select items ready for pick-up.
          5.10.3.5.1.2. Click ―Pick-Up‖ and assign a call number for selected records. The
          system allows users to change a previously assigned call number, if necessary.
          5.10.3.5.1.3. A Commercial Return Report is generated after the call number is
          assigned. This report contains a detailed list of records assigned to the call
          number. One call number is assigned per ―pick-up.‖
          5.10.3.5.1.4. The system automatically updates the Return Status code to P-
          Disposition Pending.
       5.10.3.5.2. Credit Icon.
          5.10.3.5.2.1. Use the Credit icon to either enter credit pending or credit complete
          estimates. Multiple records can be updated simultaneously if the assigned call
          number and MFG‘s name match. Click the ―Credit‖ icon to open the Credit
          Complete Update window. Select either ―Credit Pending‖ or ―Complete Credit‖
          for the call number or items selected.
          5.10.3.5.2.2. Update the Return Status code to Y-Credit Pending when materiel
          has been returned to the third party vendor for credit. Assign this status code after
          being notified of pending credit but credit has not been received. If known, a
          credit amount and reason can also be loaded.
          5.10.3.5.2.3. Update the Return Status code to T-Complete Credit when credit is
          received from the third party returns vendor. All data fields become mandatory
          entries when assigning this status code. Enter the credit amount received and
          reason, then click ―Save‖ to process updates. The Return Status is updated to
          Complete Credit and the record can no longer be modified.
       5.10.3.5.3. Check Icon.
          5.10.3.5.3.1. Use the ―Check‖ icon to either enter check pending or check
          complete estimates.      Individual or multiple records can be updated
          simultaneously. Click ―Check‖ to open the Check Complete Update window.
          Select either ―Check Pending‖ or ―Complete Check‖ for the call number or items
          selected.
          5.10.3.5.3.2. Update the Return Status code to X-Check Pending when materiel
          has been returned to the third party vendor and a check is expected in return.
          Assign this status code after being notified that a pending check is forthcoming.
          If known, a check amount and reason can also be loaded.
          5.10.3.5.3.3. Update the Return Status code to C-Complete Check when the
          check is received from the third party returns vendor. All data fields become
          mandatory entries when this status code is assigned. Enter the check value and
          reason, then click ―Save‖ to process updates. The Return Status code is updated
          to Complete Check and the record can no longer be modified.

             5.10.3.5.3.4. During the Save process, DMLSS reverses the CRL transaction and
             processes a TIL transaction type with a transaction reason of RVL. The system
             generates a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Forward the voucher and
             check to your supporting OPLOC Finance manager for processing, making sure it
             is applied to the AFWCF/MDD. The 6B accounting classification is printed on
             the form. Maintain a copy of the voucher and check for the permanent file after
             quality control. Request Finance provide a screen print of the deposit to assure
             posting to the AFWCF/MDD and file with the DD Form 1131.
         5.10.3.5.4. PV Credit Icon.
             5.10.3.5.4.1. Use the PV Credit icon when items are returned directly to the PV
             for credit. This option is not used to manage materiel returned to a third party
             returns vendor. The system assigns Return Status code P-Disposition Pending to
             these records. Use the ―PV Credit‖ icon to update status upon receipt of credit
             notification.
             5.10.3.5.4.2. In the Manage Return Item(s) window, select the items that have
             been credited and click the ―PV Credit‖ icon. Multiple records cannot be updated
             using this function. Enter the credit amount, reason, SOS, and credit account
             number (if blank) for each record. If the credit account number is present in the
             SOS record, the credit account number will automatically populate.
             5.10.3.5.4.3. Save changes to process the updates. DMLSS updates the Return
             Status code to V-Complete PV Credit and the record can no longer be modified.
         5.10.3.5.5. Destroyed Icon.
             5.10.3.5.5.1. Use the ―Destroy‖ icon to process destructions for items not
             accepted for credit or return. Process the destructions after receipt of a disposal
             manifest or other official notification.
             5.10.3.5.5.2. In the Manage Return Item(s) window, select ―Item Detail Records
             From a Call‖ from the dropdown menu and click ―Destroyed.‖ Multiple items
             can be selected and updated simultaneously. Enter a destruction reason and click
             ―Save‖ to process destructions. DMLSS updates the Return Status code to D-
             Complete Destroy and the record(s) are no longer editable.
         5.10.3.5.6. Cost Call Icon. Use the ―Cost Call‖ icon to update and track the total
         value of credits and checks received per call. Manually add the existing call amount
         to new (additional) credit or check amounts and then use ―Cost Call‖ to update the
         new call total. For example, the current value is $20.00 and a credit voucher is
         received for $25.00. Use the ―Cost Call‖ icon to update the total credit value to
         $45.00.
  5.10.4. Replacement Stock.
      5.10.4.1. In some instances, MFGs will ship replacement stock instead of issuing credit.
      When this happens, process a non-reimbursable receipt and (if warranted) a non-
      refundable issue to the appropriate customer. If the returned stock did not come from the
      customer, do not issue the replacement stock as non-reimbursable.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                155


     5.10.4.2. Create a due-in detail record using ―IM Offline Orders‖ when notification is
     received that replacement stock is being shipped and quantities are known. Check ―Non-
     Submit‖ so an additional order is not submitted to the SOS. Also, assign Refund Code
     ―N‖ because there is no charge for the replacement materiel. Link the order to the
     appropriate customer if warranted (see paragraph 5.10.4.1). Select local DODAAC from
     the customer drop down menu if materiel is for LOG inventory. Upon receiving, process
     the receipt using the normal receipt process.
     5.10.4.3. Process a RND when replacement materiel is received without prior
     knowledge. The packing list or invoice should indicate the shipment is ―Replacement
     Materiel.‖ Process the receipt using refund code ―N‖ and link to the appropriate
     customer if warranted. Select local DODAAC from the customer drop down menu if
     materiel is for LOG inventory.
  5.10.5. Manage PV Credits.
     5.10.5.1. Use the Manage PV Credits function to monitor available credit account
     balances. Ensure these balances are correct so logistics personnel and customers can
     effectively use available credits. Funds must be available in a credit account prior to
     processing a PV Credit Order.
     5.10.5.2. The Manage PV Credits window lists the SOS, total credit amount, add credit,
     loss credit, reason, and credit account number. Enter a SOS or select one from the
     dropdown menu to view available credit. The total credit amount field will populate with
     available credit funds.
     5.10.5.3. Normally, each site will have four credit accounts but could have up to six if an
     account is created for ―secondary‖ prime vendors. Both PVP and PVM SOS‘s will have
     one for IM and one for AM. PV Credit Account managers should compare the vendor‘s
     monthly PV Credit Report to the DMLSS PV Credit Account available balance for each
     account. If a difference exists, use the Manage PV Credits function to modify the
     DMLSS available balance to synchronize the two balances. Note: Verify the accuracy
     of the PV Credit Report prior to updating DMLSS. Use the ―Add Credit‖ and ―Loss
     Credit‖ icons to increase or decrease balances.
        5.10.5.3.1. Use the ―Add Credit‖ icon to increase the DMLSS credit account
        available balance. Enter the difference between the PV Credit Report and the
        DMLSS available balance into the Add Credit field. Select ―Save‖ to process and
        increase the available balance.
        5.10.5.3.2. Use the ―Loss Credit‖ icon to decrease the DMLSS credit account
        available balance. Enter the difference between the PV Credit Report and the
        DMLSS available balance into the Loss Credit field. Select ―Save‖ to process and
        decrease the available balance.
     5.10.5.4. PV Credit account fund balances are updated automatically when orders are
     placed within the ―Offline/Submit‖ module and the PV Credit indicator is checked.
     Balances can also be updated by completing item returns using Manage Return Item(s).
        5.10.5.4.1. DMLSS automatically updates the PV credit account available balance
        when Return Status T-Complete PV Credit is assigned to a detail record (see
 156                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          paragraph 5.10.3.5.2.3.). When the PV Credit update action is saved, DMLSS
          appends the credit account‘s available balance by the credit amount.
          5.10.5.4.2. As discussed in paragraph 5.10.5.2, credit account managers can
          manually update an account‘s available balance in DMLSS. Use the Manage PV
          Credit function to update the available balances manually.
       5.10.5.5. Use the IM Offline Orders function to process PV Credit Account orders.
       Placing a check in the PV Credit checkbox in the Main tab sets the refund code for the
       order to ―N‖ and deducts funds from the account‘s available balance. Sufficient funds
       must be present in the credit account for the order to process. Link the order to the
       appropriate customer if warranted. If the materiel is for LOG inventory, select the Host
       DODAAC for the DMLSS account from the customer dropdown menu.
       5.10.5.6. At the present time PV sources cannot accept electronic orders linked to the PV
       Credit Account; therefore, check ―Non-Submit‖ prior to processing orders and manually
       submit the order to the vendor. After the order is processed in DMLSS, the DD Form
       1155 can be printed and faxed to the vendor. DMLSS will create a ―pseudo‖ EDI 850
       requisition file which is transmitted to the DLA Troop Support. The pseudo 850 informs
       DLA Troop Support that a credit order has been established between the DMLSS site and
       the PV.
   5.10.6. Reprint Cash Collection Voucher. This function allows users to reprint previously
   processed DD Form 1131s. Utilize Reprint function if the original is misplaced or multiple
   copies are required.
5.11. Item Gain/Loss.
   5.11.1. Gains.
       5.11.1.1. To process an item gain click ―Gain/Loss‖ on the horizontal toolbar or select
       ―Item Gain/Loss‖ from the Navigate menu. Once the Item Gains/Losses window (Figure
       5.25.) is open, check transaction type of Gain, and enter the quantity, external document
       number if applicable, and other required information as necessary. Click ―Save‖ to
       process the gain transaction.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               157


Figure 5.25. Item Gains/Losses Window.




      5.11.1.2. A MTF Catalog record must exist before the gain transaction is processed. Use
      the Search button to locate the item ID or type into the Item ID field. The Jump To radio
      button can be used to access the catalog record. Before creating a new MTF Catalog
      record, search the database for an existing one. Keep in mind a catalog record may exist
      for that item, but may be assigned a different item ID.
      5.11.1.3. Assign the appropriate location code prior to processing. If a location code of
      ―Default‖ appears in the location field, use the dropdown menu to update. If the
      appropriate location code does not appear in the dropdown menu, use the ―Jump To‖ icon
      to access the MTF Catalog Record. Add the location code and save changes.
      5.11.1.4. Gains Transaction Codes, Reason Types, and Uses.
         5.11.1.4.1. Individual/Component Gain. DMLSS generates the ―MSG‖ transaction
         with reason type ―IIG.‖ Use the IIG transaction reason type to gain individual or
         component items when breaking down an end item or kit into individual items.
         Normally, the IIG transactions are processed in combination with the End/Kit Item
         Loss (EIL) transaction. For example, you want to disassemble a kit that contains 5
         items. First, process an EIL to lose the end item or kit from record. Then gain the 5
         individual items from the end item or kit by processing 5 separate IIGs. The total
         dollar value of the individual/component gains should normally equal the unit price of
         the end/kit item loss. As a rule, we rarely break down kits, so this is a seldom used
         transaction. The MSG/IIG transaction updates line ―8I‖ of the Medical Materiel
         Management Report (MMMR) produced by Finance, and line ―8H‖ of the
         BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects.
         5.11.1.4.2. Inshipment Gain. DMLSS generates the ―SHG‖ transaction with reason
         type ―SFG.‖ Use the SFG transaction reason type to record the receipt of an item
         shipped from another MDD account (FM****) and transfers of WRM assets between
         ORG IDs. In addition to the gain, the inshipment decreases the division in-transit
         account in finance. You should enter the shipper‘s document number into the gain
158                                                 AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      transaction for audit trail purposes. The SHG/SFG transaction updates line ―8A‖ of
      the MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―8A‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF
      (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects.
      5.11.1.4.3. Inventory Adjustment Gain. DMLSS generates the ―IAG‖ transaction
      with no corresponding reason type. Use the IAG transaction reason type to increase
      an on-hand balance in DMLSS when the actual on-hand quantity is more than the
      quantity reflected in the accountable record. Before using the IAG, ensure the
      overage isn't due to erroneous postings or failure to process another transaction. This
      transaction is not reversable. To correct an erroneous IAG, an IAL transaction must
      be processed. The IAG transaction updates line ―6A‖ of the MMMR produced by
      Finance, and line ―6A‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business
      Objects.
      5.11.1.4.4. End/Kit Item Gain. DMLSS generates the ―MSG‖ transaction with
      reason type ―EIG.‖ Use the EIG transaction reason type to build or assemble an end
      item or kit from individual components. Normally, the EIG is processed in
      combination with the Individual/Component Loss (IIL) transaction. For example,
      you want to build or assemble an end item or kit that will consist of 5 individual
      items. First, process the 5 separate IILs to record the loss of the 5 individual items
      that will be part of the end item or kit. Then, process an EIG to gain the end item or
      kit. The total dollar value of the end/kit item loss should normally equal the unit
      price of the individual/component gains. As a rule, we rarely build kits, so this is a
      seldom used transaction. The MSG/EIG transaction updates line ―8I‖ of the MMMR
      produced by Finance, and line ―8H‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report
      within Business Objects.
      5.11.1.4.5. Donated Item Gain. DMLSS generates the ―SHG‖ transaction with
      reason type ―DPG.‖ Use the DPG transaction reason type to gain ARC 1 items that
      are donated to the medical facility. For equipment items, use the DPG transaction in
      the Equipment Management (EM) module. Donations require approval actions and
      rarely occur; thus, this is a seldom used transaction. The SHG/DPG transaction
      updates line ―8C‖ of the MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―8C‖ of the
      BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects.
      5.11.1.4.6. Receipt from DRMO. DMLSS generates the ―SHG‖ transaction with
      reason type ―FZG.‖ Use the FZG transaction reason type to gain materiel withdrawn
      from DRMO. The SHG/FZG transaction updates line ―8E‖ of the MMMR produced
      by Finance, and line ―8D‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within
      Business Objects.
      5.11.1.4.7. Capitalization of SF Asset. DMLSS generates the ―MSG‖ transaction
      with reason type ―MDG.‖ Use the MDG transaction reason type to gain an item
      shipped in from other than a FM**** account. If coming from other than a FM
      account, the item was probably purchased with other than MDD (6B) funds, thus we
      capitalize it because the MDD is taking the management responsibility of the item
      from another appropriation. The MSG/MDG transaction updates line ―8H‖ of the
      MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―8G‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat)
      report within Business Objects.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   159


  5.11.2. Losses.
     5.11.2.1. To process an item loss click ―Gain/Loss‖ on the horizontal toolbar or select
     ―Item Gain/Loss‖ from the Navigate menu. Check transaction type of Loss, enter the
     quantity, external document number if applicable, and other information as required.
     Select ―Save‖ to process the loss transaction.
     5.11.2.2. Assign the appropriate location code prior to processing. If a location code of
     ―Default‖ appears in the location field, use the dropdown menu to update. If the
     appropriate location code does not appear in the dropdown menu, use the ―Jump To‖ icon
     to access the MTF Catalog record. Add the location code and save changes. The
     location code will appear on the item loss document and is valuable to warehouse
     personnel who will remove the item from inventory.
     5.11.2.3. Loss Transactions, Reason Types, and Uses.
         5.11.2.3.1. Individual/Component Loss. DMLSS generates the ―MSL‖ transaction
         with reason type ―IIL.‖ Use the IIL transaction reason type to lose an individual or
         component items that will be assembled into an end item or kit. This transaction is
         also used to drop WRM repair parts purchased with WRM funds to repair WRM
         equipment. Normally, the IIL transaction is processed in combination with the
         End/Kit Item Gain (EIG) transaction. For example, you want to assemble a kit that
         will contain 5 items. First, process the IILs on each of the 5 items that will be part of
         the end item or kit. Then, process an EIG to pick up the complete end item or kit.
         The total dollar value of the individual/component losses should normally equal the
         unit price of the end/kit item gain. This transaction is seldom used. The MSL/IIL
         transaction updates line ―9J‖ of the MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―9J‖ of
         the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects.
         5.11.2.3.2. Outshipment Loss. DMLSS generates the ―SHL‖ transaction with reason
         type ―SFL.‖ Use the SFL transaction reason type to outshipment an item to another
         MDD account (FM****) and to transfer WRM assets between ORG IDs. Place the
         document number assigned on the shipping document. When the SFL is processed it
         not only records the loss but it also posts an increase to the division in-transit account.
         The gaining activity must process an inshipment gain (SFG) to reduce the division in-
         transit account. Note: Out Shipment Losses, within both the AM and IM
         Applications, now generate a MSL/MDL transaction when AF activities ship materiel
         to a non-AF activity. DMLSS continues to generate SHL/SFL transactions for
         shipments to AF activities.
            5.11.2.3.2.1. In DMLSS 3.1.1, use the IM-Item Gains/Losses screen, select the
            loss indicator, transaction reason and item ID and press enter. Populate/complete
            all applicable fields and click ―Save‖ on the vertical toolbar. The IM RIC lookup
            screen (Figure 5.26.) appears. Verify the information and then click ―OK.‖

             5.11.2.3.2.3. The SHL/SFL transaction updates line ―9A‖ of the MMMR
             produced by Finance, and line ―9A‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report
             within Business Objects.
         5.11.2.3.3. Return to Source of Supply. DMLSS generates the ―TIL‖ transaction
         with reason type ―RTL.‖ Use the RTL transaction reason type to drop items returned
         to the source for no credit, when credit is unknown, or if there is a pending
         replacement.    In addition, use the RTL when directed by DPSC, GSA,
         AFMOA/SGALD, or other authority for actions other than excess returns. The
         TIL/RTL transaction updates line ―9B‖ of the MMMR produced by Finance, and line
         ―9B‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects. See
         paragraph 5.11.2.3.2.1. and 5.11.2.3.2.21. and figures 5.23. and 5.24. for similar steps
         and D&TM screenshots.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 161


       5.11.2.3.4. Return Item for Trade In. DMLSS generates the ―TIL‖ transaction with
       reason type ―TRL.‖ Use the TRL transaction reason type to drop an item shipped to a
       commercial source as a trade-in. The TIL/TRL transaction updates line ―9K‖ of the
       MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―9K‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat)
       report within Business Objects. See paragraph 5.11.2.3.2.1. and 5.11.2.3.2.21. and
       figures 5.23. and 5.24. for similar steps and D&TM screenshots.
       5.11.2.3.5. Outshipment to DRMO. See paragraph 5.11.2.3.2.1. and 5.11.2.3.2.21.
       and figures 5.23. and 5.24. for similar steps and D&TM screenshots. Note: If the
       user selects ―Yes for Base Transportation,‖ the shipper will default to CMOS-Local

       be able to select the Shipper and Tracking Number. If the user selects ―Pending for
       the Base Transportation,‖ the shipper will default to Pending
       5.11.2.3.6. Inventory Adjustment Loss. DMLSS generates the ―IAL‖ transaction
       with no corresponding reason type. Use the IAL transaction reason type to decrease
       an on-hand balance in DMLSS when the actual on-hand quantity is less than the
       quantity reflected in the record. Before using the IAL, ensure that the shortage is not
       due to erroneous posting or failure to process another transaction. This transaction is
       not reversable. To correct an erroneous IAL, an IAG transaction must be processed.
       The IAL transaction updates line ―6B‖ of the MMMR produced by Finance, and line
       ―6B‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within Business Objects.
       5.11.2.3.7. End/Kit Item Loss. DMLSS generates the ―MSL‖ transaction with reason
       type ―EIL.‖ Use the EIL transaction reason type to disassemble an end item or kit.
       The EIL transaction is processed in combination with the Individual/Component Gain
       (IIG) transactions. For example, you want to disassemble an end item or kit that
       contains 5 individual items. First, process an EIL to drop the end item or kit. Then
       process the 5 individual IIGs to gain the individual items that were part of the end
       item or kit. The total dollar value of the individual/component gains should normally
       equal the unit price of the end/kit item loss. We rarely assembly kits, so this
       transaction is seldom used. The MSL/EIL transaction updates line ―9J‖ of the
       MMMR produced by Finance, and line ―9J‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat)
       report within Business Objects.
       5.11.2.3.8. Decapitalization of SF Asset. DMLSS generates the ―MSL‖ transaction
       with reason type ―MDL.‖ Use the MDL transaction reason type to lose an item that is
       being shipped to other services or another division of the AFWCF (i.e. the Army or
       Base Supply). The MSL/MDL transaction updates line ―9I‖ of the MMMR produced
       by Finance, and line ―9I‖ of the BalanceInDFAS_AF (Arc/Strat) report within
       Business Objects.
       5.11.2.3.9. Natural Disaster Inventory Loss.           DMLSS generates the ―IAL‖
       transaction with reason type ―MIL.‖ Use the MIL transaction reason type to drop
       items due to a major disaster such as a fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, warehouse
       collapse, etc. Do not use this transaction for water damage from a rain storm,
       refrigerator or freezer failure, etc. If in doubt whether to use this transaction, contact
       AFMOA/SGALO. The IAL/MIL transaction updates line ―9K‖ of the MMMR

5.12. Excess.
   5.12.1. General Information.
       5.12.1.1. For the purpose of DMLSS inventory, materiel is considered local excess when
       the materiel cannot be sold to a customer, utilized in WRM, or kept as economic
       retention for future sale. General policy for reporting excess is contained in DoD
       4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumables. Refer
       to AFI 41-209, Chapter 3, for additional excess policy. Assets may also be deemed
       excess because the customer can no longer use the materiel. The Asset Review function
       in DMLSS allows logistics to restratify excess assets between OPR and WRM.
       5.12.1.2. The minimum total dollar value of each line item must be $3,000 to formally
       report materiel as excess. If the total dollar value is greater than $3,000, credit
       determination is based on stockage and redistribution requirements. DMLSS allows
       materiel managers the ability to modify the ―Excess Dollar Value;‖ however, it should
       not be changed unless higher headquarters dictates a change to the reportable excess
       threshold. This value represents the threshold that DMLSS uses to determine whether or
       not an item meets the excess criteria. Visibility of this threshold is most notable when an
       item is coded as reportable or non-reportable in the excess module. The Excess Dollar
       Value field is in the MM Service detail record located in SS.
       5.12.1.3. Refer to Attachment 5, IM Pending Actions, for a detailed explanation of
       excess pending actions. A list of excess status codes is available in the TMU table
       located in SS. To access, click on ―TMU‖ in SS, select ―IM‖ in the Application
       dropdown menu, and then open the Status Code (MRP) table.
       5.12.1.4. Reporting Excess to the TRIMEDS. Excess medical materiel in serviceable
       condition (condition codes A through C) is reported to TRIMEDS. Materiel reported
       excess using TRIMEDS is available for 45 days. The materiel is available to AF
       activities for the first 20 days. For the next 25 days, the materiel is available to all DoD
       activities. TRIMEDS uses the AFML website, Procurement Services link, to offer
       reported excess at no cost to DoD medical activities.
          5.12.1.4.1. Criteria for Reporting Excess to TRIMEDS. The following categories of
          excess materiel are reported to TRIMEDS:
                5.12.1.4.1.1. Total minimum line item value is $3,000.
                5.12.1.4.1.2. Condition Codes A, B, and C are the only acceptable codes.
                5.12.1.4.1.3. Shelf life dated items must have a minimum of 120 days until
                expiration.
          5.12.1.4.2. Exceptions to TRIMEDS Reporting Criteria.
                5.12.1.4.2.1. Do not report items with notes code ―G‖ or ―W.‖ (If a large dollar
                value, call AFMOA/SGAL for disposition instructions.)
                5.12.1.4.2.2. DMLSS does not track expiration dates for OPR materiel. In the
                Report Excess screen, select ―Dated Item‖ to produce an Excess Dated Item
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 163


             Worklist. Use this worklist to document the expiration dates for dated materiel
             that is considered potential excess.
      5.12.1.5. DMLSS Procedures for Reporting Excess.
          5.12.1.5.1. The first step in the process is to identify the potential excess materiel
          using the Report Excess function. From the Navigate menu, select ―Excess‖ and then
          ―Report Excess.‖ The Report Excess window is broken into several sections. A
          search scope must be selected and then additional search criteria identified.
             5.12.1.5.1.1. Scope. Enter IM for OPR stock, or AM for WRM.
             5.12.1.5.1.2. Stratification State (Strat State). Place a check in one, some, or all
             Strat States to further identify the search criteria.
             5.12.1.5.1.3. Item ID. Select one or multiple item IDs. Use the ―Select All‖ box
             to search all item IDs.
          5.12.1.5.2. Click ―Search‖ to retrieve and view records matching the search criteria.
          5.12.1.5.3. The search results are displayed in the Report Excess Search Results
          window. Potential excess items can be retained, reported, or restratified. Information
          is slightly different for IM and AM items; however, the basic functionality is the
          same.
          5.12.1.5.4. The Report Excess Search Results window (Figure 5.28.) contains item
          details and other management data necessary to determine appropriate item
          disposition. The item detail data is self explanatory but special attention should be
          put on the CIIC and the refrigerate/freeze indicator. These items require special
          handling and may play a role in making disposition decisions. The following
          management data is displayed and should be used to make appropriate management
          decisions:

Figure 5.28. Report Excess – IM Search Results.




             5.12.1.5.4.1. Strat State – Serviceable, Unserviceable, Repairable, Suspended,

             5.12.1.5.4.5. Due-Out – Total quantity due-out to customers.
             5.12.1.5.4.6. Economic Retention Quantity (ERQ) – Authorized OPR retention
             quantity if there is a reasonable probability that the materiel will be used in a
             specified time period. Computer calculated based on Daily Demand Rate (DDR)
             multiplied by the Economic Retention Days. The Economic Retention Days
             value is in the MM Service detail record located in SS.
             5.12.1.5.4.7. Potential Excess – Computer calculated potential excess quantity.
             5.12.1.5.4.8. $ Val Potential Excess – Line item value of potential excess.
             Computer calculated based on potential excess quantity multiplied by the U/P
             price.
             5.12.1.5.4.9. Reported Excess – Total quantity of line item already reported
             excess.
             5.12.1.5.4.10. Asset Review – Identifies shortages in either OPR or WRM
             assemblage(s). An ―X‖ will appear if a shortage exists. Use Asset Review to
             transfer materiel to fill shortages vice reporting excess. Refer to paragraph
             5.12.2.6 for more details.
             5.12.1.5.4.11. Reportable – An ―X‖ appears in this box when the potential excess
             meets reporting requirements.
             5.12.1.5.4.12. CAIM Users – Identifies customers currently using the materiel.
             5.12.1.5.4.13. Reason Non Reportable – A brief explanation is provided in this
             field if the materiel is not reportable.
         5.12.1.5.5. Report an item excess. Only items containing an ―X‖ in the reportable
         column can be reported as excess materiel. Only one record can be selected at a time.
         To report an item excess, highlight the record and click ―Excess Report‖ located on
         the vertical toolbar. The Excess Report Screen window opens. Validate excess
         quantity and condition code and click ―Save.‖ The expiration date field is mandatory
         for dated materiel. A message box with the assigned document number for the
         reported excess is displayed. Click ―OK‖ to return to the Report Excess Search
         Results window.
         5.12.1.5.6. The item is now considered reported excess and will not reappear in the
         Report Excess Search Results window. During the next DMLSS End-of-Day
         processing cycle, the system automatically produces and transmits excess report
         images to the applicable agency (i.e., TRIMEDS). The system generates the
         following transactions and writes them to Transaction History:
             5.12.1.5.6.1. ITL for Strat State OPR – Internal Transfer Loss from operating.
             5.12.1.5.6.2. ITG for Strat State EXS – Internal Transfer Gain to excess.
      5.12.1.6. Asset Review.
         5.12.1.6.1. Materiel managers should verify materiel is no longer needed prior to
         reporting it excess. Within DMLSS, the Asset Review function is an automated tool
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 165


         managers can use to locate stock shortages in OPR or LOG Owned WRM
         assemblage(s).
         5.12.1.6.2. Potential excess items can be restratified between LOG owned WRM
         assemblages and OPR. Use assets to fill shortages rather than reporting them excess.
         An ―X‖ will appear in the Asset Review box when a materiel shortage exists in OPR
         or WRM.
         5.12.1.6.3. When this condition exists, select ―Asset Review‖ located on the vertical
         toolbar to open the Asset Review window. The Asset Review window contains item
         details, potential excess details, and lists all assemblages containing an allowance for
         the respective item. Be mindful that not all listed assemblages have existing
         shortages. Some of the listed assemblages may actually have overages. Use
         assemblage overages to fill assemblage shortages prior to transferring OPR stock to
         WRM.
         5.12.1.6.4. To transfer assets, check ―SEL‖ in the WRM section of the Asset Review
         window and select ―Transfer.‖           Multiple transfers can be accomplished
         simultaneously. Complete the transfer when the Internal Transfer window opens.
            5.12.1.6.4.1. In the ―FROM‖ box, enter a location ID and a storage area.
            5.12.1.6.4.2. In the ―TO‖ box, enter a location ID and a storage area.
            5.12.1.6.4.3. Enter quantity in the Transfer Quantity field.
            5.12.1.6.4.4. Enter the Transfer Qty in the Transfer To assemblage record at the
            bottom of the screen.
            5.12.1.6.4.5. Click ―Save‖ to process item transfer and obtain delivery list. The
            option not to print this list is available from the message box. If performing
            multiple transfers, a delivery list will print for each project.
         5.12.1.6.5. The system generates the following transactions and writes them to
         Transaction History:
            5.12.1.6.5.1. ITL, Strat Stat OPR - Internal Transfer Loss from OPR.
            5.12.1.6.5.2. ITG, Strat Stat WMR - Internal Transfer Gain to WRM.
         5.12.1.6.6. Report all remaining quantities excess once Asset Review and
         redistribution has been accomplished. If no potential excess remains, the item will no
         longer appear in the Report Excess Search Results window.
     5.12.1.7. A P/S relationship may exist for items appearing as potential excess. A check
     mark in the P/S column identifies items coded as a substitute item. To view the prime
     item identification data, select the ―P/S‖ icon from the vertical toolbar. Click ―WRM
     P/S‖ to view prime item ID data for a WRM item. These icons are only available for
     substitute items.
  5.12.2. Search Excess.
     5.12.2.1. Use the Search Excess (Figure 5.29.) function to access reported excess detail
     records. Users can search for reported excess using the document number, item ID,
     Julian date reported to (DLA Troop Support or TRIMEDS), report status, or by
 166                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       equipment nomenclature. If multiple shipments are directed for a single record, a suffix
       code (A, B, C, etc.) is assigned to further identify detail records using the same document
       number. Use the ―Scope‖ to target select records and minimize search results. Available
       Scope options include ALL, IM, AM, or equipment. To further pinpoint desired results,
       use the ―Active/Inactive‖ toggle button. Active records are those that have not received
       disposition instructions. Inactive records have been shipped or disposed of accordingly.
       The ―Scope‖ defaults to ALL/Active. If a search is performed and the fields are left
       blank, DMLSS retrieves all reported excess records up to the search limit.

Figure 5.29. Report Excess – Search Excess (Search Results in Background) Window.




       5.12.2.2. Use this function to review detailed status, submit follow-ups, or submit
       cancellation requests on reported excess. Click ―Detail‖ to review excess details and
       status information. To submit a follow-up or cancellation request, select ―Status
       Request‖ located on the vertical toolbar.
       5.12.2.3. Follow-ups on Reported Excess.
          5.12.2.3.1. Computer Generated Follow-ups.
              5.12.2.3.1.1. DMLSS generates a follow-up (document identifier FTF) if DLA
              Troop Support or TRIMEDS does not respond to the FTE within 30 days. The
              Excess Detail Record is updated to reflect submission of the FTF. If no response
              to the first follow-up is received within 10 days, DMLSS generates a second
              follow-up. If there is no response to the second follow-up, a ―000‖ image with
              the message ―TWO CONS FOLLOW-UPS SENT – NO REPLY‖ is shown on the
              IM Excess Report in the Troubled tab.
              5.12.2.3.1.2. DMLSS automatically generates follow-up requests after five days.
              Manual follow-ups can be submitted at any time by using the ―Status Request‖
              button and selecting ―Follow-up.‖ DMLSS writes status code EF and document
              identifier code (DIC) FTF to the Excess file and it is transmitted to the SOS
              during EOP processing. The follow-up details are displayed in the Status tab.
          5.12.2.3.2. Manually Generated Follow-ups. Select ―Follow-Up‖ from the Status
          Request window to submit a follow-up request. After clicking ―OK,‖ the system
          generates the follow-up request and transmits the request during EOP processing.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  167


          The follow-up, DIC FTF and status code EF, is posted to the Status tab in the Excess
          Detail Record.
      5.12.2.4. Responses to Follow-Up Requests.
          5.12.2.4.1. DLA Troop Support.
              5.12.2.4.1.1. If DLA Troop Support is processing the FTE, a FTD ―TR‖ is
              transmitted. If an excess record is already established at DLA Troop Support and
              a FTD or FTR has already been generated, a duplicate of the last status is
              transmitted.
              5.12.2.4.1.2. If DLA Troop Support rejected the FTE, a FTR containing the same
              status code as the original rejection is transmitted.
              5.12.2.4.1.3. If no record of the FTE exists, DLA Troop Support processes the
              FTF as a FTE and responds with FTD or FTR status.
          5.12.2.4.2. TRIMEDS.
              5.12.2.4.2.1. If TRIMEDS is processing the FTE, a FTR ―FA‖ is transmitted.
              5.12.2.4.2.2. If no record of the FTE exists, a FTR ―FN‖ is transmitted. The
              image appears in the IM Inbox on the IM Excess Report in the Troubled tab.
              Users must delete these records before any other action can take place.
   5.12.3. Request Excess.
      5.12.3.1. Excess materiel can be requested from other DoD activities via TRIMEDS to
      fill OPR or WRM shortages and may also be requested to satisfy a specific customer
      requirement. To generate a request select ―Excess,‖ then ―Request Excess‖ from the
      Navigate menu.
      5.12.3.2. The Request Type defaults to Customer but can be changed to OPR or WRM.
      The item ID and quantity are always mandatory but the Request Type dictates additional
      mandatory criteria. To further specify a request, insert the FOA Document Number and
      condition code available in the TRIMEDS database via the AFML website by clicking
      the ―Supply‖ tab, then clicking ―Applications.‖
          5.12.3.2.1. For a Customer request, the customer‘s ID is required and the
          maintenance activity is required if the item is classified as equipment.
          5.12.3.2.2. For an OPR request, only the item ID and quantity is required.
          5.12.3.2.3. If the request is to fill a WRM shortage, then the request must be linked to
          an assemblage.
      5.12.3.3. The requested excess information is written to an excess request file and
      transmitted to TRIMEDS during the next EOP processing cycle.
5.13. Print Barcodes.
   5.13.1. The Barcode Printing module allows users to print barcode labels for new items or
   replacement labels for existing items. Barcode labels are printed when the label of an
   existing item is unreadable or if label-related information in the customer catalog has been
   modified. Print barcodes can also be used in conjunction with Replenishment Inventory,
 168                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   Physical Inventory, and the Issues processes via HHT. SBLs may be printed in the Barcode
   Printing window. The SBL is principally used for inventorying customer areas, but is also
   used for item and customer identification.
   5.13.2. Before printing large quantities of labels, check the barcode printer to ensure that the
   machine is on, operating properly, and there are plenty of labels for the print job. If using
   multiple printers, be sure to check them all. Print barcode labels frequently to ensure they
   reflect current customer information. Reprint labels as they become worn or if they are
   removed. DMLSS notifies users when unprinted labels require printing by posting the IM
   Unprinted Bar Code Labels with Changes pending action to the IM Inbox.
   5.13.3. The Barcode Printing window (Figure 5.30.) can be accessed in a few different ways.
   From the Navigate menu, click ―Print Barcodes‖ to access the Barcode Printing window or
   click ―Barcode‖ located on the horizontal toolbar. Another option is to use the keyboard
   shortcut ―Ctrl+Shift+F8.‖ This window is also accessible from the Customer Inbox when
   unprinted barcode labels with changes are pending.

Figure 5.30. Barcode Printing Window.




   5.13.4. Once the window is open, select the search criteria by utilizing any of the available
   filters. Then click ―Search‖ to view a list of all barcodes matching the search criteria. The
   list shows item description, item ID, storage area, location, level, and U/S.
   5.13.5. One, some, or all labels can be printed. Labels will print in the order they appear on
   the screen. Change the print sequence by clicking the ―Sort‖ button on the toolbar. Sort
   labels by description, item ID, storage area, or location. The Sort window also allows users
   to add additional criteria or delete existing criteria. This is helpful when more detailed
   printing is required. An example would be printing labels by location and inserting another
   sort criteria to print the location by item ID.
   5.13.6. The last used sort criteria is saved. To print in item ID sequence only, click ―Sort,‖
   highlight the field to delete, and click ―Delete.‖ Change the remaining field to item ID and
   click ―OK.‖ This is the new print sequence. Click ―Print‖ from the toolbar and select a
   barcode printer.
5.14. Orders.
   5.14.1. Customer Request.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                169


     5.14.1.1. A customer request can be generated from IM if necessary. From the Navigate
     menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Customer Request‖ to access the Customer Request
     window. Within the window, identify the requesting customer and required item using
     the dropdown lists. The window will populate with the stored catalog data.
     5.14.1.2. Review all data fields and modify as necessary. Click ―SRIM Due-Out‖ on the
     vertical toolbar to check for existing customer due-outs. If the item is due-out, contact
     the customer to validate the additional requirement. If the requirement is valid, enter a
     document number (if required) and quantity. Click ―Save‖ to process the request.
     5.14.1.3. Upon saving, the customer request generates an ESD and IOU. The customer
     request is submitted to LOG when issues are processed. Refer to paragraph 5.15, Issues,
     for completing the issue process.
  5.14.2. LOG Orders.
     5.14.2.1. Use IM LOG Orders to replenish OPR inventory and to purchase materiel
     needed to fulfill customer requirements. DMLSS assembles all pending requirements
     and populates LOG Orders during EOP processing, when IM issues are manually
     processed or when a user selects the Orders/LOG Requirement Orders option. DMLSS
     sorts all potential orders according to the SOS code and by ―Req Date.‖ The Req Date
     identifies when the requirement was generated by the system based upon either an
     unfulfilled IM Issue action or a level requirement for OPR/SER. For PVP and PVM,
     DMLSS further sorts orders (call numbers) according to delivery method. In addition,
     the system will segregate requirements if the potential order/s are linked to a customer/s
     and marked as ―PV Direct.‖
     5.14.2.2. While viewing the LOG Orders window, users may select all, some, or a single
     SOS for processing. Once an SOS is selected, DMLSS locks the item, validates, and
     builds the order(s). An order summary is visible for each source.
     5.14.2.3. The Order Summary window (Figure 5.31.) provides summary details for each
     source to include total lines, total value, exceptions, controlled item class, call number,
     auto call indicator, and delivery method. The summary also displays funds availability to
     include commitments and new available balance information. Users have the ability to
     modify specific requisition qualifiers with the order detail screen, such as, Media/Status
     (M/S) code, Priority, Supplementary Address, and Vendor Item Number. The Vendor
     Item Number (VIN) is the most critical component of the requisition process as it
     signifies to the vendor exactly what you are attempting to procure. Adjust the VIM
     accordingly if there is an acceptable equivalent loaded within the MTF Catalog on the
     item, and the primary item is not available from the vendor.
 170                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 5.31. Build Order - Order Summary Window.




       5.14.2.4. Exceptions must be resolved prior to executing an order. A check in the
       exceptions box identifies line items requiring attention. The Exception Detail window
       provides an explanation of why there is an exception on the order. Do one of the
       following to resolve exception data:
          5.14.2.4.1. Alter potential due-in or due-out quantities.
          5.14.2.4.2. Adjust the maximum/minimum order amounts.
          5.14.2.4.3. Verify that the next contract information is properly loaded for SOS
          types-DPV, BPA, DBP, RPV, and VPV.
       5.14.2.5. The exceptions box is unmarked once the exception is resolved. Execute the
       order once all exceptions are resolved.
       5.14.2.6. Using the ―Execute‖ button on the vertical toolbar allows DMLSS to process
       the order as identified in the Submission tab of the SOS record (paragraph 5.6.1.3).
       When the Submit Progress for Exception Started window (Figure 5.32.) appears, verify
       the order was completed and submitted successfully then close the window. If the order
       is destined to an ―external‖ agency, such as your Prime Vendor, DLA Troop Support,
       ECAT, etc., utilize the ―DCM Search‖ or ―DCM Monitor‖ modules within System
       Services to verify that the order was successfully transmitted.

Figure 5.32. Submit Progress for Exception Started Window.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              171


     5.14.2.7. PVMs Holding Backorders. DMLSS 3.1.2/Gen IV allows both the primary and
     back-up Med/Surg PVs to hold a backorder; however, the PV must provide an estimated
     ship date (ESD) on every line that is backordered with a status code of ―IB‖, and the
     timeframe for delivery is based on the ESD. If the ESD exceeds the order date by 90
     days, DMLSS will automatically generate a cancellation request. Additionally, if a
     customer requires materiel before the ESD, they can initiate a request for cancellation
     immediately.
        5.14.2.7.1. Any items not initially filled will be held on backorder with an ESD
        provided in the order confirmation (EDI 855). If the customer determines they
        require the product prior to the ESD, a request for cancellation must be made by
        means of the EDI 860 (Purchase Order Change Request). The PV will respond with
        an EDI 865 (Purchase Order Change Acknowledgement/Request) either accepting or
        rejecting the cancellation.
        5.14.2.7.2. If the primary PV accepts the cancellation, DMLSS generates a potential
        order to the secondary PV. The user receives a Potential Orders to PV Backup
        pending action and must decide between the following courses of action: resend the
        order to the primary PV, create an order to the secondary PV or cancel the line
        item(s) from the pending action. If the site chooses to send the order to the back -up
        PV and it cannot fill the order immediately, they may place the item on backorder and
        must provide the customer with an ESD in the order confirmation. If the customer
        decides they require the item before the ESD, the customer can request cancellation in
        the same manner as stated above.
        5.14.2.7.3. The user is notified two business days after the ESD if the receipt is not
        posted and an EDI 856 is not received via a pending action – Delinquent Backorder
        from PV.
  5.14.3. Offline Submit/Non-Submit.
     5.14.3.1. Use Offline orders to process out-of-cycle or emergency purchases in DMLSS.
     Additionally, use this process when recovering from manual supply operations,
     submitting capital equipment orders, updating computer records when orders were placed
     while DMLSS was offline, or when directed by higher authority.
     5.14.3.2. Offline Non-Submit is also used to process orders for CIIC R (schedule I and
     II) items and Prime Vendor credit orders. The Offline Non-Submit order must be
     processed in DMLSS prior to submitting the order to the vendor. When prompted, print
     the DD Form 1155 and submit it to the vendor along with the DEA Form 222, U.S.
     Official Order Forms – Schedules I and II Controlled. Note: follow the procedures for
     your geographic location. Processing offline orders in DMLSS first provides required
     prior notification of the order to DLA Troop Support and prevents the vendor‘s EDI 855
     (order confirmation) and EDI 856 (shipping confirmation) status files from rejecting in
     DMLSS and EBS.
     5.14.3.3. The difference between ―Submit‖ and ―Non-Submit‖ is simply whether or not
     the order will interface electronically with the source/vendor. For orders marked as
     ―Non-Submit,‖ the system does not generate an outgoing transaction file to the vendor.
     For Prime Vendor requisitions, the system creates a ―pseudo‖ EDI 850 file that it
172                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      transmits to DLA Troop Support. This file is used to establish a billing/delivery order
      profile by DLA Troop Support. Predetermined settings in the submission tab of the SOS
      record dictates whether orders are printed or transmitted to vendor. An override option to
      the default submission method is available in the SOS Details tab within the Offline
      Orders window.
      5.14.3.4. Two tabs exist in the Supply/Equipment Offline Orders window. Use the Main
      tab to identify order details. Use the SOS Details tab to view and edit the vendor‘s data
      as necessary.
      5.14.3.5. In the Main tab, enter the item ID or select one from the dropdown list. The
      remaining fields become available once the item ID is loaded. Use the ―Add Item‖ icon
      located on the vertical toolbar if multiple items are being purchased on a single order.
      Note: The ―Add Item‖ icon is only available after the order is associated to a customer
      ID. Remaining catalog items associated to the particular SOS appear after the ―Add
      Item‖ icon is selected. At this time, individual or multiple items may be added to the
      order by entering the order quantity. Click ―OK‖ when finished.
      5.14.3.6. In the Customer window, click ―Add‖ to enter the customer, expense center,
      and quantity. If the order is being processed to satisfy LOG OPR requirements, select the
      local DODAAC from the customer dropdown list.
      5.14.3.7. Complete additional required fields prior to executing the order. Modify the
      Strat Type and Demand Code fields using the dropdown menu. The Offline Order
      process defaults to ―Submit‖ and will electronically submit the order to the vendor. If the
      order was manually submitted to the vendor, check the ―Non-Submit‖ box so DMLSS
      will NOT submit a duplicate order to the vendor.
      5.14.3.8. The document number field is not a mandatory field. If this field is left blank,
      the system will assign the next available document number even if the Non-Submit
      function is used. If a manual document number was assigned to the order, enter the
      document number in this field.
      5.14.3.9. Once the order is complete and all codes are properly set, select ―Execute‖ to
      process the order. The LOG and CAIM due-ins and due-outs are generated and written to
      the due-in/due-out module and Transaction History.
      5.14.3.10. The user has visibility of the source‘s POC information, CAIM balances, and
      CAIM due-outs while in the Supply/Equipment Offline Orders window. The POC
      information provides a quick reference if the buyer needs to contact the source. CAIM
      balances and due-outs can be used to verify the customer‘s requirement and to help
      prevent duplicating or pyramiding customer backorders.
      5.14.3.11. Delayed Delivery Orders. A DMLSS PV order is considered a delayed
      delivery order whenever the user enters a required delivery date (RDD) from the offline
      orders screen. The RDD can be greater than the current date but not more than 180
      calendar days from the current date. (See Chapter 8, paragraph 8.19.4.6. for more
      information on delayed delivery orders).
  5.14.4. Equipment Requirement. Use the Equipment Requirement function to create an
  offline equipment order. This function bypasses the Equipment Request process discussed in
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                173


  Chapter 9, Equipment Management. The Equipment Requirement function obligates
  customer funds and creates a LOG due-out (IOU) transaction. As a reminder, the equipment
  order (LOG due-in) is not generated at this time. In order to link this new due-out to a LOG
  due-in, you must utilize the IM Offline Submit/Nonsubmit module. The user will be notified
  of the existing LOG due-out at this time and is provided the option to link the due-in and
  due-out.
  5.14.5. Due-in/Due-out Search.
     5.14.5.1. Use the Due-in/Due-out Search module to search and view active or inactive
     due-in/due-out records. An active record is one that has not been received or cancelled,
     whereas, an inactive record has been received or cancelled. Additionally, the Due-
     in/Due-out Search module is used to post and request status, request and process
     cancellations, adjust due-in/due-out quantities, and update status prices. Searches may be
     conducted in three ways (scope):
         5.14.5.1.1. MTF - Displays both LOG and customer due-ins/due-outs..
         5.14.5.1.2. LOG - Displays only LOG due-ins/due-outs.
         5.14.5.1.3. Customer - Displays only customer due-ins/due-outs.
         5.14.5.1.4. Status updates from ―external‖ agencies such as Prime Vendor, ECAT,
         DLA Troop Support, and WAWF will post automatically to respective due-in detail
         records when passing select edit checks. For example, if the due-in detail record is
         ―active‖ and the status code provided does not require further action by the user on
         the Status Edit Report Part II, then the system will post the status. Status from Prime
         Vendors will generally include price updates, quantity revisions, and advance
         shipping notifications. The information is provided by the vendor by contract and call
         number. Status from ECAT generally includes ECAT contract/call updates, quantity
         revisions, and advance shipment notifications. Status from DLA Troop Support
         could include quantity revisions, contract information, pricing changes, SOS changes,
         and advance shipment notifications. Status from WAWF will include advance
         shipment notifications.
     5.14.5.2. Revise Due-In/Due-Out Quantity. Normally, when the supply source changes
     the quantity ordered, either an AE1 image with status code ―BJ‖ (MILSTRIP) or EDI 855
     with ―IQ‖ status code (PV) is provided. During processing of the AE1 or 855 statuses,
     DMLSS adjusts the due-in quantity. Depending on the vendor type, electronic
     confirmation may not be available and the status is received by some other means (i.e.
     telephone, email, etc.). In this instance, manual quantity adjustments are accomplished
     using the LOG Due-in/Due-out module.
     5.14.5.3. Adjusting Quantities Manually. Click ―Due-in/Due-out‖ on the horizontal
     toolbar to access IM Due-In/Due-Outs. In the Due-in Search tab, enter a document
     number or item ID to search for the due-in record. The Due-in Search Results tab
     displays the retrieved records. Select ―LOG Due-in‖ and click ―Details.‖ To modify the
     existing due-in:
         5.14.5.3.1. In the Detail screen, verify a previous partial receipt has not already
         processed. If a partial receipt was previously processed, update the current due-in
174                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         quantity appropriately taking into consideration the partial receipt quantity and
         current due-in quantity. See the following examples:
             5.14.5.3.1.1. Example 1 - Decrease to the Original Quantity Ordered: The
             original due-in was for 15. A partial receipt has already processed for 5. The
             current due-in quantity is 10. The supplier decreased the original order quantity
             to 12. Since 5 of the 12 have already been received, enter 7 in the revised due-in
             quantity field. DMLSS spawns a DQC transaction with status code ―CA.‖
             5.14.5.3.1.2. Example 2 - Increase to the Original Quantity Ordered: The
             original due-in was for 10. A partial receipt for 2 has already processed. The
             current due-in quantity is 8. The supplier increased the original order to 12.
             Since 2 of the 12 have already been received, enter 10 in the revised due-in
             quantity field. DMLSS spawns a DQI transaction with status code ―BJ.‖ Note:
             DMLSS prohibits users from manually increasing due-in quantities on PV orders.
         5.14.5.3.2. Enter the revised due-in quantity in the quantity field.
         5.14.5.3.3. Use the standard unit of issue quantity.
         5.14.5.3.4. Quantity increase adjustments to LOG due-ins require the LOG due-outs
         to be increased. To increase the LOG due-out, open the Due-Out tab and perform a
         search for the document number. The results of the search are displayed in the Due-
         Out Results tab. Click ―Details‖ to view the due-out information. Coordinate with
         the customer, and if acceptable, enter the revised due-out quantity and click ―Save.‖
         Note: DMLSS will prohibit quantity increases from occurring if the LOG due-in is
         linked to a prior fiscal year LOG due-out.
      5.14.5.4. DMLSS Processing Actions for Quantity Adjustments.
         5.14.5.4.1. Due-in Increases. DMLSS increases the current and original due-in
         quantity if the revised quantity is greater than the current due-in quantity. DMLSS
         generates a DQI transaction. If the LOG due-out quantity is increased, the CAIM
         due-out is also increased (IOI transaction).
         5.14.5.4.2. Quantity Decreases. DMLSS decreases the current and original due-in
         quantity if the revised quantity is less than the current due-in quantity. DMLSS
         generates a DQC transaction with status code ―CS.‖ If the due-in is for equipment
         and it is linked to a prior FY (PFY) due-out, a message appears asking whether or not
         the FY due-out should be cancelled. Generally, the answer should be ―NO.‖ If the
         user answers ―YES,‖ then the PFY obligation is cancelled and the PFY customer
         funds are no longer retrievable.
      5.14.5.5. Due-In/Due-Out Cancellations.
         5.14.5.5.1. Understanding the Due-In/Due-Out cancellation process is of the utmost
         importance. First, users must understand how LOG and CAIM due-ins and due-outs
         are associated during the ordering process. Refer to paragraphs 5.15.4.5.2 and
         5.15.4.5.3 and figures 5.33. and 5.34. for details.
         5.14.5.5.2. Cancellation options vary depending on if the cancellations are for LOG
         or CAIM. For example, a CAIM due-in cannot be cancelled if a LOG due-out exists
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            175


          because the CAIM due-in is tied to the LOG due-out; they are assigned the same
          document number.
          5.14.5.5.3. Customer requirements can be cancelled in CAIM prior to processing
          BPS.
          5.14.5.5.4. Figures 5.33. and 5.34. provide a snapshot of DMLSS actions generated
          during the cancellation process.

Figure 5.34. Cancel LOG Due-Out Process.




   5.14.6. External Customer Import.
      5.14.6.1. External customers‘ files for requisitions are sent in A0x (electronic
      requisition) in MILSTRIP format. MILSTRIP is a uniform procedure established by
      DoD for use within DoD to govern requisition and issue of materiel within standardized
      priorities. These MILSTRIP files can be imported and processed using the External
      Customer Import module, Import External A0x Files.
 176                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       5.14.6.2. From the Navigate menu, point to Orders, and click ―External Customer
       Import.‖ In the Import External A0A Files window, click ―Browse (…)‖next to the File
       to Import field. This field may open automatically. In the Select File to Import window,
       browse for the file to be imported, select it, and click ―Open.‖
       5.14.6.3. In the Import External A0A Files window, click ―Add‖ to move the file to the
       lower section. Repeat the above steps for any other files that need to be imported. Click
       ―Process‖ to complete the process.
   5.14.7. Reprint Contract/Call Documentation.              Within the Reprint Contract/Call
   Documentation window, enter the ORG/SVC ID or choose a dropdown menu option to
   conduct a search. A list of orders associated to the ORG/SVC ID appears in the Call Register
   box. Detailed due-in data for a specific call is visible in the Due-in Detail box. Select ―Print
   DD1155‖ from the vertical toolbar to reprint the required call. The system displays the
   message ―No orders found for customer!‖ when no matches are located for the ORG/SVC
   ID.
   5.14.8. Resubmit Orders/Follow-up Requests/Cancellations.
       5.14.8.1. Periodically, LOG interface files do not print or electronically transmit to the
       designated source. These files include but are not limited to the purchase request (EDI
       850), the cancellation request (EDI 860), and the receipt files (EDI 861 and 527R).
       Various system and network issues can cause this condition. This function allows users
       to either reprint or submit the orders.
       5.14.8.2. Orders that did not transmit or print are displayed in the Resubmit orders
       window. To retransmit orders, highlight a single order or multiple orders and select the
       ―Resubmit‖ button from the toolbar. To reprint orders, highlight a single order or
       multiple orders and select the reprint button from the toolbar. The system removes these
       records from the list upon completion.
       5.14.8.3. The original submission data and time, submission failure reason, order
       information, and due-in details are available by highlighting an order and selecting the
       ―Detail‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Select ―Close‖ to return to the Resubmit
       window.
   5.14.9. Resend to Gentran. Gentran is a software package which is responsible for
   formatting data prior to transmission to external agencies. Utilize GENTRAN to transmit
   orders via FTP, HTTPS, etc. If there are no orders to send, the message ―No orders to
   resend‖ is displayed. Select ―OK‖ to return to the previous screen. If order files exist,
   highlight the file(s) being resubmitted and click ―Submit‖ located on the vertical toolbar.
5.15. Issues.
   5.15.1. Overview. The LOG issue module is used as a response to customer generated
   requirements. Reference Chapter 6 (CAIM), Paragraph, 6.9 and Chapter 7 (CS), Paragraphs
   7.2.2.2 (Order Item) and 7.5 (Order Summary) for a detailed explanation on the customer
   replenishment process. The LOG issues process generally includes the following steps:
       5.15.1.1. LOG receives customer requirements.
       5.15.1.2. Execute LOG issues.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                177

     5.15.2.1. Select ―Navigate,‖ then ―Issues‖ and ―LOG Routine Issues‖ or click the
     ―Issues‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access the routine issues process.
     5.15.2.2. Select a customer(s) from the dropdown menu and click ―Search.‖ To select all
     customers, leave the customer entry blank and click ―Search.‖ DMLSS retrieves all
     pending customer(s) issues and displays them in the search results window.
     5.15.2.3. Select an individual issue or all issues by using the ―Select All‖ button located
     on the vertical toolbar. Click ―Gen Picklist‖ and then determine break and sort options
     prior to processing.
     5.15.2.4. The picklist ―break‖ function determines where the page breaks are set for a
     given picklist. The primary break option is defaulted to the last criteria used and no
     default is set for the secondary option. Available sort criteria for each is Storage Area,
     Location ID, Customer ID, and IPG (Issue Priority Group).
     5.15.2.5. The picklist ―sort‖ function determines the sort sequence for a given picklist.
     The primary sort is defaulted to the last option used. The picklist can be further sorted
     using Secondary, Tertiary, and Fourth sorts. These three options do not have defaults
     assigned. The available sort criteria for each are Customer ID, Location ID, Item ID, and
     Item Description.
     5.15.2.6. After selecting break and sort options, click ―OK‖ to view the Picklist-Break on
     Storage Area window. This window displays the issue requirements for the customer(s).
     5.15.2.7. Select ―Process‖ from the vertical toolbar to print the picklist. The system
     displays a ―Successfully Processed‖ message and assigns a picklist number. The Issues
     Search window is displayed after processing.
     5.15.2.8. Use the picklist to pull stock from the LOG storage location. While pulling
     stock for issue, annotate the actual quantity pulled in the space provided on the picklist.
     After all stock is pulled, picklist actions must be confirmed (paragraph 5.15.4).
  5.15.3. Non Routine Issues.
     5.15.3.1. Use the Non Routine Issues function to record offline, and emergency issues.
     Record non-routine orders for the following reasons:
         5.15.3.1.1. To maintain accurate inventory levels.
         5.15.3.1.2. To record demand history.
         5.15.3.1.3. To charge the issue to the customer.
     5.15.3.2. From the Navigate menu point to Issues and click ―Non Routine Issues‖ to
     open the Non Routine Issues window. Complete all required information (red dot) or
178                                                       AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      select information from the dropdown lists. The Delivery list option is the default for all
      non-routine issues. Click ―Save‖ and ―Close‖ from the vertical toolbar.
      5.15.3.3. The message ―Delivery List has been processed. Do you want to print it?‖ is
      displayed. Click ―Yes‖ to print the list. A message box appears indicating that the
      delivery list was printed. Printing the delivery list reduces LOG balances and processes
      an INR to the customer.
      5.15.3.4. When processing this type of issue, change the Delivery List default to
      Unofficial Pick List. The purpose of this action is to verify LOG balances exist prior to
      processing the issue. Therefore, the issue will process rather than create an additional
      (invalid) customer requirement/backorder.       Click ―Save‖ to view the Inventory
      Management window using the Unofficial Pick List. Click ―Print‖ to generate and print
      the picklist. This will not reduce LOG balances.
      5.15.3.5. Use the picklist to pull stock from the LOG storage location. While pulling
      stock for issue, annotate the actual quantity pulled in the space provided on the picklist.
      After all stock is pulled, picklist actions must be confirmed.
  5.15.4. Confirm Picks.
      5.15.4.1. Once issues are pulled from the storage area, use the Confirm Picks function to
      update LOG inventory balances and generate a pending Deliver List (paragraph 5.18).
      This step must be completed before funds are updated and the customer is charged for the
      issues. From the IM Navigate menu, select ―Issues,‖ and then ―Confirm Picks.‖
      5.15.4.2. Select the appropriate picklist and click ―Confirm Picks.‖ Click ―Select All‖ to
      confirm all pending picklists. The picklist information is displayed with the Picked Qty
      field highlighted because it requires updates. Perform the following:
         5.15.4.2.1. If the actual quantity issued (the ―picked quantity‖) is equal to the original
         issue quantity leave the Picked Qty field empty.
         5.15.4.2.2. If the actual quantity issued (the ―picked quantity‖) is different from the
         original issue quantity, type the actual quantity in the Picked Qty field. This action
         generates an IM Issue Exception resulting in a pending action.
         5.15.4.2.3. If the item is not in stock or only a partial quantity is available for issue, a
         LOG requirement is generated to fill the customer backorder. These requirements
         will appear in LOG Orders.
      5.15.4.3. After updating the Picked Qty field, click ―Complete‖ located on the vertical
      toolbar. If the confirmed Picked Qty differs from the original picklist quantity, the
      item(s) is locked for inventory. An inventory must be performed on the item(s) to clear
      the lock. See Physical Inventory (paragraph 5.8.) for processing procedures.
      5.15.4.4. Upon confirming picklists, DMLSS generates LOG and Customer transactions
      to record the issue action. The following information describes different scenarios and
      the associated DMLSS transactions.
         5.15.4.4.1. If the item is in stock, an ISS transaction is generated.
         5.15.4.4.2. If the item is not in stock, an IOU transaction is generated and linked to
         the requesting customer. These requirements will appear in LOG Orders.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              179


      5.15.4.5. All LOG and Customer transactions appear in Transaction History and serve as
      an audit trail. Below are examples of how Transaction History will display transactions.
         5.15.4.5.1. An item ordered for a customer will generate a CAIM (customer) ESD
         and IOU. Because all customers order from LOG, DMLSS checks LOG inventory
         balances to fill the order.
         5.15.4.5.2. If the request is filled, a LOG ISS transaction is generated. In this
         instance, three transactions are written to Transaction History: the CAIM ESD and
         IOU, as well as the LOG ISS. In this case, the customer requirement was filled by
         LOG and the transaction is complete (Figure 5.35).

Figure 5.35. LOG Fulfilled Customer Requirement (Issue Generated).




         5.15.4.5.3. An IOU transaction is generated if LOG cannot fulfill the customer
         requirement. In this case, three transactions are written to Transaction History: the
         customer (CAIM) ESD and IOU, as well as the LOG IOU. This indicates the item
         was ordered, but LOG could not fill the order internally. Item requests not fulfilled
         by LOG appear in LOG orders indicating the item must be purchased from the
         designated source. Once purchased, a LOG ESD (due-in) is written to Transaction
         History (Figure 5.36.).
 180                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013

   5.15.5. Reprint Completed Picklists.
       5.15.5.1. Occasionally, completed picklists are misplaced or additional copies are
       needed. Use the Reprint Completed Picklists function to obtain additional copies of a
       picklist. In the Reprint Completed Picklists window, identify the required picklist(s) and
       click ―Reprint‖ on the vertical toolbar. The message ―Picklist(s) Printed‖ displays.
       Select ―OK‖ to return to the Reprint Completed Picklist(s) window. The output product
       is identified as a reprinted product.
       5.15.5.2. DMLSS prevents multiple users from generating multiple picklists for the same
       issue request. On the customer issue request, DMLSS defaults to the item ID, customer
       and document number when a user generates a picklist. Once saved, picklists cannot be
       cancelled.
5.16. Receipts.
   5.16.1. The Receipts module enables users to process receipts, due-in adjustments, and
   cancellation actions. Receipts are processed either manually or by using the RF HHT.
   Pertinent item information is required prior to processing receipts in DMLSS. Obtain this
   information from the item, receiving document, materiel packing list, and/or shipping
   document. Using this data, receiving personnel can effectively process complete, partial,
   discrepant, and/or receipt not due-in transactions.
   5.16.2. To access the Receipts module, select ―Navigate‖ and then ―Receipts‖ or use the
   DMLSS shortcut ―Ctrl+Shift+Del.‖ The Receipts window is separated into two tabs: Search
   and Process Receipts tab.
       5.16.2.1. Receipts Search Tab. Use this tab to search for active or inactive due-ins, to
       obtain delivery lists, or to process receipts. Active due-ins are those in which the receipt
       has not processed and Inactive due-ins are those in which the receipt has already
       processed. Search for all due-ins by clicking ―Search‖ while all data fields are blank. To
       narrow the search, enter at least three characters into any of the search fields. Adjust the
       Record Limit between 1 and 500 to further minimize or maximize the search results.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              181


     Upon completing the search, the system displays the search results in the Process Receipt
     Search Results tab. The Process Receipt Search Results tab is used to view due-in
     details, process due-in status, adjust due-in quantities, process complete and partial
     receipts, and process cancellations.
     5.16.2.2. Process Receipts.
        5.16.2.2.1. The Process Receipt Search Results tab displays all due-ins matching the
        pre-determined search criteria. As a rule, editable fields appear with a white
        background. The receipt quantity, cancel quantity, status price, local contract, and
        substitute fields can be modified prior to processing a receipt.
            5.16.2.2.1.1. Process Box – The system automatically ―checks‖ this box unless
            (1) receipt exceptions exist as discussed below or (2) the due-in is from a "DPV"
            type source of supply (Prime Vendor) and the vendor has not provided an
            advanced shipping notification (EDI 856).
                5.16.2.2.1.1.1. Hazardous Materials – Receipts for hazardous material must
                be processed manually. Place a checkmark in the ―Process‖ box to continue.
                A message indicating that the item is hazardous is displayed. Select ―OK‖ to
                continue.
                5.16.2.2.1.1.2. Local Contract Number – A contract number must be loaded
                prior to processing the receipt. Click ―Detail‖ from the vertical toolbar and
                enter the local contract number from the source document. Close the Details
                window to update the contract information in the due-in detail. The receipt
                may now be processed.
                5.16.2.2.1.1.3. QA Record – The message ―An existing QA message exists
                for this Item ID‖ appears if a QA Record exists for the item. Receipts cannot
                be processed using RF/HHT when linked to a QA Message. These receipts
                must be processed using the DMLSS receipts module. The receipt cannot be
                processed until the QA Message is reviewed. Select/Check the ―QA‖ box and
                click the ―Jump To‖ icon to view the message. If the receipted material meets
                the QA criteria, do not process the receipt. Contact the vendor and request
                replacement materiel. If necessary, process a discrepant receipt and make
                sure the material is not issued to the customer(s). If the material does not
                meet the QA criteria, process the receipt.
            5.16.2.2.1.2. Pipeline Time (PLT) – A PLT checkbox is added to each record
            when the delivery time varies by plus or minus 10 days. Check this box to record
            this data as an actual PLT. Remember, PLTs are used to calculate ROPs for
            stocked items. They are also a valid indicator of actual delivery time. The system
            will not record the PLT if this box is unchecked.
            5.16.2.2.1.3. Quantity – Receipt actual quantity received. A discrepant receipt or
            due-in adjustment may be necessary if different than current due-in quantity.
            5.16.2.2.1.4. Price – Enter the billing price in this field.
        5.16.2.2.2. Receipt Cancellations (DQC). Process complete or partial cancellations
        from the IM Process Receipt tab.
182                                                 AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         5.16.2.2.2.1. Update the quantity field to reflect the actual receipt quantity. If
         complete cancellation is processed, then enter zero.
         5.16.2.2.2.2. Enter the cancellation quantity in the Cancel Quantity field. If
         complete cancellation, this will equal the total due-in quantity.
         5.16.2.2.2.3. Place a check in the Process box and click‖ Process Receipts‖
         located on the vertical toolbar. Disregard the PLT field.
         5.16.2.2.2.4. For complete cancellations, DMLSS generates a DQC transaction
         with status code BQ.
         5.16.2.2.2.5. For partial cancellations, DMLSS generates a DQC transaction with
         status code BJ.
      5.16.2.2.3. Receipt Discrepancies.
         5.16.2.2.3.1. Process discrepant receipts from the Process Receipts tab. DMLSS
         uses the transaction quantity, receipt document quantity, current due-in quantity,
         and total price to determine if the receipt is complete or partial and if the
         discrepancy is a consequential or inconsequential overage or shortage. The DLA
         Consequential Discrepancy dollar amount is documented in the Computations tab
         of the MM Service detail record located within SS. This dollar value defaults to
         $100 and should not be modified unless otherwise directed by higher
         headquarters.
         5.16.2.2.3.2. Discrepancies cannot be processed against PV SOS type code DPV
         or VPV items within DMLSS. The Prime Vendor Discrepancy process will be
         managed within the DMMONLINE web portal application.
         5.16.2.2.3.3. Consequential Overages. If the overage quantity meets the
         consequential dollar value for the SOS, DMLSS generates a RND transaction for
         the overage quantity. The RND records to Transaction History, appends the
         inventory balance, and generates an additional receipt/claims record so DFAS will
         process payment to the vendor.
         5.16.2.2.3.4. Consequential Shortages. If the shortage quantity meets the
         consequential dollar value for the SOS, DMLSS generates a DQC for the shortage
         quantity. The DQC records to Transaction History and notifies DFAS of the
         shortage. DFAS will either short pay the bill or obtain credit if payment was
         already submitted.
         5.16.2.2.3.5. For consequential discrepancies, DMLSS assigns Medical Materiel
         Advice Code (MMAC) ―BH‖ for discrepancies attributable to the shipper or
         MMAC ―BJ‖ for discrepancies attributable to the carrier.
         5.16.2.2.3.6. Inconsequential Overages. For inconsequential overages, DMLSS
         generates a complete receipt and a SDG transaction. The SDG records to
         Transaction History and appends inventory balance records. The gain transaction
         is passed to Finance and updates inventory value data but it does not generate a
         claims payable record.
         5.16.2.2.3.7. Inconsequential Shortages.    If the shortage is inconsequential,
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               183


          DMLSS generates a complete receipt and a SDL transaction. The SDL records to
          Transaction History and passes to Finance to update inventory values.
          5.16.2.2.3.8. For inconsequential discrepancies, DMLSS assigns MMAC code
          ―BK‖ for a Notes code ―R‖ item and MMAC code ―BL‖ for all other items.
          5.16.2.2.3.9. Linked Due-Outs. If the discrepancy involves a shortage for a due-
          in that is linked to a current FY due-out, DMLSS generates a due-out cancellation
          (IOC) transaction reversal for the DQC or SDL transaction quantity. If it is linked
          to a PFY due-out, the link is broken and the PFY due-out is maintained.
       5.16.2.2.4. Receipt of Substitutes.
          5.16.2.2.4.1. Periodically, the vendor will ship a substitute item in place of the
          requested (prime) item. When this happens, process the receipt using the
          Substitute icon located on the vertical toolbar within the Process Receipts tab.
          Note: A catalog record and P/S relationship must exist within DMLSS before a
          receipt of substitute can be processed.
          5.16.2.2.4.2. To create a P/S relationship, click the ―Jump To‖ button next to the
          Substitute field. Under the New tab, enter the substitute item ID and adjusted
          ratio if required. After saving the record, return to the Receipts module and
          follow the procedures for processing a substitute.
          5.16.2.2.4.3. Use the original document number to access the due-in detail record
          for the requested item ID. Highlight the record that needs to be processed, and
          then select ―Substitute.‖ The system displays all associated substitutes. This field
          will be blank if no substitutes exist.
          5.16.2.2.4.4. Select the substitute item and click the checkbox in the Substitute
          field. Enter the price of the substitute item into the price field, check the Process
          box, and then click ―Process located on the vertical toolbar. A RRD is generated
          using the prime item ID documented in the original due-in detail record. The
          RRD is forwarded to Finance for processing. The substitute item ID is recorded
          in Transaction History. If the price was changed, DMLSS generates a PDI
          transaction prior to processing the RDD. The PDI is also recorded in Transaction
          History.
          5.16.2.2.4.5. The substitute item ID is written to the Receipts Backorder Release
          Report. The Delivery List from LOG to the customer identifies the backorder
          release against the prime item ID, but reflects an issue against the substitute item
          ID.
       5.16.2.2.5. Receipt Reversal. Receipts processed in error can be reversed in the IM
       Transaction History module. To reverse a receipt, enter the document number and
       click ―Search.‖ To narrow the search, select additional data to search (i.e. transaction
       type, user ID, item ID, and to and from transaction dates). Select the appropriate
       receipt transaction and click ―Reverse.‖ Enter the reversal quantity and click ―OK.‖
       The system reverses all associated transactions (backorder release issues) and then
       reverses the original receipt. Upon completion, the original due-in(s) and due-out(s)
184                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         are recreated. Reversal transactions are recorded in Transaction History and contain a
         red ―X‖ in the Reversal Transaction (Rev Txn) box.
         5.16.2.2.6. Price Corrections. When receipts are processed at the wrong price use the
         Price Correction function located in IM Transaction History to process price
         corrections. Search for the receipt document number to access the record. To narrow
         the search, select additional data to search (i.e. transaction type, user ID, Item ID, and
         to and from transaction dates). Select the receipt and click the ―Correction‖ icon.
         Enter the correct price in the price correction field and click ―OK.‖ DMLSS
         generates a PDI transaction and increases or decreases the original receipt price. The
         system also updates the price for all associated issues. Additionally, the price of the
         MTF Catalog record is updated to reflect the current price.
      5.16.2.3. Prime Vendor Receipts.
         5.16.2.3.1. Upon processing a PV receipt, an EDI 861, receipt confirmation, is
         generated and passed to Finance for processing payment. This occurs for both stock
         funded and credit orders and does reflect partial quantities. The receipt confirmation
         contains the line item document number and CLIN.
         5.16.2.3.2. In addition to the 861, DMLSS will pass a Materiel Receipt
         Acknowledgement (527R) to DLA. The 527R is not passed until the DMLSS receipt
         and three EOD cycles have processed, allowing sufficient time for corrective actions.
         When the receipt is complete (no partials pending) a 527R is submitted to DLA with
         a ‗final indicator.‘
         5.16.2.3.3. The due-in status price for PV items cannot be changed once the EDI 855,
         order confirmation, is processed in DMLSS. Bases should not utilize the vendor
         ―Packing slip‖ to obtain pricing as that information excludes the designated cost
         recovery rate and distribution fees associated with the MTF and contract. To change
         the price, obtain a Price Control Number (PCN) from DLA Troop Support and load
         that number into DMLSS. Once loaded, the due-in status price can be updated.
         5.16.2.3.4. Quantity adjustments are allowed (receipt reversals and cancellations)
         until the Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement (527R) is generated. Once the receipt
         and three EODs have passed, no adjustments are allowed.
         5.16.2.3.5. Manage Return Authorization. Utilize the ―Return Auth‖ modal window
         (Figure 5.37.) to enter information regarding a discrepancy or request for return. For
         example, the Prime Vendor‘s distribution center pulled the wrong item or NDC, and
         you are attempting to secure an exchange for the materiel.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               185


Figure 5.37. Return Authorization Modal Window.




            5.16.2.3.5.1. DMLSS 3.1.2 provides users the ability to enter a Return
            Authorization Number and a Materiel Disposition Description to document items
            returned to the PV. The Return Authorization Number is provided by the PV and
            used as a reference if there are short payments to the vendor that are disputed and
            by the customer to keep track of material that has been returned due to
            discrepancies, overages, etc.
            5.16.2.3.5.2. Upon processing the item receipt, DMLSS will generate an Manage
            Return Authorization (MRA) transaction. Users can view the return authorization
            number and materiel disposition in the transaction history.
         5.16.2.3.6. Price Verification.
            5.16.2.3.6.1. Real-time price verification is an automated process for all
            medical/surgical (PVM) requisitions. This process occurs upon receipt of a PV
            purchase order confirmation (EDI 855). After the EDI 855 is received, DMLSS
            transmits an automatic transmission price challenge to DLA Troop Support via
            the Price Lookup Web Service (PLWS). The results of the PLWS lookup are
            recorded in the due-in detail and displayed in the status tab with a status code of
            ―PV‖ for Price Verified, or ―PF‖ for Price Verification Failed (Figure 5.38.).
            Users cannot process price changes on a due-in after receipt of the EDI 855.

              5.16.2.3.6.2. Pharmaceutical (PVP) inquiries are currently handled manually via
              email and phone communication.
       5.16.2.4. Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) Interface – WAWF is a secure web-based
       system used for electronic invoicing, receipt, and acceptance. It allows government
       contractors and authorized DoD personnel to generate, capture and process receipt and
       payment-related documentation. DMLSS 3.1.2. establishes an electronic interface with
       WAWF that displays shipment information and allows the user to verify receipt of
       materiel. The interface then uses PKI to electronically bind the digital signature and
       provide proof that the user (electronically) signed the document with the contents. This
       applies to SOS types: BPA, CON, DPV, ECA, RPV, and VPV.
          5.16.2.4.1. Advance Shipping Notice. DMLSS receives an EDI 856 file from
          WAWF containing information provided by the vendor. This file will provide
          shipping status information to include inbound passive RFID and UID. The due-in
          details will show the shipment status receipt and it will update the due-in status price
          for all SOS types excluding DPV. The purchase order must be loaded in the due-in
          detail for CON orders so the EDI 856 will associate to the due-in detail record.
          5.16.2.4.2. Receipt Process. DMLSS displays shipment information such as
          shipment number and Item Unique Identification Data (IUID) to allow the user to
          verify receipt of materiel. The user is required to select the Process box for
          applicable Shipment ID received. DMLSS will display a modal window asking ―Are
          you acknowledging receipt and acceptance for the item(s) selected?‖ (Figure 5.39.).
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 187


Figure 5.39. IM Receipt Search Window.




           5.16.2.4.3. Receipt Acceptance. Upon physical receipt/acceptance of the item,
           DMLSS generates a Receipt Acceptance (EDI 861) to WAWF in addition to the
           Receipt (EDI 527) to DLA Troop Support Medical for SOS types DPV, ECA, and
           DLA. The Receipt Acceptance contains the user‘s POC information to include name,
           phone number, e-mail address, and user ID in the receipt financial file. Note: It is
           important this information is entered correctly into the User Information screen. This
           file completes the receipt/acceptance steps in WAWF. WAWF then combines the
           invoice with the receipt notification and sends them to DFAS for payment.
5.17. IM Summary Receipt Pending. The EDI 527R can be manually processed prior to the
third EOD cycle using the IM Summary Receipt Pending function; however, this action is not
recommended because DMLSS will populate a ―BSM transaction date‖ during the next EOD
cycle in all RRD or DQC transactions linked to the particular call. Once the BSM transaction
date populates, DMLSS prohibits users from reversing the transaction. Highlight the call
number and click the ―Process‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to generate the 527R. This
process marks the ―final indicator‖ in the record so the EOD DFAS process will read and send
the receipts and cancellations to EBS. As previously stated, once processed, reversals and
cancellations are prohibited.
5.18. Delivery List.
   5.18.1. Print Delivery List(s) after all issues are processed. DMLSS generates Delivery
   List(s) for LOG backorder releases resulting from receipts and as a result confirmed picklists
   (paragraph 5.15.4.). This list identifies item(s) that need to be pulled from LOG inventory
   and delivered to customers. Printing a Delivery List updates the customer‘s EOH quantities.
   5.18.2. Select a customer and click ―Process‖ to print a Delivery List. When the message
   ―Would you like to print the selected Delivery Lists?‖ appears, click ―Yes‖ to access the
   Print Selection window. The Delivery List is defaulted to print all issues. Select ―CIIC R
   and Q‖ to obtain a separate Delivery List for controlled substances or select ―Other than CIIC
 188                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   R and Q‖ to obtain a Delivery List for all items except controlled substances. Click ―OK‖ to
   return to the Print Delivery List window.
5.19. Reprint Delivery List. Occasionally, additional copies of a Delivery List are required or
the original was misplaced. Use the Reprint Delivery List function to obtain additional copies of
Delivery List(s). Once the window opens, identify the customer ID and either Delivery List
(routine) or Non-routine Delivery List. The system displays orders by delivery order number.
Select the Delivery List(s) to reprint and click ―Print‖ located on the vertical toolbar. Click
―Close‖ to exit window.
5.20. Transaction History.
   5.20.1. DMLSS maintains 24 months of historical data within the Transaction History
   module. Transaction History serves as an audit trail and is accessible at anytime and is
   maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 09.00. Corrective actions and transaction reversals are
   also accomplished within Transaction History. To conduct a search, enter search criteria in
   the Generic Search tab. The search scope defaults to ALL, but can be changed to IM, AM,
   CAIM, or IM/AM combined. Enter as much search criteria as possible to minimize search
   results and processing time. Broad searches take longer and result in maximum search
   results. DMLSS limits search criteria to 2000 records; however, users may reduce the
   number of search records as needed. A typical function of the Transaction History module
   includes conducting a daily review of transactions. All of the processed transactions are
   included in the Transaction History. However, the only reversible transactions are backorder
   release issues, destructions, shipping discrepancy gains and losses, turn-in adjustment gains
   and losses, inventory adjustment gains and losses, specific types of issues, and specific types
   of receipts.
   5.20.2. Price Corrections.
       5.20.2.1. Periodically, transactions are processed using an incorrect price. When this
       happens, use the Price Correction option located on the vertical toolbar to correct the
       transaction price. The icon is not available and ―grayed out‖ if the transaction price
       cannot be corrected.
       5.20.2.2. To perform a price correction, search for the transaction using the document
       number or other available data. The search results automatically display in the Search
       Summary Results tab. Select the transaction to correct from the bottom half of the Search
       Summary Results tab and click ―Correction.‖
       5.20.2.3. Enter the correct price in the Price Correction window and click ―OK.‖
       DMLSS automatically processes reversals for this transaction and all spawned
       transactions that were processed at the incorrect price; then processes the exact same
       transactions at the correct price using the same document numbers.
       5.20.2.4. If the price entered into the Price Correction window is different than the
       current MTF Catalog price, users will receive the following message: ―Price has been
       corrected for this transaction and all related transactions. The new price is different than
       the current catalog price. Do you want to change the catalog price? Yes/No.‖ If ―Yes‖
       is selected, DMLSS changes the MTF Catalog price and recalculates the serviceable
       inventory value to reflect this change. All price corrections are passed to Finance.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   189


   5.20.3. Reversals.
      5.20.3.1. Sometimes transactions are processed in error. When this happens, use the
      Reversal function located in Transaction History to process corrective actions.
      Reversible transactions include backorder release issues, destructions, shipping
      discrepancy gains and losses, turn-in adjustment gains and losses, inventory adjustment
      gains and losses, specific types of issues, and specific types of receipts.
      5.20.3.2. Enter search criteria into the Generic Search tab. The search results
      automatically display on the Search Summary Results tab. In the bottom half of the
      Search Summary Results tab, select the transaction to reverse. Click ―Reverse‖ located
      on the vertical toolbar and the system displays the Transaction Reversal Quantity
      window. Enter the reversal quantity in this field. The reversal quantity must be equal to
      or less than the original quantity. If a previous reversal has been processed for a partial
      quantity, the total of both reversals must be equal to or less than the original transaction
      quantity. Click ―OK‖ to process the reversal and return to the Transaction Reversal
      Quantity window. Verify the correct quantity was reversed.
      5.20.3.3. DMLSS identifies reversed transactions by placing a red ―X‖ in the Rev Txn
      checkbox. For receipts and backorder releases, the reversed transactions and quantities
      repopulate the Due-in/Due-out file using the original document number.
   5.20.4. Archive Management. Use the Archive Management application to research
   historical transactions that are more than 24 months old. Users must have the ―ARC
   Transaction History‖ role assigned to their user ID to gain access to this function. The search
   window in Archive Management is identical to IM Transaction History.
5.21. QA.
   5.21.1. Procedures. Procedures for processing QA records are outlined in Chapter 9 of AFI
   41-209. QA messages are automatically downloaded from the JMAR website via Medical
   Materiel Quality Control (MMQC) to the DMLSS server. Notifications of new QA messages
   are posted in the IM Inbox. These messages should be worked the day they arrive to ensure
   prompt actions to message resolution.
   5.21.2. Submitting a New QA Complaint.
      5.21.2.1. The New QA Complaint process is used by DMLSS customers to build new
      complaint detail(s) and submit Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDR) when there is
      a quality deficiency with a medical product. It is also the vehicle for submitting Safe
      Medical Device (SMD) incidents. Examples of discrepancies, which should be reported
      on the PQDR, are:
            5.21.2.1.1. Wrong or deficient labeling.
            5.21.2.1.2. Foreign or particulate matter in liquids and solids.
            5.21.2.1.3. Imperfectly manufactured items that are off-color, off-taste, and off-odor.
            5.21.2.1.4. Suspected sub-potency or super-potency.
            5.21.2.1.5. Defective devices.
            5.21.2.1.6. Pinholes in tubing.

          5.21.2.1.7. Faulty calibrations.
          5.21.2.1.8. Systemic equipment failures.
          5.21.2.1.9. Poor quality products.
       5.21.2.2. PQDRs are submitted as either category I or II. FDA defines these categories.
       See AFI 41-209 for their descriptions and reporting procedures.
       5.21.2.3. In DMLSS/IM Navigate menu, select ―QA‖ and then ―New QA Complaint‖ to
       access the Create New Complaint window (Figure 5.40.). Select the appropriate
       Complaint Type (I or II). If type I is selected, a message appears instructing the user to
       contact DLA Troop Support immediately. In addition, the Type I Complaint Detail tab is
       activated and requires additional patient reaction data. Note: Do not use ―Type III‖
       complaint type in the New QA Complaint process. This category is not used in the
       PQDR process.

Figure 5.40. Create New Complaint.




       5.21.2.4. Enter applicable data into the remaining mandatory data fields. If possible, the
       optional data fields should also be completed. When the item ID is entered, the item
       description and MFG‘s data automatically populates if the information is stored in
       DMLSS.
       5.21.2.5. To identify potential DoD Requisition Numbers, click the ―Search‖ button next
       to the data field. Requisition data corresponding to the specified item ID is displayed in
       the Select DoD Requisition Number window. Highlight the applicable requisition and
       click ―OK‖ to populate the DoD Requisition Number field.
       5.21.2.6. It is very important to identify OH quantities at this time. Serviceable LOG
       inventory quantities must be suspended to prevent issue. Affected materiel stored in
       customer areas must be retrieved. Utilize the Navigate\Return Item module to process a
       Turn-In Gain for no credit to Strat State OPR/SUS for each customer possessing the
       affected materiel. Enter the total quantity OH and total quantity suspended. These
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 191


     quantities do not necessarily match because you may have OH quantities that do not meet
     the complaint criteria, i.e. different lot number.
     5.21.2.7. Click ―Save‖ after entering the applicable data. Upon saving, the message
     ―Please submit the complaint on-line by selecting the QAC link button" is displayed. The
     ―QAC Link‖ button connects the user with the DMMONLINE web page for online
     reporting instructions and submittal of the electronic Standard Form (SF) 368, Product
     Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR). Note: Submit an online SF 368 via DMMONLINE
     rather than using the obsolete SF380, Reporting And Processing Medical Materiel
     Complaints/Quality Improvement Report link available in DMLSS.
     5.21.2.8. Customer OH balances are available by clicking ―CAIM Balance.‖ The
     message ―No Balance Exists for Item ID xxx‖ is displayed when no customer balances
     exist.
     5.21.2.9. All new QA complaints immediately appear in the IM QA Complaint Alert.
     Complaint Exists for Items pending action. If not already accomplished, report the
     complaint at this time. When the materiel complaint has been rectified, notify the Patient
     Safety Officer and/or Risk Manager and enter a close reason and close date in the
     Complaint Detail tab. Click ―Save,‖ then ―Close,‖ and the complaint is removed from
     the pending action.
  5.21.3. QA Complaint Search. Use the QA Complaint Search function to search and retrieve
  existing complaint data. Click ―Search‖ to process an all inclusive search or enter search
  criteria to limit the search results. QA complaints matching the search criteria will appear in
  the Search Results window. A records detailed data can be viewed by either double clicking
  on the record or by highlighting the record and selecting ―Detail‖ on the vertical toolbar.
  Once the QA Complaint details are displayed, the close date and close reason can be
  modified as well as the name of the person initiating the complaint.
  5.21.4. New QA Record.
     5.21.4.1. Use the New QA Record function to add/load a new record into DMLSS for
     processing. The item description, QA reference number, class, and QA source are
     mandatory fields and must be completed to add a new record. Additional information,
     such as the item ID, should be completed, if known. Once added to DMLSS, the record
     can be routed through the DMLSS notification process in the same manner as the
     automated QA notifications.
     5.21.4.2. DMLSS provides two methods of QA notification and distribution of new
     messages. These methods are automatic and manual. DMLSS is designed to download
     QA messages automatically from USAMMA and update the DMLSS system.
     5.21.4.3. Automatic. When QA messages are downloaded to the DMLSS server,
     DMLSS checks the MTF and Customer Catalog records to determine whether or not any
     users have used the item associated with the QA message. New QA messages are posted
     to the IM Inbox for LOG review. Any customers associated to the products are identified
     in the QA Details tab. The customer receives notification of the QA message in the
     CAIM Inbox.
192                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      5.21.4.4. Manual. In some cases, QA data may need to be loaded manually. Instances
      might occur when a QA message is initiated in your facility or when items are not
      updated in DMLSS from the automatic transfer.
      5.21.4.5. From the Navigate menu, point to QA and click ―New QA Record.‖ The QA
      Record (New) window appears with Supply as the default type of search. Select an item
      ID from the dropdown list. When selected, the Item Description field is automatically
      populated.
      5.21.4.6. Complete all required fields (fields with red dots), or select data from the
      dropdown list. Add or edit lot numbers, as desired. After all information is added click
      ―Save.‖
      5.21.4.7. At the message prompt, click ―OK.‖ The reference information appears in the
      bottom-half of the window. Note: You can double-click on the record(s) to view the
      details of the customer‘s quantities, and add the record(s) to additional customers.
  5.21.5. QA Search.
      5.21.5.1. QA Search allows users to search for all QA records in the DMLSS database.
      When a supply or equipment item is identified as defective, the QA Record Search
      window displays all of the QA message information. For supply items, DMLSS
      identifies all internal or external customer accounts having consumption history and
      WRM accounts that have an OH balance or due-in for the item. It also allows logistics
      personnel to select any additional customer accounts or WRM accounts that should
      receive pending action notifications for the item. For equipment items, DMLSS
      identifies all equipment accounts and WRM accounts that have the item and allows
      maintenance personnel to select any additional equipment accounts or WRM accounts
      that should receive pending action notifications for the item. DMLSS associates all
      system identified and selected customer accounts, WRM accounts, and equipment
      accounts with the QA Notice in the QA Customer record so that subsequent actions may
      be tracked and recorded.
      5.21.5.2. From the Navigate menu, point to QA and then click ―QA Search‖ to access
      this module. Select the commodity type of supply or equipment, or leave blank to search
      both types. Select search criteria from one of the available dropdown lists or enter the
      data manually. At least one field must be populated to conduct a search.
      5.21.5.3. If the Reject Ind is ―Yes,‖ the search will only return DoD MMQC records that
      do not match catalog records. If the ―Reject Ind‖ is ―No,‖ the search will only return
      MMQC records that do match catalog records.
      5.21.5.4. The QA Record Search window (Figure 5.41.) will display the search results in
      the QA Record tab. Additional information from the original QA message along with
      associated customers and assemblages is available in the QA Details tab.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              193


Figure 5.41. QA Record Search.




      5.21.5.5. Adding a Customer to a QA Record.
         5.21.5.5.1. As stated earlier, when DMLSS downloads the QA message, it compares
         the item ID, NDC, MFG Cat number, etc. from the QA message to those in the MTF
         and Customer Catalog records. Pending action notification is sent to all customers
         with prior usage recorded. In some instances, the QA notification may need to be
         forwarded to additional customers that were not identified during the electronic
         review. Users can add additional customers to the QA message notification by
         clicking the ―Add Customer‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar and then entering
         the required information.
         5.21.5.5.2. Open the applicable QA message. The ―Add Customer‖ icon is located in
         the QA Record Search module, QA Record tab. A pop-up window displays a list of
         all customers loaded in DMLSS. Select customer ID(s) that are being added to the
         notification list.
         5.21.5.5.3. Upon saving, the selected customer ID(s) are added to the QA Details tab.
         DMLSS forwards a pending action notification to each customer selected.

          click ―Close‖ to return to the QA Record Search window. Use the Pick/Delivery list
          to relocate the affected assets.
       5.21.5.9. Completing QA Message Actions. QA messages should be closed out when all
       associated actions are complete. This action must be coordinated with the MTF Patient
       Safety Officer and/or Risk Manager. Within QA Search, locate the applicable MMQC
       message. Click ―Apply Date‖ located next to the Completed Date Field. The Completed
       Date Field is populated with the current date. Select ―Save‖ to apply the date to the
       MMQC message and finalize the process.
   5.21.6. QA Class Maintenance.
       5.21.6.1. Editing the QA Notification Class window enables users to change the number
       of days before issuing delinquency notice, or the number of days before a delinquency
       notice must be posted to LOG. Figure 5.42. is an excerpt of the QA Notification Class
       window and shows the fields that can be modified.

Figure 5.42. QA Notification Class.




       5.21.6.2. To access the QA Notification Class window, select ―QA‖ from the Navigate
       menu; and then ―QA Class Maintenance.‖
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 195


       5.21.6.3. The ―Delinquency Notice (Days)‖ column identifies the time frame the system
       will use to post a delinquent notice to the customer. The ―Delinquent Notice (LOG)
       (Days)‖ column represents the time frame used to post a delinquent notice in the IM
       Inbox (or LOG). The delinquent days must be updated to a maximum of 1, 5, and 5 days
       respectively for class I, II, and III.
       5.21.6.4. Click ―Save‖ to exit the window and apply modified values.
5.22. Transportation. This option provides outshipment and inshipment search screens from
the Distribution and Transportation Module (D&TM) that allow users to track all or selected
shipments and send advance shipment notices to gaining bases. IM users can process
transactions requiring DRMO, Return to Source of Supply, Return Item for Trade-In, regular loss
transactions, process Issues, Reachback orders, and process Excess type shipments that will be
tracked within the D&TM module. See Attachment 4, DMLSS Distribution and Transportation
Module, for additional instruction.
5.23. Return Item.
   5.23.1. The Return Item window allows customers to return stock no longer required,
   unserviceable, suspended, or overstocked from an item location to the LOG. CAIM does not
   allow returns to external sources. Before processing, a determination must be made whether
   to allow credit to the end user. Medical materiel personnel must also determine if the items
   consumption history will be reduced and whether the Svc/Customer is considered an
   ―Internal‖ or an ―External‖ type customer. DMLSS does not allow a user to process a
   customer turn-in from a customer type of ―Spoke.‖
   5.23.2. If credit will be given for the return item, check the ―Issue Credit‖ checkbox. Return
   transactions are posted to the Transaction History module. A TIL transaction is generated for
   the customer area losing/returning and a TIG transaction is generated for LOG.
   5.23.3. Acceptable equivalents are items associated with a P/S relationship. A checkmark in
   this checkbox indicates that the item is the equivalent of an item currently existing in the
   MTF catalog. If the P/S relationship is not established, go to the MTF catalog to establish
   the P/S relationship. During processing, the item is added to the LOG inventory as the sub
   item but is identified to customers as the prime item.
   5.23.4. Effect of Returns on Issue Consumption.
       5.23.4.1. For supply items, the demand code determines if issue consumption should be
       reduced. If the ―Reduce Demand‖ checkbox is checked, DMLSS generates a CHZ
       transaction with demand code of ―R‖ to reduce current month issue consumption by the
       quantity of the transaction. DMLSS reduces current month consumption to zero if it is
       less than the transaction quantity. If the Reduce Demand checkbox is not checked,
       DMLSS generates a CHZ (consumption history) transaction with demand code ―N.‖
       Issue consumption is not reduced. Turn-in of equipment does not affect issue
       consumption.
       5.23.4.2. To process an item return, select the Navigate menu and click ―Return Item‖ to
       view the Return Item window. Enter all required information in the From box in the
       window. Entering the customer ID will automatically populate the expense center field.
       Entering the item ID will populate the TO box and automatically populate required fields
 196                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       with default data. Within the TO box, the Strat Type, Strat State, and Storage Area
       should be reviewed and modified as necessary.
       5.23.4.3. Select a reason for the return from the dropdown box. More information can be
       entered in the reason box after selecting a reason, if required. After information is
       entered click ―Save‖ to process. Users have the option of printing a return document.
5.24. Internal Transfer.
   5.24.1. The Internal Transfer process allows users to restratify assets internally from one
   stratification state to another. Examples include OPR/SER to OPR/SUS, or OPR/SER to
   WRM/SER. DMLSS generates both an ITG and ITL when an internal transfer is processed.
   DMLSS simultaneously writes the ITG and ITL to Transaction History.
   5.24.2. From the Navigate menu, select ―Internal Transfer‖ to access the Internal Transfer
   window. Enter an item ID or select one from the dropdown list. Depending on the item ID
   entered, various fields will be populated with default catalog data associated to the item ID.
   5.24.3. In the From section, use the dropdown menus to select the stratification state the item
   is being transferred from. In the ―To‖ section, use the dropdown menus to select the
   stratification state the item is being transferred to. If there is no location ID associated with
   the item being transferred, click the ―Jump To‖ button and add a location for the item.
   5.24.4. Enter the transfer quantity and click ―Save.‖ The transfer quantity must be less than
   or equal to the available quantity. After processing, users have the option to print a delivery
   list. The delivery list can be used to relocate the assets from the old storage location to the
   new location.
5.25. Status Edits. The Log Status Edits window displays requisition status messages received
from suppliers that electronically interface with DMLSS. From the Navigate menu, select
―Status Edits‖ to access these records. Status edits also appear in the IM pending action named
IM Status Edits Report and are maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 02.00. These status
messages are classified into the following three groups:
   5.25.1. Part 1 – Errors Tab.
       5.25.1.1. Unrecognized status codes/messages are displayed in Part 1, Errors tab. In the
       bottom section of the window, highlight an item to review. Requisition data for the
       highlighted item appears in the top section of the window.
       5.25.1.2. When cancellation status is received from a DPV or VPV source, a list of
       suitable substitutes is displayed in the PV Available Alternatives Report. Review this
       with a pharmacy representative and determine whether a suitable substitute will satisfy
       their requirement.
       5.25.1.3. Status messages can be deleted once they have been reviewed and appropriate
       action has been taken. Highlight the record(s) to be deleted, and click ―Delete‖ located
       on the vertical toolbar.
   5.25.2. Part 2 – Awaiting Review Tab.
       5.25.2.1. Records appear in the Part 2, Awaiting Review tab when requisition status is
       received and requires manual intervention. In the bottom section of the window,
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  197


       highlight an item to review. Requisition data for the highlighted item appears in the top
       section of the window to include the status description (reason for delay).
       5.25.2.2. Review and process these messages to update the Due-in Detail record
       accordingly. Once processed, the message is removed from this tab. The status
       code/message dictates what information is required for processing. Upon entering the
       required data, click ―OK.‖
       5.25.2.3. Status messages can be deleted once they have been reviewed and appropriate
       action has been taken. Highlight the record(s) to be deleted, and click ―Delete‖ located
       on the vertical toolbar.
   5.25.3. Part 3 – Processed Tab.
       5.25.3.1. Requisition status that was received and automatically processed is displayed in
       this tab for a total period of 7 days. In the bottom section of the window, highlight an
       item to review. Requisition data for the highlighted item appears in the top section of the
       window to include the status description.
       5.25.3.2. Delete status messages after review. Highlight the record(s) to be deleted and
       click ―Delete‖ located on the vertical toolbar.
5.26. Standard Report. A list of available IM standard reports can be accessed by selecting
―Standard Report‖ from the Navigate menu or by selecting the ―Reports‖ icon located on the
horizontal toolbar. Refer to Chapter 13, Reports, for a brief description of each report in
DMLSS along with its content and use.
5.27. Reprinting Asset Relocation Delivery List.
   5.27.1. Use the Reprint Asset Relocation Delivery List function to view and/or reprint any
   delivery list produced because of asset restratification changes that were processed within the
   past 30 days. To open the window, select ―Reprint Asset Relocation Delivery List‖ from the
   Navigate menu.
   5.27.2. To search for a delivery list, enter the ORG ID and the ―From‖ and ―To‖ dates and
   then click ―Search‖ located on the vertical toolbar. All delivery lists meeting the search
   criteria are displayed in the Deliveries window. Double-click the delivery number to screen
   a delivery list prior to printing. Details of the delivery list appear in the Delivery Detail
   window. Click ―Print‖ on the vertical toolbar to print the report.
5.28. Reachback.
   5.28.1. Reachback Scope. DMLSS functionality allows an organization to act in the
   capacity of a Reachback host furnishing medical materiel to supported customers either
   inside or outside of their geographic region. In order for DMLSS to act as the ―Host‖
   Reachback organization, the ―Reachback Enabled‖ indicator in System Services/MM Service
   Detail must be checked.
   5.28.2. Reachback Ordering. Svc/Customers requiring reachback support must be first
   established as a reachback customer. The Reachback Customer indicator (SS\Svc Customer
   Detail) has to be checked in order for the customer to qualify. Reachback customers have
   two avenues for submitting requisitions. The first and most widely used option, is to load
   their requirements into the TLAMM Reachback website accessible through the AFML
 198                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   website by clicking the ―Readiness tab‖ and then clicking ―Applications.‖ Customers have
   the ability to enter requirements on a shopping guide tailored to their specific mission needs.
   Once quantities are entered, the host reachback site may import orders directly into DMLSS
   from this website. The other option is to email requisitions (in MILSTRIP) format directly to
   the Reachback host.
   5.28.3. Reachback Order Import Process. DMLSS users should save the reachback
   customer order file into a location which is easily accessible by all users (i.e., shard drive).
   The file should be renamed with a .txt extension (Example: FM6943FEB152011.txt.).
   DMLSS is coded to only allow a single import of a specific file name and thus alleviates
   duplication.
       5.28.3.1. Once the file has been saved in the folder or drive, click on
       ―Navigate\Orders\External Customer Import.‖ The Import External AOA files screen
       appears (Figure 5.43.). At the top of the screen, click on the small button containing
       three dots (…). Next, select the drive and or folder where the reachback customer order
       file resides. Once you have located the file, highlight it and click ―Open.‖ The path
       populates at the top of the screen. Click the ―Add‖ button located on the vertical toolbar.
       This moves your file from the top of the screen to the ―Selected Files for Import‖ section.
       Finally, click the ―Process‖ button on the vertical toolbar.

Figure 5.43. Import External AOA Files Window.




       5.28.3.2. DMLSS displays a ―Customer Import Message was successful‖ if the file was
       properly constructed. Close the module when complete. In order to confirm if the file
       was successfully imported, launch the ―DCM Monitor‖ module within System Services.
       The most recent DMLSS inbound files appear at the upper portion of the screen. Look
       for any file(s) which contain a contract number heading of ―FROM-EXTERNAL.‖ If the
       Process Code indicates ―FMTGOOD,‖ then DMLSS was able to decipher the requisition
       data. If the Process Code indicates something else (i.e., ―FMTFAIL‖), then the file is
       probably not formatted properly. Contact the MHS Service Desk for assistance.
   5.28.4. IM Reachback Pending Actions.
       5.28.4.1. IM Reachback Customers Error/Review Processing. Review this pending
       action to determine if the customers requisition(s) requires further action prior to
       processing. For example, DMLSS will prohibit a user from completing the order process
       if the customer has insufficient funds loaded. Other examples of rejections could include
       a request for a particular item ID that is not loaded in the host MTF catalog. The NSN,
       U/P, Qty Req, Docnum, Supp Addr, Fund Cd, Expense Ctr, Advice Cd, Dmd Cd, Signal
       Cd, and Priority Cd are all editable fields. Once the data has been adjusted, highlight the
       respective row(s) and click ―Process‖ on the vertical toolbar.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                199


      5.28.4.2. IM Reachback Issues Exist for Processing. If the Reachback customer has the
      Reachback Issue indicator selected in their Svc/Customer detail record, DMLSS will
      attempt to fill the requirement first from OPR/SER stock. The DMLSS user filling the
      customer request would process the requirement in the same fashion as regular IM Issues
      (paragraph 5.15).
      5.28.4.3. IM Reachback Log Orders Exist for Processing. DMLSS creates this pending
      action when reachback customers demands are not completely filled and result in a LOG
      due-out. Launching the pending action reveals all SOS‘s which contain requirements.
      Work this pending action in the same fashion as normal LOG Orders.
      5.28.4.4. IM Reachback Customers Delivery List. This pending action is produced when
      the delivery list indicator is unchecked during the processing of a LOG receipt or IM
      Issues to a reachback customer. Highlighting the particular delivery list number and
      processing the delivery list completes the process.
      5.28.4.5. IM Reachback Issue Killed/Partial Order Cancelled. This pending action is
      produced when LOG processes issues for the reachback customer and confirms a quantity
      ―less‖ than the prescribed amount on the Picklist. DMLSS immediately produces an
      inventory exception on the item ID(s) and cancels the partial quantity not filled.
5.29. Hub & Spoke.
   5.29.1. Hub & Spoke Scope. The Hub & Spoke functionality enables a large MTF, within a
   specific geographic region, to directly support a single or multiple ―Spoke‖ customers. The
   spoke customer(s) may or may not also be co-located in the same region. The overarching
   concept of Hub & Spoke, is that the Hub MTF acts a source of supply for the spoke
   customer(s) and conduit for filling items which are not readily available through traditional
   ―E-Commerce‖ commercial vendors such as Pharm or Medsurg Prime Vendors, ECAT, etc.
   Further, Hub & Spoke allows the Hub to order items for the Spoke customer(s) and have the
   materiel delivered directly to the Spoke location.
   5.29.2. Ordering Process (Spoke DMLSS Server). Spoke customers requiring support from
   a Hub location must first build the new SOS on the spoke DMLSS server. The SOS type
   must equal ―HUB.‖ In addition, the SOS code assigned must equal the RIC for the hub‘s
   DODAAC (Example = EFN). MTF catalog records must be updated to reflect the new hub‘s
   SOS value. DMLSS consolidates requirements for the hub SOS within the IM Log Orders
   module and transmits them electronically through DLA Troop Support. DLA Troop Support
   then passes the order files to gaining hub DMLSS server.
   5.29.3. Ordering Process (Hub DMLSS Server). The ―Hub‖ indicator, located in SS\MM
   Service Detail, must be checked in order for the hub to establish spoke customer accounts.
   When establishing the new Spoke Svc/Customer account, check the ―Spoke‖ indicator on the
   ―Basic‖ tab. Check the ―Spoke Issue‖ indicator on the Materiel tab if you want to issue
   items directly to the customer from operating inventory. Spoke customers do not require
   funds. Both spoke and hub bases utilize the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF);
   therefore, all sales from the hub to the spoke base are processed as outshipments and not
   sales.
   5.29.4. IM Hub pending actions and Order Processing.
 200                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       5.29.4.1. Spoke Customers Error/Review Processing. This pending action is produced
       when a new spoke customer requisition is received and there are errors detected on the
       order(s). Examine the error description closely. For example, if the error message
       indicates ―NO RECORD FOUND‖ then the item ID furnished by the spoke customer
       does not match anything within the hub‘s MTF Catalog. Contact the spoke customer and
       attempt to adjust the NSN value manually and then process the request.
       5.29.4.2. IM Spoke Orders. Orders that are successfully formatted (correct item ID, unit
       of purchase, etc.) automatically generate a customer due-in (ESD) transaction. These
       requirements are then forwarded to the IM Issues module where they can be processed
       like any other internal customer demand. Requirements that are not filled with on-hand
       balances are migrated to the IM Log Orders module where they are aligned to the Log
       default SOS for processing. Items which are issued to the customer update IM
       Transportation pending actions.
5.30. DCAM Customer Support.
   5.30.1. DCAM Scope. DMLSS 3.1.1 supports a direct DCAM to DMLSS interface.
   DMLSS allows DCAM customers, at remote locations, to download MTF cataloging
   information each day and then place orders to DMLSS. During the DMLSS EOD cycle, the
   system produces and transmits five separate cataloging files. They will appear within System
   Services\DCM as ―TO-TCAM.‖ These files are placed into a directory which allows DCAM
   users to import the data. DCAM requisitions follow a similar path as ―Reachback‖ orders, as
   they both utilize the same IM Reachback pending action in-box notifications. DMLSS also
   has the capability to pass requisition status to DCAM customers. During routine daily
   processing of DCAM customer requests, DMLSS programmatically writes status based upon
   the outcome of the customer order. These status images are imported into DCAM in the
   same fashion as the MTF cataloging data mentioned above.
   5.30.2. DCAM Ordering. External svc/customers who require DCAM support must be first
   established as a DCAM customer. Both the Reachback Customer and DCAM Customer
   indicators in the System Services\Service Customer Detail need to be checked in order for
   the customer to qualify (Figure 5.44.). DCAM customers transmit requisitions (in
   MILSTRIP format) directly to the host DMLSS server.

Figure 5.44. Service/Customer Detail – DCAM Test.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     201


   5.30.3. IM Reachback Customers Error/Review Processing. Review this pending action to
   determine if the DCAM customer requisition(s) requires further action prior to processing.
   For example, DMLSS will prohibit a user from completing the order process if the expense
   center provided in the requisition does not match the DCAM customers ―default‖ expense
   center loaded in the Svc/Customer detail record. Other examples of rejections could include
   incorrect priority code or a request for a particular item ID that is not loaded in the host MTF
   catalog. Once the data has been adjusted, highlight the respective row(s) and click ―Process‖
   on the vertical toolbar.
   5.30.4. IM Reachback Issues Exist for Processing. If the DCAM customer has the
   Reachback Issue indicator selected in their Svc/Customer detail record, DMLSS attempts to
   fill the requirement from OPR/SER stock first. The DMLSS user filling the customer request
   processes the requirement in the same fashion as regular IM Issues (paragraph 5.15.).
   5.30.5. IM Reachback Log Orders Exist for Processing. DMLSS creates this pending action
   when DCAM customers demands are not completely filled and result in a LOG due-out.
   Launching the pending action reveals all SOS‘s which contain requirements. Work this
   pending action in the same fashion as normal LOG orders.
5.31. Master Ordering Facility (MOF). MOFs may be used to place an order for another site
at any time; however, their use is primarily designed to meet the demands of disaster relief (e.g.,
placing orders for another site due to a natural disaster), to facilitate placement of unusual orders
(e.g., equipment), readiness operations, or to manage sets, kits, and outfit builds. The AF has 10
designated MOFs that include three ANG Consolidated Shipment and Distribution Centers
(CSDCs). These sites are identified as alternate ordering sites for other bases within their region
with the exception of AFMOA/SGALW – the only MOF not restricted by region.
   5.31.1. The establishment of a MOF and its supported customers is determined by Trading
   Partner Contract information stored in the Medical Master Catalog (MMC). This
   information is received during the UDR Delta process and visible in the TMU. Additionally,
   MOF indicators are visible in the MM service detail and customer organization records in
   System Services (SS).
   5.31.2. MOF customer orders are not filled from on-hand stock. They bypass the issue
   process and are processed in LOG orders. An SOS code must be established for each MOF
   PV contract. A MOF SOS code cannot be used as the default SOS code for LOG catalog
   records.
   5.31.3. MOF Customer Orders can be processed within the DMLSS IM application by using
   existing electronic interfaces, external customer import, customer request, or offline order
   processing. MOF sites can issue from on-hand balances using the IM non-routine issue
   (NRI) to fill a MOF‘s customer‘s immediate requirement; however MOF PV contracts are in
   place to meet the demands of the customer. Non-usage (NUS) and drop shipment (DRS) are
   the only delivery methods available for MOF orders.
   5.31.4. With the implementation of the MOF order process, DMLSS the system will send
   the order to the MOF customer‘s primary MOF PV. If the order is cancelled by the primary,
   it is then sent to the MOF customer‘s backup MOF PV. If it is canceled again and the MOF
   and MOF customer are in different regions, the order is sent to the MOF‘s primary MOF PV
   and then to the MOF‘s back up MOF PV. Orders that cannot be filled by the primary(s) or
 202                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   secondary(s) MOF PV contracts will be placed on the IM ―MOF Orders Exist For
   Processing‖ pending action. If the order is cancelled from all available MOF PVs, the system
   will write the MOF customer‘s request to the IM ―MOF Orders Exists for Processing‖
   pending action.
   5.31.5. The PVs are required by MOF contract to provide delivery to locations within the
   Global Region the MOF Contract supports ONLY. For deliveries outside of the Global
   Region the MOF must coordinate transportation arrangements with the PV.
5.32. IM Utilities Menu.
   5.32.1. IM Utilities, Inbox. The IM Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the IM
   module. It can also be viewed by selecting ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities menu. The IM Inbox
   contains many pending actions that are either advisory in nature or require user action.
   DMLSS will automatically remove some action items from pending actions upon processing
   while other advisory notices should be removed or deleted upon review and when no longer
   needed. A detailed list of IM pending actions and their recommended use is available in
   Attachment 5.
   5.32.2. IM Utilities, Maintain Address. DMLSS contains an address table that is linked to
   other modules such as the SOS module. Use the Maintain Address function to add, modify,
   and delete addresses. The ultimate goal is to load and maintain a single address only once.
   Properly managing addresses will eliminate duplicate entries due to misspelling, different
   abbreviations, etc.
   5.32.3. IM Utilities, Maintain Location. DMLSS contains an IM Location table that is
   linked to the location/storage area in the LOG Catalog. The location is used in conjunction
   with the storage area and identifies various locations where OPR inventory may be stored.
   For example, refrigerated materiel may be stored in either the warehouse or the vault. One
   location and storage area combination should be added for each; REFER/WAREHOUSE and
   REFER/VAULT. Once added, both will appear in the location/storage area dropdown menu
   located in the LOG catalog. New location\storage areas may also be added by using the
   ―Jump To‖ button within the LOG Catalog.
   5.32.4. IM Utilities, Maintain POC. Use the Maintain POC function to manage POC data
   entered into DMLSS. Data written to this table comes from different modules such as the
   SOS POC tab, Equipment Custodian information, and the User Info tab located in SS. Use
   this function to maintain a single POC record while eliminating duplicate entries due to
   misspelling, different abbreviations, etc.
   5.32.5. IM Utilities, Override Process. When one person is using a record, the record
   becomes locked to all other users and all other processes. The override process allows that
   record to be unlocked. First, attempt to contact the user who has locked it and ask them to
   exit the record. If the user who has locked the record cannot be reached, users assigned the
   appropriate access rights can unlock the record using the override process.
   5.32.6. IM Utilities, Override CAIM Process. When one person is using a record, the record
   becomes locked to all other users and all other processes. The Override CAIM process
   provides a method to unlock CAIM processes. As stated in the previous paragraph, attempt
   to contact the person using the CAIM process prior to unlocking. When necessary, users
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  203


  assigned the appropriate privileges can use this function to unlock CAIM processes. The
  CAIM Override Process is available in both IM and CAIM.
  5.32.7. IM Utilities, Override Picklist. In the Override Picklist window, users assigned the
  appropriate access rights can override the assignment of a particular user to a picklist. When
  a user is assigned to a picklist, the items in the picklist are locked, until the picklist is
  completed. By overriding the user assignment, another user can complete the picklist.
  5.32.8. IM Utilities, Override Physical Inventory. When a physical inventory is initiated,
  DMLSS locks the included records. The ―Override Physical Inventory‖ option can be used
  to unlock records that are locked for inventory. Use of this option should be limited because
  changes to these records may cause inaccurate inventory outcomes.
  5.32.9. IM Utilities, HHT. The type of HHT being used must be identified within DMLSS.
  To do so, access HHT from the Utilities menu and select ―Janus,‖ PDA, or Trakker. All sites
  should select ―PDA‖ unless otherwise instructed.
  5.32.10. IM Utilities, PDA Order File. The PDA Order File window is used to create a file
  of starter data used to generate PDA orders. The starter file must be created before the PDA
  is used to submit orders to DMLSS and includes the items with which potential orders can be
  created. Use IM to see all item IDs, AM for item IDs associated to a particular assemblage,
  and CAIM to see a specific customer catalog.
  5.32.11. IM Utilities, Customer HAZMAT File. Use this option to create a hazardous
  materials file that may be provided to the BEE staff or other official requesting activity. The
  file is produced in text format and contains the item ID, item description, U/S, issue quantity,
  customer ID, and customer description. This file provides a method of notifying the BEE
  staff of all hazardous material sales.
  5.32.12. IM Utilities, DCAM Local Catalog File. Use this option if your MTF supports an
  external DCAM customer(s) that wish to build a local catalog within DMLSS and download
  that catalog into DCAM.
  5.32.13. IM Utilities, DCAM File Download. During the DMLSS End-of-Day cycle, the
  system creates four individual files (stklst.Z, qcalrt.Z, subs.Z, longnom.Z). These files are
  used as the foundation for building catalog records within DCAM. Use the ―Select all Files‖
  button on the vertical toolbar to mark all files for processing. Click ―Download‖ to
  download the data.
  5.32.14. IM Utilities, Review Usage.
     5.32.14.1. PVP Usage Variance. The PVP Usage Variance process provides a method to
     review current variances outside of the normal monthly review process. This report
     contains historical data and recommends a new usage quantity based upon the last 90
     days use. These calculations are based upon the previously reported usage, actual usage,
     and the variance percentage set within the Contract tab of the PVP SOS record. This
     provides a means to send and update usage quantities to the PV. During the review
     process, take periodic or seasonal requirements into consideration. For example, if you
     had an increased but temporary need for an item, the system would increase your usage
     but you would decrease the number once the need passed. Note: During EOM
     processing, the system generates a pending action to review PVP usage variances. The
204                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      PVP Usage Variance pending action will appear in the IM Inbox for users assigned this
      privilege.
      5.32.14.2. PVM Usage Variance. The PVM Usage Variance process provides the same
      functionality as the PVP process discussed in the previous paragraph. In this case, the
      calculations are based upon the previously reported usage, actual usage, and the variance
      percentage set within the Contract tab of the PVM SOS record. As previously stated,
      DMLSS generates the PVM Usage Variance pending action monthly. The PVM Usage
      Variance pending action will appear in the IM Inbox for users assigned this privilege.
      5.32.14.3. Recurring NUS/NUA. This process produces a report that shows PVM items
      that were ordered three or more times in the previous 90 days. Based upon the recurring
      orders, PVM monitors may wish to change the delivery method from NUS to USE (for
      DPV items) or from NUA to USA (for ACPOP items).
      5.32.14.4. Send Current Usage. This option provides a method to transmit current usage
      data to both pharmaceutical and MED/SURG PVs. When processed, DMLSS creates a
      usage file and transmits that file during EOD processing.
  5.32.15. IM Utilities, PV Reported Usage. Use the PV Reported Usage option to obtain a
  printed usage report for PVM, PVP, or both. This report shows the reported usage quantity
  and the submission date.
  5.32.16. IM Utilities, PV Websites. Use this option to access a vendor‘s website for PVP,
  PVM, ECAT, EMALL, QA, and RIC websites. Highlight a vendor and click ―Go To Web‖
  on the vertical toolbar to access the websites.
  5.32.17. IM Utilities, Change Vendor Item Number. VINs can be updated for multiple
  catalog items in the ―Change Vendor Item Number‖ window. This task is only performed by
  LOG and is usually a onetime function, performed the night before changing PVs. The
  following tasks are performed within this option: Change VINs, print VIN Conversion
  Reports, view VIN Conversion Reports, and change VIN for Gen III.
  5.32.18. IM Utilities, Calculate Fill Rate. This option is no longer in use. Note: Under
  GEN IV contracts, DLA Troop Support will use DMLSS-Wholesale (DMLSS-W)
  applications to calculate and make contractual fill-rates available. During GEN IV-Phase 1,
  DMLSS-Retail (DMLSS-R) will not display the fill rate to users; users will obtain the fill
  rate directly from DMMonline.
  5.32.19. IM Utilities, Dashboard. The IM Dashboard provides a high level view of the
  logistics account to include inventory lines and value, stratification state, PV fill rate (see
  note in paragraph 5.31.18.), inventory performance, and daily demands. Use this option to
  view and print data in a variety of report formats. Charts and graphs are produced by left
  clicking on underlined data headings. Furthermore, use the dropdown option to vary the
  graphic presentation. Blue colored sections are derived from the most recent End-of-Day
  (EOD) processing while Green colored sections are derived from the latest End-of- Month
  (EOM) cycle.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   205


                                            Chapter 6

                    CUSTOMER AREA INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

6.1. Purpose. CAIM is a user-friendly inventory management tool designed to enhance the
efficiency of DMLSS by allowing the materiel manager to establish and maintain local storage of
items in the customer area. Use the CAIM module to provide patient care and clinical support
through the use of modules that allow automated support for requesting materiel, physical
inventory, ordering, storage, receipt, and tracking of patient care related materiel all the way up
to its point of use.
   6.1.1. CAIM is designed with the flexibility to support different customers in the manner
   most appropriate for their size. It provides the capability to place orders internally with MTF
   stockrooms and any other customer areas classified as a CAIM SOS, as well as placing
   orders using purchase cards directly with external sources such as non-contracted BPAs and
   DBPAs; however, AF policy directs that only medical maintenance activities are authorized
   to be coded as a CAIM SOS. The local Medical Logistics Flight Commander determines
   whether or not the maintenance activity is allowed to order directly to a SOS.
   6.1.2. CAIM allows customers to store and order items by location. The item requests are
   submitted to LOG (Host MTF). LOG either fills customer requirements by issuing materiel
   from OPR stock or a backorder is generated and LOG must obtain the materiel from an
   external source and issue the materiel to the customer upon receipt.
   6.1.3. For privileged users, the CAIM Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the CAIM
   application from the DMLSS System Navigation window. It contains many pending actions
   that are either advisory in nature or require user action. DMLSS automatically removes
   some action items from the inbox upon processing, while other advisory notices should be
   removed or deleted upon review and when no longer needed. A detailed list of CAIM
   pending actions and their recommended use is available in Attachment 6. At a minimum, all
   pending actions should be reviewed and worked daily to ensure proper management of all
   assemblages.
   6.1.4. The CAIM main window also appears once it is launched from the DMLSS System
   Navigation window. In this window, users can access the modules and functionalities of
   CAIM mainly through the menu options. In some cases, you can also use the buttons on the
   horizontal toolbar at the top of the window to open IM module windows. While on any IM
   primary window, you have access to the same menu bar and horizontal toolbar buttons. Each
   module window, however, displays a unique set of vertical toolbar buttons on the right side
   of these windows.
   6.1.5. The modules covered in the remainder of this chapter are in the same order as they
   appear in the Navigate dropdown menu located on the menu toolbar.
6.2. New Catalog Item.
   6.2.1. MTF Catalog Item.
       6.2.1.1. Items not listed on the UDR or DMLSS Extract require a new MTF Catalog item
       record to be loaded. While a new MTF Catalog item can be created in CAIM, only basic
       information can be loaded. Medical logistics should encourage that customers leverage
206                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      the use of the ―New Item Request‖ module with the CS application to maximum extent
      based upon policy set forth in AFI 41-209, paragraph 4.4. in lieu of creating catalog
      records. Additional management data such as MTF restrictions, special requirements, and
      destruction methods must be updated in IM. For this reason, it is recommended that new
      catalog records be created in IM by a logistician. User restrictions may apply to
      accessing IM.
      6.2.1.2. From the CAIM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―New Catalog Item‖ and then
      ―MTF Catalog Item‖ or click on the ―MTF Catalog‖ button located on the horizontal
      toolbar to access this function. A shortcut option is also available by simultaneously
      pressing ―Ctrl+Shift+F2‖ on the keyboard.
      6.2.1.3. MTF Catalog records should be loaded and/or modified as explained in Chapter
      5, paragraph 5.2.
  6.2.2. Customer Catalog Item.
      6.2.2.1. Use the Customer Catalog Detail window to add or update customer catalog
      data, edit customer locations, add notes to the customer catalog item, and search for other
      customer catalog items. If applicable, users can also identify items that will be stored in
      the carousel and add a carousel location for a CAIM SOS to a Customer Catalog record.
      From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―New Catalog Item‖ and then ―Customer Catalog
      Item‖ to access this function.
      6.2.2.2. Enter the required information (fields with red dots). After the item ID is
      entered, other data fields are automatically populated with information from the MTF
      catalog record. Enter the customer ID and click ―Save.‖ The record is updated with
      information contained in the MTF catalog record.
      6.2.2.3. CAIM issues supplies based on location. The IM Delivery Lists automatically
      default to the CAIM customer‘s delivery location that is identified in the SVC/CUST
      Detail record in SS. Within the CAIM module, additional storage locations can be added
      by accessing the customer‘s catalog record. In the Customer Catalog Detail record, click
      ―Add‖ in the location box to add another storage location.
      6.2.2.4. The Combine Location button is available when multiple locations exist. Use
      the ―Combine‖ button to merge data from two locations into a single location record.
      6.2.2.5. Use the ―Edit‖ button to access the Item Location Detail window and apply
      management indicators specific to that item ID. The following data fields, indicators, and
      system features are available in this window.
         6.2.2.5.1. Estimated Monthly Usage – This is not a mandatory field; however, the
         estimated monthly usage should be loaded if known.
         6.2.2.5.2. Level – This is a mandatory field when the Level Type is either Core or
         Static (see paragraph 6.2.2.5.7.). Enter the customer‘s desired level, that is, the
         amount the customer maintains within their storage area. Note: It is possible for a
         Core or Static item to contain a level of zero.
         6.2.2.5.3. Reorder Point (ROP) – This is a mandatory field when the Level Type is
         either Core or Static. When mandatory, enter the customer‘s desired ROP. The ROP
         determines when the item should be replenished to avoid stock exhaustion.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  207


          6.2.2.5.4. Location – Use the dropdown menu to specify the item‘s storage location.
          Use the ―Add‖ located next to the location field to add a new location and storage
          area. The POU, Carousel, Ready Use, and Other indicators can also be selected in the
          Location (New) window.
          6.2.2.5.5. Storage Area – The storage area coincides with a specified location and is
          added and/or modified by using the ―Add‖ button located next to the location field.
          6.2.2.5.6. Expense Center – Use the dropdown menu to specify the expense center in
          which this particular item ID is associated. Only the expense center associated to the
          customer in the SVC/CUST Detail record in SS appears in this dropdown menu.
          6.2.2.5.7. Level Type.
              6.2.2.5.7.1. Core – Indicates the level and ROP are computer controlled and
              based on the same calculations used for OPR inventory.
              6.2.2.5.7.2. Static – Indicates the level and ROP are manually controlled by the
              custodian or by logistics personnel.
              6.2.2.5.7.3. Non-Stocked – Indicates this item is ―stockless‖ and the level and
              ROP fields are not available.
          6.2.2.5.8. Auto Level – Use the ―Auto Level‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to
          initiate a system calculation to compute the level and ROP. At least three months of
          consumption data must be available prior to using this feature.
      6.2.2.6. Save data prior to exiting the Customer Catalog Detail window. The data fields,
      indicators, and features are unique to the specified item ID and customer ID; therefore,
      each customer catalog record must be coded separately.
6.3. Catalog Search.
   6.3.1. The CAIM Catalog Search function works the same as the IM Catalog Search function
   and is used to search for customer catalog records as well as for LOG, MTF, ECAT, and
   other contracted item catalog records. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.3. for a detailed
   explanation. The Generic Search window automatically defaults the search scope to
   ―Customer Catalog‖ and to the ―Cust ID‖ assigned to the customer conducting the search.
   6.3.2. The Catalog Search function is used to retrieve and manage the customer catalog
   records. Paragraph 6.2.2. contains detailed explanations of the data fields and indicators used
   to manage customer catalog records. This function can also obtain information pertaining to
   LOG and/or MTF catalog records and determine whether or not a LOG and/or MFT catalog
   exists. While customers have the capability to create new LOG and/or MTF catalog records,
   it is not recommended. Logistics personnel should create catalog records using the IM
   function to ensure the catalog records are properly coded.
6.4. SOS. The CAIM SOS mimics the IM SOS functionality. Privileges to CAIM SOS should
not be afforded to CAIM customers. SOS records should be managed by logistics personnel
using the IM SOS function explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.2.1.4.19.
6.5. Purchase Card. The CAIM Purchase Card function mimics the IM Purchase Card
function. CAIM Purchase Card privileges should not be given to customers. The IM Purchase
 208                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Card function should be used by logistics personnel to manage the GPC program. Refer to
Chapter 5, paragraph 5.7. for a detailed explanation of DMLSS purchase card processes.
6.6. Physical Inventory.
   6.6.1. The CAIM Physical Inventory function is used to validate actual OH quantities with
   the DMLSS EOH quantity and to adjust inventory balances. The typical function of CAIM
   Physical Inventory is to process issues or losses for quantity shortages, and to process gains
   for quantity overages; therefore, adjusting the EOH quantities so they match the actual OH
   quantities.
   6.6.2. While a CAIM Physical Inventory can be coded as ―Official‖ or ―Unofficial,‖ AFI 41 -
   209, Chapter 3, states all CAIM inventories are unofficial except for medical maintenance.
   CAIM inventories are unofficial because the materiel is no longer LOG owned. The
   difference between official and unofficial inventories is described as follows.
       6.6.2.1. Unofficial Physical Inventory. The unofficial inventory provides a method to
       informally adjust inventory balances. While an Inventory Adjustment Report-Unofficial
       is generated, unofficial inventories do not require Certifying Official and Approving
       Authority signature. The following transactions are produced as a result of processing an
       Unofficial Physical Inventory and are visible in both CAIM and IM Transaction History.
          6.6.2.1.1. An ISU transaction is generated for each item ID identified with an
          inventory shortage. This condition exists when the inventory count is less than the
          EOH quantity. The ISU does not update or charge customer funds because the
          customer was already charged when the materiel was issued from LOG.
          6.6.2.1.2. An IAG transaction is generated for each item ID identified with an
          overage condition. This condition exists when the inventory count is greater than the
          EOH quantity. The IAG does not affect customer funds nor does it affect LOG
          inventory balances or funds.
          6.6.2.1.3. When no quantity adjustments occur, DMLSS unlocks the customer
          catalog records and they become available for normal operating business.
       6.6.2.2. Official Physical Inventory. The CAIM Official Physical Inventory should not
       be used, but is explained to provide an understanding of the differences between the
       official and unofficial inventory processes. An Inventory Adjustment Report-Official is
       produced as a result of an official inventory and must be signed by the Certifying Official
       and Approving Authority. Official inventories reflect inventory loss and gain actions that
       are subject to audits. The following transactions are produced as a result of processing an
       Official Physical Inventory and are visible in both CAIM and IM Transaction History.
          6.6.2.2.1. An IAL transaction is generated for each item ID identified with an
          inventory shortage. This condition exists when the inventory count is less than the
          EOH quantity. The IAL does not affect customer funds nor does it affect LOG
          inventory balances or funds.
          6.6.2.2.2. An IAG transaction is generated for each item ID identified with an
          overage condition. This condition exists when the inventory count is greater than the
          EOH quantity. The IAG does not affect customer funds nor does it affect LOG
          inventory balances or funds.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               209


         6.6.2.2.3. When no quantity adjustments occur, DMLSS unlocks the customer
         catalog records and they become available for normal operating business.
  6.6.3. CAIM Physical Inventories may be accomplished manually or by using an HHT (in
  CAIM only) in batch, RF, or store & forward mode to record the inventory results. A
  physical inventory may be for an entire customer area, a storage area, selected locations, or
  selected item IDs.
  6.6.4. Manual Inventory.
     6.6.4.1. Select ―Physical Inventory‖ from the CAIM Navigate menu or click ―Phys.
     Inven.‖ located on the horizontal toolbar to initiate a new or access a pending customer
     inventory. In the Physical Inventory selection box, choose ―Unofficial‖ to begin a new
     inventory, access an existing one, or choose ―Cancel‖ to exit the physical inventory
     process. If a pending inventory already exists, the message, ―You already have a
     physical inventory in progress for this customer. Only locked records will be displayed.‖
     appears. Click ―OK‖ to continue.
     6.6.4.2. In the search criteria window, enter the appropriate item ID, storage area,
     location, and/or item type and then click ―Search‖ to retrieve the desired customer
     records for inventory. The item type defaults to Stocked but can be changed to Static,
     Core, or All Core/Static.
     6.6.4.3. Upon clicking ―Search,‖ DMLSS displays all matching customer records in the
     bottom portion of the window, regardless of the EOH quantity. To process a manual
     inventory, enter the count quantities in the ―Inv Qty‖ field for the corresponding item
     ID(s). Inventory quantity fields left blank are automatically filled with a zero quantity.
     Do not leave fields blank if an OH quantity exists. If necessary, use the Barcode search
     field to locate a particular record.
     6.6.4.4. Process Inventory (Process Inv). Once all inventory quantities are entered, click
     ―Process Inv‖ located on the vertical toolbar to generate pending inventory actions.
     Afterwards, the Inv Complete button appears on the vertical toolbar.
     6.6.4.5. Inventory Complete (Inv Complete). After inventory counts are validated, click
     ‖Inv Complete‖ to complete the customer inventory and generate potential ISU and IAG
     transactions as explained in paragraph 6.6.2.1. Select ―Yes‖ when prompted to print the
     Inventory Adjustment Report-Unofficial.
     6.6.4.6. Cancel Inventory (Cancel Inv). Click ―Cancel Inv‖ to terminate the inventory if
     the search criteria or item(s) were selected in error, or when the inventory needs to be
     terminated for official reasons. Cancelling the inventory unlocks all affected customer
     catalog records and allows the customer to resume normal operations.
     6.6.4.7. Close Inventory. Select ―Close‖ to exit the inventory process without
     terminating the inventory. When Close is selected, a message opens informing the user
     that all records remain locked for inventory. Upon reentering the Physical Inventory
     function, users are notified that selected records are locked for inventory. These are the
     only records that are displayed until the inventory is completed or cancelled.
     6.6.4.8. Invalid Records. Click ―Invalid Records‖ to access the Invalid Inventory
     Report, which is produced as a result of a HHT inventory. This report identifies invalid
210                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      records that were transferred from a HHT to DMLSS as part of an inventory. These
      records are displayed in the CAIM Invalid Inventory pending action.
      6.6.4.9. Revert. Click ―Revert‖ to cancel pending inventory actions and begin a fresh
      inventory. All Inv Qty fields revert to blank fields and no transactions are generated.
      6.6.4.10. Reset. Use the ―Reset‖ button to reset the item ID, location, storage area,
      and/or item type search criteria fields to blank.
  6.6.5. Inventory Using the HHT Batch Option.
      6.6.5.1. Using the HHT in batch mode allows multiple customer areas to be inventoried
      and then uploaded to CAIM using the docking station. If duplicate records are found, the
      last record uploaded will override the previous record.
      6.6.5.2. The CAIM must be locked for physical inventory prior to the upload. To do so,
      initiate a CAIM Physical Inventory from a PC and then select ―Close‖ as explained in
      paragraph 6.6.4.7.
      6.6.5.3. To perform a physical inventory using batch HHT; type a valid user ID and hit
      the Batch button on the Personal Data Assistant (PDA) to use the Batch password, or
      manually type in the value of Batch in the password field. The default password is
      ―Batch.‖ When using HHT mode, you are not required to enter your ―client‖ password.
      6.6.5.4. Select option #2 (Phy Inventory) from the CAIM HHT main menu and scan the
      appropriate Customer Barcode Header Label (CBHL). If the label is not readable, press
      ―OK‖ and enter the customer barcode serial number. A customer inventory method of
      ‗P‘ (Physical Inventory) is displayed on the window.
      6.6.5.5. Scan the Shelf Barcode Label (SBL), physically count the item, and enter the
      inventory quantity. Repeat this step for all items being inventoried. If the barcode does
      not read, press ―OK‖ and type in the item ID, location ID, and quantity at the prompts.
      Once all items have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item Barcode and Customer
      Barcode menus.
      6.6.5.6. After the inventory is completed, verify active sync is initiated on the PC, return
      the HHT to the docking station, select ―Send File (Batch)‖ on the HHT, and select
      ―Inventory.‖
      6.6.5.7. From the PC, open the CAIM application and select the ―Batch HHT‖ button.
      The system responds with the number of valid and invalid records. Close the window
      and select the ―Phys Inven‖ button. A message appears stating that a customer inventory
      is already in progress, click ―OK‖ to continue.
      6.6.5.8. Click the ―Process Inv‖ button and then the ―Inv Complete‖ button to process
      the inventory and generate inventory adjustment transactions.
      6.6.5.9. For unofficial inventories, DMLSS generates an ISU transaction for shortages
      and an IAG for overages. For official inventories, DMLSS generates an IAL for
      shortages and an IAG for overages. An Inventory Adjustment Report is produced for
      both types of inventories. The customer‘s EOH is increased and/or decreased as a result
      of processing these transactions.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              211


     6.6.5.10. On the HHT, select ―File‖ from the bottom menu and then select ―Exit‖ to
     logout of the HHT.
  6.6.6. Inventory Using the HHT RF Option.
     6.6.6.1. Using the HHT in RF mode allows multiple customer areas to be inventoried
     and then uploaded to CAIM using RF. The CAIM customer must be locked for Physical
     Inventory on the client before using RF HHT to conduct an inventory. To do so, initiate
     a CAIM Physical Inventory from a PC and then select ―Close‖ as explained in paragraph
     6.6.4.7.
     6.6.6.2. Select ―Physical Inv‖ from the CAIM HHT menu; type a valid DMLSS user ID
     and password. Do not use the ―Batch‖ password.
     6.6.6.3. Scan the CBHL. If the label is not readable, press ―OK‖ and then enter the
     customer barcode serial number. A customer inventory method of ―P‖ (Physical
     Inventory) is displayed on the window.
     6.6.6.4. Scan the SBL or manually enter the item ID, item location, and then enter the
     inventory count. The count is updated to the server in real time when accepted. When
     the inventory is complete, open the CAIM application from the PC and select ―Phys
     Inven.‖ A message appears stating the customer inventory is already in progress, click
     ―OK‖ to continue.
     6.6.6.5. If the CAIM Physical Inventory window was open while conducting the
     inventory, click ―Revert.‖ All inventory counts are displayed in the Inv Qty field on the
     Physical Inventory Entry window for review and acceptance.
     6.6.6.6. Click ―Process Inv‖ and then ―Inv Complete‖ to process the inventory and
     generate adjustment transactions.
     6.6.6.7. For unofficial inventories, DMLSS generates an ISU transaction for shortages
     and an IAG for overages. For official inventories, DMLSS generates an IAL for
     shortages and an IAG for overages. An Inventory Adjustment Report is produced for
     both types of inventories. The customer‘s EOH is increased and/or decreased as a result
     of processing these transactions.
     6.6.6.8. On the HHT, select ―File‖ from the bottom menu and then select ―Exit‖ to
     logout of the HHT.
  6.6.7. Inventory Using the HHT Store and Forward Option.
     6.6.7.1. Typically, the Store & Forward HHT mode is used in locations outside the RF
     coverage area. This mode is similar to the batch HHT, but it allows you to transmit
     inventory records that were collected in batch to CAIM via RF rather than through the
     docking station. Multiple customer areas can be inventoried and then uploaded to CAIM
     using the RF. If duplicate records are found, the last record uploaded will override the
     previous record.
     6.6.7.2. The customer(s) must be locked for Physical Inventory prior to the upload. To
     do so, initiate a CAIM Physical Inventory from a PC and then select ―Close‖ as explained
     in paragraph 6.6.4.7.
 212                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       6.6.7.3. Select ―Physical Inv‖ from the CAIM HHT menu, type a valid username, and
       enter ―Batch‖ as the password.
       6.6.7.4. Scan the CBHL. If the label is not readable, press ―OK‖ and enter the customer
       barcode serial number. A customer inventory method of ―P‖ (Physical Inventory)
       displays on the window.
       6.6.7.5. Scan the SBL, physically count the item(s), and enter the inventory quantity.
       Repeat this step for all items being inventoried. If the barcode does not read, press ―OK‖
       and type in the item ID, location ID, and quantities when prompted. Once all items have
       been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item Barcode and Customer Barcode menus.
       6.6.7.6. After the inventory is completed, select ―Send File (RF)‖ on the HHT and enter
       a valid DMLSS user ID and password.
       6.6.7.7. Open the CAIM application from the PC and select the ―Phys Inven‖ button. A
       message appears stating that a customer physical inventory is already in progress, click
       ―OK‖ to continue. Select the ―Process Inv‖ and then ―Inv Complete‖ to process the
       inventory and generate adjustment transactions.
       6.6.7.8. For unofficial inventories, DMLSS generates an ISU transaction for shortages
       and an IAG for overages. For official inventories, DMLSS generates an IAL for
       shortages and an IAG for overages. An Inventory Adjustment Report is produced for
       both types of inventories. The customer‘s EOH is increased and/or decreased as a result
       of processing these transactions.
       6.6.7.9. On the HHT, select ―File‖ from the bottom menu and then select ―Exit‖ to
       logout of the HHT.
6.7. Destructions. Medical materiel destructions must be processed by logistics personnel using
the IM Destruction process explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.9. Customers should never
process destructions. Because the Destruction resource is tied to several roles within UP Assign,
it is difficult to prevent customers from receiving the privileges to use the CAIM Destruction
process. Therefore, it is essential to enforce this policy at the site level.
6.8. Return Item. CAIM customers are not allowed to return items to LOG. Logistics
personnel must use the IM Return Item function explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.23. to
process customer returns.
6.9. Customer Replenishment.
   6.9.1. Use the Customer Replenishment function to submit automated supply requests to
   LOG and replenish the customer area inventory. Logistics staff and/or customers can process
   materiel requests using manual, automatic, or HHT replenishment methods. The HHT
   method may be conducted in batch, RF, or Store & Forward mode.
   6.9.2. Initiating replenishment actions, regardless of method used, generates a CAIM due-
   out (CAIM IOU transaction) and due-in (CAIM ESD transaction). The following LOG
   transaction(s) are generated once the customer order is submitted to LOG and the IM Issues
   are processed:
       6.9.2.1. If sufficient stock is OH, a LOG issue (ISS transaction) processes issuing the
       material to the customer.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 213


     6.9.2.2. If stock is not OH, a LOG due-out (IOU transaction) is generated.
     6.9.2.3. If a partial quantity is OH, both an ISS and IOU could process.
  6.9.3. If ―Verify Orders‖ is enabled in SS for the SVC/CUST, the customer must access the
  Orders Build/Process/Submit (BPS) function explained in paragraph 6.11.1 to process the
  order. Note: Customer funds are not obligated and committed until the BPS function is used
  to submit customer orders to LOG.
  6.9.4. Typical replenishment actions include the following:
     6.9.4.1. Using HHTs to determine replenishment quantities required to refill stock
     shortages.
     6.9.4.2. Conducting a manual replenishment to replenish stock for specified items.
     6.9.4.3. Using automatic replenishment, allowing DMLSS to calculate replenishment
     quantities based on customer levels, EOH quantities, customer due-ins, and due-outs.
     THIS OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED because automatic replenishment is based on
     EOH quantities and assumes that customer levels are valid.
  6.9.5. Manual Replenishment.
     6.9.5.1. From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―Customer Replenishment‖ and then
     ―Manual Replenishment‖ or click ―Manu Repl‖ located on the horizontal toolbar to
     access the ―Manual Replenishment Inventory Entry‖ window.
     6.9.5.2. Use one or more of the search criteria to retrieve customer catalog records for
     potential replenishment. The available search criteria includes the item ID, item
     description, storage area, location, barcode, and item type. Use the item type dropdown
     menu to specify a stock level type code of stocked, non-stocked, core, or static. Enter
     ―All‖ into the item type field to retrieve records assigned all stock level type codes. Once
     the search criterion is identified, click ―Search‖ to retrieve the matching customer catalog
     records for potential replenishment.
     6.9.5.3. Enter a quantity in the Quantity field based on one of the available inventory
     methods. The inventory method is linked to the customer‘s Inventory Method indicator
     located in each SVC/CUST Detail record in SS. All AF activities defaults to ―Order
     Quantity‖ and should only be changed after thorough consideration.
         6.9.5.3.1. Order Quantity - Enter the quantity required to replenish stock.
         6.9.5.3.2. Shelf Count – Enter the actual quantity OH. DMLSS generates
         replenishment based on the difference between the customer‘s level and the shelf
         count.
         6.9.5.3.3. Empty Shelf - DMLSS replenishes the level quantity because it assumes
         the OH quantity is zero.
     6.9.5.4. Manual replenishments can be processed in many different ways. Assuming the
     Order Quantity method is being used, the customer must ultimately know what quantity
     to request whether using pen and paper or memory only. If necessary, the customer can
     print the inventory list displayed in the Manual Replenishment Inventory Entry window
     by selecting ―Print‖ from the File dropdown menu. This list can be used to inventory the
214                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      stock room and then the customer can use the printed list to enter the required
      replenishment quantity.
      6.9.5.5. The Replenishment Qty and Replenishment Amount columns are updated for
      each line item and totals are calculated as replenishment quantities are entered into the
      Manual Replenishment Inventory Entry window. This feature may be valuable if
      insufficient funds are available for 100% replenishment.
      6.9.5.6. Click ―Replenish‖ located on the vertical toolbar once all quantities are
      annotated. DMLSS responds with a message confirming the number of items being
      replenished. Click ―OK‖ in response to the confirmation message to return to the CAIM
      main menu. If the Verify Orders option is not selected for the customer, the Generate
      Order Progress window opens, followed by the ―Orders Have Been Successfully Built‖
      message.
      6.9.5.7. A message is displayed if there are replenishment exceptions. Exception items
      are not ordered until the exception is resolved. You are also prompted to print a
      Replenishment Exception Report at this point. All other items are transferred to the
      Orders – BPS function and are considered ―pending‖ orders until submitted to LOG from
      the BPS window, explained in paragraph 6.11.1.
  6.9.6. Automatic Replenishment.
      6.9.6.1. As previously stated (see caution in paragraph 6.9.4.3.), the Automatic
      Replenishment function is used to allow DMLSS to automatically calculate customer
      replenishment quantities using the following calculation: Level – (O/H + D/I – D/O) =
      Replenishment Qty.      Before using this method, ensure valid customer levels are
      established. Items with a level of zero and items marked for deletion are not considered
      for replenishment.
      6.9.6.2. From the CAIM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Customer Replenishment‖
      and then ―Automatic Replenishment‖ or click on the ―Auto Repl‖ button to access the
      Automatic Replenishment window. DMLSS calculates the customer‘s requirements and
      displays the results in a message box for customer validation.
      6.9.6.3. Attempting to run Auto Replenish for a customer who has an unexecuted order
      or unsent executed orders pending action will generate a message informing the customer
      that pending actions related to orders exist. These pending actions must be deleted or
      submitted to LOG before automatic replenishment can be processed.
      6.9.6.4. At the message prompt signifying completion of the replenishment process, click
      ―OK‖ to return to the previous window.
  6.9.7. Replenishment Using Batch HHT.
      6.9.7.1. With a HHT in batch mode, scan the SBLs to enter the inventory. The
      information is stored in the HHT until the inventory process is complete. The unit is then
      placed in the docking station and all the inventory data is downloaded to DMLSS at one
      time.
      6.9.7.2. When using this method, the records processed in the text file determine the
      replenishment quantity for each item location. The entries are processed according to the
      customer's inventory method.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              215


     6.9.7.3. To perform a replenishment inventory with a batch HHT: Select ―Replenish
     Inv‖ from the CAIM HHT menu; type a valid username and enter ―Batch‖ for the
     password; and scan the CBHL. If the label does not read, press ―OK‖ on the HHT to
     reach the Manual Input window and manually enter the customer barcode serial number
     and inventory method at the prompt.
     6.9.7.4. At the prompt, scan the SBL and enter the quantity required if using the Order
     Quantity inventory method. If using the Shelf Count inventory method, enter the OH
     quantity. Repeat this step for all items being inventoried. If the barcode does not read,
     press ―OK‖ and type in the item ID, location ID, and quantity at the prompt. Once all
     items have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item Barcode and Customer Barcode
     menus.
     6.9.7.5. After the replenishment inventory is completed, select ―Send File (Batch)‖ on
     the HHT and return it to the docking station.
     6.9.7.6. Log into CAIM using a DMLSS enabled PC. In the ―Select a Customer‖
     window, select the customer that has been inventoried for replenishment using the HHT.
     If you have multiple customer inventories, the Batch Transfer Process will update all of
     the customers regardless of which customer you log into first.
     6.9.7.7. In the CAIM Main window, select the Batch HHT button located on the
     horizontal toolbar. At the message prompt, click ―OK‖ to begin the replenishment
     inventory transfer. Only records without exceptions are replenished.
     6.9.7.8. Records with exceptions are written to either the CAIM Invalid Inventory or the
     CAIM Replenishment Exceptions Report pending action. The item exceptions must be
     resolved prior to replenishment. Reference Attachment 6 for an explanation and
     suggested use of these pending actions.
  6.9.8. Replenishment Using HHT RF Mode.
     6.9.8.1. HHTs used in RF mode receive and transmit ‗real time‘ data to CAIM as the
     process is being performed just like your computer does over the LAN.
     6.9.8.2. To replenish inventories using the RF HHT, select ―Replenish Inv‖ from the
     CAIM HHT menu and enter a valid username and password. Do not use the ―Batch‖
     password.
     6.9.8.3. Scan the CBHL. If the label will not scan, manually enter the customer barcode
     serial number and inventory method at the prompt.
     6.9.8.4. At the prompt, scan the SBL and enter the quantity required if using the Order
     Quantity inventory method. If using the Shelf Count inventory method, enter the OH
     quantity. Repeat this step for all items being inventoried. If the barcode does not read,
     press ―OK‖ and type in the item ID, location ID, and quantity at the prompt. Once all
     items have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item Barcode and Customer Barcode
     menus.
     6.9.8.5. If the SBL is invalid due to damage or corrupt data. Press ―Enter‖ to access the
     manual entry windows. The system will allow manually entering of the item ID,
     customer ID, location ID, and quantity.
216                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      6.9.8.6. On the HHT, press ―Cancel‖ to complete the customer area replenishment
      inventory process. DMLSS prompts for new customer information. Follow the steps
      outlined above to continue the process in other areas.
      6.9.8.7. Once all items and customers have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item
      Barcode and Customer Barcode menus.
  6.9.9. Replenishment Using HHT Store & Forward Mode.
      6.9.9.1. Store & Forward HHT is similar to Batch HHT. Multiple customer areas can be
      inventoried and then uploaded to CAIM using RF.
      6.9.9.2. Using the HHT in Store & Forward mode allows you to scan the SBLs in batch
      mode and then enter the inventory in RF mode. However, in Store & Forward mode, the
      information is stored in the HHT until the inventory process is complete. The HHT then
      uses RF mode to transmit the inventory data to CAIM at one time, without the use of a
      docking station.
      6.9.9.3. For a replenishment inventory on the HHT, the records processed in the text file
      determine the replenishment quantity for each item location. The entries are processed
      according to the customer‘s inventory method. Once the upload is complete, CAIM will
      perform a validation process on the data and notify the user of records containing errors.
      6.9.9.4. Use the following steps as a guide to process replenishments using the Store &
      Forward HHT method:
         6.9.9.4.1. Select ―Replenish Inv‖ from the CAIM HHT menu, enter a valid username,
         and type ―Batch‖ for the password.
         6.9.9.4.2. Scan the appropriate CBHL. If the label will not read, press ―OK‖ on the
         HHT to reach the Manual Input window. Manually enter the customer barcode serial
         number and inventory method at the prompt.
         6.9.9.4.3. At the prompt, scan the SBL and enter the quantity required if using the
         Order Quantity inventory method. If using the Shelf Count inventory method, enter
         the OH quantity. Repeat this step for all items being inventoried. If the barcode does
         not read, press ―OK‖ and type in the item ID, location ID, and quantity at the prompt.
         Once all items have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the Item Barcode and
         Customer Barcode menus.
         6.9.9.4.4. Repeat the process for each item being replenished.
         6.9.9.4.5. On the HHT, press ―Cancel‖ to complete the customer area replenishment
         inventory process. DMLSS prompts for new customer area information. Follow the
         steps outlined above (paragraph 6.9.9.4.) to continue the process in other areas.
         6.9.9.4.6. Once all items and customers have been inventoried, click ―Cancel‖ on the
         Item barcode and Customer Barcode menus.
         6.9.9.4.7. After the inventory is completed, select ―Send File (RF)‖ on the HHT and
         enter a valid user ID and password.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             217


        6.9.9.4.8. Select the ―Issue‖ method and answer ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ to the prompt asking
        if error messages should be displayed. The upload initiates at this point without the
        need for the docking station.
        6.9.9.4.9. Log into CAIM using a DMLSS enabled PC. In the Select a Customer
        window, select the customer that has been inventoried for replenishment using the
        HHT. If multiple customers were inventoried, the Batch Transfer Process updates all
        of the customers regardless of which customer you log into first.
        6.9.9.4.10. On the HHT, select ―File‖ from the bottom menu and then select ―Exit‖ to
        log out of the HHT.
     6.9.9.5. Log onto CAIM and select the ―Batch HHT‖ button located on the horizontal
     toolbar. At the message prompt, click ―OK‖ to begin the replenishment inventory
     transfer.
     6.9.9.6. Once the upload is complete, CAIM clears the HHT of all data and performs a
     validation process. CAIM notifies the user of records containing errors by displaying a
     Replenishment Exception pending action in the Customer Inbox. The user must
     manually correct the errors listed.
     6.9.9.7. If the customer has Verify Orders turned off, the orders are automatically
     submitted to LOG. If Verify Orders is turned on, the user must access the Orders - BPS
     function to process the orders.
  6.9.10. Point of Use (POU) and Carousel. POU and Carousel are not particular CAIM
  Replenishment functions but operate like an automated replenishment function when the
  customer detail record is properly coded.
     6.9.10.1. POU.
        6.9.10.1.1. A POU cabinet is an automated supply tracking and replenishment system
        used in various locations throughout a hospital. These POU cabinets store, dispense,
        and automate the replenishment of materiel. With a POU cabinet, you do not need to
        perform manual replenishments or use HHTs for replenishment.
        6.9.10.1.2. A POU interface was established to provide a means of communication
        between the POU cabinet and DMLSS. This interface allows leveling and ordering
        functionality to be handled by the POU system, and requirements received from the
        POU system are then filled by DMLSS. The POU system acts as the conversion
        manager and reorder calculator. DMLSS supplies any order quantities requested by
        POU.
        6.9.10.1.3. POU Set-up Procedures. If POU cabinets are used, the Verify Receipts
        and Verify Orders indicators in SVC/CUST record in the SS application should NOT
        be selected, they should be unchecked. To use the POU interface properly, perform
        the following tasks:
            6.9.10.1.3.1. Configure the POU interface in the SS application. Access DCM
            Search and click the ―Configure‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Select
            ―POUSRV‖ in the DCM Interface Selection window and click ―Yes‖ in the Send
            field. Enter the POU‘s server IP address, login ID, and password. Save changes
            before existing.
 218                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


              6.9.10.1.3.2. Identify the POU locations in the customer catalog. Access CAIM
              and perform a customer catalog search. Click the ―Add‖ button to add a location.
              In the Location – New window, add a unique location and storage area and click
              the POU indicator. A location cannot be marked as POU when the send indicator
              in DCM Configuration is turned off.
          6.9.10.1.4. An item in the customer catalog can have a carousel location, a POU
          cabinet location, and a ready use location. Remember that the combination of
          location ID and storage area must be unique.
          6.9.10.1.5. Items, which reject as a result of the automated POU replenishment, are
          displayed in the POU Replenishment Exception Report pending action. Access the
          pending action and take necessary actions to resolve the exception and to process the
          replenishment.
       6.9.10.2. Carousel.
          6.9.10.2.1. A carousel is a type of stock and storage equipment usually located in a
          medical pharmacy or medical supply warehouse. Manual or HHT replenishments are
          not required when using a carousel. A carousel interface is available to accommodate
          the use of carousels by any of the following:
              6.9.10.2.1.1. CAIM SOS customer (Only authorized CAIM SOS is the medical
              maintenance activity).
              6.9.10.2.1.2. CAIM customer with ready use location.
              6.9.10.2.1.3. Pharmacy that does not operate as a SOS.
          6.9.10.2.2. These carousels may be a series of bins mounted to a track that retrieves
          the required items for the operator. Currently, there are several carousel storage and
          retrieval systems in operation within DoD MTFs. To use the carousel interface
          properly, perform the following tasks:
              6.9.10.2.2.1. Configure the carousel interface in the SS application. Access
              DCM Search and click ―Configure‖ located on the vertical toolbar. Select
              ―Carousel-1‖ or ―Carousel-2‖ in the DCM Interface selection window.
              6.9.10.2.2.2. Identify the carousel locations in the customer catalog. Access
              CAIM and perform a customer catalog search. Click ―Add‖ to add a location. In
              the Location – New window, add a unique location and storage area and click the
              ―Carousel‖ indicator.
          6.9.10.2.3. An item in the customer catalog can have a carousel location, a POU
          cabinet location, and a ready use location. Remember that the combination of
          location ID and storage area must be unique.
          6.9.10.2.4. Use the CAIM Ready Use Location Replenishment pending action as
          explained in Attachment 6 when using Carousel and Ready Use replenishments.
6.10. Print Barcodes.
   6.10.1. Use the CAIM Print Barcode function to print barcode labels for new items or
   replacement labels for existing items. Barcode labels are printed when the label of an
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   219


  existing item is unreadable or if label-related information in the customer catalog has been
  modified. Print barcodes to be used in conjunction with Replenishment Inventory, Physical
  Inventory, and Issues processes via HHT. SBLs may also be printed in the Barcode Printing
  window. The SBL is principally used for inventorying customer areas, but is also used for
  item and customer ID.
  6.10.2. Before printing large quantities of labels, check the barcode printer to ensure that the
  machine is on, operating properly, and there are plenty of labels for the print job. Barcode
  labels should be printed frequently to ensure the label information is accurate. Reprint labels
  as they become worn or if they are removed. Customers should monitor the Unprinted
  Barcode Labels with Changes and Unprinted Critical Barcode Labels pending actions and
  produce new labels as necessary. Refer to Attachment 6 for a description and recommended
  use of these pending actions.
  6.10.3. Select ―Print Barcodes‖ from the CAIM Navigate menu or click on the ―Barcode‖
  button located on the Horizontal toolbar to access this function. Barcode labels can also be
  printed from the Unprinted Barcode Labels with Changes and Unprinted Critical Barcode
  Labels pending actions.
  6.10.4. In the Barcode Printing window, use the following search criteria to locate potential
  barcode labels to print.
     6.10.4.1. Print Customer Header Label Only - Check this indicator to print a customer
     identification label.
     6.10.4.2. Item ID – Use to search for a specific item.
     6.10.4.3. Location – Use the dropdown menu to retrieve records associated to a specific
     location.
     6.10.4.4. Item Type – Use the dropdown menu to retrieve records associated to a specific
     item level type. The available search criteria is: all records (ALL), Stocked, Non-
     stocked, Core, Static, and All Core/Static.
     6.10.4.5. Barcode Type – Use the dropdown menu to identify a specific type of barcode
     label to retrieve. The available barcode types are: All, All Changes, Critical, Noncritical,
     and Obsolete.
     6.10.4.6. Storage Location – Use the dropdown menu to identify records associated to a
     specific storage area.
  6.10.5. Click the ―Search‖ button on the vertical toolbar once the search criteria is identified.
  DMLSS displays the item description, item ID, storage area, location, level, and U/S of the
  matching records in the ―Barcode Printing‖ window. Labels can be printed for one, some, or
  all of the displayed records. Use the Shift and/or Control key function to highlight multiple
  records.
  6.10.6. Reset. Click on the ―Reset‖ button to remove all previous search criteria so a new
  search can be conducted.
  6.10.7. Print. Select the ―Print‖ button to print a barcode report containing the displayed
  records.

   6.10.8. Barcode Print. Click on the ―Barcode Print‖ button on the vertical toolbar to produce
   a barcode label for all selected (highlighted) records.
   6.10.9. Delete. Click on the ―Delete‖ button to insert an ―N‖ in the Type column. This
   provides another method to further sort the records. Clicking ―Delete‖ in this window does
   not mark the customer catalog for deletion.
   6.10.10. Select All. Click ―Select All‖ to highlight all records for printing.
   6.10.11. Sort. Use the ―Sort‖ button on the vertical toolbar to identify how the records are
   sorted and displayed within the Barcode Printing window. Use the ―Insert,‖ ―Add,‖ and
   ―Remove‖ buttons as an advanced sort feature. Records can also be sorted in ascending
   order by clicking once on any of the column headings or sorted in descending order by
   clicking the column heading twice. Labels are printed in the order they appear on the screen.
   The last Sort option is stored in CAIM for the next print session.
6.11. Orders.
   6.11.1. BPS Orders.
       6.11.1.1. Use the CAIM BPS function to submit and/or cancel pending customer orders
       to LOG when the SVC/CUST has ―Verify Orders‖ turned on, when the order edits or
       rejects (i.e. lack of funds), or when an order is submitted to an external agency other than
       LOG. The BPS function is also used to resubmit orders that appear in the CAIM
       Unexecuted Orders pending action. From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and
       then ―Build/Process/Submit Orders‖ or click on the ―BPS Order‖ button located on the
       horizontal toolbar to access this function.
       6.11.1.2. Normally, the only SOS that appears in the ―SOS Selection‖ window is the RIC
       assigned to LOG, i.e. EDT for Elmendorf, FM5000. Highlight the local LOG SOS and
       click ―OK‖ to access the Build Orders/Order Summary window.
       6.11.1.3. The upper half of the window contains details of the customer‘s order to
       include the SOS, project code, total number of line items on the order, total value of the
       order, and an exceptions indicator. If an ―X‖ appears in the exceptions column, click
       ―Detail‖ to access the specific line item in question. The exception must be resolved
       before that item can be ordered.
       6.11.1.4. The customer‘s fund record details are displayed in the lower half of the
       window. The project center fund code and associated EOR is visible along with the
       dollar value of new commitments and surcharges, which are based on the order totals
       listed in the upper half of the window. Additionally, the current available balance is
       listed and the new available balance shows the customer what the available balance will
       be if all items are ordered.
       6.11.1.5. The following flag (Flg) indicators are used throughout the order process: P –
       process, H – Hold, and D – Delete. These indicators are used to determine whether or not
       an individual record or an entire order is processed upon clicking the ―Execute‖ button.
       6.11.1.6. Execute. Click ―Execute‖ to process the order. Upon executing, the system
       generates an ESD IOU transaction. Both are written to Transaction History.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              221


     6.11.1.7. Detail. Click ―Detail‖ to access the Build Orders/Order Detail window.
     Features available in the order detail window include the ability to add Notes, print a
     detailed report, view SOS information, and check/compare PVM pricing. The due-in and
     due-out details are listed in separate tabs.
        6.11.1.7.1. Due-In Tab. The due-in quantity, advice code, and U/P price can be
        modified in the Due-In tab. The customer can also code the due-in as ―Hold.‖ To do
        so, highlight the record to be held and click the ―Hold‖ button located at the bottom
        of the window. The ―Flg‖ indicator changes from ―P‖ to ―H.‖ Records with a ―Flg‖
        indicator of ―H‖ are not processed as part of the order upon executing.
        6.11.1.7.2. Due-Out Tab. In the Due-Out tab, only the quantity can be modified.
        Like the due-in, the due-out can also be coded as ―Hold.‖ In addition, the due-out can
        be coded for deletion by highlighting the desired record and clicking ―Delete‖ located
        at the bottom of the window. In this case, the ―Flg‖ indicator changes to ―D‖ and the
        record is removed from the order.
     6.11.1.8. Hold. Click ―Hold‖ to flag an entire order to be held. An order containing a
     ―Flg‖ indicator of ―H‖ is held and not processed upon executing the order. Orders that
     are held reappear in the Build Orders/Order Summary window with a ―Flg‖ indicator of
     ―P‖ upon reaccessing BPS. Orders may need to be held for various reasons to include:
        6.11.1.8.1. Reducing the maximum dollar amount allowed for an order.
        6.11.1.8.2. Holding an order that is not ready to be submitted.
        6.11.1.8.3. Loading additional funds for the order.
     6.11.1.9. Exceptions. An exception indicator is visible in the Build Orders/Order
     Summary window as well as in the Build Orders/Order Detail window. All exceptions
     must be resolved before the item can be ordered. Once resolved, the ―X‖ is removed
     from the exception indicator box. Highlight the order containing exceptions and click
     ―Exception‖ to access the Exception Detail window. Take one of the following actions to
     rectify the exception:
        6.11.1.9.1. Alter potential due-in or due-out quantities. Edit the due-in or due-out
        order information, click ―Save,‖ and then click ―Close.‖
        6.11.1.9.2. Adjust fund targets. Navigate to the customer‘s fund record in SS and
        load funds in the appropriate EOR.
        6.11.1.9.3. Adjust the maximum/minimum order amounts. Edit the due-in order
        quantity to lower or raise the order dollar amount, click ―Save,‖ and then click
        ―Close.‖
        6.11.1.9.4. The SOS may also require use of a purchase card.
     6.11.1.10. Report. While in the Build Orders/Order Summary window, click the
     ―Report‖ button to print the BPS Order Summary Screen Report. While in the Build
     Orders/Order Details window, click the ―Report‖ button to print the Order Detail Screen
     Report. Each of these reports replicates the data contained within each window.
222                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      6.11.1.11. Refresh. Click ―Refresh‖ to refresh the data displayed within the Build
      Orders/Order Summary window. This feature is beneficial because the user does not
      have to exit and reaccess this window to update the information.
  6.11.2. Offline Submit.
      6.11.2.1. Use the CAIM Offline Submit function to place out-of-cycle or non-routine
      orders to LOG. Normally, customer orders are submitted to LOG using one of the CAIM
      replenishment options or by logistics personnel processing a customer request using the
      IM Order function.
      6.11.2.2. From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Offline Submit‖ to
      access this function. Offline Submit function can also be accessed using the shortcut by
      simultaneously pressing the ―Ctrl+Shift+F10‖ keys.
      6.11.2.3. In the Submit Offline Orders window, enter an item ID or select one from the
      Drop Down Search & Select list. This list defaults to ascending sequence by item
      description but it can also be sorted by item ID sequence. Upon entering the item ID,
      corresponding information from the MTF catalog record automatically populates the
      location, expense center, and SOS fields. The demand code always defaults to recurring
      and the priority code defaults to 13. Modify these fields as necessary.
      6.11.2.4. Enter the required quantity in the Order Qty field. Use the Add Item feature
      located on the vertical toolbar to add additional items and quantities to the order.
      Continue selecting the Add Item feature until the last item is added.
      6.11.2.5. After all requirements are added to the order, select ―BPS Order‖ to
      immediately process the order or select ―Close‖ to process the order at another time. If
      ―BPS Order‖ is chosen, the order is immediately transmitted to LOG. If ―Close‖ is
      chosen, the order is ‗staged‘ and accessible by accessing the CAIM BPS Order function
      explained in paragraph 6.11.1.
      6.11.2.6. Upon processing the order to LOG, an ESD and IOU transaction are generated
      and written to Transaction History.
  6.11.3. Offline Non-Submit.
      6.11.3.1. Use the CAIM Offline Non-Submit function to document a manual order to
      LOG without submitting an electronic request to LOG. This function is normally not
      used because in almost all instances the customer order is already submitted. In normal
      circumstances, customers use one of the CAIM replenishment functions or logistics
      personnel process a customer request using the IM Orders function. The CAIM Offline
      Submit function explained in paragraph 6.11.2 should be used prior to the Offline Non-
      Submit option. Whichever method is used, the customer must understand the Offline
      Non-Submit function documents the order in CAIM but does NOT submit an order to
      LOG.
      6.11.3.2. From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Offline Non-
      Submit‖ to access this function. Enter the desired item ID in the Non-Submit Offline
      Orders window or select one from the Drop Down Search & Select list. This list defaults
      to ascending sequence by item description but it can also be sorted by item ID sequence.
      Upon entering the item ID, corresponding information from the MTF catalog record
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                223


     automatically populates the Location, Expense Center, and SOS fields. The demand code
     always defaults to recurring and the priority code defaults to 13. Modify these fields as
     necessary.
     6.11.3.3. Enter the required quantity in the Order Qty field. Use the Add Item feature
     located on the vertical toolbar to add additional items and quantities to the order.
     Continue selecting the Add Item feature until the last item is added.
     6.11.3.4. After all requirements are added to the order, select the ―Close‖ button to
     process the order and generate a DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies or Services.
     6.11.3.5. Select the ―New Order‖ button to generate another Offline Non-Submit order.
     6.11.3.6. Upon processing the order, an ESD and IOU transaction are generated and
     written to transaction history.
  6.11.4. Due-In/Due-Out Search.
     6.11.4.1. Use the CAIM Due-in/Due-out Search module to retrieve and review
     customer‘s active and inactive due-in/due-out records. An active record is one that has
     not been received or cancelled; an inactive record has been received or cancelled.
     Additionally, the CAIM Due-in/Due-out Search module is used to adjust a customer‘s
     due-in/due-out quantities. Due-in/due-out searches may be for a particular customer or at
     the MTF level (scope) as explained below:
         6.11.4.1.1. Customer – Displays only due-ins and due-outs associated to the specified
         customer. When a corresponding LOG due-out exists, the customer‘s due-in quantity
         and price cannot be updated.
         6.11.4.1.2. MTF – Displays LOG and customer due-ins and due-outs. This option
         provides customer‘s a method of seeing LOG‘s due-in and due-out status without
         having to contact logistics. Quantity and price adjustments to LOG records are not
         allowed in CAIM.
     6.11.4.2. The CAIM Due-in/Due-out search functions work the same as described for the
     IM Due-in/Due-out search functions explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.14.5. A few
     exceptions for cancellations and revisions apply to customer due-ins and due-outs.
         6.11.4.2.1. The CAIM due-in quantity cannot be revised if a corresponding LOG
         due-out exists. Revisions must be accomplished to the LOG due-out first and then to
         the CAIM due-in.
         6.11.4.2.2. The CAIM due-out quantity cannot be revised if a corresponding CAIM
         due-in exists. Revisions must be accomplished to the LOG due-out and CAIM due-in
         prior to adjusting the CAIM due-out.
         6.11.4.2.3. Since the CAIM due-in and due-out are not linked, both must be revised
         and/or cancelled. If the CAIM due-out is not modified, it will continue to appear in
         BPS as a customer requirement.
  6.11.5. Reprint Contract/Call Documentation. The Reprint Contract/Call Documentation
  function is generally used by logistics personnel as explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.14.7.
  However, if customers desire, this function can be used to print a DD1155 or DD250,
  Material Inspection and Receiving Report, reflecting the customer‘s order(s) to LOG. The
 224                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   orders are divided by contract/call and appear in the Call Register box. Detailed due-in data
   for a specific call is visible in the Due-in Detail box. Select the appropriate print function to
   reprint the required call. When no matches are located for the specified customer, the system
   displays the message ―No orders found for customer!‖
   6.11.6. Resubmit Orders/Follow-up Requests/Cancellations.
       6.11.6.1. In most cases this function is not required for use by CAIM customers. This
       function is primarily used by logistics personnel to resubmit orders directly to vendors.
       However, if a condition exists, customers can use this function to resubmit orders to LOG
       that did not process or was not previously received.
       6.11.6.2. Highlight the files being resubmitted and click the ―Submit‖ button located on
       the vertical toolbar. If multiple records are present, use the ―Shift‖ or ―Control‖ key
       functions to select multiple orders and then click on the ―Submit‖ button to resubmit the
       files.
       6.11.6.3. Alternate submission methods can also be selected for orders being
       resubmitted. In addition to resubmitting an order, customers can also edit the order for
       resubmission or remove the order to prevent it from being resubmitted.
       6.11.6.4. The message ―There are no failed orders to resubmit at this time‖ appears if all
       orders transmitted successfully during the initial process. Click ―OK‖ to return to the
       CAIM main menu.
   6.11.7. Resend to GENTRAN. This CAIM function should not be used by customers.
   Logisticians are responsible for generating and/or resending files to GENTRAN as explained
   in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.14.9.
6.12. Issues. AF policy is that CAIM customers do not possess the authority to resell medical
materiel and therefore should never attempt to issue materiel to other customers. Only
authorized CAIM SOS activities (medical maintenance) that are granted the appropriate
privileges are allowed to process CAIM issues. If a customer attempts to process issues, the
message ―You must be a CAIM SOS to process Issues‖ appears and the customer is forced to
click ―OK‖ to continue.
6.13. Receipts.
   6.13.1. Customers can use the CAIM Receipts function to search for and view materiel
   receipts associated to their account; however, they should not be manually processing
   receipts in CAIM. Per AF policy, only CAIM SOS accounts (medical maintenance
   activities) are authorized to manually process receipts in CAIM. This function is directly
   related to the Verify Receipts indicator located in the Materiel tab of each customer‘s
   SVC/CUST Detail record in SS. The Verify Receipts indicator for all customers should be
   unchecked.
   6.13.2. Because the Verify Receipts indicator is unchecked, receipts for CAIM customers
   automatically process after IM receipts are processed and the delivery list is generated in IM.
   Active CAIM due-ins becomes inactive as a result of that receipt process.
   6.13.3. The automatic receipt action fails if an item is locked at anytime during the process.
   As a result, the affected receipt records are displayed in the Auto Receipts Failed pending
   action, which appears in both the IM and CAIM Inbox. Customers or logisticians must
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              225


   access these records and process the receipts from the pending action. Receipt failures can
   be attributed to one of the following:
       6.13.3.1. Item(s) Locked for Inventory. The inventory must be completed or cancelled
       before the receipt can process.
       6.13.3.2. Due-in/Due-out Out of Balance. Receipt fails if the due-out is less than the
       due-in quantity. Increase the due-out quantity to allow the receipt to process.
6.14. Delivery List. This function is only available to CAIM SOS customers; therefore, it is
restricted to authorized medical maintenance activities.
6.15. Reprint Delivery List. This function is only available to CAIM SOS customers;
therefore, it is restricted to authorized medical maintenance activities.
6.16. Customer Status Edits. Customers can use the Customer Status Edits function to review
status received from LOG. Because LOG is the only SOS for AF customers, the status should
only appear on the Part III, Processed tab.
6.17. QA.
   6.17.1. New QA Complaint. The CAIM New QA Complaint process is the same as the IM
   New QA Complaint process. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.21.2 for a detailed explanation.
   To maintain an effective and efficient QA program, customers should discuss new QA
   complaints and product quality deficiency reporting instructions with the MM Manager prior
   to submitting an IM or CAIM New QA complaint.
   6.17.2. QA Complaint Search. Use the CAIM QA Complaint Search function to retrieve
   QA complaint data associated to new QA complaints submitted by the specified customer.
   6.17.3. QA Customer Responsibilities.
       6.17.3.1. Each SVC/CUST account is responsible for assigning a QA monitor to initiate,
       review, and respond to QA messages and/or complaints. The customer QA monitor is
       responsible for reporting and submitting new QA complaints to the MM Manager as well
       as reviewing and responding to pending actions generated as a result of the AF QA
       program.
       6.17.3.2. The following pending actions are unique to CAIM and require customer
       response to complete the QA process. Refer to Attachment 6, CAIM Pending Action, to
       understand why these pending actions are generated and for an explanation of the
       customer‘s required actions. The LOG QA monitor cannot complete the QA process
       until required customer actions are completed.
            6.17.3.2.1. ―QA Alert. Cust Equipment.‖
            6.17.3.2.2. ―QA Alert. Item Qty Required Cust (Supply).‖
            6.17.3.2.3. ―QA Delinquency Notice. Supply Item Qty Cust.‖
            6.17.3.2.4. ―CAIM QA Complaint Alert. Complaint Exists for Item.‖
6.18. Standard Reports.
   6.18.1. The CAIM Standard Reports module provides customers and logisticians numerous
   standardized reports to use while managing the customer‘s account activity. Because these
 226                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   reports are ‗Standardized,‘ they cannot be modified. Select ―Standard Reports‖ from the
   CAIM Navigate menu or click on the ―Reports‖ button located on the horizontal toolbar to
   access Standard Reports.
   6.18.2. Refer to Chapter 13, Reports, for a brief description of each report in DMLSS along
   with its content and use. Also, a description of all CAIM Standard Reports is available
   within the online Help function. Once in the Reports window, click the ―Help‖ button
   located on the vertical toolbar to access the CAIM Reports reference table.
   6.18.3. Once processed, reports are displayed in the Report Viewer window. The following
   features are available for most reports. Use the ―save to file‖ feature to save the report in
   either text, Excel, .PSR, or clipboard formats. Available formats vary for different reports.
   Some reports can only be saved as a .PSR file; therefore, the data cannot be manipulated in
   other Microsoft software programs (i.e. Excel, Word, etc.).
6.19. Adhoc Reporting. The Adhoc Reporting tool uses Business Objects, a commercial off-
the-shelf software package, to produce customized reports. Customers and logisticians can
utilize this tool to retrieve specific data and/or data formats that are not available using the
Standard Reports function. These reports are produced on demand and are only visible using
BOs.
6.20. Transaction History.
   6.20.1. The Transaction History module maintains 24 months of transaction history. Use the
   CAIM Transaction History function to access up to 24 months of historical data for a
   specified customer. This historical data can be reviewed for reporting purposes or to correct
   errors. Use the Archive Management function to access historical data greater than 24
   months old.
   6.20.2. Select ―Transaction History‖ from the CAIM Navigate menu or click ―Trans
   History‖ located on the horizontal toolbar to access this function. The Transaction Search
   window is divided into two tabs: Generic Search and Search Summary Results.
   6.20.3. In the Generic Search tab, enter search criteria for existing transaction information.
   There are several search options available depending on the nature of the search. Processing
   time can be minimized and search results narrowed by entering as much search criteria as
   possible. The broader the search the longer DMLSS needs to process the search. DMLSS
   also limits search criteria to 500 records; however, the user may reduce the number of search
   records as needed. Search results are displayed in the Search Summary Results tab.
   6.20.4. All historical transactions matching the search criteria are displayed in the Search
   Summary Results tab. When possible, customers should use the Transaction History
   function to conduct a daily review of transactions to verify accuracy. If necessary, corrective
   actions should be accomplished. While all customer transactions are recorded in Transaction
   History, only backorder release issues, destructions, shipping discrepancy gains and losses,
   turn-in adjustment gains and losses, inventory adjustment gains and losses, specific types of
   issues, and specific types of receipts can be reversed. Customers should not process
   transaction reversals and other corrective actions without consent and instruction from
   logistics personnel.
6.21. Mass Updates.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               227


  6.21.1. View Unchanged Expense Centers.
     6.21.1.1. Within DMLSS, a customer‘s catalog records (item locations) are associated to
     the expense center similarly to the way the catalog records are associated to the
     SVC/CUST. If directed to change a customer‘s assigned expense center, use the Change
     Expense Center function explained in Chapter 4, paragraph 4.23.
     6.21.1.2. The View Expense Centers function provides a method for customers and
     logisticians to view and update the record(s), if any, that did not change expense centers
     due to the catalog record being locked at the time the Change Expense Center was
     processed. If this condition exists, the affected records are also displayed in the CAIM
     Unchanged Expense Center Due to Mass Update pending action.
     6.21.1.3. Whether accessed from the View Unchanged Expense Center function or the
     CAIM Unchanged Expense Center Due to Mass Update pending action, users can either
     delete the record and leave them assigned to the originating expense center or access the
     customer detail record and change the assigned expense center to resolve the condition.
     6.21.1.4. Click ―Delete‖ to remove the record and leave assigned to the original expense
     center.
     6.21.1.5. To update the expense center, click the ―Detail‖ button to access the customer‘s
     catalog record. Then click the ―Edit‖ button located at the bottom of the window. Use
     the dropdown menu to reassign the expense center and click ―Save.‖
  6.21.2. Copy Items.
     6.21.2.1. Use the Mass Update Copy Items function to copy one or more catalog records
     from one customer‘s catalog to another customer‘s catalog. This function is useful when
     creating or updating customer catalogs for new customers.
     6.21.2.2. From the CAIM Navigate menu, select ―Mass Update‖ and then ―Copy Items‖
     to access this function.
     6.21.2.3. In the Mass Update/Copy Items window, use the dropdown menu in the Select
     a Customer to copy items from the box to identify the originating customer‘s catalog
     records. Once loaded, the originating customer‘s catalog item IDs and item descriptions
     are displayed in the upper portion of the window.
     6.21.2.4. Next, use the dropdown menu located in the Select a customer to copy items to
     the box to identify the gaining customer‘s account.
     6.21.2.5. Use the ―Shift‖ and/or ―Control‖ key functions to highlight (select) the desired
     records to copy. Once all records are highlighted, click ―Move Down‖ to copy the
     catalog records to the gaining customer‘s catalog. Duplicate records are not copied to the
     new customer.
     6.21.2.6. Delete Feature. If a catalog record was moved to the gaining customer in error,
     highlight the record and click ―Delete‖ on the toolbar. This action removes the catalog
     record from the gaining accounts catalog.
     6.21.2.7. Item Location (Loc) Feature. On the vertical toolbar, click ―Item Locs‖ to view
     the Mass Updates Create Customer Catalog Records window. Make necessary edits to
     the item‘s location, level type, level, and ROP from this window. This step is important
 228                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       because the new customer might not store an item in the same location or may require a
       larger or smaller level for an item. Upon editing the gaining customer‘s catalog data,
       click the ―Process‖ button to process the updates.
       6.21.2.8. As a result of using this function, each record copied appears in the new
       customer‘s Unprinted Critical Barcode Labels pending action. Barcode labels can be
       printed by accessing each record from the pending action.
   6.21.3. Change SOS. The Change SOS function should not be used by customers as its
   purpose is to specify different primary SOSs for items listed on the customer‘s catalog.
   Because AF customers only order materiel from LOG, with potential exception to medical
   maintenance activities, this option is not beneficial.
6.22. Check Available Funds. The Check Available Funds function is available to customers
so they have direct visibility of their fund record. The fund record cannot be modified from
CAIM, but customers can see the fund record details to include their available balance. Select
―Check Available Funds‖ from the CAIM Navigate menu to access the customer‘s fund record.
Customers must be assigned the SS MTF Funding resource in order to access their detailed fund
record. This resource is embedded in the SS Expert and SS Read Only privileges. Since
customers should not load and/or modify fund records, it is highly recommended that the
DMLSS SA assign the SS Read Only privilege or create and assign a local privilege with read
only rights to the SS MTF Funding resource.
6.23. CAIM Utilities Menu.
   6.23.1. CAIM Utilities, Choose Customer. The Choose Customer function allows users to
   specify the customer account in which they are working without having to exit the CAIM
   module. A customer ID can also be designated by clicking on the Customer button located
   on the horizontal toolbar. Once a customer ID is identified, all CAIM actions performed are
   associated to the specified customer‘s account.
   6.23.2. CAIM Utilities, Inbox.
       6.23.2.1. The inbox opens automatically upon accessing the CAIM Module and open
       pending actions are present. Customers may also gain access to the inbox by selecting
       ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities dropdown menu. Customers must be assigned CAIM pending
       actions in SS and UP Assign prior to having visibility in the CAIM module. Pending
       actions are listed by the ―as of‖ dates. A description of CAIM pending actions and their
       recommended use are available in Attachment 6.
       6.23.2.2. Review and work the pending actions daily to ensure proper management of the
       customer‘s account. To initiate a process or report, click on the ―Jump To‖ icon located
       at the bottom of the window. Make changes as required and save actions to complete the
       process. Print any required reports as needed. When processes are complete, close the
       window to return to the inbox. Delete pending actions once they are completed. The
       inbox can be closed or left open while in the CAIM module.
   6.23.3. CAIM Utilities, Adjust Periodic Automatic Resupply (PAR) Levels.
       6.23.3.1. PAR levels in CAIM represent the customer‘s storeroom levels. Customer‘s
       levels and ROPs are established upon creating a new customer catalog record. DMLSS
       generates recommended level changes as a result of processing recurring orders.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               229


     6.23.3.2. Access the Recommended Level Changes window by selecting ―Adjust PAR
     Levels‖ from the CAIM Utilities menu. Customer records are also posted to the CAIM
     Recommended Level Changes pending action after the item obtains 90 days of
     transaction history.
     6.23.3.3. Ordering frequently and allowing the computer to adjust PAR levels results in
     more efficient use of storage space and ensures stock availability when needed.
     Maintaining accurate levels and ROPs allows logistics personnel to better manage
     storeroom stock.
     6.23.3.4. All customer records containing recommended changes to the level, ROP,
     and/or level type are displayed in the Recommended Level Change window. The current
     and suggested level, ROP, and level type are displayed in this window along with other
     catalog management data. Customers or logisticians can accept, modify, or reject the
     recommended changes. When no recommendations exist, the message ―No
     Recommended Level Changes‖ appears as a notification to the user.
         6.23.3.4.1. Accept – Highlight the record(s) for the items you want to accept the new
         level, ROP, and/or level type changes. Click ―Accept‖ to process the changes.
         DMLSS will update the customer‘s catalog record data and remove the item from the
         Recommended Level Change list.
         6.23.3.4.2. Delete - If you want to reject the recommendations, highlight the item
         record(s) and click ―Delete‖ to remove the record(s) from the Recommended Level
         Change Report. The item record is removed until the next recommended levels are
         updated and processed.
         6.23.3.4.3. Modify - In some instances, you may want to reduce or increase an
         inventory level but not to the extent of the DMLSS recommendations. To modify the
         suggested level, ROP, and inventory type, select the item record and click ―Modify.‖
         Enter your desired values in the level, ROP, and/or inventory type and click ―OK‖ to
         update the customer‘s level, ROP, and level type. Click ―Accept‖ to process the
         modified changes.
  6.23.4. CAIM Utilities, Batch Issues Update. Reserved.
  6.23.5. CAIM Utilities, Batch Inventory Update. Reserved.
  6.23.6. CAIM Utilities, Maintain Location.
     6.23.6.1. Use the CAIM Maintain Location function to manage a customer‘s locations
     and storage areas. Customers can establish new, update existing, and/or delete existing
     locations and storage areas.
     6.23.6.2. Select ―Maintain Location‖ from the Utilities dropdown menu to access this
     function. All locations and storage areas assigned to the specified customer are displayed
     in the Add Location window.
     6.23.6.3. To remove a location and storage area, highlight the desired record and click
     the ―Delete‖ button located at the bottom of the window.
     6.23.6.4. To add a new or update an existing location and storage area, highlight an
     existing record and click the ―Detail‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. In the
230                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      Location Detail window, make necessary modifications and click ―Save‖ to process
      updates. To add a new location and storage area, type in the new location ID and storage
      area, select the appropriate record type, and click ―Save‖ to add the new record.
      6.23.6.5. POU, Carousel, and Ready Use locations are explained in paragraph 6.9.9.
  6.23.7. CAIM Utilities, Maintain Pending Action Reports. In the Maintain Pending Action
  Reports window, customers can select action notices to post in the inbox when an action is
  pending. While pending actions are assigned to users in SS UP Assign, this function further
  defines which actions are posted to the user‘s inbox. As a general rule, all pending actions
  should be reviewed; therefore, it is highly recommended that customers elect to have all
  pending actions post to the inbox. Click ―Yes‖ to post the pending action(s) to the inbox and
  click ―No‖ to prevent the pending action from posting.
  6.23.8. CAIM Utilities, Maintain Address. DMLSS contains an address table that is linked
  to other modules such as the SOS module. The address table should be maintained by
  medical logistics personnel using the IM Maintain Address function. However, if used in
  CAIM, the customer‘s address is accessible and can be updated using this function. The
  customer‘s address data resides in the Basic tab of the SS SVC/CUST Detail record.
  6.23.9. CAIM Utilities, Maintain POC. This function helps maintain a single POC record
  while eliminating duplicate entries due to misspelling, different abbreviations, etc.; however,
  the DMLSS POC table should be maintained by medical logistics personnel using the IM
  Maintain POC function. If used in CAIM, the customer‘s POC record is accessible and can
  be updated using this function.
  6.23.10. CAIM Utilities, Override Process. When a record or module is opened by a single
  user, the record becomes locked to all other users and all other processes. If you need access
  to a locked record or process, first contact the user who has it locked and request that he/she
  exit or complete their updates. If you cannot locate that person, use the Override Process
  function to gain control of a locked record or process.
  6.23.11. CAIM Utilities, HHT Model Type. The HHT Model Type function identifies the
  type of HHT being used by the LOG account. The default is set to Janus; however, the
  standard HHT used at AF accounts is the PDA. The available HHT types are: Janus, PDA,
  and Trakker. The HHT Model Type must be updated before batch orders can be processed if
  a different model is purchased and put into use. Click ―OK‖ to save the change.
  6.23.12. CAIM Utilites, Prime Vendor Web Sites. This function provides a link to vendor‘s
  websites. Despite its title, this function is not restricted to PV sources. Select ―Prime
  Vendor Web Sites‖ from the CAIM Utilities menu to access PVP, PVM, ECAT, EMALL,
  QA, and RIC websites. Highlight the desired source and click the ―Go to Web‖ button
  located on the vertical toolbar. DMLSS uses the local internet carrier to access the vendor‘s
  website.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 231


                                           Chapter 7

                                CUSTOMER SUPPORT (CS)

7.1. Purpose. The CS module encompasses supply, equipment, and facility management
functions into a single area. Within CS, supply custodians can submit new item requests and
monitor the status of existing requests. Equipment custodians can submit requests for new
equipment and monitor the status of requested equipment. Additionally, custodians can also
submit equipment work requests to the Biomedical Maintenance manager. Duty section
managers can request new FM work requests, request updated status, and monitor the status of
existing facility work requests. Finally, supply and equipment custodians can check the status of
funds in the CS module as well as process standardized reports designed to assist them in
managing their respective accounts. Many of the functions available in CS are also explained in
other chapters of this manual. In those situations, you may be referred to another chapter for a
detailed explanation of the process.
7.2. Catalog Search.
   7.2.1. The CS Catalog Search function works the same as the IM Catalog Search function
   and is used to search for customer catalog records as well as searching for LOG, MTF,
   ECAT, and other contracted item catalog records. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.3 for a
   detailed explanation. New MTF and customer catalog records must be created using the
   CAIM New Catalog Item function explained in Chapter 6, paragraph 6.2. As stated in
   previous chapters, customers and logistics personnel should attempt to locate an existing
   catalog record by conducting a search prior to creating a new catalog record. Search scopes
   should be set to ―Contracted items‖ before choosing all items since they present the best
   possible monetary savings over open market items.
   7.2.2. The Equivalent and Order Item features available in CS Catalog Search provide
   customers with additional options while conducting searches and submitting requests. Use
   these options as follows:
       7.2.2.1. Equivalent. By clicking the ―Equivalent‖ button located on the vertical toolbar,
       the search results are narrowed to show only those items that are equivalent to the
       originally selected item.
       7.2.2.2. Order Item. The Order Item feature provides customers a method of
       immediately submitting an order for an item found within catalog search. The Order
       Item button appears only for those items with an existing MTF catalog record.
           7.2.2.2.1. In the Catalog Search Results window, highlight the desired item and click
           ―Order Item‖ located on the vertical toolbar. The Add Item to Order Request window
           appears.
           7.2.2.2.2. Within the Add Item to Order Request window, all fields are populated
           with default data. However, the location ID, expense center, priority, quantity,
           demand code, and advice code fields can be modified. The quantity field defaults to
           one so this must be updated prior to clicking the Save button. Figure 7.1 depicts a
           default Add Item to Order Request window.
 232                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 7.1. Add Item to Order Request.




          7.2.2.2.3. Upon clicking ―Save,‖ the request appears in the Order Summary window,
          explained in paragraph 7.5. Click ―Close‖ to return to Catalog Search and/or
          continue adding items to the order. This window reappears each time the Order Item
          button is selected. The order can be executed or deleted at this time.
          7.2.2.2.4. The order remains in a ―pending‖ state if it is not executed or deleted and
          can be accessed anytime using the Order Summary function. Reference explanation
          provided in paragraph 7.5 for executing and/or deleting these orders.
7.3. New Item Request (NIR).
   7.3.1. The NIR is used to submit a request for a supply item that does not have an existing
   customer or LOG catalog record and/or the item has not previously been approved for
   purchase.
   7.3.2. Select ―New Item Request‖ from the CS Navigate menu or click on the ―NIR‖ button
   located on the horizontal toolbar to open a NIR. The NIR (Figure 7.2.) contains required and
   optional data fields. The customer must enter data into the required fields (identified with a
   red dot) and should provide as much of the optional data as possible. All data provided is
   used during the research phase of the NIR process and is important when searching for
   existing catalog records. Note: User may also use Cat Search to find item to be submitted. If
   found during the search, highlight the item and click the ―Add To NIR‖ icon on the vertical
   toolbar.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                233


Figure 7.2. New Item Request Window.




   7.3.3. NIR Data Fields. Use the NIR data fields as explained below:
      7.3.3.1. Customer ID. Defaults to customer ID specified upon entering the CS module.
      7.3.3.2. Expense Center.     Defaults to the default expense center associated to the
      customer ID.
      7.3.3.3. Item Description. Opens text field used by the customer to provide a detailed
      description of the requested item.
      7.3.3.4. U/P. Use the dropdown menu to identify the U/P (i.e. if it is an individual item,
      select ―EA,‖ if package of 10 select ―PG.‖)
      7.3.3.5. U/P Price. Enter the purchasing price of the requested item.
      7.3.3.6. Quantity. Enter the quantity being requested relative to the U/P.
      7.3.3.7. Total Price. Equals the U/P price multiplied by the quantity requested.
      7.3.3.8. Item ID Requirements. A minimum of one of the following item ID numbers
      must be provided in order to purchase the requested item. More than one can be entered
      if the information is available. For example, if both the NSN and MFG‘s catalog number
      are known, enter both into the corresponding fields.
          7.3.3.8.1. MFG‘s Catalog Number - The item ID number assigned by the MFG
          should be loaded in this field. If the item is a pharmaceutical, the MFG‘s catalog
          number is the same as the NDC. Note: This is not the same number as the PVON or
          VCN.
          7.3.3.8.2. NSN - An NSN is a 13-digit numerical number assigned centrally for
          global use and is recognized throughout the DoD. Load the contiguous number into
          this field. Do not use dashes, spaces, prefixes, or suffixes. The AF considers ―NCM‖
          and ―UM‖ numbers valid NSNs (i.e. 6515NCM040423 and 6515011498842UM);
          however, they are unique to WRM and should not be used in a peacetime OPR
          setting.
234                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         7.3.3.8.3. NDC - The NDC should be entered into this field for commodities
         classified as a pharmaceutical. Load the 11-digit contiguous number into this field.
         Do not use dashes, spaces, prefixes, or suffixes.
      7.3.3.9. PVON. The PVON is assigned and only recognizable by the assigning vendor.
      Different vendors most likely will have different PVONs for the same product. Note:
      The PVON is not the same as the NDC or MFG‘s Catalog Number.
      7.3.3.10. Type VIN. This field will most likely be assigned by logistics personnel during
      the review process. ―Type VIN‖ identifies the type of item ID that will be used to
      purchase the requested item. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.2.1.4.23. for a detailed
      explanation for assigning the Type VIN.
      7.3.3.11. Item ID. The item ID should be assigned by logistics personnel during the
      review process. Reference Chapter 5, paragraph 5.2.1.4.2. for a detailed explanation for
      assigning item IDs.
      7.3.3.12. Type Item ID. The Type Item ID should be assigned by logistics personnel
      during the review process. The Type Item ID field identifies the assigned item ID and
      must be in agreement with the number loaded into the Item ID field.
      7.3.3.13. Document Number.      No data is required during the request phase. The
      customer‘s due-in document number (CAIM ESD) automatically populates this field
      when the Ordering Authority processes the customer requirement or an offline order.
      7.3.3.14. Contract Number. The customer can load the contract number during the
      request phase if known. If during the review process, a contract number is linked to the
      item being requested, logistics personnel should load the contract number into this field.
      7.3.3.15. SOS. The SOS dropdown menu is linked to LOG‘s SOS table so this
      information is usually assigned by logistics personnel. However, it can be assigned by
      the customer upon submitting the NIR. Use the ―Jump To‖ button located next to the
      SOS field to search for existing SOS codes.
      7.3.3.16. Recurring. Check this indicator if the requested item will be required on a
      recurring basis. A recurring request is usually an item that will be purchased at least
      monthly, however, the definition of recurring varies.
      7.3.3.17. Estimated Usage/Month. If recurring, identify potential quantity that will be
      used on a monthly basis.
      7.3.3.18. Required Delivery Date (RDD). Identify the date in which the item is required
      to be delivered to the customer.
      7.3.3.19. Advice Code. The Advice Code should be assigned by the Ordering Authority
      during the ordering phase.
      7.3.3.20. Customer Catalog. Check this indicator to automatically add the new record to
      the customer‘s catalog upon approval.
      7.3.3.21. Ozone Depleting Substance. Check this indicator if the item meets the
      definition of an ozone depleting substance.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               235


     7.3.3.22. Vendor Information. The requesting customer must load              the vendor‘s
     information so the Approval and Ordering Authorities know where to           purchase the
     requested item. If a SOS is chosen from the dropdown menu and                the vendor‘s
     information is already stored in the SOS table, these data fields will       automatically
     populate with the stored data.
     7.3.3.23. Justification. Open text field used by the customer to justify the NIR.
  7.3.4. NIR Routing Process.
     7.3.4.1. Originator.
         7.3.4.1.1. The customer‘s user ID is automatically populated in the Originator field
         and the NIR submission date is loaded into the Date field.
         7.3.4.1.2. Upon completing the NIR request, the customer must use the dropdown
         menu to identify the Approval Authority.
         7.3.4.1.3. Click ―Save‖ upon completion. The NIR is automatically forwarded to the
         Approval Authority‘s Inbox for review and approval/disapproval.
         7.3.4.1.4. At this point, the requesting customer can use the NIR Status function to
         monitor the request status.
     7.3.4.2. Approval Authority.
         7.3.4.2.1. The Approval Authority is someone within the customer‘s chain of
         command privileged to approve and/or disapprove NIRs. For example, it may be the
         department head, Officer in Charge (OIC), NCOIC, or the resource advisor.
         Appointed personnel must be provided the CS Approval Authority privilege in SS to
         perform this function.
         7.3.4.2.2. Upon accessing CS, the Approval Authority should access the New Item
         Request pending action and approve or disapprove the NIR.
         7.3.4.2.3. If approved, the Approval Authority must use the dropdown menu to
         assign a logistician to conduct catalog research. Upon saving, the NIR is forwarded
         to the IM New Item Request pending action and appears in the Catalog Research
         Review tab.
         7.3.4.2.4. If disapproved, the Approval Authority should click on the ―Note‖ button
         and provide an explanation for disapproval. The NIR is closed and becomes inactive.
     7.3.4.3. Catalog Research.
         7.3.4.3.1. Catalog research should be accomplished by medical logistics personnel
         using the IM New Item Request pending action. Appointed personnel must be
         assigned the CS NIR Catalog Research privilege in SS to accomplish this task.
         7.3.4.3.2. Thorough research should be conducted to determine whether or not a
         catalog record already exists. When using the IM Catalog Search function, be sure to
         check the ―All Items‖ scope so DMLSS will search the DMLSS Master UDR file.
         Locating and selecting existing catalog records ensures all pertinent catalog
         information is present in the MTF, LOG, and customer catalogs. Additionally, it
         helps to avoid creating and maintaining multiple catalog records for the same item
236                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         using multiple item IDs. Successfully finding an existing catalog record is highly
         dependent upon the customer providing as much information as possible. Note:
         Search scopes should be set to ―Contracted items‖ first and then ―ECAT‖ before
         choosing all items since they present the best possible monetary savings over open
         market items.
         7.3.4.3.3. Reference Chapter 5, paragraph 5.2. for a detailed explanation for creating
         new catalog records and paragraph 5.3. for a thorough explanation on conducting
         catalog searches.
         7.3.4.3.4. By clicking the ―Jump To‖ button located next to the Item ID field,
         DMLSS conducts an automated catalog search based on the catalog criteria provided.
         For example, if the NDC is provided, DMLSS will search for an existing catalog
         record using the NDC number.
         7.3.4.3.5. When the automated catalog search does not produce a match, use all
         available ID data to conduct manual research. To do so, use the IM Catalog Search
         function. When the data is available, use the search criteria in the following
         sequence: Item ID, NSN, NDC, MFG‘s catalog number, UPN, item description, and
         then search by MFG‘s name cross-referencing to item description.
         7.3.4.3.6. Check the Existing Cat indicator if an existing catalog record is located
         during research. When checked, the Item ID field becomes mandatory. If using the
         ―Jump To‖ button, the item ID will automatically populate once the catalog record is
         selected. When a match is found, complete the NIR process using one of the
         following options:
             7.3.4.3.6.1. Disapprove the NIR and establish a customer catalog record for the
             requesting customer. The customer can use the Manual Replenishment function to
             resubmit the item request to LOG.
             7.3.4.3.6.2. Disapprove the NIR, and process an IM Offline Submit/Non-Submit
             order or an IM Customer request and link to the requesting customer ID.
         7.3.4.3.7. Check the No Existing Cat indicator if research does not produce a match
         to an existing catalog record. At this point in the process, a new catalog record can be
         created at any time. However, it is recommended that one be created once the LOG
         Authority has approved the purchase. By doing so, you will prevent the addition of
         catalog records for items that are not going to be purchased, thus preventing
         unnecessary clutter. Once the catalog record is added, enter the item ID and other
         pertinent data into the NIR.
         7.3.4.3.8. Upon completing research, assign someone to conduct the Hazardous
         Materiel Review and click ―Save‖ to update the NIR. The NIR status is updated and
         appears in the Haz Mat Review tab.
      7.3.4.4. Hazardous Materiel Review.
         7.3.4.4.1. The Haz Mat Review should be conducted by medical logistics personnel
         using the IM NIR pending action. However, at least one individual from the BEE
         office should be privileged to conduct the Haz Mat Review. If medical logistics
         determines the item could potentially be hazardous, then he/she should notify the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              237


        BEE that a NIR requires their review. At this point, BEE should log into the NIR and
        annotate the appropriate hazardous identification.
        7.3.4.4.2. Conduct research to determine whether or not the requested item is
        considered hazardous and assign one of the following:
            7.3.4.4.2.1. D – Hazardous; no Hazardous Materiel Information System (HMIS)
            information available.
            7.3.4.4.2.2. N – Non-Hazardous.
            7.3.4.4.2.3. P – may be Hazardous; no HMIS information available.
            7.3.4.4.2.4. Y – Hazardous, Equivalent to ―Hazardous – HMIS information is
            available.‖
        7.3.4.4.3. If the item is found to be hazardous, follow local reporting and storage
        procedures. Also, the appropriate Haz Mat Code, MTF restrictions, special
        requirements, and destruction methods should be loaded into the MTF catalog record
        at this time.
        7.3.4.4.4. Upon completing the review, assign the LOG authority and click ―Save.‖
        The NIR status is updated and now appears in the LOG Authority tab.
     7.3.4.5. LOG Authority.
        7.3.4.5.1. The LOG authority is usually assigned to the Medical Logistics Flight
        Commander, Medical Logistics Flight Chief, NCOIC of Medical Logistics, or
        someone within the MTF that is responsible for fiscal review. Personnel performing
        this task must be assigned the CS LOG Authority privilege.
        7.3.4.5.2. Click the ―Approve‖ indicator to approve the purchase of the requested
        item. Once the Approve button is checked, assign the NIR to an authorized Ordering
        Authority. Upon saving updates, the NIR status is updated and appears in the
        Ordering Authority tab.
        7.3.4.5.3. Click the ―Disapprove‖ indicator to disapprove the purchase of the
        requested item. If disapproved, the LOG authority should use the ―Note‖ feature to
        annotate a reason for disapproval. Disapproved requests are returned to the originator
        and within CS NIR Status, disapproved NIRs appear in the customer‘s Disapproved
        tab. In IM, the records are marked as inactive and appear in the NIR Administrator
        tab.
     7.3.4.6. Ordering Authority.
        7.3.4.6.1. The Ordering Authority is medical logistics personnel authorized to
        purchase the requested item. If not already completed, the catalog record must be
        established so the item can be purchased. The CS Ordering Authority privilege must
        be assigned to personnel authorized to purchase new item requests.
        7.3.4.6.2. From the IM New Item Request - Ordering Authority tab, the purchasing
        agent can process the order by creating a customer request or by placing an offline
        order.
 238                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          7.3.4.6.3. Click the ―Cust Req‖ button to create a customer requirement for the
          requested item. This action establishes a CAIM ESD transaction and generates a
          CAIM IOU transaction. A requirement for this item will appear in LOG Orders and
          associated to the assigned SOS.
          7.3.4.6.4. Click the ―Offline‖ button if the item is to be ordered immediately without
          sending the requirement to LOG Orders. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.14.3. for a
          detailed explanation on processing offline orders. Using this option generates a
          CAIM ESD and IOU as well as an IM ESD and IOU.
          7.3.4.6.5. The customer‘s due-in document number (CAIM ESD) automatically
          populates the Document Number field upon processing the customer requirement or
          an offline order.
          7.3.4.6.6. Within IM, the record is marked as inactive and appears in the NIR
          Administrator tab. Within CS NIR Status, the record appears in the Completed tab.
   7.3.5. Additional NIR features.
       7.3.5.1. Delete. If the NIR is disapproved and will not be resubmitted, it can be removed
       from the pending action by clicking ―Delete.‖
       7.3.5.2. Clear Status. If the NIR has been disapproved by the approval or LOG
       authority, they should have provided an explanation. Based on their reasoning, you may
       decide to resubmit the request. Click the ―Clear Status‖ button to remove all approval
       status from the NIR routing section. Make appropriate edits to address the original
       rejection reason. Reassign to the approval authority and resubmit the request.
       7.3.5.3. Print. Click ―Print NIR‖ to obtain a printed version of the NIR.
7.4. New Item Request Status. The CS NIR Status function provides customers a method of
monitoring their NIR(s) status. The five stages of approval/disapproval are as follows.
   7.4.1. Approval Required. In this stage, the NIR(s) is waiting for approval or action from
   the customer.
   7.4.2. Being Processed. In this stage, the NIR(s) are waiting for approval or action from
   LOG (IM personnel).
   7.4.3. Completed. NIR(s) that have been completed, ordered, and/or received appear in the
   Completed tab.
   7.4.4. Disapproved. NIR(s) that have been disapproved appear in this tab.

          completing the equipment request, the custodian must hand deliver the indicated
          document(s) to the MEMO office.
          7.13.3.1.21. Click ―Save‖ located on the vertical toolbar once all data is entered into
          the Main tab. Upon saving, an equipment request number is assigned and the
          remaining tabs become available. The custodian is responsible for adding additional
          data into the Replacement ECN, Supplies, Training, and Suggested Sources tabs. If
          no additional information is available the request can be submitted at this time.
      7.13.3.2. Replacement ECN(s) Tab. If the request type is Accelerated Replacement or
      Normal Replace, use this tab to identify the ECN(s) of the existing equipment item(s)
      being replaced. Replacement and/or upgrade comments can also be added for future
      reference. MEMO and maintenance personnel use this information to verify turn-in of
      replaced equipment upon issue of the new equipment.
244                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      7.13.3.3. Supplies Tab. Use the ―Add‖ button to specify supplies and/or replacement
      parts to be purchased in conjunction with the equipment purchase. Use the ―Delete‖
      button to remove supplies and/or replacement parts that were erroneously added.
      7.13.3.4. Training Tab. If operator training is required, the custodian must check the
      Training Required indicator and enter detailed training information. If necessary,
      maintenance personnel will add their training needs into this tab during the review
      process.
      7.13.3.5. Suggested Sources Tab. Use this tab to identify at least three suggested sources
      for the requested item. Place a ―check‖ in the Primary Source box to indicate which
      source is the primary or preferred source of purchase. If the Sole Source indicator on the
      Main tab is checked and a sole source letter is provided to MEMO, then only one
      suggested source is required.
  7.13.4. While it is possible for the custodian to complete additional information, MEMO,
  maintenance, and FM personnel usually complete the remaining tabs. Therefore, the
  custodian may click the ―Submit‖ button at this time to process the equipment request. Note:
  Once the equipment request is submitted, the custodian is limited to viewing the request and
  he/she cannot add or edit information.
  7.13.5. Appointed MEMO personnel access the request from the EM Customer Equipment
  Request Submitted pending action. MEMO personnel should refer to the explanation
  provided in Chapter 9, paragraph 9.10. to complete the process.
  7.13.6. Equipment Request Search.
      7.13.6.1. The Equipment Request Search function provides equipment custodians a
      method of retrieving one or more Equipment Request records. Custodians use this
      function to monitor the status of their Equipment requests.
      7.13.6.2. In the Equipment Request Search window, the ORG and customer ID default to
      the custodian‘s account information. Leave all search criteria fields empty and click
      ―Search‖ to retrieve all equipment request records.
      7.13.6.3. Enter specific search criteria into one or more of the following search criteria
      fields:
         7.13.6.3.1. Item ID – Normally assigned by MEMO personnel upon approval so the
         item ID may not always be available.
         7.13.6.3.2. Nomenclature – The dropdown menu provides defaults to the
         standardized equipment device nomenclature table and does not reflect the short item
         description provided in the Main tab.
         7.13.6.3.3. Fund Type – Select either OP Fund (Capital) or Expense.
         7.13.6.3.4. Request Number – Only request numbers assigned to the custodian‘s
         equipment requests appear in the dropdown menu.
         7.13.6.3.5. Request Status – Available stages of a request are approved, awaiting
         approval, cancelled, customer request, disapproved, filled by excess, and new request.
         Upon initial submission, new request is assigned and then updated as the request
         flows through the approval process.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 245


          7.13.6.3.6. Fund Status – The Fund Status field is blank until the request is approved.
          At that time, ―Unfunded‖ is assigned unless MEMO personnel modify the funding
          information located in the Status tab. Depending upon available funds, the Fund
          Status may be updated to reflect Funded or Partial Funded.
          7.13.6.3.7. Order Status – The Order Status remains blank until the funding
          information is loaded into the Status tab. Initially, ―Not Ordered‖ is assigned until
          MEMO personnel process an order for the requested item or the request is cancelled.
          Depending on the state of the order, Cancelled, Ordered, or Partial Ordered is
          assigned.
          7.13.6.3.8. Receipt Status – Once the order is submitted, the Receipt Status is
          updated to Open Due-Outs. This status is updated to Partial Received or Received
          respectively, when a partial or complete receipt is processed in EM.
          7.13.6.3.9. Request Type – This is directly related to the Request Type assigned by
          the custodian upon completing the equipment request. Available types are listed in
          paragraph 7.13.3.1.4.
7.14. New Equipment Work Order.
   7.14.1. Equipment custodians can use the New Equipment Work Order function to submit
   equipment work order requests to medical maintenance. This function provides an
   automated method to communicate needs rather than the custodian leaving the duty section
   to visit the maintenance shop. To access the New Work Order window, select ―New
   Equipment Work Order‖ from the CS Navigate menu or click on the ―New Equipment Work
   Order‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar.
   7.14.2. Within the New Work Order window, only five data fields are available for edit, all
   of which are mandatory. These data fields are used as follows:
      7.14.2.1. ECN – Obtain the ECN from the equipment tag/label and enter into this field.
      The equipment ID data, work order details, and custodian‘s information is automatically
      populated upon entering the ECN.

       7.14.4.1. Revert – Click the ―Revert‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to reset all
       data fields to their original state, since the last save.
       7.14.4.2. Print – Click ―Print‖ to print a copy of the request.
       7.14.4.3. Cancel – Click ―Cancel‖ to withdraw the equipment work order request. The
       request is automatically removed from the MA Customer Work Order pending action
       upon cancelling the request.
7.15. Open Equipment Work Order.
   7.15.1. Custodians can use this function to monitor the work order status of their assigned
   equipment. Multiple search criteria options exist to help locate specific records. Select
   ―Open Equipment Work Order‖ from the CS Navigate menu to access the Work Order
   Search window.
   7.15.2. In the Work Order Search window, the Scope field defaults to search for open work
   orders and the ORG and Customer fields default to the custodian‘s assigned ORG and
   customer account. The remaining optional fields are blank at this time.
   7.15.3. In the default window, click ―Search‖ to retrieve all open work orders. Use the
   remaining search criteria fields to narrow your search and minimize the search results.
       7.15.3.1. Scope – Check the Open indicator to search for only open work orders. Check
       the Completed indicator to search for only completed and cancelled work orders. Check
       both indicators to search for all work orders.
       7.15.3.2. ECN – Enter an ECN to search for a specific work order.
       7.15.3.3. Work Order – Enter the ―From‖ and ―To‖ work order numbers to conduct a
       work order search for a series of work orders.
       7.15.3.4. Request Date – Enter ―From‖ and ―To‖ dates to search for work orders that
       were requested within the specified time frame.
       7.15.3.5. Class – Use the dropdown menu to specify the equipment device class assigned
       to the equipment item(s). The dropdown options are linked to the device class table and
       cannot be modified.
       7.15.3.6. Maintenance Activity – Use the dropdown menu to identify or conduct a search
       for work orders assigned to a specific MA.
       7.15.3.7. MFG – Enter a MFG‘s name to conduct a search for work orders associated to
       a specific MFG. The MFG‘s dropdown menu is linked to the DMLSS MFG table.
       7.15.3.8. Category – Select either scheduled or unscheduled to minimize your search
       results.
       7.15.3.9. MFG Serial Number – Enter the MFG‘s serial number to search for a specific
       equipment record.
   7.15.4. Custodians can only request cancellation of work order requests that he/she
   generated using the CS New Equipment Work Order request.
7.16. Equipment Sub-custodian.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 247


   7.16.1. The Equipment Sub-custodian function provides equipment custodians a method to
   associate guardianship of specific equipment to an individual(s) within his/her area of
   responsibility. For example, the appointed equipment custodian for the Dental Clinic is
   accountable for all equipment owned by the Dental Clinic. However, each treatment room
   usually contains similar equipment and each room is usually assigned to a specific dental
   technician. The equipment custodian could use the sub-custodian function to associate a
   specific treatment room‘s equipment, by ECN, to the technician assigned to that treatment
   room. Likewise, a custodian could use this function when he/she is responsible for
   equipment that is stored or used in different buildings.
   7.16.2. Per AFI 41-209, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.3.6.2., the MTF Commander or designated
   Squadron Commander appoints, in writing, property (equipment) custodians to support
   medical logistics in the requisition, management, accountability, and maintenance of
   equipment in the using activities. Therefore, using the sub-custodian function does not
   constitute the transfer of responsibility. Using this function is simply a means to assist the
   equipment custodian in safe guarding the equipment within his/her area of responsibility.
7.17. New Quality Complaint. The CS New QA Complaint process is the same as the IM and
CAIM New QA Complaint process. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.21.2 for a detailed
explanation. To maintain an effective and efficient QA program, customers should discuss new
QA complaints and product quality deficiency reporting instructions with the MM Manager prior
to submitting a New QA Complaint.
7.18. Search Quality Complaints. The CS Search Quality Complaint function is the same as
the IM and CAIM QA Complaint Search functions. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.21.3 for a
detailed explanation covering this function.
7.19. Check Available Funds. The CS Check Available Funds function mimics the CAIM
Check Available Funds function and provides customers with direct visibility of their fund
record. The fund record cannot be modified from CS, but customers can see the fund record
details to include their available balance. Select ―Check Available Funds‖ from the CS Navigate
menu to access the Customer Fund record.
7.20. Choose Customer. The CS Choose Customer function is the same as the CAIM Choose
Customer function and allows users to specify the customer account in which they are working
without having to exit the CS module. A customer ID can also be designated by clicking on the
―Customer‖ button located on the horizontal toolbar. Once a customer ID is identified, all CS
actions performed are associated to the specified customer‘s account.
7.21. Inbox. CS Inbox messages or pending actions are generated as a result of customers
initiating a NIR or work request. Therefore, CS pending actions are not assigned in SS, UP
Assign. Customers must access the CAIM Inbox to review and take action on alert notices as
explained in Chapter 6, paragraph 6.23.2. A list of CAIM pending actions to include an
explanation of use is available in Attachment 6.
7.22. User Preference. Customers should use the User Preference feature to specify whether or
not they want to receive a message in their inbox when a submitted work request has been
opened by the facility manager. To receive messages, place a check in the Opened Work
Request Notification indicator box and click ―OK.‖ Remove the check to terminate the
messages.

                             ASSEMBLAGE MANAGEMENT

8.1. Purpose. Assemblage Management (AM) is the DMLSS module used to manage your
WRM programs and Customer Owned (CO) programs such as Medical Counter-Chemical
Biological Radiological Nuclear (MC-CBRN) and Pandemic Flu items. Maintaining WRM
assemblages properly is critical to the overall effectiveness of the WRM and CO programs.
DMLSS streamlines the processes and allows for greater flexibility in asset management. This
section addresses procedures used to manage those programs.
   8.1.1. For privileged users, the AM Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the AM
   module from the DMLSS System Navigation window. It can also be viewed by selecting
   ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities menu. Users must be assigned the AM User Pending Action
   privilege and be associated to pending actions for the inbox to appear. The AM Inbox
   contains many pending actions that are either advisory in nature or require user action.
   DMLSS will automatically remove some action items from the inbox upon processing, while
   other advisory notices should be removed or deleted upon review and when no longer
   needed. A detailed list of AM pending actions and their recommended use is available in
   Attachment 7. AM pending actions should be reviewed and worked daily to ensure proper
   management of all assemblages.
   8.1.2. The AM main window also appears once AM is launched from the DMLSS System
   Navigation window. In this window, users can access the modules and functionalities of AM
   mainly through the menu options. In some cases, you can also use the buttons on the
   horizontal toolbar at the top of the window to open AM module windows. While on any AM
   primary window, you have access to the same menu bar and horizontal toolbar buttons. Each
   module window, however, displays a unique set of vertical toolbar buttons on the right side
   of these window.
   8.1.3. The main modules covered in the remainder of this chapter in the same order as they
   appear in the Navigate dropdown menu located on the menu toolbar.
8.2. Assemblage Record Data. The first option on the AM Navigate dropdown menu is the
Assemblage Record Data window. It provides a single view for all assigned WRM assemblage
records maintained in DMLSS-AM. It can be used to view single line items within an
assemblage with or without multiple location records; and the user has the ability to move
throughout all the item records within an assemblage. Use the Assemblage Record Data window
to add, update, merge or split locations, process gains and losses, set and manage relationships
including prime/sub, manage critical, deferred and commingled codes, and utilize other
functions via the vertical toolbar without having to exit the assemblage data record. To access
this window, select this option from the navigate menu or click on the ―Assemblage‖ button
located on the horizontal toolbar.
   8.2.1. Assemblage Record Data Criteria. The Assemblage Record Data Criteria window
   Figure 8.1. is the first window to appear after accessing the Assemblage Record Data option
   and is used to select the applicable assemblage record data criteria . The following data
   search criteria and management options are available in this window:
 250                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 8.1. Assemblage Record Data Criteria Window.




       8.2.1.1. ORG – Select primary ORG (DODAAC) or a specific sub-ORG.
       8.2.1.2. Assemblage – Assemblages are listed by ORG ID. Utilize the type assist for
       expedited assemblage identification and then highlight the desired assemblage from the
       available list.
       8.2.1.3. Item ID – Use the type assist feature or utilize the drop down to select the
       desired item ID.
       8.2.1.4. Include Sub ORGs - If this field is checked, all ORGs and associated
       assemblages will appear in the assemblage list.
       8.2.1.5. Delete Location Field - The Delete Location Record When On-Hand Quantity Is
       Zero field is a management tool that prompts DMLSS to automatically delete location
       record(s) when the OH quantity is zero. This function works in conjunction with the AM
       Location Delete Indicator located on the Basic tab of the MM Service Detail record in
       SS. The default is set to ―No‖ if the AM Delete Location Indicator in SS is not set. If the
       indicator is set, then the default in the Assemblage Record Data Criteria screen defaults
       to ―Y.‖ The preferred method is to set (or check) the AM Delete Location Indicator in
       the MM Service Detail record (see Attachment 2).
       8.2.1.6. Search/Close/Delete buttons – The ―Search‖ button opens the assemblage record
       for the identified item. The ―Close‖ button closes the assemblage record data criteria
       screen without taking any action. The ―Delete‖ button can delete an entire assemblage if
       it was erroneously added to the ORG due to a Standard Assemblage Add (paragraph
       8.21) with the condition that the assemblage/subassemblage does not contain on-hand
       balances or have funds associated to it. If either of these conditions exist, the delete
       button will not appear.
          8.2.1.6.1. On the Assemblage Record Data Criteria screen select the organization
          from the dropdown list. Select the assemblage to be deleted and click ―Delete.‖
          8.2.1.6.2. At the message prompt. ―Do you want to delete selected assemblage?‖
          click ―Yes.‖ The Assemblage Record Data Criteria screen will update with
          assemblage deleted. Click ―Close.‖
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                251


   8.2.2. Navigating in the Assemblage Record Data Window. The Assemblage Record Data
   window Figure 8.2 opens in the position of the selected Item ID. This window provides most
   of the information a user needs to perform assemblage record updates.

Figure 8.2. Assemblage Record Data Window.




      8.2.2.1. The top portion of the window allows you to scroll forward and/or backwards
      through all of the assemblage‘s data records using the VCR buttons. Users also have the
      option to search for specific item ID records.
      8.2.2.2. The next window segment provides the corresponding assemblage information
      based on the search criteria. The ORG ID, assemblage and sub-assemblage data,
      assemblage description, unit training code (UTC) if loaded, build control number (BCN),
      date of the last inventory, and as of date are displayed.
      8.2.2.3. Following the assemblage information is the management information for each
      line item found in the assemblage and the allowance standard quantities. This view
      provides a quick overview of the line items position in the inventory and assemblage
      without having to move between other windows. Users can view or make changes to the
      MTF catalog record by clicking the ―Jump To‖ icon next to the Item ID field. Note:
      Using the Jump To button produces a message warning that the record is locked. Click
      ―Yes‖ to see the lock details or click ―No‖ to view the MTF catalog record. Chances are
      you are the one locking the record.
      8.2.2.4. Below the management information view are special requirements and inventory
      stratifications. The special requirements view is populated by the special requirements
      tab from the MTF catalog record. Updates to the special requirements field must be
      completed in the MTF catalog record.
      8.2.2.5. The inventory stratification state is populated, by item ID, for all assemblage
      data records maintained under the selected item ID Figure 8.3. When a stratification state
      is changed, the change will be reflected in this field along with the quantities by
      stratification state.
 252                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 8.3. Special Requirements and Stratification State.




   8.2.3. Updating Location Record Data.
       8.2.3.1. The individual location records are displayed at the bottom of the Assemblage
       Record Data window Figure 8.4. The list displays all location records associated to that
       Item ID and can be sorted in any sequence by clicking a column header. Information
       within the location records can be reviewed and modified within the Assemblage Record
       Data window without having to navigate to another window or AM function.

Figure 8.4. Assemblage Data (location) Records by Item.




       8.2.3.2. Another function of this view is the ability to use ―COPY and PASTE‖ in the
       data fields to update common information. Using the Manufacturer (MFG) field as an
       example, Abbott Labs may be spelled multiple ways. A user can copy the correct
       spelling, highlight the remaining rows, and paste the correct spelling in the specified data
       field.
       8.2.3.3. The ―On-Hand Qty‖ field contains a calculator function to allow the user to
       make quick calculations when modifying data. This function helps when processing
       adjustments to the assemblage data record. Click the calculator when processing gains
       and losses to the inventory. Enter the total quantity counted. DMLSS will calculate the
       adjustment quantities based on input. Select the proper gain/loss reason and complete the
       transaction. Upon processing, the OH quantity is adjusted to reflect the new quantity.
       8.2.3.4. Many changes to an assemblage data record can be made without saving the data
       each time adjustments are made. Users can click ―Save‖ anytime or DMLSS will
       compile the changes upon closing the window. There are two exceptions to this standard
       − changes to OH quantity and changes to stratification state. New entries to either of
       these positions locks the field and it cannot be modified until the new data is saved. Both
       of these fields update the financial position of the inventory and must be controlled to
       ensure the correct financial data is posted to accountable financial records.
       8.2.3.5. Use the location record data fields to manage assemblages as follows:
          8.2.3.5.1. Location – Identifies storage location of the item.
          8.2.3.5.2. Sub-Location – Further specifies the item‘s storage location.
          8.2.3.5.3. OH Quantity – The actual OH quantity of that item, in that location and
          sub-location, with identical QA data such as lot number, MFG‘s name, and date, etc.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      253


        If the item is stored in a single location but has different lot numbers, then two
        location records should be maintained; one for each lot number.
        8.2.3.5.4. Stratification State – Identifies the item‘s inventory stratification state.
     8.2.3.6. Maintain Location. DMLSS contains an AM Location table that is used to
     manage location and sub-location codes. These codes have a ―parent/child‖ relationship
     whereby the sub-location is directly linked to the location code. For example, if multiple
     warehouses are used to store WRM assets and each warehouse contains a ―SHELF1‖
     sub-location; then ―WAREHOUSE1‖ and ―WAREHOUSE2‖ must both be assigned a
     sub-location of ―SHELF1.‖ Use the add, edit, and delete features to manage WRM
     location and sub-location codes.
  8.2.4. Assemblage Record Data Screen Toolbar Icons.
     8.2.4.1. Relationship Icon. Use the Relationship button to display a list of associated
     substitute item IDs (paragraph 8.9) and End/Support item details (paragraph 8.10).
     End/Support item associations are items identified as a component of an end item or an
     end item associated to a component. This relationship is not restricted to equipment; it
     can also be used to identify supply items that are required in order to use the end item.
     For example, you might have specific IV tubing associated to a specific type of IV fluid.
     These relationships should be periodically reviewed by a clinician to ensure proper
     medical support is available during contingencies.
     8.2.4.2. Set Codes Icon. This option is a shortcut to the Item Code Change window. Use
     this function to apply and/or remove critical, deferred, and commingled codes for the
     specified line item. Refer to paragraph 8.7. for further explanation of these codes.
     8.2.4.3. Add Location Icon (Gain Location). Use the Add Location function to gain OH
     inventory into the Assemblage Record Data for the specified item ID. This function
     should only be used when an identical location record does not already exist. If the
     required location record including identical QA data already exists, then modify the
     quantity within the existing location record rather than adding another location.
        8.2.4.3.1. Enter the quantity you are gaining and any other applicable fields such as
        sub location. Click ―Enter‖ on the keypad and then Select the Transaction Reason on
        the Gain Type Select screen. Click ―OK.‖
        8.2.4.3.2. In the Assemblage Record Data window enter any additional information if
        available. Click ―OK.‖
        8.2.4.3.3. In the Assemblage Record Data window the Loc ID defaults to NONE and
        the O/H Qty is updated to reflect the gained quantity. In the Loc ID field dropdown
        list select the location. If the location of the item is not in the Loc ID field dropdown
        list, the user must add the location. Edit other fields as necessary and click ―Save‖ on
        the vertical toolbar.
     8.2.4.4. Split Location Icon. Use the Split Location function to separate a single location
     record into two location records.
        8.2.4.4.1. This function should be used when the existing location record contains the
        correct OH quantity, but the QA record data differs. For example, the correct
        location quantity is ten; but six bottles are from manufacturer ―AAA‖ and four bottles
 254                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          are from manufacturer ―BBB.‖ The benefit of using the Split Location is that this
          function does not generate gain and loss transactions because the same OH quantity is
          maintained.
          8.2.4.4.2. Highlight the location record being split, and then click on the ―Split
          Location‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Enter the quantity being moved to
          the new location record. DMLSS reduces the OH quantity in the existing location
          record and creates a new location record placing the specified quantity in the OH
          quantity field. The remaining data fields must be populated and updates saved prior
          to exiting the window.
       8.2.4.5. Merge Location Icon. Use the Merge Location function to consolidate two
       separate location records into a single location record. Use this function when the
       existing location records are identical including location, sub-location, lot number, etc. It
       should also be used when two or more locations are merging into one to save physical
       storage space. The benefit of using the Merge Location is that this function does not
       generate gain and loss transactions because the total OH quantity remains unchanged.
          8.2.4.5.1. Select the location record being merged (the record you are not keeping)
          and click the ―Merge Loc‖ icon. In the Change Location for Strat State window
          Figure 8.5., enter the transfer quantity into the location record where the materiel is
          physically located. OH quantities can be merged into a single location record or
          multiple location records. Click ―OK‖ to merge the data.

Figure 8.5. Change Location for Strat State Window.




          8.2.4.5.2. If only a partial amount was moved (or merged) into another location, the
          location record will remain with the adjusted OH quantity. The old location record
          may remain with a zero OH quantity if the ―AM Delete Location‖ indicator is not set.
          Use the Delete Loc function (paragraph 8.2.4.6.) to remove location records with a
          remaining OH quantity of zero.
       8.2.4.6. Delete Location Icon. Within the Assemblage Record Data window, use the
       Delete Location function to remove a location record that is no longer required. This
       option is only available for location records with an OH quantity of zero. Location
       records appear with a zero OH quantity when one of the following two conditions exist:
          8.2.4.6.1. The AM Location Delete indicator in the MM Service Detail record (see
          Attachment 2) is not checked and the Delete Location indicator for the assemblage is
          set to ―No‖ in the Assemblage Record Data Criteria window.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    255


          8.2.4.6.2. Item(s) exist for review on the AM pending action AM Gains Incomplete
          Because of Price Factor.
          8.2.4.6.3. To delete, select a location record with zero OH quantities in the
          assemblage. Click ―Delete Loc‖ and the location record is removed from the
          assemblage.
      8.2.4.7. WRM Prime/Sub Icon. Use the WRM Prime/Sub (P/S) function to establish or
      modify a P/S relationship associated to an item ID in the assemblage data record. An
      ―Allow Qty (U/S)‖ must be present for the prime item before this option becomes
      available. Refer to paragraph 8.9. for detailed explanation on P/S relationships.
8.3. Assemblage Item Transfer.
   8.3.1. Use the Assemblage Item Transfer function to transfer individual assemblage data
   records between assemblages and/or sub-assemblages. Transfers can be processed within the
   same ORG or between two different ORGs.
   8.3.2. Individual item transfers can be accomplished between two customer owned
   assemblages, but only when the same customer owns the assemblages.
   8.3.3. Select ―Assemblage Item Transfer‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu to access
   this function. In the Assemblage Item Transfer Criteria window Figure 8.6, use the available
   search criteria to locate the desired record(s). The criteria window is separated into two
   parts: Source Assemblage and Destination Assemblage.

Figure 8.6. Assemblage Item Transfer Criteria Window.




   8.3.4. Source Assemblage.
      8.3.4.1. ORG. Identify the source ORG. All assemblages associated to the specified
      ORG are displayed as available assemblages. Utilize the Include Sub Orgs checkbox to
      display assemblages from all subordinate organizations.
      8.3.4.2. Item ID. Specify the item ID being transferred.
      8.3.4.3. Stratification (Strat) State. Specify the Strat State of the assemblage data record.

      window.
 256                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       8.3.4.4. Location ID. If known, specify the location code of the source assemblage
       location record. If left blank, all location records meeting the search criteria are
       retrieved. Use the ―through‖ feature to search for records assigned a specific series of
       locations, i.e. ―SHELF1‖ through ―SHELF5.‖
       8.3.4.5. Sub-Location. If known, enter the sub-location of the source assemblage
       location record. If left blank, all location records meeting the search criteria are
       retrieved. The sub-location works in conjunction with the location ID. Use the
       ―through‖ feature to search for records assigned a specific series of locations, i.e. ―BOX
       1‖ through ―BOX 5.‖
   8.3.5. Destination Assemblage. In the ―Organization‖ field, specify the ORG that owns the
   assemblage in which the assets are being transferred. All assemblages owned by the
   specified ORG are displayed. Highlight the gaining assemblage.
   8.3.6. Assemblage Item Transfer window. Upon clicking ―Search,‖ the location data records
   meeting the specified search criteria are displayed in the Assemblage Item Transfer window.
   Enter the ―Transfer Qty‖ for each location record being transferred and click ―Save.‖ Select
   ―Yes‖ when prompted to print a delivery list. Use the delivery list to relocate the transferr ed
   assets.
   8.3.7. The transfer process generates an ITL transaction for all assets transferred from the
   losing ORG/assemblage and an ITG transaction for all assets transferred to the gaining
   ORG/assemblage. These transactions are written to Transaction History and all ITLs and
   ITGs are assigned the same document number from document serial block 8000-8499, Gains
   and Losses.
8.4. Mass Update Assemblage Record. This function provides a method for assemblage
managers to update multiple assemblage data records simultaneously. Utilize this screen as a
timesaving tool by applying modifications to specific targeted information in mass.
   8.4.1. Select ―Mass Update Assemblage Record‖ from the AM Navigate dropdown menu or
   click on ―Mass Update‖ located on the horizontal toolbar to access this tool. In the Mass
   Update Assemblage Record Criteria window Figure 8.7, identify the desired ORG and
   assemblage(s). Narrow your search results by selecting the desired assemblage(s) and
   entering a single search criteria field (i.e. Location) or multiple fields to further narrow
   search results (i.e. Location and Sub-Location). Multiple assemblages can be viewed at the
   same time. Use search criteria fields as follows:
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 257

      8.4.1.1. Select either the ―Supplies‖ or ―Equipment‖ radio button to limit the search to
      the selected commodity.
      8.4.1.2. Incomplete Flag - Limits search results to location records where the incomplete
      flag indicator is checked.
      8.4.1.3. Record locking indicators.
         8.4.1.3.1. No Lock. In the Mass Update screen, the default locking scheme is set to
         ―No Lock‖ which implies that multiple users can access the same Assemblage ID
         records in Mass Update simultaneously. Record integrity applies with this option; the
         last ―Save‖ action updates the record.
         8.4.1.3.2. Row-Locked. When Row-Lock is selected, all records become uneditable
         to other AM users when a check mark is entered in the ―SEL‖ indicator box.
         8.4.1.3.3. Pre-Lock. When Pre-Locking is selected all records default with a check
         mark in the ―SEL‖ indicator box; therefore, the records are uneditable to other AM
         users until the check mark is removed.
      8.4.1.4. Item ID – Limits results to specified item ID within the specified assemblage(s).
      8.4.1.5. Location ID – When a single location is entered, DMLSS limits search results in
      the selected assemblage(s) to the specified location. When using the location ―through‖
      criteria, DMLSS displays the identified locations and all locations between the beginning
      and ending locations.
      8.4.1.6. Sub Location – When a single sub-location is entered, DMLSS limits search
      results in the selected assemblage(s) to the specified sub-location. When using the sub-
      location ―through‖ criteria, DMLSS displays the identified sub-locations and all those
      between the beginning and ending sub-locations.
      8.4.1.7. Manufacturer Name - Returns location records in the selected assemblage(s) that
      match the specified manufacture‘s name. The manufacturer name must be spelled the
      same as it is listed in the location record to ensure a match.
 258                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       8.4.1.8. Lot Number - Returns only those items in the selected assemblage(s) that match
       the specified lot number. The lot number must be an identical match to the location
       record to find a match.
       8.4.1.9. Original Expiration Date – When a single expiration date is entered, DMLSS
       limits the search results for the selected assemblage(s) to the specified expiration date.
       When using the Original Expiration Date ―through‖ criteria, DMLSS retrieves the
       location records with an original expiration date matching the specified dates and all
       expiration dates between the beginning and ending dates.
       8.4.1.10. Revised Expiration Date - When a single expiration date is entered, DMLSS
       limits the search results for the selected assemblage(s) to the specified expiration date.
       When using the Revised Expiration Date ―through‖ criteria, DMLSS retrieves the
       location records with a revised expiration date matching the specified dates and all
       expiration dates between the beginning and ending dates.
   8.4.2. Mass Update Assemblage window Figure 8.8. After the search criteria is selected,
   click ―Search‖. The search results are displayed in the Mass Update Assemblage window.
   Within this window, individual records can be updated or multiple records can be updated

       advanced utilities menu; and then select ―Save Column Settings.‖ Using this function
       saves the column settings for that user and that PC only. Each time the user accesses
       Mass Updates, the column settings will appear as they were when last saved.
       8.4.2.4. Selecting Records for Update – To select an individual record, simply click on
       the desired row. Use the Shift and Control keys same as other windows based programs
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 259


     to select multiple rows for update. The Shift key is used to select a sequence or
     consecutive rows and the Control key is used to select random or non-sequential rows.
     8.4.2.5. Select All – The Select All button is located in the upper right corner of the Mass
     Update Assemblage window. If the ensuing update applies to all location records, click
     ―Select All‖ to select or highlight all records.
     8.4.2.6. Set to Incomplete – Selecting this button inserts a check mark into the
     Incomplete Record indicator for all location records highlighted.
     8.4.2.7. Set to Complete – Selecting this button removes the check mark from the
     Incomplete Record indicator for all location records highlighted.
     8.4.2.8. Apply Button – This button is used to apply the ―new‖ data to the selected
     location records.
  8.4.3. To apply mass updates, load the data into the fields located in the top portion of the
  Mass Update Assemblage window. If all records are affected, use the Select All button to
  highlight all data records prior to applying changes. Then, use the Apply button to apply the
  new data to selected records. For, example, if an entire Biological Warfare/Chemical
  Warfare (BW/CW) assemblage was moved from ―Bldg 1‖ to ―Bldg 2,‖ first, you would
  search for all records within the BW/CW assemblage; then, click the ―Select All‖ button to
  highlight all location records within the assemblage; enter ―Bldg 2‖ into the Location data
  field in the top portion of the window; click the ―Apply‖ button, and finally ―Save‖ the
  changes. A single data field or multiple data fields may be updated at the same time. The
  following data fields are available for update:
     8.4.3.1. Location – Enter the applicable location into this field and click ―Apply‖ to
     update the location for selected records. Note: If the desired location does not already
     exist, double-click in the Location field within one of the location records. Use the Add
     Location function in the Location/Sub Location Maintenance window to establish the
     new location. Refer to paragraph 8.35.2. for a detailed explanation on maintaining
     locations.
     8.4.3.2. Sub Location - Enter the applicable sub-location code into this field and click
     ―Apply‖ to update the sub-location for selected records. Note: If the desired sub-
     location code does not already exist, double-click in the Location field within one of the
     location records. Use the Add Sub-Location function in the Location/Sub Location
     Maintenance window to establish the new sub-location code. Refer to paragraph 8.35.2.
     for a detailed explanation on maintaining location codes.
     8.4.3.3. Manufacturer – Use this field to update the MFG data for selected location
     records. Mass updating the MFG data field is useful when multiple spelling versions of
     the same MFG exist within the specified assemblage(s). The mass update tool is an easy
     way to apply the same spelling version to all records simultaneously.
     8.4.3.4. Lot Number – Use to update lot number data to correct inconsistencies with lot
     number information or to enter common lot number information.
     8.4.3.5. External Authority – This field is designed to be used in conjunction with the
     Revised Expiration Date field. The most common example of an external authority is the
 260                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       SLEP. In conjunction with applying a Revised Expiration Date, SLEP or an applicable
       reference number should be applied to the External Authority data field.
       8.4.3.6. Original Expiration Date – The original expiration date is generally captured
       during the receipt process. This date should only be modified if incorrectly captured
       during the receipt process. If the item has been tested and the expiration date extended
       by proper approval authority, use the Revised Expiration Date field to capture the
       extended expiration date.
       8.4.3.7. Revised Expiration Date – Load extended expiration dates into this field. For
       example, if an item was submitted to SLEP and approved for a two year extended
       expiration date and the original expiration date is 5/8/2011; then enter 5/8/2013 into the
       Revised Expiration Date field. The appropriate reference for extension should also be
       entered into the External Authority field, paragraph 8.4.3.5.
       8.4.3.8. Manufacture Date – Date of manufacture as documented on the materiel label.
       8.4.3.9. Stratification State – Updates to the stratification state are only permitted when
       using the Pre-Lock function and when the ―SEL‖ indicator is checked using the Row-
       Lock function. In either case, the ―SEL‖ indicator must be checked.
   8.4.4. If search results reflect a zero quantity in a location record for the specified
   assemblage(s), some or all of the data fields may be grayed out and uneditable. Location
   records with a zero quantity are a result of not selecting the AM Location Delete indicator,
   which is used to remove location records when the OH quantity is zero. Use the Delete
   Location function to remove these records from the assemblage(s).
8.5. Item Allowance Change.
   8.5.1. Use the Item Allowance Change function to manually add, modify, or remove an
   assemblage allowance for an item, whether or not it is already part of a standard or non-
   standard assemblage. Use the Non-standard Assemblage Allowance Change function
   explained in paragraph 8.6 to apply mass allowance updates to non-standard assemblages.
   Electronic allowance updates for standard assemblages are accomplished using the Standard
   Assemblage Update function shown in paragraph 8.22.
   8.5.2. Select ―Item Allowance Change‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu or click on
   the ―Allowance‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access the Item Allowance Change
   window. Once the window opens, enter the item ID and hit the enter key. If necessary, click
   the ―Jump To‖ button located next to the item ID field to go to the MTF catalog search
   screen and create a new record. Upon entering a valid item ID, two tabs are displayed in the
   Item Allowance Change window ─ the Assemblages Containing Item, and Assemblages Not
   Containing Item tabs Figure 8.9.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 261


Figure 8.9. Item Allowance Change Window.




   8.5.3. Assemblages Containing Item tab. All individual location records by assemblage
   already containing an allowance for the specified item are displayed in this tab. Relevant
   management data is also listed to include P/S relationships, OH quantity, due-in quantity,
   current allowance quantity, and commingled, critical, and deferred codes and quantities.
   Allowance updates and changes to the locally managed indicator may be applied to an
   individual line item or applied to multiple line items in mass.
      8.5.3.1. Allowance Updates. Allowance changes to individual line items can be
      accomplished within the specified location record or by using the Apply function located
      in the top portion of the window. The Apply function must be used to simultaneously
      apply updates to multiple records. To do so, enter the new allowance in the New
      Allowance Qty field. Select (highlight) the location records to which the ensuing update
      applies. Click ―Apply.‖ Finally, verify updates are correct and save changes. To remove
      the allowance, apply a new allowance quantity of zero.
      8.5.3.2. Locally Managed Indicator. The Locally Managed Indicator setting determines
      whether or not electronic allowance updates process or edit.
          8.5.3.2.1. If the setting is checked, electronic updates edit for review and the
          assemblage manager determines whether or not to manually apply the update. If this
          indicator is unchecked, electronic updates process and the allowance is updated
          accordingly.
          8.5.3.2.2. Apply the Locally Managed Indicator to individual records by placing a
          check mark in the Locally Managed checkbox within the location record or by using
          the apply function. When using the apply function, both the new allowance quantity
          and locally managed indicator are updated together for the specified records upon
          selecting the ―Apply‖ button. This indicator defaults to ―No Change.‖ Click ―Add‖
          to apply the indicator to selected records and use ―Remove‖ to uncheck the locally
          managed indicator.
      8.5.3.3. If an item assigned to an assemblage is a sub item for an associated prime, verify
      your prime/sub ratio before updating the new allowance field.

       8.5.3.4. Assemblages Not Containing Item tab. This tab lists all remaining assemblages
       that do not contain an allowance for the specified item ID. Apply initial allowance
       quantities and the Locally Managed indicator the same as shown in paragraph 8.5.
   8.5.4. Use the ―Set Codes‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to access the Item Code
   Changes window. Deferred, critical, and commingled codes and quantities may be applied as
   explained in paragraph 8.7.
8.6. Non-Standard Assemblage Allowance Change.
   8.6.1. Use this function to add, modify, and remove allowance quantities associated to non-
   standard assemblages. Prior to applying allowance updates, the non-standard assemblage
   must be loaded into the database as explained in paragraph 8.24. Select ―Non-Standard
   Assemblage Allowance Change‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu to access this
   function. In the criteria window, identify the ORG and assemblage to be updated.
   8.6.2. All location records with existing allowances appear in the Non-Standard Assm
   Allowance Change window. Allowance adjustments must be applied to individual line items
   one at a time.
   8.6.3. Click on the ―Add Item‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to add a new allowance
   for a new item ID. Type in the item ID and select the flashlight icon. Click ―OK" in the Item
   ID pop-up window if the information is correct and the window disappears. Enter the
   allowance quantity and click ―Save‖ on the vertical toolbar.
   8.6.4. Deferred, critical, and commingled codes and quantities may also be applied as
   explained in paragraph 8.7. by selecting the ―Set Codes‖ button located on the vertical
   toolbar.
8.7. Item Code Change.
   8.7.1. Use the Item Code Change function to manage deferred, critical, and commingled
   codes and to apply or modify quantities or percentages to assemblage data records. Select
   ―Item Code Change‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu or click on the ―Set Codes‖ icon
   available on various vertical toolbars to access this function.
       8.7.1.1. Deferred Code. Deferred codes are used to identify assemblage materiel that
       will be purchased using an existing deferred procurement (DP) plan prior to processing
       the assemblage out-shipment.       Refer to AFI 41-209, Chapter 13 for a detailed
       explanation of available DP programs.
          8.7.1.1.1. Items assigned the following deferred codes are linked to the Deferred Item
          Order function explained in paragraph 8.19.5.
              8.7.1.1.1.1. V - DoD Owned Stock (PV).
              8.7.1.1.1.2. E - Service-Owned CEC.
              8.7.1.1.1.3. R - Service-Owned VMI.
              8.7.1.1.1.4. S - Service-Owned PVWRM.
          8.7.1.1.2. Items coded as deferred are considered ―on-hand‖ assets and calculated
          into the item stock percentages that appear on assemblage status reports.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                263


     8.7.1.2. Critical Code. The critical code is used to designate an item(s) within an
     assemblage as a critical necessity for deployment. The critical code may be applied to all
     or part of the allowance quantity using the percentage indicator or by manually entering
     the critical quantity. Items assigned a critical item code are calculated into the critical
     item percentage on stock status reports.
     8.7.1.3. Commingled Code. This code indicates that assemblage materiel for the item
     number is commingled with operating stock. All or part of the OH quantity may be
     coded as commingled using the percentage indicator or a specified quantity can be
     manually loaded into the commingled quantity field. When processing a receipt or gain
     against an item with a commingled code, the system annotates the assemblage data
     record(s) as incomplete.
         8.7.1.3.1. The purpose of choosing to commingle WRM and operating stock is to
         minimize loss due to stock expiration and deterioration. Sufficient operating stock
         should be OH to effectively rotate with WRM stock.
         8.7.1.3.2. QA data is not required in the assemblage data record for commingled
         materiel. Before processing any AM out-shipments or sales, the assemblage manager
         should remove the commingled code and update the assemblage record data with the
         correct product management information.
         8.7.1.3.3. Items coded as commingled are considered ―on-hand‖ assets and are
         calculated into the item stock percentage on assemblage status reports.
  8.7.2. Item Code Change Criteria window. Use the Item Code Change Criteria window to
  first select the ORG and assemblage(s) in which the updates apply. The following search
  criteria can be used to further minimize search results.
     8.7.2.1. Item ID - Entering an item ID reduces the search results to that item ID for the
     specified assemblage(s).
     8.7.2.2. Deferred Code – Returns assemblage data records matching the deferred code
     criteria. Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate code. Locally assigned
     deferred codes may be assigned to assemblage data records. If being used, they will
     appear in this dropdown menu. Local deferred codes are established and managed within
     the TMU located in the SS module.
     8.7.2.3. Critical Code - Returns assemblage data records matching the critical item code
     criteria for the specified assemblage(s). Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate
     code. Locally assigned critical codes may be assigned to assemblage data records. If
     being used, they will appear in this dropdown menu. Local critical codes are established
     and managed within the TMU located in the SS module.
     8.7.2.4. Commingled Code – Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate
     commingled code and only the assemblage data records matching that code criteria for
     the specified assemblage(s) are displayed.
  8.7.3. Multiple search criteria can be used at the same time. For example, to search for
  Atropine Injectors with a deferred code of ―D‖ within a BW/CW assemblage; first identify
  the assemblage; enter ―6505009269083‖ in the Item ID field; choose Deferred Code ―D,‖ and
 264                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   click ―Search.‖ The search results only display the assemblage data records matching all the
   criteria.
   8.7.4. Item Code Change window. Within the Item Code Change window, users can apply
   the deferred, critical, and commingled quantities by quantity or percentage. Use the ―Notes‖
   field to provide a short explanation as to why the code(s) are assigned. A thorough reference
   to applicable codes should be maintained in each corresponding assemblage‘s continuity
   binder.
       8.7.4.1. To add or update using a quantity, enter the quantity in the appropriate
       row/column. In the corresponding code column, select a code from the dropdown list.
       Enter a short note in the Note column explaining why the code is assigned.
       8.7.4.2. To modify a code based on percentages, select (highlight) the assemblage data
       record(s) being updated. Then, in the top portion of the window, assign the applicable
       deferred, critical or commingled code using the dropdown list. Enter a short note in the
       Note column explaining why the code is assigned. Update the corresponding percentage
       field to meet local requirements. The percentage defaults to 100% but can be adjusted to
       as low as 1%. Percentages are applied using whole numbers only. Click ―Apply‖ to
       update the specified assemblage data record(s). Verify updates are correct and click
       ―Save.‖
       8.7.4.3. Use the ―Reset‖ button to remove deferred, critical, and/or commingled codes,
       quantities, and percentages. To do so, highlight the applicable assemblage data records.
       In the Reset box, choose ―deferred,‖ ―critical,‖ or ―commingled,‖ depending on which
       code is being removed and click the ―Reset‖ button. Verify the specified code was
       removed from the assemblage data records and click ―Save.‖
       8.7.4.4. DMLSS allows multiple item codes to be assigned to the same assemblage data
       record; however, some rules apply. An item can be classified as both critical and
       deferred, but the critical plus deferred quantity cannot exceed the allowance quantity. In
       addition, the commingled quantity cannot exceed the OH quantity.
8.8. Equipment (AM).
   8.8.1. Use the AM equipment function to maintain equipment records and/or print barcode
   labels for equipment associated to LOG and CO assemblages. Equipment detail records
   associated to CO assemblages can only be viewed from AM; however, updates are only
   permitted in the EM and MA modules. All AM equipment records are also accessible from
   the EM module and those requiring maintenance are accessible from the MA module.
   8.8.2. Select ―Equipment‖ from the AM Navigate dropdown menu or click on the
   ―Equipment‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access the Equipment Search Criteria
   window. Numerous data fields are available for use in processing inquiries. Leave all data
   fields empty and click ―Search‖ to retrieve all assigned equipment records. Otherwise,
   multiple data fields can be used simultaneously to narrow search results when trying to locate
   specific equipment records. The most direct route to a specific equipment record is by using
   the Equipment Control Number (ECN) as your search criteria.
   8.8.3. The Equipment Search Results window displays all equipment records matching the
   specified search criteria. To view an individual equipment record, highlight the desired
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 265


   record and click on the ―Detail‖ button located on the vertical toolbar or double-click the
   desired record. Multiple equipment records may be selected by highlighting the items using
   the ―Shift‖ or ―Ctrl‖ key methods. Selected records are displayed in ECN sequence. When
   multiple records are selected, a VCR button is available in the upper left corner of the
   window to allow users to scroll through the equipment records.
   8.8.4. If necessary, use the Filter function in the Equipment Search Results window to filter
   through the equipment records retrieved as a result of the initial search. One or more of
   following criteria can be used to filter the records: item ID, nomenclature, manufacturer,
   common model, contractor, ORG ID, customer name, custodian name, assemblage
   description, and assemblage number. To apply the filter, enter the applicable filter data and
   click the ―Filter‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Click the ―Reset‖ button to remove
   filters.
   8.8.5. Highlight an equipment record and click the ―Detail‖ button or double-click on the
   equipment record to access the equipment detail record. Each equipment data record
   contains several tabs categorizing the individual equipment data fields.
   8.8.6. CO Assemblage Equipment. Equipment designated for CO assemblages is accounted
   for as operating inventory and the equipment data records are maintained using the EM
   module. Each piece of equipment must be ―Associated‖ to the designated CO assemblage in
   order to meet the allowance requirement and to be calculated into the available stock
   percentages reported on assemblage status reports. To establish the association, the
   equipment must be owned by the same customer that owns the CO assemblage; i.e. an ECN
   owned by 3H5888 can only be associated to a CO assemblage owned by 3H5888.
      8.8.6.1. Associating Equipment to CO Assemblage. Access equipment detail record(s)
      using the EM Equipment search function. Use the ―Associate‖ button located on the
      vertical toolbar to access the Associate to Customer-Owned Assemblage window. The
      ORG and customer fields default to the owning activity. Use the available dropdown
      menus to associate the equipment to the appropriate assemblage. Once accomplished, the
      assemblage data appears in the bottom portion of the Main tab.
      8.8.6.2. Un-Associating Equipment from a CO Assemblage. Access equipment detail
      record(s) using the EM Equipment search function. Use the ―Remove‖ button located on
      the vertical toolbar to unassociate the equipment item from the CO assemblage. Click
      ―OK‖ to confirm removal of the association.
   8.8.7. Refer to Chapters 9 and 10 for an in-depth explanation on maintaining equipment data
   records.
8.9. Prime/Sub (P/S) Items.
   8.9.1. Use the P/S tool to establish a relationship between a sub item ID and a prime item ID.
   While assemblage allowances are associated to specific item IDs, every site may not have
   that specific item ID OH. In some cases, the exact same item and/or package size cannot be
   obtained during replenishment action. In these cases, establish a prime/sub relationship
   allowing the sub item to fulfill the assemblage allowance requirements.
   8.9.2. The following rules apply when establishing a P/S relationship:
 266                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       8.9.2.1. The prime item must have an assemblage allowance. The sub item cannot have
       an assemblage allowance for the specified ORG and assemblage ID.
       8.9.2.2. The sub item must have a quantity OH or due-in.
       8.9.2.3. An item cannot be substituted for more than one prime item within the same
       ORG and assemblage.
       8.9.2.4. An item cannot be both a prime and a sub in the same ORG and assemblage.
   8.9.3. Select ―Prime/Sub Items‖ from the AM navigate menu or click on the ―Prime/Sub
   Item‖ button located on the horizontal toolbar to establish, revise, or delete P/S relationships.
   P/S relationships are applied at the ORG and assembly ID level. Therefore, if the same
   relationship exists for other assemblage(s) within the ORG, the P/S relationship must be
   applied to each assemblage.
   8.9.4. In the criteria search window, select the ORG, assemblage, and item ID in which the
   ensuing P/S relationship will apply. Click ―Search‖ to access the Prime/Sub Items window
   Figure 8.10. The window is divided into 3 sections: top section, lower left, and lower right
   section.

Figure 8.10. Prime Sub Items Window.




   8.9.5. Prime item ID management information is displayed in the top section. The lower left
   section contains items without an allowance authorization; therefore, are considered
   overage(s) and potential sub items. Existing sub items are displayed in the lower right
   section.
   8.9.6. If the sub item is already part of the assemblage, enter the prime number in the search
   criteria window and open the Prime Sub Items window. In the lower left section of the
   window, select the sub‘s item ID and click the ―>‖ button to associate the sub item to the
   prime. The P/S ratio always defaults to 1:1, so modify the P/S ratio as necessary. For
   example, if the prime item‘s unit of sale (U/S) is 5s and the sub item‘s U/S is 1s, the
   prime/sub ratio would be 1 (prime) to 5 (sub) respectively.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  267


   8.9.7. Use the ―Add Item‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to establish a P/S
   relationship when the sub item is not already loaded in the assemblage. In the criteria search
   window, select the ORG, assemblage, and prime item ID and access the Prime/Sub Items
   window. Click the ―Add Item‖ button to open the Inventory Add Item-Location Data
   window. Type in the item ID and press the enter key to populate the description, issue and
   pricing fields. The QA data fields will also be displayed. You must enter, as a minimum, the
   sub quantity to process the update. The sub item‘s QA should also be loaded at this time. If
   not loaded, leave the incomplete box checked. Click ―Save‖ to process the actions.
   8.9.8. The Gain Type Select window appears upon clicking the ―Save‖ button. Select the
   applicable type of gain and click ―OK.‖ Print the source document if required for QA.
   8.9.9. Return to the Prime Sub Items window and associate the newly gained sub item from
   the lower left section to the lower right section by clicking the ―>‖ button. Adjust the ratios
   as needed and save the information. Click ―Save‖ to complete the process.
8.10. End/Support Items. The End/Support items function was created to allow users to link
consumable supplies to the equipment item they support. These supplies are unique to the
capabilities to the equipment and generally do not work with other equipment items. Using this
function is advantageous when budgeting for replacement materiel in an assemblage. If an
equipment item changes, consumables that support the equipment can also be replaced at the
same time.
   8.10.1. Support Items.
       8.10.1.1. From the AM navigate dropdown menu, select ―End/Support‖ and then
       ―Support‖ to access the Support Items window. In the criteria window, enter an ORG
       from the dropdown list to view all associated assemblages. Select an assemblage from
       the list and enter an item ID. The End/Support Item function can only be applied to one
       assemblage at a time. Click ―Search‖ to open the Support Items window. Use the
       Support Items window to associate end items to a support item.
       8.10.1.2. Basic item information of the support item is listed in the top part of the
       window including the allowance quantity, item code, and assemblage data contained in
       the assemblage data records. Use the VCR buttons in the upper left corner to move
       forward or back through the project without exiting or reopening the assemblage (this
       changes the support item ID). The middle of the window is reserved for MFG name and
       model ID for the support item. The lower left window contains a list of available items
       within the project that may be associated as an end item. The lower right window is the
       association box for end items associated to the support items.
       8.10.1.3. To associate end items to the support item, move the applicable item ID(s) from
       the Available Items box to the End Items box. Highlight the item ID(s) and click on the
       ―>‖ button to move the item ID(s) to the End Items box. Use the ―>>‖ button to move all
       available item ID(s) to the End Items box. Click ―Save‖ to complete the process.

       8.10.2.1. Use the End Items window to associate an end item to one or multiple support
       items. From the Navigate menu, select ―End/Support Items‖ and click on ―End Items‖ to
       view the End Items Criteria window. Enter an ORG from the dropdown list to view all
       associated assemblages. Select an assemblage from the list and enter an item ID. Only
       one assemblage can be selected at a time. Click ―Search‖ to open the End Items window.
       8.10.2.2. Basic item information of the end item is displayed in the top part of the
       window, to include allowance quantity, item code, and assemblage data contained in the
       assemblage data records. Use the VCR buttons located in the upper left corner of the
       window to move forward and backward through the project without exiting or reopening
       the assemblage (this changes the end item ID). The middle of the window is reserved for
       MFG name and model ID for the end item. The lower left window contains a list of
       available items within the assemblage that may be associated to an end item. The lower
       right window is the association box for support items associated to an end item.
       8.10.2.3. To associate supply items to an end item, move the applicable item ID from the
       Available Items box to the Support Items box. Highlight the item ID(s) and click on the
       ―>‖ button to move the item ID(s) to the Support Items box. Use the ―>>‖ button to
       move all available item ID(s) to the Support Items box. Click ―Save‖ to complete the
       process.
       8.10.2.4. To remove a Support Item association, select the item ID from the Support
       Items box and click the ―<‖ button to disassociate and move back to the Available box.
       Use the ―<<‖ button to disassociate all item IDs. Click ―Save‖ to complete the process.
   8.10.3. The Set Codes button is a shortcut that allows you to open the ―Item Code Change‖
   window to update item codes for the new relationship without having to exit and open the
   window from the Navigate window.
   8.10.4. After a relationship is created for either the end item or support items, use the ―Print‖
   button to print a report showing the relationship information. The printed report will appear
   similar to the respective windows and lists supported item ID(s) and/or end item ID(s),
   assemblage, allowance quantity, and item code information.
8.11. Weights/Cubes.
   8.11.1. The Weights/Cubes function provides a method to document the weight and cube (in
   cubic square feet) of assemblages. These figures are entered into DMLSS and displayed on
   the packing list for each assemblage by location and sub-location. This data can also be
   retrieved when using BusinessObjects (BO) to develop localized reports.
   8.11.2. Select ―Weights/Cubes‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu to access this
   function. In the criteria window, identify the applicable ORG, assemblage, location, and sub-
   location (not mandatory). In the Location/Sub-location Weight and Cube List window, enter
   the weight and cube for each available location and sub-location.
   8.11.3. Click the ―Open‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to return to the criteria
   window and select other locations or assemblages. After all processes are complete, click
   ―Save‖ and ―Close.‖ Each time this data changes, a new packing list should be printed to
   reflect the changes.
8.12. Item Gains/Losses.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     269


   8.12.1. Whether building an assemblage from scratch or maintaining an existing one, the
   need will eventually arise for assemblage managers to process gains to increase an item
   quantity and/or a loss to reduce an item quantity. Use the Item Gains/Losses function to
   increase or decrease an assemblage item‘s OH quantity. Select ―Item Gains/Losses‖ from the
   AM navigate dropdown menu or click on the ―Gain/Loss‖ icon located on the horizontal
   toolbar to open the Item Gains/Losses criteria window Figure 8.11. In the criteria window,
   specify the applicable ORG and assemblage. Gains and losses can only be applied to one
   assemblage at a time. Click ―Search‖ to view all items in an assemblage or enter one or more
   of the following search criteria to minimize the results.

Figure 8.11. Item Gains/Losses Criteria Window.




      8.12.1.1. Item ID - Enter the specific item ID that the ensuing gain or loss will apply.
      8.12.1.2. Location ID – Select a location ID from the dropdown menu to minimize the
      search results to only those items with the specified location ID.
      8.12.1.3. Sub-location – Use the sub-location dropdown in conjunction with the location
      ID. Doing so narrows search results to those records assigned the specified location and
      sub-location.
   8.12.2. In the criteria window, an option exists to delete the location record when OH
   quantities equal zero. Select ―Yes‖ if you are processing a loss and the item will not be
   replaced. If ―No‖ is selected, a location record with a zero OH quantity remains in the
   assemblage. This function works in conjunction with the AM Location Delete Indicator
   located in the Basic tab of the MM Service Detail record in SS (see Attachment 2). After
   you have selected an assemblage and entered additional search criteria, click ―Search‖ to
   open the Item Gains/Losses window and to view the search results.
   8.12.3. All assemblage data records matching the specified search results are displayed in
   the Item Gains/Losses (search results) window Figure 8.12 to include allowance, due-in, and
   OH quantities as well as record location and QA data. Initially, the only field available for
   update is the Gains/Losses data field. Once a gain or loss is applied, the quantity field
   becomes mandatory.
 270                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013

   8.12.4. Gains and/or losses can be applied to a single line item or to multiple line items
   simultaneously.
       8.12.4.1. Individual. Choose a gain or loss transaction reason within the applicable
       location record (row) to apply to individual items. Different transaction reasons and
       quantities can be applied to different location records at the same time. Enter the quantity
       and click ―Save‖ to update records.
       8.12.4.2. Multiple. To apply the same transaction reason to multiple lines, use the
       ―Shift‖ and/or ―Control‖ key function to highlight the applicable location records, enter
       the transaction reason at the top of the window, and click ―Apply.‖ This action applies
       the gain or loss transaction type to all selected (highlighted) location records. Enter the
       gain or loss quantity and click ―Save‖ to update records.
       8.12.4.3. All. Click ―Select All‖ to highlight all location records; enter the transaction
       reason at the top of the window; and click on the ―Apply‖ button. This action applies the
       gain or loss transaction type to all location records. Enter the appropriate gain or loss
       quantity once the transaction reason is applied.
       8.12.4.4. Click ―Save‖ on the vertical toolbar to move to another gains/losses window
       where the user can enter a desired priority, supply condition code, SOS RIC, Delivery
       Date, (optional) Ext Doc Number and the Authority/Purpose. Click OK to complete the
       process and update the records.
   8.12.5. Add Item function. Use the add item function if an item does not appear in an
   assemblage; i.e., new assemblage allowance standard requirements or an addition of a
   substitute item. To add the item to the assemblage, click the ―Add Item‖ button on the
   vertical toolbar to open the Inventory Add Item-Location Data window. Enter the item ID
   and press the ―Enter‖ key. If one does not exist, DMLSS prompts you to create a new MTF
   catalog record. The item‘s descriptive data auto populates once the item ID is identified.
   Enter the quantity being gained and load the corresponding QA data. QA data entry is not
   mandated at this point but it is highly recommended that it be loaded at this time. Leave the
   Incomplete check box checked if the QA data is not loaded at this time. Click ―Save‖ to
   process the gain.
   8.12.6. Create a P/S relationship if the item being gained is a substitute for a prime item that
   is assigned an allowance quantity.
   8.12.7. Outshipment Loss Example. On the Item Gains/Losses window enter the pertinent
   data for the loss in the dropdown boxes and click ―Save‖ on the vertical toolbar. The

       8.12.8.1. On the AM-Item Gains/Losses screen click the Close icon on the vertical
       toolbar and the Outshipment Form/Transportation Selection screen appears (Figure
       8.14.). Enter the LOA (Line of Accounting)/Fund Cite, Transportation requirements and
       Tracking information and click OK and the user then returns to the AM-In Box.
       8.12.8.2. DOD 4000.25-1-M, MILSTRIP requires additional information for hazardous
       items being turned into DRMO. Users must enter a signal code in the gain/loss screen
       when they process a loss to DRMO for a hazardous item. The valid signal code choices
       are A, B, C, and L (default is A). If the signal code is B, users must enter a ―Bill to
       Activity‖ (DODAAC of the bill to office). The ―Bill to Activity‖ prints in block 27 of
       DD Form 1348-1a, Issue Release/Receipt Document. The DRMO DODAAC also prints
       on the DD Form 1348-1a for all DRMO shipments.
   8.12.9. All gain and loss transactions are written to the Transaction History file and to DFAS
   to update financial records. Only Inventory Adjustment Gain/Loss transaction reasons
   generate an Inventory Adjustment Voucher.
8.13. Destruction.
   8.13.1. The item destruction process is another form of a loss transaction. Potential reasons
   to destroy materiel are if it is expired or reached its life expectancy and the materiel is not
   authorized for turn-in to commercial returns, DRMO, or excess. In addition, process a loss
   (DDL transaction) to document the quantity when materiel is shipped to the FDA/DOD
   SLEP for testing. The sample is not returned hence the quantity must be removed from
   AFWCF/MDD records.
   8.13.2. Select ―Destruction‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu to access this function.
   The search criteria window for the destruction process is the same as for gains and losses
   (paragraph 8.12) except these records default to a Gain/Loss transaction type of
   ―Destruction‖ Figure 8.15. The quantity field is the only field available for data entry.

Figure 8.15. Destruction Window.




   8.13.3. In the Destruction window, select the item ID and enter the destruction quantity in
   the quantity field. Click ―Save‖ to process the destruction. A window opens listing the item
   ID, item description, the destruction code, and the destruction method Figure 8.16. Enter the
   reason for destruction in the space provided. This reason is printed on the destruction
   document. During processing, the OH quantity is reduced by the quantity being destroyed.
   Click ―OK‖ to finalize the process and adjust the OH quantity. Use the ―Open‖ button
   located on the vertical toolbar to process destructions from other assemblages if necessary.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  273


Figure 8.16. Destruction (Detail) Window.




   8.13.4. Before a destruction transaction is allowed, a destruction method must be associated
   to the item‘s MTF catalog record. If a destruction method is not loaded, DMLSS displays a
   message indicating that one is required. If necessary, click the ―Jump To‖ button located
   next to the item ID field to view the MTF catalog record.
   8.13.5. Once the MTF catalog record appears, click on the ―Destruction Method‖ tab located
   at the bottom of the Basic tab. Click on the ―Edit‖ button to load a destruction method if one
   is not already present. DMLSS returns to the Destruction window upon saving changes and
   closing the MTF Catalog window. The destruction can now be processed.
   8.13.6. After all destructions have been processed, click the ―Close‖ button located on the
   vertical toolbar. The Destruction Report window appears providing the opportunity to print
   either a Gains and Losses Report or a Destructions Report. Under Optional Report, select
   ―Destruction Document‖ and click ―OK‖ to print the corresponding destruction report in
   duplicate on a local printer. If applicable, print any pending Gain/Loss Reports.
   8.13.7. If the Destruction Report is not printed at this time, it can be reproduced using the
   Destruction Report in the AM Reports module. Destruction reports can be printed or
   reprinted by ORG, assemblage ID, item ID, or by a specified period of time using the To and
   From date fields.
   8.13.8. All item destructions are written to Transaction History and assigned a transaction
   code of DDL and document serial block 8000-8499 is used to record the destruction.
8.14. Commercial Returns. The AM Commercial Returns function is set-up to accurately
process, track, and update WRM assets that are returned through reverse distribution for credit
consideration. The AM Commercial Returns module works the same as the IM Commercial
Returns module; however, AM commercial returns should be processed IAWAFI 41-209.
8.15. Returns.
   8.15.1. Use the AM Returns function to process a TIG from a customer account to an
   assemblage. This function should only be used when the item was initially issued from the
   assemblage to the customer to satisfy a contingency operation or exercise and the materiel is
   in serviceable condition at the time of turn-in. Inspect the item for serviceability and proper
 274                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   packaging prior to processing the return. Credits are not authorized for returning WRM
   except in the rare occasion that the materiel never left the logistics warehouse. In that case,
   process an issue reversal versus a turn-in.
   8.15.2. Select ―Returns‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu to access this function. Use
   the Search criteria window the same as explained in paragraph 8.12. Returns can only be
   processed for one assemblage at a time. In the Returns window, enter the quantity being
   returned for turn-in into the quantity field of the corresponding item ID. Click ―Save‖ to
   process the return.
   8.15.3. A secondary Returns window opens displaying the item ID and description of the
   item being returned. Identify the customer, location, storage area, and expense center of the
   customer account that is returning the item. Upon selecting a customer, most of this data is
   automatically populated. While the Reason field is optional, a reason for the return should be
   annotated. It is also recommended that the original issue document number be included in
   the reason field. The reason annotated in this field prints on the Return Report. Do not use
   the Issue Credit for This Item box because credit cannot be given to the customer for
   returning the item. Click ―OK‖ to continue the returns process.
   8.15.4. During the return process, DMLSS checks the customer‘s estimated on-hand (EOH)
   balance. If the return quantity is greater than this EOH balance, a message appears asking
   whether or not you want to continue. Verify the return quantity and select ―Yes‖ to continue.
   In addition, DMLSS notifies you if multiple location records exist for the item being
   returned. Each of those records contain the same allowance quantity, but reflect only the OH
   quantity associated to each location record; meaning you should add the OH quantities
   together to make sure the quantity being returned will not be considered an overage.
   8.15.5. Click the ―Open‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to process additional returns
   to other assemblages as needed. After all processes are complete, click ―Close‖ to log out.
   The Optional Report window appears providing the opportunity to print either a Gains and
   Losses Report or a Return Item Report. Print the Returns Report by placing a check in the
   check box nest to Returns and clicking ―OK.‖ The Returns Report is printed in duplicate to
   the local printer. If necessary, print the pending Gains and Losses Report.
   8.15.6. If the Returns Report is not printed at this time, it can be reproduced using the
   Returns Report in the AM Reports module. Returns Reports can be printed or reprinted by
   ORG, assemblage ID, item ID, or by a specified period of time using the To and From date
   fields.
   8.15.7. All item returns are written to Transaction History and assigned a transaction code of
   TIG and document serial block 8000-8499 is used to record the return.
8.16. Issue Non-Routine.
   8.16.1. The Issue Non-Routine function in AM is used to issue WRM assets to a selected
   customer with a valid requirement. Issues from WRM assemblages are authorized when
   overages exist and a requirement can be filled within the MTF or in the event of emergency
   to prevent death or undue suffering. All issues from WRM should be scrutinized. Verify
   questionable issue requests with proper approval authority prior to processing.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 275


   8.16.2. Select ―Issues Non-Routine‖ from the AM Navigate dropdown menu or click on the
   ―Issues‖ icon located on the horizontal toolbar to access this function. In the Issues Non-
   Routine Search criteria window, identify at a minimum the ORG and assemblage in which
   the ensuing issue(s) will be processed. If known at this time, the search criteria can be
   minimized by entering the item ID, location, and/or sub-location of the item(s) being issued.
   8.16.3. Utilize the ―Delete Location Record when Quantity is Zero?‖ function to determine
   whether or not DMLSS should remove a location record when the OH quantity is reduced to
   zero. If ―No‖ is selected, a ‗shell‘ record remains in DMLSS even though the OH quantity is
   zero. If ―Yes‖ is selected, the location record is removed from the assemblage when the OH
   quantity is zero.
   8.16.4. Click the ―Search‖ button once all search criteria is identified. All assemblage data
   records matching the search criteria are displayed in the Issues Non-Routine window. Only
   two fields, Customer and Quantity, require data entry. The customer ID can be applied to a
   single location record or to multiple location records using the Apply tool located at the top
   of the window.
   8.16.5. To process a single issue, highlight the applicable location record, choose the
   customer ID from the dropdown menu, enter the issue quantity, and click ―Save‖ to process
   the issue Figure 8.17.

Figure 8.17. Issue Non-Routine Window.




   8.16.6. Use the Shift and/or Control key functions to highlight multiple location records
   when more than one but not all records are affected. Enter the customer number at the top
   and click ―Apply‖ if the items are being issued to the same customer or select the customer
   ID from the dropdown menu for each location record. Enter the issue quantity for each
   record and click ―Save‖ to process the issues.
   8.16.7. Use the ―Select All‖ button to highlight all records if issues are being processed
   against all location records. If all items are being issued to the same customer, enter the
   customer‘s ID into the Customer field at the top of the window and click ―Apply.‖ This
   action applies the customer ID to all highlighted records. Next, enter the quantity being
   issued into the ―Qty‖ field for each location record. Click ―Save‖ to process the non-routine
   issues.
   8.16.8. The issue quantity must be equal to or less than the available OH quantity, for each
   location record, in order to process. Controlled items or other restricted items will not be
   processed unless the customer is authorized to receive these types of supplies. If the
   customer is authorized, they must be designated as such in SS, SVC/CUST function, Materiel
   tab.
 276                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   8.16.9. If sufficient funds are not available and the target flag is other than ―NONE,‖
   DMLSS produces a message displaying ―Insufficient Customer Funds, Do you want to
   continue?‖ Choosing ―Yes‖ processes the issue as refund code ―R‖ while driving the project
   and expense center available balance negative. If ―No‖ is chosen, contact the supply
   custodian so he/she can take appropriate actions to have funds loaded in their project/expense
   center. Note: When funds are not available at the time of deployment, AF policy allows the
   expense and project center to go negative to ensure the deployment is not delayed. AM
   notifies users with an ―insufficient fund‖ message, asking if you wish to continue the process.
   A ―Yes‖ answer allows DMLSS to process the INR and update the approriate customer fund
   record. If the customer has a target flag set (Project Center, Project Center/EOR, Expense, or
   Expense/EOR), the available balance in the fund record will become a negative figure. The
   customer will be billed by Finance in the next billing cycle.
   8.16.10. Upon processing issues, DMLSS decreases the item‘s OH quantity according to the
   corresponding issue quantity. After processing, click ―Open‖ to issue additional items from
   another assemblage or click ―Close‖ to return to the main AM window. DMLSS prompts
   you to print a delivery list upon closing the ―Issue Non-Routine‖ window. The Delivery List
   is used to pull and deliver the assets to the receiving customer. Select the report and click
   ―OK‖ to send it to your local printer.
   8.16.11. AM Issues. All assemblage issues are defaulted to non-recurring and refundable;
   therefore, consumption history is not recorded and the customer is always charged for the
   issue. The total price of each issue is written to the Reimbursable Sales (R-Sales) field of the
   AM Fund record
       8.16.11.1. All AM non-routine issues generate an INR transaction from the assemblage
       and a RNR transaction to the customer, and are assigned a document serial number from
       the 8000-8499 block, Gains and Losses. These transactions are written to the Transaction
       History file.
8.17. Transfers. AM Transfers are used to process assemblage gains (in-shipments) and losses
(out-shipments), to reconstitute a previous assemblage sale, to change an assemblage ID, and to
merge two like assemblages into a single assemblage. Different rules apply to each type of
transfer as explained below. Because the gain, loss, reconstitution, and merge processes require
data files, it is highly recommended that a main folder and subfolders be maintained on a local
shared drive to manage these files. Within each subfolder (i.e. Assemblage Gain), create
additional subfolders that specifically identify the assemblage ID (i.e. 937 D 0; EMEDS
Resupply, Basic). An example is displayed in Figure 8.18.

Figure 8.18. Recommended Assemblage Transfer File Management.




   8.17.1. Assemblage Gain.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    277


      8.17.1.1. Use the Assemblage Gain function to process an assemblage in-shipment. This
      process is used regardless of how the incoming assemblage will be coded; LOG owned,
      CO, or LOG Managed Expense Center Owned. Upon completing this process, the next
      available instance of the specified assemblage is gained into AM.
      8.17.1.2. Prior to beginning the gain process, verify the 21 in-shipment files are saved to
      a local hard drive or shared drive and are accessible. These 21 text files are a direct result
      of the losing MTF‘s assemblage loss transaction. If all 21 files are not present, request
      the losing MTF resend the out-shipment files.
      8.17.1.3. Also, verify the applicable ORG exists in DMLSS prior to processing the gain.
      In most cases, the host ORG, or LOG, will be the owning ORG; however, in some cases
      a new ORG may need to be created. If so, follow instructions provided in Chapter 4, SS,
      to create the new ORG.
      8.17.1.4. From the AM navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfers‖ and then
      ―Assemblage Gain‖ to access this function. In the Browse the Folder window, navigate
      to the local folder in which the 21 in-shipment files are stored. These files must be
      identified prior to processing the assemblage gain. Click ―OK‖ and the Assemblage Gain
      window appears.
      8.17.1.5. The Assemblage Gain window Figure 8.19 contains data fields used to specify
      the gain criteria and displays the assemblage(s) identified in the Browse to Folder
      window used in the previous step. If multiple assemblage data files are located in the
      identified folder, they will all appear in the assemblage description window at the bottom
      of the window. Use the Assemblage Gain data fields and indicators as explained below.

Figure 8.19. Assemblage Gain Window.




         8.17.1.5.1. ORG. The ORG defaults to the Host ORG or LOG, i.e. FM4486. Use
         the dropdown menu to reassign to a different ORG, if necessary.
         8.17.1.5.2. Scope. The scope identifies who owns, maintains, and funds the
         assemblage being added. DMLSS defaults to LOG owned, modify as necessary.
             8.17.1.5.2.1. LOG. AFWCF/MDD owned and funded assets.
             8.17.1.5.2.2. Customer. Assets are CO and funded. The customer uses DMLSS
             to manage the assets. When selected, the Customer and Expense Center fields
278                                                 AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         become mandatory. Upon selecting the Customer, the Fund Center field
         populates with the associated expense center ID.
         8.17.1.5.2.3. LOG Managed Expense Center Owned. Assets are CO and funded.
         However, logistics personnel are using DMLSS to manage assets. When selected,
         the Expense Center field becomes mandatory.
      8.17.1.5.3. Transfer Directory (Dir) & Browse. Default mapping reflects the local
      folder identified in the Browse to Folder window. Use the ―Browse‖ button to map to
      another folder.
      8.17.1.5.4. Validate DMLSS Master or AM Master Assm. Check this indicator to
      validate the in-shipment catalog records against the DMLSS master UDR file. All
      catalog records containing differences are written to an exceptions report. The
      catalog exceptions must be rectified prior to using the catalog record in DMLSS.
      Leave this indicator unchecked to accept catalog records as is.
      8.17.1.5.5. Update Allowance Quantities from DMLSS Master or AM Master Assm.
      Check this indicator to update your local assemblage allowance quantities using the
      DMLSS master UDR file. Leave this indicator unchecked to accept the allowances
      contained within the incoming data files. Using this option is highly recommended
      because the allowances contained on the incoming assemblage data files may not be
      current.
      8.17.1.5.6. To Assemblage. Use the dropdown menu to assign the incoming
      assemblage (assemblage being gained) to a preexisting assemblage ID. For example,
      915/H/1/0 was previously out-shipped. Sixty days later, the assemblage has returned.
      Use the dropdown menu to select ―915/H/1/0‖ as the To Assemblage. The instance
      number listed on the in-shipment file may differ from the instance number in this
      field because multiple instances of that assemblage may already exist in your local
      DMLSS database. Also, use the To Assemblage feature when performing an
      assemblage merge, explained in paragraph 8.17.5.
      8.17.1.5.7. Customer. The Customer field only becomes available if the Scope is
      equal to Customer. Use the dropdown menu to associate the assemblage to the
      applicable customer ID.
      8.17.1.5.8. Fund Center. The Fund Center field is used to identify the expense center
      associated to the customer. Upon selecting a customer, this field auto populates with
      the customer‘s associated expense center.
      8.17.1.5.9. Project Code. Not required for AF activities.
      8.17.1.5.10. Ownership Code. Not required for AF activities.
      8.17.1.5.11. Maint Activity. Assign a specific MA activity to the assemblage. This
      is a mandatory entry.
      8.17.1.5.12. Packing List. Check the Packing List indicator to obtain a printed copy
      of the assemblage packing list. It is printed upon processing the gain. This option is
      highly recommended. Assemblage managers should review the contents of the
      assemblage prior to developing a management plan.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               279


         8.17.1.5.13. Freeze Shipment. Check the Freeze Shipment indicator to ―Freeze‖ the
         assemblage for physical inventory. Once the gain is processed, the ―Freeze‖ is in
         effect and a physical inventory should be conducted immediately, explained in
         paragraph 8.20.
         8.17.1.5.14. Process All. Check this indicator if multiple assemblages appear in the
         Assemblage Description box and a gain is to be processed for all of those
         assemblages. All assemblage files are highlighted upon checking this box.
         8.17.1.5.15. Assemblage Description Box. Displays assemblage in-shipment files
         stored in the folder identified in the Browse to Folder window. This box could
         contain one or more files. To select multiple files, but not all, use the Shift and/or
         Control key function to specify which assemblage files are being gained.
     8.17.1.6. DMLSS may produce an Exceptions Report when data such as supplier and
     MFG on the incoming catalog records does not match local catalog records. For
     example, the losing MTF may have been purchasing an item from PVP, while the gaining
     MTF is purchasing that same item from CB6. All catalog exceptions must be corrected
     prior to using the catalog records in DMLSS.
     8.17.1.7. A SHG transaction and a SFG transaction reason is written to Transaction
     History for each individual item gained during this process. Each SHG/SFG transaction
     is assigned the same document number from document serial block 8000-8499, Gains
     and Losses. DMLSS prohibits reversals of erroneous SHG/SFG transactions. Balance
     adjustments should be made within each assemblage data record or using the AM Gains
     and Losses function.
     8.17.1.8. As a result of the Assemblage Gain, all equipment items, regardless of the
     maintenance requirement indicator, require an acceptance inspection. These work orders
     are written to the MA Inbox under the Acceptance Work Order Inspection pending
     action.
  8.17.2. Assemblage Loss. Four different types of assemblage losses are processed using the
  Assemblage Loss function: Ship Assemblage, Sell Assemblage, War Switch, and Internal
  Transfer.
     8.17.2.1. The top portion of the assemblage loss window Figure 8.20 contains
     assemblage loss criteria and various process codes and indicators. The following data
     fields appear for all of the loss processes.
 280                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 8.20. Assemblage Loss Window.




          8.17.2.1.1. ORG. The ORG defaults to the Host ORG or LOG, i.e. FM9133. Use
          the dropdown menu to identify a different ORG if necessary. The assemblages
          owned by this ORG are displayed in the bottom portion of the window.
          8.17.2.1.2. Include Sub Orgs. Check this indicator to include assemblages associated
          to subordinate ORGs. This option is not available if the primary ORG is not in the
          ―Organization‖ field.
          8.17.2.1.3. Select All. Check this indicator to highlight all assemblages, selecting all
          of them for out-shipment. Theoretically, this option is rarely used because
          assemblage shipments usually do not occur in mass quantities. To highlight multiple
          assemblages, but not all, use the Shift and/or Control key functions.
       8.17.2.2. The bottom portion for each assemblage loss displays all assemblages owned
       by the identified ORG that are available for shipment.
       8.17.2.3. Ship Assemblage (Assm).
          8.17.2.3.1. Use Ship Assm to process a loss and ship the assemblage to another
          facility. From the AM navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfers‖ and then
          ―Assemblage Loss‖. In this window, select the ―Ship Assm‖ process.
          8.17.2.3.2. Consider the following criteria prior to processing an assemblage
          shipment. Some of these actions must be completed in DMLSS prior to processing.
              8.17.2.3.2.1. All catalog exceptions must be rectified.
              8.17.2.3.2.2. Maintenance personnel must complete and close open work orders.
              8.17.2.3.2.3. Finalize Physical Inventories. The assemblage shipment will not
              process if the assemblage or any part of an assemblage is in an inventory freeze
              status.
              8.17.2.3.2.4. Verify there are no commingled items in the project. DMLSS
              produces a Commingled Item Pick List Report when a user attempts to out-ship
              an assemblage.
              8.17.2.3.2.5. Processing and/or closing all pending actions associated to the
              assemblage being out-shipped is highly recommended.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             281


          8.17.2.3.2.6. Printing and filing a copy of the following reports: Assemblage
          Status, Packing List, Commingled Picklist, Incomplete Record, P/S, End/Support
          Item, and the AM Funds Status.
          8.17.2.3.2.7. Identify and track existing due-ins for the assemblage(s) being out-
          shipped. Upon receipt of these items, process individual out-shipments and ship
          the materiel to the gaining facility.
       8.17.2.3.3. In addition to the ―ORG,‖ ―Include Sub Orgs,‖ and ―Select all‖ fields
       described in paragraph 8.17.2.1, the following process codes and data fields appear
       when Ship Assm is selected:
          8.17.2.3.3.1. Remove from AM. This indicator should always be checked.
          When checked, DMLSS removes the assemblage from the system once all actions
          are processed.
          8.17.2.3.3.2. Archive. The Archive indicator is checked by default.            All
          assemblage sales files should be archived and accessible for future use.
          8.17.2.3.3.3. Ship to RIC, DODAAC, and Priority. These data fields are
          important to both the losing and gaining facilities. Enter the Ship to RIC, gaining
          DODAAC, and shipment priority code to document the required shipment data.
          This information is printed on the DD Form 1348-1A.
       8.17.2.3.4. Assemblages Available for Shipment. The assemblages associated to the
       identified ORG are displayed in the bottom portion of the window and are available
       for shipment. All work orders must be closed before Transfer can be completed. If
       there are any assemblages with Open Work Orders the message box will appear.
       Click ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ (if you click Yes the Work Order screen appears).
       8.17.2.3.5. Click the ―Save‖ button located on the vertical toolbar once all
       assemblage shipment criteria and indicators are selected. The Ship to Address screen
       (Figure 8.21.) will appear. If correct click ―OK.‖ Click ―OK‖ in the Assemblage Loss
       Verification window.

          8.17.2.3.6. In the Browse to Folder window Figure 8.22, identify the local folder in
          which the 21 assemblage shipment files will be stored. These files should be stored
          to a CD (usually D drive). Click ―OK‖ to save the data files. If the Archive indicator
          was checked, save the files according to the explanation provided in paragraph 8.17.
          and figure 8.18. In either case, make sure an additional copy of all 21 files is stored
          in a local or shared folder for later use, if necessary. Label all discs accordingly.

Figure 8.22. Assemblage Loss Browse for Folder.




          8.17.2.3.7. A DD Form 1348-1A is printed as a result of the out-shipment to support
          the transfer.
          8.17.2.3.8. Due-ins and pending actions associated to the assemblage being out-
          shipped are identified with a red ―X‖ in the delete column. This may appear in other
          modules such as IM.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              283


        8.17.2.3.9. The maintenance data and maintenance cost information associated to
        equipment items being out-shipped are written to the out-shipment files and that data
        is populated in the gaining facility‘s corresponding equipment records.
        8.17.2.3.10. DMLSS records the transfer in Transaction History as transaction type
        SHL and transaction reason SFL. The document serial block assigned is 8000-8499,
        Gains and Losses. Erroneous SHL transactions can be reversed in IM Transaction
        History.
     8.17.2.4. Sell Assemblage (Assm).
        8.17.2.4.1. The Sell Assemblage function is used to sell an entire assemblage to a
        customer. Generally, this action is directed by higher headquarters and the receiving
        customer ID and expense center are specified in the notification. If necessary, create
        the new customer ID, expense, and project centers IAW instructions provided in
        Chapter 4.
        8.17.2.4.2. Because the assemblage is being ―sold,‖ the customer must ―pay‖ for the
        assets. This process issues all OH serviceable assets to the customer. DMLSS
        generates a reimbursable INR transaction for the OH serviceable assets; charging the
        customer to include applicable surcharges. This action obligates and expenses
        customer funds while increasing the R-Sales field in the AM fund record.
        8.17.2.4.3. An issue is not generated for assets that are not serviceable. Therefore,
        the Stratification (Strat) State is coded as Unserviceable, Suspended, Reparable, or
        FDA Test. These assets are identified and printed on the Assemblage Sale
        Exceptions Report and must be worked separately.
        8.17.2.4.4. Additionally, DMLSS decreases the assemblage allowance quantities
        (levels) to zero. If assets do not issue due to Strat State code, the OH quantity is
        maintained and allowance quantity is set to zero.
        8.17.2.4.5. From the AM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfers‖ and then
        ―Assemblage Loss.‖ In the ―Assemblage Loss‖ window, select the ―Sell Assm‖
        process.
        8.17.2.4.6. In addition to the ―ORG,‖ ―Include Sub Orgs,‖ and ―Select all‖ fields
        described in paragraph 8.17.2.1, the following process codes and data fields appear
        when Sell Assm is selected:
            8.17.2.4.6.1. Check Funds. If checked, DMLSS enforces a funds edit to verify
            customer funds are available to cover the sale amount. The assemblage sale will
            not process if sufficient funds are not available. If not checked, DMLSS
            processes the assemblage sale regardless of funds availability. This may cause
            the customer‘s expense and project centers to go negative. See paragraph 8.16.9.
            8.17.2.4.6.2. Archive. The Archive indicator is checked by default.           All
            assemblage sales files should be archived and accessible for future use.
            8.17.2.4.6.3. Sell to Customer. Enter the customer‘s ID in which the assemblage
            is being sold.
            8.17.2.4.6.4. Ship to RIC, and Priority. These data fields are optional; however,
284                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             this data may be important if the customer is geographically separated. These
             data fields provide an excellent opportunity to document this data. If entered, this
             information is printed on the DD Form 1348-1A. Load the gaining activities RIC
             into the RIC field.
         8.17.2.4.7. Assemblages Available for Sale. The assemblages associated to the
         identified ORG are displayed in the bottom portion of the window and are available
         for shipment.
         8.17.2.4.8. All work orders must be closed before Transfer can be completed. If
         there are any assemblages with Open Work Orders the message box will appear.
         Click ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ (if you click Yes the Work Order screen appears). Click ―Print‖
         to print Work Order page.
         8.17.2.4.9. Click the ―Save‖ button located on the vertical toolbar once all
         assemblage sales criteria and indicators are selected and applied to applicable
         assemblages. A message appears prompting to either continue or discontinue the
         sale. If you continue the sale, the following messages and/or prompts appear:
             8.17.2.4.9.1. In the Browse for Folder window, identify a local folder as
             explained in paragraph 8.17. and figure 8.18. to save the assemblage sale data
             files. These files should be provided to the customer and can be saved to a CD.
             8.17.2.4.9.2. Next, identify the local folder as explained in paragraph 8.16. and
             figure 8.18. to archive the assemblage sale data files. These files should be saved
             and accessible by the losing activity.
             8.17.2.4.9.3. Click ―OK‖ in the Assemblage Sale was Successful window.
             8.17.2.4.9.4. Click ―OK‖ in the Assemblage Exceptions are created for the AM
             Sale window if it appears. As explained in 8.17.2.5., if assets did not issue due to
             Strat State they are written to the AM Item(s) Could Not Be Sold Report pending
             action.
         8.17.2.4.10. Assemblages for external customers and assemblages requiring
         transportation will be shipped through base transportation (CMOS). Check the status
         of the assemblage using the out-shipment tab in the Transportation module. The
         source document (DD 1348-1a) will automatically print.
         8.17.2.4.11. If shipping the assemblage, forward the assemblage sales data files, a
         copy of the Delivery List, Active Due-ins list, and a copy of the DD1348-1A to the
         gaining customer. Print an Assemblage Status Report for all items not shipped due to
         stratification state or existing due-ins. The Active Due-ins List identifies items that
         are currently on order for the project. Assets received after 30 days are to be
         absorbed into other WRM assemblages if needed and reported excess if no
         requirement exists. The Assemblage Status Report will identify items that were not
         shipped due to their stratification state or order status. All these reports provide the
         gaining customer better oversight when determining initial requirements after
         receiving the assemblage.
      8.17.2.5. War Switch.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             285


       8.17.2.5.1. The purpose of the War Switch is to transition a stored assemblage(s) to
       an operational mode. This action is generally directed by higher headquarters. If
       necessary, create new customer, expense, and project centers IAW instructions
       provided in Chapter 4, System Services.
       8.17.2.5.2. The first step in processing the War Switch is to specify the Trans Org ID
       in the Assemblage Description Change window, paragraph 8.26. Select ―Assemblage
       Description Change‖ from the AM navigate dropdown menu and load the applicable
       Host LOG account (DODAAC) or customer ID in the Trans Org ID field. Save
       changes prior to exiting the window. Repeat this action for each assemblage and/or
       sub-assemblage in which the War Switch is being applied.
       8.17.2.5.3. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Transfers‖ and then ―Assemblage
       Loss.‖ In the Assemblage Loss window, click on the ―War Switch‖ indicator in the
       Process box. The War Switch criteria and indicators are listed in the top portion of
       the window and all assemblages associated to the specified ORG are listed in the
       bottom portion of the window.
       8.17.2.5.4. In addition to the ―ORG,‖ ―Include Sub Orgs,‖ and ―Select all‖ fields
       described in paragraph 8.17.2.1., the following process codes and data fields appear
       when the War Switch is selected:
          8.17.2.5.4.1. Delivery List. Check this indicator to produce and print a delivery
          list as part of the process. The customer can use the delivery list to perform an
          initial inventory upon receipt of the assets.
          8.17.2.5.4.2. Page Break. This option is only available when the Delivery List
          indicator is checked. It defaults to ―None‖ but can be change to ―By Loc‖ or ―By
          Loc/Sub Loc‖ to satisfy local requirements.
          8.17.2.5.4.3. Check Funds. If checked, DMLSS enforces a funds edit to verify
          customer funds are available to cover the total dollar value of customer issues.
          The War Switch only processes if sufficient funds are available. If not checked,
          DMLSS processes the issues regardless of funds availability. This may cause the
          customer‘s expense and project centers to go negative. See paragraph 8.16.9.
       8.17.2.5.5. Available Assemblages. The assemblages associated to the identified
       ORG are displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Only the assemblages
       assigned an ―Activate Org‖ are available for the War Switch process.
       8.17.2.5.6. The following information should be identified prior to processing the
       War Switch:
          8.17.2.5.6.1. Identify whether or not the assets are for resupply. If for resupply,
          the assets are gained into operating inventory if the host MM Service ORG ID,
          i.e. FM4479, is associated to the particular assemblage or sub-assemblage in the
          ―Trans Org ID‖ field. If not for resupply, the assets are issued to a specified
          customer.
          8.17.2.5.6.2. If not for resupply, then identify the customer‘s ID in which the
          assets are to be issued.
          8.17.2.5.6.3. Ensure an equipment custodian is assigned to all customer accounts
286                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


             affected by the War Switch. This is accomplished in EM.
         8.17.2.5.7. DMLSS generates the following transactions as a result of processing the
         War Switch and marking assets as resupply.
             8.17.2.5.7.1. An ITL transaction is processed to document the loss from the
             specified assemblage. An ITL is processed for each record containing OH
             serviceable assets. The assemblage‘s serviceable balances are reduced to zero.
             8.17.2.5.7.2. An ITG transaction is processed to document the gain into operating
             stock. An ITG is processed for each corresponding ITL and LOG‘s serviceable
             balances are increased by the ITG quantity.
         8.17.2.5.8. DMLSS generates the following transactions as a result of processing the
         War Switch and marking the assets for customer issue.
             8.17.2.5.8.1. A reimbursable INR is processed to document the issue of
             serviceable OH assets. The total dollar value of these issues is written to the R-
             Sales field in the AM fund record.
             8.17.2.5.8.2. A RNR is generated documenting the customer‘s receipt of the
             assets. A RNR is processed for each corresponding INR.
             8.17.2.5.8.3. A SLR is generated adjusting the customer‘s stock level. The new
             customer location level mirrors the old assemblage‘s cumulative level for the
             affected item ID.
         8.17.2.5.9. In addition to these transactions, DMLSS also creates customer catalog
         records for the affected customer accounts if one did not already exist. The
         customer‘s EOH balance is increased by the RNR quantity. The customer‘s level
         type defaults to ―Static‖ and the reorder point of supply assets is set to two-thirds of
         the level.
         8.17.2.5.10. OH assets assigned a Strat State of Unserviceable, Suspended,
         Reparable, or FDA Test remain OH in the assemblage and are identified as an
         exception in the AM Item(s) Could Not Be Sold pending action.
         8.17.2.5.11. Equipment data records are updated accordingly. Maintenance ―Stored‖
         cycles are converted to ―In-Use‖ cycles and work orders are generated, if applicable.
         The equipment is reassigned to the new customer account and a Custody
         Receipt/Location List is generated for the corresponding equipment custodian‘s
         signature.
      8.17.2.6. Internal Transfer.
         8.17.2.6.1. Use the Assemblage Loss – Internal Transfer function to transfer an
         assemblage from one ORG to another ORG within the same DMLSS database. For
         example, if an assemblage is currently associated to LOG but should be associated to
         the local ANG‘s ORG, you would use this function to reassign ownership.
         8.17.2.6.2. From the AM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfers and then
         ―Assemblage Loss.‖ In the Assemblage Loss window, select ―Internal Transfer‖ in
         the Process box. Use the Internal Transfer criteria and indicators as follows.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   287


          8.17.2.6.3. In addition to the ―ORG,‖ ―Include Sub Orgs,‖ and ―Select all‖ fields
          described in paragraph 8.17.2.1., the following process codes and data fields appear
          when the Internal Transfer is selected:
             8.17.2.6.3.1. Packing List. Check this indicator to produce and print a packing
             list as part of the process. The gaining ORG can use the packing list to perform
             an initial inventory upon receipt of the assets.
             8.17.2.6.3.2. Page Break. This option is only available when the Delivery List
             indicator is checked. It defaults to ―None‖ but can be changed to ―By Loc‖ or
             ―By Loc/Sub Loc‖ to satisfy local requirements.
             8.17.2.6.3.3. Transfer ORG. Use the dropdown menu to specify the gaining
             ORG. Click ―Apply‖ to apply the gaining ORG to all highlighted assemblages.
          8.17.2.6.4. Available Assemblages. The assemblages associated to the identified
          ORG are displayed in the bottom portion of the window.
          8.17.2.6.5. Click ―Save‖ to process the transfer once all criteria and indicators are set
          and the transfer ORG is applied to the applicable assemblage(s). The Internal
          Transfer process generates an ITL transaction for all assets transferred from the losing
          ORG and an ITG transaction for all assets transferred to the gaining ORG. These
          transactions are written to Transaction History and all ITLs and ITGs are assigned the
          same document number from document serial block 8000-8499, Gains and Losses.
          Assembly fund targets are not transferred to the new ORG and must be reestablished
          if applicable.
   8.17.3. AM Reconstitution.
      8.17.3.1. Use the AM Reconstitution to recover returned assemblage assets that were
      previously sold or transitioned to operating as a result of the War Switch process. First,
      inventory the assemblage assets to determine what items will be gained back into the
      MTF‘s WRM program. The archived data files from the original assemblage sale or War
      Switch process must be accessible in order to process the reconstitution. Asset
      reconstitution does not have to be performed in its entirety at the single session which
      means the AM Reconstitution process can be accessed multiple times for the same
      assemblage until the Complete Reconstitution indicator is processed.
      8.17.3.2. From the AM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfer‖ and then ―AM
      Reconstitution‖ to access this function Figure 8.23. Use the Reconstitution search criteria
      as follows.

Figure 8.23. AM Reconstitution Screen.
288                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         8.17.3.2.1. AM Sale. Select AM Sale if the original assemblage was lost due to an
         Assemblage Loss – Sell Assm process. DMLSS automatically detects the
         assemblages that were previously sold.
         8.17.3.2.2. War Switch. Select War Switch if the original assemblage was lost due to
         processing the War Switch. DMLSS automatically detects assemblages that were
         previously lost due to processing the War Switch.
         8.17.3.2.3. Complete Reconstitution. Check this indicator after the restitution is
         complete. The assemblage data files can be reaccessed as many times as necessary
         until this indicator is processed, but once this box is checked the reconstitution
         process is finalized and DMLSS will not allow further modifications to the
         assemblage data files.
         8.17.3.2.4. ORG. Specify the ORG that owned the original assemblage.
      8.17.3.3. Click ―Search‖ once all search criteria is entered. The assemblage location
      records are retrieved from the archived data files and displayed in the Reconstitution
      window. Use the ―Check all Processes‖ button to select all records for reconstitution.
      Use the ―Uncheck all Processes‖ button to remove the process indicator from all records.
      8.17.3.4. The Gain Quantity and Process indicator are the only editable fields. The
      original quantity, reversed quantity, loss document number, original location, sub-
      location, and ECN are also displayed for reference. The Gain Quantity defaults to the
      original loss quantity and must be modified as necessary.
      8.17.3.5. The location records are displayed in item ID sequence. As counts are
      performed and completed, enter the actual return quantity in the Gain Quantity field for
      each applicable item ID. Check the Process indicator for records containing a Gain
      Quantity. DMLSS generates the following actions upon clicking ―Save.‖
         8.17.3.5.1. Processes an INR reversal transaction for each item containing a Gain
         Quantity to offset the original INR generated as a result of the original sale or War
         Switch process. All reversals are written to Transaction History.
         8.17.3.5.2. Updates the Reversed Quantity field to reflect the reconstituted quantities.
         This field reflects the total reversed quantity if multiple reversals are processed for
         the same location record.
         8.17.3.5.3. Customers do not receive credit for returned assets.
         8.17.3.5.4. After saving, the ―Complete‖ button appears in the vertical toolbar. Click
         this button to finalize the process if the reconstitution is completed for the
         assemblage.
      8.17.3.6. After the reconstitution process is completed, the assemblage allowance
      standard (AS) must be reapplied. The AS can be processed using the DMLSS master
      UDR or from the AS file download from the AFML website. Your local business
      practice determines where this data is obtained. Once the AS data is updated, you will be
      able to view readiness percentages on the Assemblage Status Report.
  8.17.4. Assemblage ID Change.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            289


     8.17.4.1. Use the Assemblage ID Change process to modify an assemblage‘s ID data, i.e.
     Assm description, Assm ID, increment number, sub-assemblage, and/or instance. This
     process should only be used if an existing assemblage was gained or created using the
     incorrect ID data or if directed by higher headquarters. For example, an assemblage was
     originally created for a Hospital Surgical Expansion Package using Assm ID: 885;
     Increment: A; Instance: 1; and Sub-assemblage: 0. After further review, you found that
     you should have built a Hospital Medical Expansion Package using Assm ID: 885;
     Increment: B; Instance: 1; and Sub-assemblage: 0.
     8.17.4.2. For the AM navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfer‖ and the ―Assemblage
     ID Change‖ to access this process. In the top portion of the Assemblage ID Change
     window, identify the owning ORG and the source assemblage. In the bottom portion of
     the window, identify the new assemblage ID data. If the ensuing change is to the same
     Assm ID (from 885 A to 885 A), only the instance number is updated (from 885 A 1 0 to
     885 A 2 0).
     8.17.4.3. This process generates an exception and an Allowance Change Report.
     Assemblage managers should print these reports and take action as necessary to correct
     catalog data and allowance standards. Upon completion, the old assemblage no longer
     exists and the new assemblage is available throughout AM.
  8.17.5. Assemblage Merge.
     8.17.5.1. Use the Assemblage Merge process to combine two like assemblages that are
     partial or incomplete making one complete assemblage. The two partial assemblages
     must be assigned the same assemblage ID, i.e. 903L and 903L. Assemblages assigned
     different assemblage IDs cannot be merged. Assemblage Gain is used in conjunction
     with Assemblage Merge to complete this process.
     8.17.5.2. Generally speaking, one portion of the assemblage would already be on record
     in AM and the remaining portion was shipped to your site to satisfy remaining
     requirements. For example, assemblage 903/L/1/0 is loaded against your host ORG.
     AFMOA/SGALW notifies you that they shipped the remaining assets and you will be
     receiving a second set of in-shipment files containing the data records for 903L. The
     second set will need to be merged with existing assemblage 903/L/1/0.
     8.17.5.3. The files are sent to the gaining base by AFMOA/SGALW or the losing base
     via email or CD. When these files are received they must be copied onto a local PC.
     Recommend using storage procedures described in paragraph 8.17. and figure 8.18.
     8.17.5.4. From the AM navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfer‖ and then
     ―Assemblage Merge‖ to initiate the merge process after the in-shipment files have been
     saved to a local drive.
     8.17.5.5. Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate ORG. All assemblages
     owned by the specified ORG are displayed. Highlight the assemblage in which the
     ensuing merge will be applied. Upon clicking ―Save,‖ the out-shipment indicator is
     flagged with a red ―X.‖
     8.17.5.6. Next, process an Assemblage Gain to complete the process. From the AM
     Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Transfer‖ and then ―Assemblage Gain.‖ When
 290                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       prompted, identify the folder in which the in-shipment data files were saved. In the
       Assemblage Gain window, specify the ORG in which the merge assemblage is
       associated. In the To Assemblage field, specify the assemblage in which the data files
       are being merged.
       8.17.5.7. The following actions are generated as a result of the Assemblage Merge
       process.
          8.17.5.7.1. SHG/SFG transactions are written to Transaction History for the gaining
          assets; meaning those contained on the second in-shipment file. The existing assets
          were gained during the original in-shipment. All SHG/SFL transactions are assigned
          a document serial number from the 8000-8499 block, Gains and Losses.
          8.17.5.7.2. The AM Gains Incomplete because of Price Factor pending action is
          generated for data records if the U/P and/or U/S ratios conflict with existing catalog
          records.
          8.17.5.7.3. Records with incomplete catalog data are written to an exception report.
          8.17.5.7.4. A P/S report is produced if P/S relationships are detected on the in-
          shipment file.
          8.17.5.7.5. The out-shipment indicator is removed on the assemblage.
8.18. Transportation. This option provides outshipment and inshipment search screens from
the Distribution and Transportation Module (D&TM) that allow users to track all or selected
shipments. AM users can process transactions requiring DRMO, Return to Source of Supply,
Return Item for Trade-In, Sell Assemblage, Ship Assemblage, regular loss transactions,
Reachback orders, and ship Excess type transactions that will be tracked within the D&TM
module. See Attachment 4, DMLSS Distribution and Transportation Module, for additional
instruction.
8.19. Orders.
   8.19.1. Asset Review.
       8.19.1.1. The Asset Review function is used to transfer assets between WRM
       assemblages and/or between WRM and operating (OPR). After identifying search
       criteria, this function displays asset records with potential overages and shortages so that
       managers can transfer (restratify) assets to meet requirements while minimizing losses
       due to deterioration and excess.
       8.19.1.2. The order of transfers is important to the effectiveness of the process and
       ensures proper stock usage. Restratify assets in the following order: Host ORG (LOG)
       Assemblages, subordinate ORG Assemblages, OPR, Special Projects (SP), and then
       Excess.
       8.19.1.3. From the AM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Asset
       Review‖ to access the Asset Review search criteria window. The search criteria window
       contains the following data fields.
          8.19.1.3.1. ORG. Use the dropdown menu to specify the ORG that owns the
          assemblage(s) being reviewed. Once populated, all assemblages associated to that
          ORG are displayed.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                291


         8.19.1.3.2. Available Assemblages. Select or highlight one or more assemblages for
         review. The Asset Review function identifies overages and shortages for all
         highlighted assemblages.
         8.19.1.3.3. Search Criteria. If WRM is selected, the Asset Review will only include
         WRM assemblages. If WRM and Operating is selected, the OPR overages and
         shortages will also be identified.
      8.19.1.4. The Asset Review window Figure 8.24 displays all records with the potential
      for restratification in item ID sequence. It is divided into three portions: Item Details,
      Selected Assemblages, and the Potential Transfer to Location.

Figure 8.24. Asset Review Window.




         8.19.1.4.1. Item Details. The item ID details appear in the upper portion of the
         window. Use the VCR buttons located above the item ID to scroll to other records in
         the selected assemblage(s) with overages and/or shortages. Click ―Jump To‖ next to
         the item ID to review the MTF catalog record. If applicable, review consumption
         history when considering transferring assets between WRM and OPR stocks. Also
         consider when the WRM item could be physically moved to OPR and made available
         for consumption. For example, do not process the transfer if the item will expire
         before it can be used.
         8.19.1.4.2. Selected Assemblages. The item balances for each selected assemblage
         are displayed in the middle portion of the window. An asset balance detail record
         appears for all selected assemblages, even if the asset balances are zero. Review this
         list to locate the assemblage(s) that contain potential overages or shortages.
         8.19.1.4.3. The bottom portion of the window (the ―Transfer to‖ portion) lists other
         WRM assemblage(s) or LOG OPR details in which a corresponding shortage or
         overage also exists.
      8.19.1.5. To begin the transfer process, highlight the source assemblage in the Selected
      Assemblage portion of the window and mark the destination assemblage or OPR by
      placing an ―X‖ in the ―SEL‖ box located in the Transfer To portion of the window. Once
 292                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       the source and destination are identified, click on the ―Transfer‖ button located on the
       vertical toolbar and the Internal Transfer window appears.
       8.19.1.6. The Internal Transfer window Figure 8.25 is separated into several boxes. The
       Item ID details, Source (From), and Destination (To) data defaults according to the
       transfer criteria determined in the previous Asset Review window.

Figure 8.25. Internal Transfer Window.




          8.19.1.6.1. Transfer Quantity. Determine the transfer quantity and enter that number
          in the Transfer Quantity field.
          8.19.1.6.2. Transfer From. If only one source location record is available this field is
          uneditable. If multiple source location records exist, specify which will be used as
          the source and identify the quantity being transferred from that location record.
          Transfers can be processed from multiple location records at the same time.
          8.19.1.6.3. Transfer To. If only one destination location record is available this field
          is uneditable. If multiple destination location records exist, specify which will be
          used as the destination and identify the quantity being transferred to that location
          record. Transfers can be processed to multiple location records at the same time.
          8.19.1.6.4. Existing Location. Check the Existing Location indicator if assets are
          being transferred to an existing location. Uncheck this indicator if the assets are
          being transferred to a new location.
       8.19.1.7. Click ―Save‖ once the transfer quantity, source, and destination records have
       been identified. Click ―Yes‖ when prompted to print the delivery list. Use this delivery
       list to relocate the transferred assets. DMLSS returns to the Asset Review window once
       the transfer is completed and the data records are updated to reflect the changes.
       Continue to process transfers or ―Close‖ the window to exit the Asset Review function.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    293


      8.19.1.8. As a result of the transfers, an ITL transaction is generated to document the loss
      from the source location and an ITG transaction is generated to document the gain to the
      destination location. These transactions are written to Transaction History and assigned a
      document serial number from the 8000-8499 series, Gains and Losses.
   8.19.2. Replenishment List.
      8.19.2.1. The Replenishment List function is used to review LOG owned assemblage
      shortages and determine a replenishment method. Assemblage managers should research
      excess materiel availability and process an in-house Asset Review (paragraph 8.19.1.)
      prior to using WRM funds to replenish stock.
      8.19.2.2. DMLSS prioritizes item replenishments as follows:
          8.19.2.2.1. If funds are available to replenish 100% of shortages, all requirements
          will appear in the Replenishment List window.
          8.19.2.2.2. If funds are not available for 100% replenishment, then DMLSS
          calculates replenishment quantities to meet a target dollar amount by sorting all
          critical item shortages from lowest cost to highest, ordering one of each until the
          dollar cost exceeds the remaining available amount. DMLSS proceeds to order
          another of each item starting at the lowest and the cycle continues until there is
          insufficient funds to order any remaining critical shortages or all critical shortages are
          satisfied. If money remains, the process repeats with noncritical shortages until all
          shortages are filled or the target dollar amount is exhausted.
      8.19.2.3. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Replenishment List‖
      or click on the ―Replenish‖ button located on the horizontal toolbar to access the AM
      Replenishment search criteria window Figure 8.26. Utilize the available search tools as
      follows to access the desired replenishment lists.

Figure 8.26. AM Replenishment Search Criteria Window.




          8.19.2.3.1. ORG. Use the dropdown menu to identify the ORG that owns the
          assemblage(s) being replenished.
294                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         8.19.2.3.2. Available Assemblages. All assemblages owned by the specified ORG
         are displayed and available for replenishment action. Only assemblages coded as
         LOG owned are available. Multiple assemblages and/or sub-assemblages can be
         selected simultaneously as long as they are assigned to the same AM Fund record.
         8.19.2.3.3. Rollup Requirements.       Check this indicator to ―roll-up‖ multiple
         requirements for the same item ID into a single replenishment requirement. The
         ―roll-up‖ action occurs at the assemblage ID level; therefore, sub-assemblages can be
         rolled up, but different assemblages cannot be rolled together, i.e. 937G and 941A
         cannot be rolled up. For example, an EMEDS Basic, 937A, contains multiple sub-
         assemblages. Item ID 6510-00-201-2001, Bandage Cast Plaster 3‖ x 3 yards, is
         assigned an allowance quantity of 1 PG in both sections A (Emergency Room) and K
         (Logistics). Upon executing the order, DMLSS creates individual ESD transactions
         for each item ID within each assemblage. Depending upon the SOS type linked to the
         order, DMLSS either combines the total order amount into one single contract line
         item number (CLIN) as is the case for DPV type sources or breaks each item out by
         document number on the order file, i.e. DD1155, EDI 511R, etc. Receipts are still
         performed at the individual document number level.
         8.19.2.3.4. Item ID. Enter an item ID if looking to replenish a single item.
         8.19.2.3.5. Stock Target Criteria. The Stock Target Criteria feature provides a
         method for assemblage managers to determine replenishment action based on a
         percentage of critical and noncritical items or based on a specified dollar amount.
         This feature could be used when funds are not available to replenish the entire
         assemblage and you need to maximize use of available funds.
             8.19.2.3.5.1. Percentage. The critical stock percentage must be set to 100%
             before a percentage can be entered into the noncritical percentage field. If critical
             is less than 100%, then the noncritical is set to zero.
             8.19.2.3.5.2. Dollar Amount. A target dollar amount can be specified if a target
             percentage is not used. While any target amount can be entered in the search
             criteria window, the funds available balance cannot be exceeded during a
             replenishment action.
         8.19.2.3.6. Select Allow Qty. This feature allows assemblage managers to produce a
         replenishment list based on the current allowance quantities or the old allowance
         quantities. Available AM funds should only be utilized to fulfill current allowance
         quantities.
         8.19.2.3.7. LOG Order. If checked, the replenishment action will include LOG, i.e.
         EFN, to see if stock is available to replenish WRM requirements. This indicator
         should be unchecked except for an emergency deployment because funds are
         allocated to WRM separately and you should not use OPR stocks to fill WRM
         shortages.
      8.19.2.4. Click ―Search‖ once the applicable search criteria are identified. All item
      shortages meeting the search criteria are displayed in the Replenishment List window
      Figure 8.27. Some of the data in this window is for informational purposes while other
      fields and indicators are editable and used to submit item orders. The list also provides
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    295


      dollar figures that identify critical shortage dollars, total order critical shortage dollars,
      total shortage dollars, and total order dollars. These figures could be helpful when
      determining your WRM budget requirements or requesting additional funds from
      AFMLO.

Figure 8.27. AM Replenishment List Window.




      8.19.2.5. Order quantities are defaulted to the shortage quantity and appear in the order
      column. If the quantity is adjusted, the total order dollar field is increased or decreased
      by the price difference. If the item is coded as critical, the total order critical shortage
      dollars are also adjusted.
      8.19.2.6. The AM replenishment process identifies AM requirements for other
      procurement (OP) items but does not allow them to be ordered from AM replenishment.
      Use the Offline/Non-Submit order process, paragraph 8.19.4., to establish due-ins for
      these items. AFMOA/SGALX will provide specific processing procedures for this type
      of order.
      8.19.2.7. The Advice Code does not appear in the Replenishment List window; however,
      it defaults to ―2D‖ (furnish exact quantity requested) and can be modified in the Build
      Orders details window. Note: Refer to SS Module TMU Table, Advice Codes for a list
      of all advice codes.
      8.19.2.8. Item IDs that appear in ―RED‖ indicate that the order quantity is less than the
      total required quantity. This usually occurs when insufficient funds are available to
      replenish the total required quantity. Review the list to ensure that you order the most
      critical requirements first.
      8.19.2.9. Replenishment List Window. The following fields and features are available in
      this window:
296                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      8.19.2.9.1. Target Stock Percentages. The Target Stock Percentage is equal to the
      amount on hand and due-in versus the authorized amount. The Target Stock Dollar
      Amount displays the available funds. This amount cannot be zero.
      8.19.2.9.2. Priority Code. Use the dropdown menu to assign appropriate priority
      code. If left blank, system assigns routine priority code, i.e. 13. Note: Priority code
      03 should not be used to order in-garrison materiel.
      8.19.2.9.3. Signal Code. Use the dropdown menu to assign appropriate code, ―A‖
      (ship to requisitioner) should be assigned in almost all instances. Defaults to ―A‖ if
      left blank.
      8.19.2.9.4. Project Code. Enter the project code if known. In most cases, project
      codes are no longer used.
      8.19.2.9.5. Media & Status (M/S) Code. Use the dropdown menu to assign the
      appropriate M&S code. If left blank, it defaults to ―S‖ (100% Supply and Shipment
      Status).
      8.19.2.9.6. Supplementary Address (Supp Add). Enter a supplementary address if
      materiel is to be shipped to a location other than the ordering facilities ship to address.
      If used, the signal code should be changed to ―J‖ (Ship to Supplementary Address;
      Bill to Requisitioner).
      8.19.2.9.7. Distribution (Dist) Code. Assign if applicable.
      8.19.2.9.8. Required Delivery Date (Req Del Date). Enter date item is required to be
      delivered.
      8.19.2.9.9. Select All. Click ―Select All‖ to highlight all records. Click a second
      time to unselect all records.
      8.19.2.9.10. Apply.    Click ―Apply‖ to apply requisition codes to selected
      (highlighted) records.
      8.19.2.9.11. Set Qty to Zero. Click this button to change the order quantity to zero
      for highlighted records. To set all order quantities to zero, click ―Select All‖ and then
      ―Set Qty to Zero.‖
      8.19.2.9.12. End/Support (E/S) Item Indicator. A check in the E/S box indicates that
      this particular item ID supports other equipment/supplies. Do not deviate from this
      procurement source or product number when ordering this item.
      8.19.2.9.13. P/S Indicator. A check in the P/S box indicates a P/S relationship exists
      for the item. Review the P/S ratios to determine whether or not a requirement exists
      and what quantity is actually required.
      8.19.2.9.14. Delete Indicator (Del). A checkmark in the Del column indicates the
      item is coded for deletion. Research these items to determine if they are valid
      allowance standard items and process accordingly. Remember to check P/S
      relationships.
      8.19.2.9.15. Exceptions (Excp). A check in the Excp box indicates a replenishment
      exception exists for the item. Use the ―Jump To‖ button located in the item ID
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                297


        column heading to view the LOG/MTF Catalog to correct replenishment exceptions.
        Exception items may not be ordered until the exception is remedied. Click on the
        exception item to view the Exception Report window. The report provides exception
        data by item ID for the specified assemblage.
        8.19.2.9.16. Fund. Identifies the associated AM Fund number.
        8.19.2.9.17. Available Balance. Identifies the associated AM Fund records available
        balance.
        8.19.2.9.18. Total Critical Shortage Dollars. Total dollar value of critical shortage
        items.
        8.19.2.9.19. Total Order Critical Shortage Dollars.      Total dollar value of critical
        shortage items being replenished.
        8.19.2.9.20. Total Shortage Dollars. Total dollar value of shortages.
        8.19.2.9.21. Total Order Dollars. Total value of items being replenished.
        8.19.2.9.22. Add Item. Click the ―Add Item‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to
        access the Replenishment List – Enter Item ID window. Enter the applicable item ID
        and assemblage in which the item is being added and click ―OK.‖ The
        Replenishment List appears with the added item. Modify codes and quantities as
        necessary before executing the order.
        8.19.2.9.23. Asset Review (A/R). A check in the A/R box indicates that a potential
        overage for that item ID exists in another assemblage or in OPR inventory. Highlight
        the applicable line item and click the ―Asset Review‖ button located on the vertical
        toolbar. If possible, transfer assets as explained in paragraph 8.19.1. to satisfy stock
        shortages.
        8.19.2.9.24. Print. Click the ―Print‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to print a
        copy of the displayed Replenishment List.
        8.19.2.9.25. Refresh. Click this button to refresh the replenishment requirements if
        all are not processed at the same time.
     8.19.2.10. Click ―Save‖ to process the replenishments once all codes, indicators, and
     quantities are applied. In the AM Order window Figure 8.28, select a single SOS or
     multiple SOSs to process. Orders are separated by SOS and commodity type then
     displayed in the Orders window. Enter a call number for the order if ―AUTO‖ assign call
     number indicator is not checked for the SOS. You will not need to enter a call number if
     ―AUTO‖ assigned is checked for that SOS. The next sequential call number is pulled
     from the SOS Catalog record, Contract tab. Select one or all orders to process and click
     the ―Execute‖ button located on the vertical toolbar.

      8.19.2.11. An ESD transaction is written to the Due-In file and Transaction History.
      Each line item is assigned a 0001-2999 document serial number.
   8.19.3. Customer Owned Assemblage Replenishment.
      8.19.3.1. Use this function to process replenishment orders for CO Assemblage(s). This
      function looks and works similar to AM replenishments, except LOG owned assemblages
      are linked to an AM fund record and CO assemblages are associated to a customer ID,
      expense center, and project center; same as CAIM customers. CO assemblage
      allowances must be loaded and shortages must exist before this replenishment process
      can be utilized.
      8.19.3.2. From the AM Navigate dropdown menu, select ―Orders‖ and the ―Customer
      Owned Assemblage Replenishment‖ to access this function. In the criteria window,
      select the customer and assemblage being replenished. Data fields and functions unique
      to CO assemblage replenishment are explained below. Refer to paragraph 8.19.2. for
      detailed explanation of the remaining fields as the LOG owned replenishment is very
      similar.
         8.19.3.2.1. LOG Issue. The LOG Issue indicator determines whether or not LOG
         OPR inventory will be considered during replenishment action. In most instances,
         inventory managers do not want to deplete OPR stock in order to fill CO assemblage
         shortages.
             8.19.3.2.1.1. Unchecked - DMLSS defaults this indicator to ―unchecked‖; which
             means DMLSS bypasses LOG inventory, builds and passes the replenishment
             orders to LOG orders, and the materiel is purchased from the supplier.
             8.19.3.2.1.2. Checked - If the LOG Issue indicator is checked, LOG OPR
             inventory is considered and if available will be issued to fill the requirements. If
             not available, DMLSS builds and passes the replenishment requirements to LOG
             orders for purchase.
         8.19.3.2.2. EOR Funds.     The EOR Funds icon located on the vertical toolbar
         provides a quick view of the customer‘s funds summary. Prior to processing the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  299


          replenishment action, the Total Order Dollar value in the replenishment screen should
          be compared to the funds summary available balance to verify adequate funds are
          available.
          8.19.3.2.3. PVM Price. Use the PVM Price link to obtain a total delivered price for
          items purchased from the Medical/Surgical (Med/Surg) PV. This view shows the
          LOG PVM price, the raw price and the total cost calculation (Cost $ Calculation:
          Raw Price * Cost Recovery Factor * Distribution Fee).
   8.19.4. Offline Non-Submit.
      8.19.4.1. Use the Offline Non-Submit function to manually create due-ins for one-time
      orders, CP/OP item orders, and PV Credit orders. Despite its title, this function is used to
      create offline orders that are either submitted or not submitted electronically. When
      placing offline non-submit orders, the requisition file is not electronically transmitted to
      the SOS so the orders must be manually placed using the telephone, email, or internet;
      however, if the Non-Submit indicator is not checked, the order is electronically submitted
      to the SOS.
      8.19.4.2. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and then ―Offline Non-Submit‖
      to access the Supply/Equipment Offline Orders window. Identify the ORG and select an
      assemblage in the search criteria window and then click ―Search.‖
      8.19.4.3. The Supply/Equipment Offline Orders window Figure 8.29 contains item and
      assemblage information along with two tabs: Main and SOS Details. Use the data fields
      and indicators as explained below to process an Offline Non-Submit order.

Figure 8.29. Supply/Equipment Offline Orders Window.




          8.19.4.3.1. Item ID. First, enter the item ID or click the Flashlight button to view a
          list of item IDs. The Flashlight works in conjunction with the Assm Ind. The item
          ID must be associated to an assemblage to process the offline request. Upon entering
          an item ID, the price, maintenance activity, demand code, allowance quantity,
          priority, and non-submit fields are populated with default data.
300                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         8.19.4.3.2. Assemblage Indicator (Assm Ind). This indicator works in conjunction
         with the Flashlight button. If checked, it limits the item ID search to those items
         contained within the specified assemblage. If the indicator is removed, then all
         catalog records are displayed.
      8.19.4.4. Main Tab.
         8.19.4.4.1. Order Quantity. The Order Qty field appears once an item ID is entered.
         Insert the order quantity for the specified item ID.
         8.19.4.4.2. Price. Enter the current order price of the specified item ID if different
         from the MTF catalog price.
         8.19.4.4.3. Non-Submit. Check this indicator if the order was placed manually using
         the telephone, email, internet, or some other means. If checked, the order will not be
         electronically transmitted to the SOS.         Leave this indicator unchecked to
         electronically transmit the order to the SOS.
         8.19.4.4.4. PV Credit. Check this indicator if the order is being placed against either
         the PVP or PVM WRM credit returns account. If for PV Credit, enter a manually
         controlled call number in the SOS Details tab. DMLSS will assign a document
         number for all PV Credit issues and establish an ESD transaction with Refund Code
         ―N‖ as a result of executing the order request. DMLSS also updates the Credit Fund
         record by the credit dollar amount and posts a history of used credits. The order will
         not process if funds are not available or the order exceeds the available credit amount.
         8.19.4.4.5. Demand Code.      Defaults to Recurring but can be changed to Non-
         Recurring if necessary.
         8.19.4.4.6. Document Number. Enter a manually assigned document number if used.
         If left blank, DMLSS automatically assigns the next available document number.
         8.19.4.4.7. Project Code. Enter the project code if the item is being purchased for a
         specific deployment or contingency if known.
         8.19.4.4.8. Refund Code. Defaults to ―R‖ unless the PV Credit indicator is checked
         or the order is associated to an OP item. Change to ―N‖ as necessary.
         8.19.4.4.9. Required Delivery Date (Req Del Date). Enter the date materiel is
         expected for delivery if applicable. See paragraph 8.19.4.6. for information on
         delayed delivery orders.
         8.19.4.4.10. Priority. Use the dropdown menu to assign the appropriate priority
         code. Defaults to routine if left blank, i.e. ―15.‖
         8.19.4.4.11. Premium Transportation. Check this indicator if premium transportation
         charges were approved to pay for shipping costs.
         8.19.4.4.12. Estimated Release Date (Est Rel Date). Enter the vendor‘s estimated
         release date of the order if known.
         8.19.4.4.13. Add Item. Click the ―Add Item‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to
         add additional line items to the order. In the Add Items window, select and add order
         quantities to one or multiple items to add them to the Offline order. Only items
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                301


        assigned the same SOS as the original item ID appear in the ―Add Item‖ window.
        The document number field will populate with the next sequential document number
        based on the one entered in the original requirement. If 71287200 is assigned to the
        original item ID, then 71287201 is assigned to the first item added to the order using
        Add Item. The price and refund code can also be updated from this window. Select
        ―OK‖ to return to the Supply/Equipment Offline Orders window. Note: Once a
        submitted order is executed, additional line items cannot be added to that call number.
        8.19.4.4.14. SOS Info. Click the SOS Info button located on the vertical toolbar to
        view detailed information about the SOS to include last call number used.
     8.19.4.5. SOS Details Tab.
        8.19.4.5.1. SOS. The default SOS Code assigned to the item ID specified in the
        Main tab appears in this field. Use the dropdown menu to change the SOS as needed.
        If the required SOS is not listed, associate the required SOS to the item ID by clicking
        the ―Jump To‖ button and adding the SOS in the SOS Cat tab of the MTF Catalog
        window.
        8.19.4.5.2. Call Number. Enter a call number if necessary or allow DMLSS to auto
        assign the next available call number. If the SOS is not set to automatically generate
        a call number, you will need to enter a call number.
        8.19.4.5.3. Submission. Verify that the submission method and form are correct
        prior to executing the order. Once all offline order criteria are specified, click the
        ―Execute‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to process the offline order. An ESD
        transaction is written to the due-in file and to the Transaction History for the item(s)
        on the order. A DD Form 1155 is available to be printed on the local printer.
     8.19.4.6. Delayed Delivery Orders. Delayed delivery enables DMLSS users to order
     material to support construction and maintenance of service assemblages, as well as
     supporting other contingency operations that require future deliveries. Users can request
     a PV delayed delivery for medical/surgical orders by entering a delayed delivery date
     (DDD) from the offline orders screen. Required Delivery Date (RDD) toggles to DDD
     when the item is sourced to PVM. The DDD must be greater than 3 calendar days and no
     more than 180 calendar days from the current date. O&M funded sites cannot select a
     DDD beyond the end of the current fiscal year. The PV must provide order
     acknowledgement (EDI 855) to confirm the quantity and acceptance of the DDD within
     three business days of the order placement and cannot use ―IB‖ status code for delayed
     delivery orders. All delayed delivery orders are treated as non-recurring and delivery
     orders/call numbers are separated by DDD.
        8.19.4.6.1. Delayed Delivery Price Changes. Delayed Delivery allows a onetime
        price change per line item before material is delivered. Price updates are automated
        with an EDI 865 notice. The Prime Vendor will provide a final delivered price no
        later than three business days prior to the DDD.
        8.19.4.6.2. Delayed Delivery Shipment. The PV shall make deliveries no earlier than
        one business day prior to the DDD; however, if receipt for the item is not processed
        within two business days after the DDD (seven business days for OCONUS), the user
        will be prompted for potential cancellation. DMLSS creates a pending action, and the
302                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         user receives the following notification: IM Overdue Delayed Delivery Shipment.
         The system then allows the user to process a request for cancellation if an Advanced
         Shipment Notice (EDI 856) has not been received.
      8.19.4.7. PVMs Holding Backorders. Both the primary and back-up Med/Surg PVs can
      hold a backorder; however, the PV must provide an estimated ship date (ESD) on every
      line that is backordered, and the timeframe for delivery is based on the ESD. See Chapter
      5, paragraph 5.14.2.7. for more information on PVM backorders.
  8.19.5. Deferred Item Order / ECAT Contingency Ordering.
      8.19.5.1. Use the Navigate option to select Orders and the Deferred Item Order function
      to identify materiel and place orders for items that are coded as part of the WRM DP
      program. These items should not be ordered until authorized by higher headquarters.
      Reference AFI 41-209, Chapter 13 for directives concerning WRM DP processes. In
      order to procure an item from an ECAT Contingency contract (SOS: ECC, ECD. ECP, or
      ECR) the item IDs must have the applicable SOS established within the MTF catalog
      detail record. Items meeting the prescribed criteria for ECAT Contingency contracts will
      be administered by DLA Troop Support. These select items are populated within the
      Medical Master Catalog (MMC) and pushed to each DMLSS activity via the daily UDR
      Delta process. DMLSS users are prohibited from adding an ECAT Contingency SOS
      record (ECC, ECD, ECP, or ECR) against any item ID unless it is already a component
      of the MMC data feed.
      8.19.5.2. DP codes are assigned using the Set Code function explained in paragraph 8.7.
      These codes are tied to specific SOSs (DMLSS – ECAT Readiness Automated Order
      Process for Contingency Contracts). The four specific codes are:
         8.19.5.2.1. VMI (Code R) – Service Owned VMI. Defaults to SOS code ―ECD.‖
         8.19.5.2.2. CEC (Code E) – Service Owned CEC. Defaults to SOS code ―ECC.‖
         8.19.5.2.3. PV (Code V) – DOD Owned stock. Defaults to SOS code ―ECR.‖
         8.19.5.2.4. PVWRM (Code S) – Service Owned PVWRM. Defaults to SOS code
         ―ECP.‖
      8.19.5.3. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and the ―Deferred Item Order‖
      to access this function see Figure 8.30. Use the AM Replenishment Search criteria
      window in the same way as for other AM replenishments. Highlight the appropriate
      assemblage ID, select the desired item ID or leave the field vacant to retrieve all items
      requiring deferred replenishment.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   303

   8.19.6. Resubmit Orders/Follow-up Requests/Cancellations.
      8.19.6.1. Use this function to resubmit orders to the SOS if the file transmission or print
      function failed. It is important to review this function daily to ensure supply orders and
      deliveries are not delayed. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Orders‖ and then
      ―Resubmit Orders/Follow-up Requests/Cancellations‖ to access this function.
      8.19.6.2. All files that failed to transmit or print are displayed in the Resubmit Orders
      window. Use the following features to manage these files as appropriate:
          8.19.6.2.1. Resubmit. Highlight the applicable file and click the ―Resubmit‖ button
          located on the vertical toolbar to retransmit or reprint an order.
          8.19.6.2.2. Detail. Click the ―Detail‖ button to view the contents of the failed order.
          8.19.6.2.3. Refresh. Use the ―Refresh‖ button to update the Resubmit window if
          order files have been resubmitted or removed.
          8.19.6.2.4. Remove. Highlight an order file and click the ―Remove‖ button to delete
          the order file. Once the file is removed, it can no longer be retransmitted or reprinted.
   8.19.7. Resend to Gentran. Gentran, a product of DCM, is the transmission method used to
   transmit interface files from DMLSS to its intended recipient. Files that cannot transmit out
   of DMLSS due to LAN problems are stored in Gentran until the LAN problems are
   corrected. Once the problems are corrected, use the Resend to Gentran process to resubmit
   the files. The message ―No orders to resend‖ is displayed if there are no orders to send.
   Select ―OK‖ to return to the previous screen. Gentran should be monitored daily to ensure
   successful interface and/or transmission of files.
8.20. Physical Inventory.
   8.20.1. Purpose. Use the Physical Inventory module to assess and document the accuracy of
   automated inventory balances. The Physical Inventory module includes adjusting recorded
   balances to match actual inventory balances by processing losses and gains to items. Reports
   specific to the inventory process are also available.
 304                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   8.20.2. Select Assemblage.
       8.20.2.1. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Physical Inventory‖ and then ―Select
       Assemblage‖ to access the Physical Inventory – Select Assemblage window Figure 8.31.
       Use the Physical Inventory features as follows:

Figure 8.31. Physical Inventory – Select Assemblage Window.




          8.20.2.1.1. Scope. The scope defaults to AM but the inventory manager must check
          either ―Annual‖ or ―Other‖ depending on the type of inventory being conducted.
          8.20.2.1.2. ORG. Use the dropdown menu to identify the ORG that owns the
          assemblage(s) being inventoried.
          8.20.2.1.3. Include Sub ORGs. Check this indicator to include assemblages owned
          by sub-ORGs. This feature only works if the host ORG is loaded in the ORG field.
          8.20.2.1.4. Select Assemblages. Highlight the applicable assemblages and click the
          Select Assemblages indicator to place a check in the Select indicator for multiple
          assemblages simultaneously.
          8.20.2.1.5. Select All. Click this indicator to select all assemblages for Physical
          Inventory.
          8.20.2.1.6. Select field. Check this indicator to select assemblages for inventory one
          at a time.
       8.20.2.2. The Date of Last Inventory column reflects the date of the last automated
       inventory. If blank, an automated inventory has never been completed. This date is also
       displayed on the Physical Inventory Date Report and should be used to schedule future
       annual inventories.
       8.20.2.3. Click ―Search‖ once the applicable assemblages are selected for inventory. The
       selected assemblages and components are listed in the Select Inventory Segment, Search
       Results window. Preview this window to ensure that no other processes have locked any
       of the assemblage‘s components and that there are no SOS type codes of unknown
       (UNK) loaded in the project. If these conditions exist for all or some of the components,
       the inventory cannot be processed.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 305


     8.20.2.4. If the SOS type code is ―UNK,‖ access the MTF catalog record and load a valid
     SOS against the item. Once all ―UNK‖ SOS codes are corrected, the inventory can be
     processed.
     8.20.2.5. If a component of the assemblage is locked by another process, determine who
     has the item locked and why. The other processes must be closed prior to processing the
     inventory.
     8.20.2.6. Once all exceptions and locks are cleared, click the ―Process Inv‖ button
     located on the vertical toolbar. DMLSS locks the records and assigns an inventory
     control number. The control number is tied to the inventory segment you created.
     8.20.2.7. The Generate Count Lists and Assign Teams Criteria window appears upon
     clicking ―Save.‖ It is recommended that you generate count lists and assign teams at this
     time. If cancelled at this time, count lists can be generated later using the Generate Count
     Lists function explained in paragraph 8.20.5.
  8.20.3. Control Number Status.
     8.20.3.1. Use the Control Number Status function to view and/or print the current status
     of an active inventory. When in AM, only control numbers associated with AM
     inventories are displayed. All active control numbers, current status or process, and the
     number of records associated with an inventory appear in the Inventory Control Number
     (ICN) Status window.
     8.20.3.2. Highlight a record and click the ―Detail‖ button or double-click on an ICN to
     view count list summary information.
     8.20.3.3. Highlight an ICN and click the ―Cancel‖ button located on the vertical toolbar
     to cancel an inventory that was erroneously processed. Click ―Yes‖ in the status box to
     verify your intent to cancel the inventory. If an inventory is cancelled, any updates made
     during counting will be lost and the date of last inventory field is not updated.
  8.20.4. Generate Count Lists.
     8.20.4.1. In the criteria window (Figure 8.32), select the desired Default Count List
     Breaks and set the Count List sort criteria. Click ―OK‖ once desired settings are
     complete.

       8.20.4.2. The Generate Count List and Assign Teams to AM Inventory Control Number
       Figure 8.33 appears once the count list criteria are completed. Use the Add Count List
       and Add Team buttons to increase the number or count lists and teams required for the
       specified inventory. For example, you have four count teams assigned. However, you
       want eight count lists to minimize the number of items on each count list. By default,
       DMLSS automatically creates one count list and one assigned team. You would click the
       ―Add Count List‖ button to add seven more count lists. You would then click the ―Add
       Team‖ button to add the additional three count teams. The inventory teams are assigned
       to a specific count list. Teams can be used more than once but count lists cannot.

Window.




       8.20.4.3. Next, assign a team to each count list. This can be accomplished line item by
       line item in the bottom portion of the window or simply use the Assign Team dropdown
       menus to associate a team to a count list. When using the dropdown menu, each
       individual row in the bottom portion of the window is updated to reflect the assigned
       team (Team column). Another option is to use the Select All, Apply and Change
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  307


      Highlighted Rows to Count List functions to apply count list assignments to individual
      rows en masse.
      8.20.4.4. Count lists are printed using the Physical Inventory Reports function explained
      in paragraph 8.20.8. Enter the ICN and print the required count lists.

      criteria window and regenerate count lists based on new or different count list criteria.
      8.20.4.6. Click on the ―Statistics‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to view the total
      number of item locations and percentages counted by count team or by count list. This
      feature provides a snapshot of the inventory progress at a given point between the start
      and finalization of an inventory.
   8.20.5. Enter Counts.
      8.20.5.1. The inventory manager or a member of the inventory posting team uses the
      Enter Counts function to record actual inventory counts when count lists are completed.
      Counts are entered by ICN.
      8.20.5.2. The Enter Counts window and printed count lists are in item ID/detail sequence
      to simplify the entry process. Click ―Save‖ after all counts are posted. If the first count
      matches the DMLSS balance quantity, a second count is not required. If an out of
      balance exists and the same quantities are counted twice, the matching quantities will be
      considered verified and the record will be moved to Research Discrepancies.
      8.20.5.3. Table 8.1 reflects the rational used to determine inventory recounts. The key is
      that two counts must match to consider the count process valid. There is no reason to
      recount if the first count matches the OH balance. After first counts, two other counts
      must match to consider the inventory line valid. Any out of balance conditions after third
      counts will require research.

Table 8.1. Enter Counts Rational Table.

                                                       This item ID requires research
                                                       after all counts are processed.

 O/H = 20        18           18                       Two       matching     counts.
                                                       Requires research because of
                                                       the out-of-balance condition.


       8.20.5.4. Information pertinent to individual assemblage data location records can be
       updated within the Enter Counts window in addition to recording inventory counts. Part
       of the AM inventory process is validating item QA data. Update the MFG‘s name,
       manufacture date, expiration dates, revised expiration dates, and lot numbers of each line
       item when necessary. This is a good opportunity to clean up data within the database.
       8.20.5.5. Figure 8.34 reflects an excerpt from an open inventory. Notice that there are
       two different spellings for Bayer. Under MFG name, you can update all instances of
       Bayer to read either ―Bayer‖ or ―Bayer Corporation‖ by typing each or using ―cut and
       paste‖ in each occurrence. The same can be done in any field. Standardizing data is
       another method to clean up the QA data.

Figure 8.34. AM Enter Counts for Physical Inventory.




       8.20.5.6. After first counts are complete, generate the second and third count lists using
       the Generate Count List function explained in paragraph 8.20.5. The maximum number
       of counts allowed is three. After the third count, all out of balance conditions require
       research during the research discrepancies part of the inventory.
       8.20.5.7. Click the ―Item Detail‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to view and/or
       print detailed management data for the selected item ID. The Item Detail window
       displays OH quantities by location code along with other detailed data. The window also
       displays current count information.
       8.20.5.8. Use the ―Add Item‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to add items to the
       automated inventory that are not included in the automated inventory count lists. Adding
       an item to the inventory automatically generates a recount. This item will also require
       research during the Research Discrepancies portion of the inventory process because
       there was not a beginning count. The proper gain transaction will be processed for items
       kept in the inventory.
   8.20.6. Research Discrepancies.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                309


      8.20.6.1. Use the Research Discrepancies function to view and resolve inventory count
      discrepancies found during the inventory. All final adjustments are processed using this
      function.
      8.20.6.2. Select the ICN from the list to view all items that require research. From the
      list you can select one, some, or all items to process. After making your selection, click
      the ―Process‖ icon to initiate research.
      8.20.6.3. The first record is displayed from your selection. If multiple records were
      selected, VCR buttons will appear at the top of the window. These buttons will allow
      you to scroll through the remainder of your list.
      8.20.6.4. The AM physical inventory deals with the entire count total for a line item.
      One line item may have several detail records associated for different locations or
      manufacturers. The total of all these detail records must match the OH balance records
      Figure 8.35.

Figure 8.35. Research Discrepancies Window.




      8.20.6.5. After research, enter a final quantity and adjustment reason. Enter the actual
      quantity found if research reveals that a count was incorrect. DMLSS generates the
      applicable inventory adjustment if the final count is different from the quantity OH.
      DMLSS does not generate an adjustment transaction if the final count matches the
      quantity OH.
      8.20.6.6. The Adjustment Reason prints on the Inventory Adjustment Voucher so it
      needs to be clear and reflect actual actions performed. Note: An adjustment reason is
      required for all items with CII Code of J, R, or Q, and will be printed on the Inventory
      Adjustment Voucher. Adjustment reasons are also required if the potential inventory
      adjustment value is greater than the allowable amount set for Physical Inventory
      Adjustments in System Services (TMU module).
      8.20.6.7. The Discrepancy List will be blank once all actions are processed.
      8.20.6.8. Click on the ―Post-Inventory Actions‖ button to record additional notes
      concerning the inventory. These notes could include identifying problems associated
      with day-to-day business to target additional training, inventory after action notes, or
 310                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       recommendations for upcoming inventories. All Post-Inventory Action notes are
       compiled as part of the inventory finalization process. A Post-Inventory Actions Report,
       by ICN, is available from the AM Physical Inventory Reports function explained in
       paragraph 8.20.8.
   8.20.7. Finalize Inventory. Once all inventory actions are completed, use the Finalize
   Inventory function to process the inventory adjustments and unlock records that were frozen
   for inventory. From the AM Navigate menu, select ―Physical Inventory‖ and then ―Finalize
   Inventory‖ to access this function. Identify the applicable ICN and click the ―Finalize‖
   button located on the vertical toolbar. After verifying that you want to finalize the inventory,
   print an Inventory Adjustment Voucher produced as a result of processing inventory gains
   and losses.
   8.20.8. Reports.
       8.20.8.1. Use the Physical Inventory Reports function to view and/or print reports and
       lists associated to an inventory. Inventory documents are maintained IAWAFRIMS T
       41-04 R 13.00.
       8.20.8.2. Inventory Accuracy Analysis - Lists the inventory segment, physical and OH
       counts, adjustments, and accuracy for the inventory by ICN.
       8.20.8.3. Inventory Adjustment Voucher - The Inventory Adjustment Voucher reflects
       item management data, adjustment in dollars, and adjustment reason for all inventory
       gains and losses produced during an inventory. It can be produced using the Finalize
       Inventory function or by accessing the reports function. This report requires the
       certifying and approving officials‘ (AO) signature and must be maintained in the
       permanent file.
       8.20.8.4. Post-Inventory Actions - Lists the quantity, transaction code, and further
       description of what caused the discrepancy. This lists can help with an after inventory
       analysis in determining training requirements for normal operations.
       8.20.8.5. Missed Location Count List - This report lists any locations that were not
       counted during a specific inventory. This report should be reviewed before finalizing an
       inventory to verify all locations were counted.
       8.20.8.6. Potential Inventory Discrepancy Report - This report reflects potential
       inventory discrepancies based off count quantities that result in a stock overage or
       shortage condition. Check this list to view your potential discrepancies prior to finalizing
       the inventory.
       8.20.8.7. Preview Inventory Accuracy Analysis - Lists the inventory segment by ICN.

       counts of the inventory.
8.21. Standard Assemblage Add.
   8.21.1. Use the Standard Assemblage Add function to load (or add) an assemblage instance
   to your database. Information pertaining to standardized assemblages is contained on the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              311


   DMLSS Master file that is updated monthly during the UDR Delta process. If the UDR
   Delta process is inactive, the DMLSS Master file is updated each time the UDR is manually
   processed via systems administration. The most current assemblage information can also be
   downloaded from the AFML website. Select ―Standard Assemblage Add‖ from the AM
   navigate dropdown menu to access this window Figure 8.36.

Figure 8.36. Standard Assemblage Add Window.




   8.21.2. Most of the data fields in the Standard Assemblage Add (UDR) window are
   mandatory data fields. Valid data should be entered into the remaining optional fields if
   known. To add a standard assemblage, enter data into the fields as follows:
      8.21.2.1. ORG/Sub ORG ID – Enter the owning ORG‘s ID number.
      8.21.2.2. Branch of Service – Select Air Force.
      8.21.2.3. Assm ID – Upon clicking the dropdown box, the ―Select Assemblage‖ window
      appears. Select the assemblage ID being loaded, i.e. select ―937‖ if loading an EMEDS
      Basic.
      8.21.2.4. Assm. Incr. – The assemblage increment automatically populates upon
      selecting the assemblage ID.
      8.21.2.5. Sub Assm – The sub-assemblage automatically populates upon selecting the
      assemblage ID. If applicable, all sub-assemblages are loaded as part of this process. If
      no sub-assemblages are associated to the assemblage, a zero populates this field.
      8.21.2.6. Assm Description – The assemblage description populates upon selecting the
      assemblage ID.
      8.21.2.7. Assm UIC – Army use. Identifies the assemblage UIC.
      8.21.2.8. Operational Status – Defaults to ―Mobility‖. The other option is ―Stored‖, but
      assign ―Mobility‖ unless otherwise directed. The operational status greatly affects the
      maintenance cycles for all equipment associated to the assemblage. Status of ―Stored‖
      extends the maintenance cycles.
 312                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       8.21.2.9. Build Control Number – Use this field to capture the MRL Recnum or Fund
       Number to ensure funds are available for redistribution within the AF Medical Service
       (AFMS) by providing a link between the fund record and assemblages.
       8.21.2.10. Equipment Readiness Code (ERC) – Not used by Air Force sites.
       8.21.2.11. Number Required – Identifies how many instances of the assemblage you
       wish to add to the ORG. In most cases, this should remain at ―1.‖
       8.21.2.12. Scope – The scope identifies who owns, maintains, and funds the assemblage
       being added.
          8.21.2.12.1. LOG Owned – AFWCF/MDD owned and funded WRM assets.
          8.21.2.12.2. CO – Assets are CO and funded and are not WRM. Customer is using
          DMLSS to manage the assets. When selected, the Customer and Expense Center
          fields become mandatory. Upon selecting the customer, the expense center populates
          with the associated expense center ID.
          8.21.2.12.3. LOG Managed Expense Center Owned – Assets are CO and funded.
          However, logistics personnel are using DMLSS to manage assets. When selected, the
          Expense Center field becomes mandatory.
       8.21.2.13. The Project Code, Ownership Code and Trans Org ID are not needed or
       required for use by AF activities.
       8.21.2.14. Report to JMAR – Will be checked systematically.
       8.21.2.15. Warehouse Location – Identifies storage location of assemblage.
   8.21.3. Upon saving, a message appears if an item is not in the MTF catalog. Click ―OK‖ in
   the message box to automatically add the item. An Exception Report is generated,
   identifying data requirements for each catalog record meeting exception criteria. These data
   inconsistencies must be corrected before the catalog record can be used. DMLSS provides
   an option to print the Exceptions Report. After the Exception Report is printed, select ―OK‖
   to confirm the assemblage was created. These exceptions are also written to the AM Catalog
   Exception Processing pending action.
   8.21.4. Every assemblage added to DMLSS is assigned an Instance number. While not
   visible during the add process, it is visible throughout AM once the assemblage is added.
   The assemblage instance is an internally assigned number that provides a means for DMLSS
   to post transactions and maintain transaction history for that specific instance. It is not and
   should not be used as a sequential number defining the number of assemblages assigned to
   that ORG. The sequential number assigned can be found in the Medical Resource Letter.
8.22. Standard Assemblage Update.
   8.22.1. Use the Standard Assemblage Update function to update existing assemblage
   allowance quantities. This process pulls the allowances from the DMLSS Master (UDR) file
   and updates the specified assemblage allowances in AM. Select ―Standard Assemblage
   Update‖ from the AM Navigate menu to access this function.
   8.22.2. In the Standard Assemblage Update window Figure 8.37, select the owning ORG for
   the assemblage being updated. All assemblages associated to that ORG are displayed in the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 313


   bottom portion of the window. Highlight the assemblage(s) being updated and select the
   appropriate updated option in the Process box. Multiple update options are available and
   described as follows.

Figure 8.37. Standard Assemblage Update Window.




      8.22.2.1. Maintain Old and New Allowance Quantities - Updates current allowance
      quantities and moves existing quantities to old allowance quantity fields.
      8.22.2.2. Update Current Allowance Quantity - Replaces current allowance quantities
      only.
      8.22.2.3. Delete Old Allowance Quantity – Deletes old allowance quantities and enters a
      zero in the old allowance quantity field.
      8.22.2.4. Delete Current Allowance Quantity - Deletes current allowance quantities and
      enters a zero in the current allowance quantity field.
   8.22.3. Click the ―Save‖ button on the toolbar to save your actions. The Standard
   Assemblage Update message window opens and displays the current assemblage
   information, updates were successful, and the option to print the Allowance Change Report.
   It is recommended that you print the report for your WRM continuity files.
8.23. Assemblage Allowance Update File.
   8.23.1. Use the Assemblage Allowance Update File function to update the DMLSS Master
   (UDR) file located on the DMLSS server with the most current allowance standards
   published on the AFML website, Readiness page.
   8.23.2. Use the Application tab located on the home page of the AFML website to select the
   Allowance Standard Management System Figure 8.38 Locate a specific AS by typing its
   number into the search or scrolling through the list of all assemblages. After the appropriate
   AS is selected, click the download tab and select ―DMLS Output.‖ Click on the download
   hyperlink and save to a folder on the PC or CD-ROM. Files from the website are
   downloaded or sent in the .ZIP format and identified as ―AM[SRAN].ZIP‖ (example
   AM4427.ZIP). This file must be unzipped or extracted prior to uploading the new/revised
   file(s) data. An approved zip/unzip program must reside on your PC to perform this
   function. Contact your local Information Systems office for the approved program, if
   required.
 314                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 8.38. Link to Allowance Standard Management System Link on Air Force Medical
Logistics Website, Application Tab.




   8.23.3. Unzip or extract the files from the .ZIP file to your local PC hard drive in a folder
   you have already identified. There will be a minimum of two files with the .DEL extension
   created for each assemblage. Below is an example of what the .ZIP file contains:
       8.23.3.1. AM4427111956.DEL.
       8.23.3.2. AMI4427111956.DEL.
   8.23.4. The AM[SRAN]xxxxxx.DEL file is the main file used by the system and contains all
   the file structure. The AMI[SRAN]xxxxxx.DEL file is the index file that contains all the
   allowance standard information. Both files are required for the upload to process correctly.
   8.23.5. To process the allowance standard update, select ―Assemblage Allowance Update
   File‖ on the AM Navigate menu. The AM Assemblage Allowance Update File window
   opens and prompts you to navigate to the folder in which the import file(s) reside. Only one
   .DEL file may be processed at a time. Go to the folder where the files reside and select the
   ―AM[SRAN]xxxxxx.DEL‖ file. Click ―Open.‖ Do not select the AM file with the letter ―I‖
   in the third position. If the wrong file is selected the system returns an information box
   indicating the file does not exist. If this happens, click ―OK‖ and select the correct file.
   8.23.6. The assemblage information is listed in the Assemblages to Import box Figure 8.39
   Select the assemblage(s) to import or check the Select All box and click ―Process.‖ An
   information box is displayed with the assemblage information and the options to continue or
   cancel the process. Click ―OK‖ to update the DMLSS Master (UDR) file. Once completed,
   a successfully updated message appears. If Cancel is chosen, DMLSS returns to the
   Assemblage Allowance Update File window.

Figure 8.39. Select File to Import Window.




   8.23.7. Once this process is complete, use the Standard Assemblage Update function
   explained in paragraph 8.22. to apply the new allowances to the assemblage(s).
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               315


8.24. Load Non-Standard Assemblage.
   8.24.1. Non-standard assemblages may be built for a specific purpose or mission in
   situations where a standard assemblage does not contain required materiel. Some examples
   of a non-standard assemblage are BW/CW programs, Hospital Expansion projects, and pilot
   units for new/modified assemblages. This non-standard assemblage may include some items
   from existing standard assemblages or items not found in any of the standard assemblages.
   Because the items that belong to a non-standard assemblage are not predefined, item-level
   information must be manually loaded.
   8.24.2. The Load Non-Standard Assemblage function is part one of a two part process to
   create an instance of a Non-Standard Assemblage in AM. Once this part is completed,
   accomplish the Non-Standard Assemblage Add function explained in paragraph 8.25. Both
   steps must be completed before the non-standard assemblage appears in AM.
   8.24.3. Select Load Non-Standard Assemblage from the AM Navigate menu to access the
   Non-standard Assemblage Load window Figure 8.40. Most of the fields require data entry
   and should be used as follows:

Figure 8.40. Non-Standard Assemblage Load Window.




      8.24.3.1. Assm ID – Four digit alpha-numeric number that identifies the assemblage (i.e.
      BWCW identifies Biological/Chemical Warfare). Must be unique and cannot duplicate
      an assemblage ID already in the UDR.
      8.24.3.2. Assm Incr. – If the assemblage contains modular units, enter the unit number
      identifier in the Assm Incr field. If multiple increments exist, enter the exact number.
      DMLSS will assign the next sequential increment number. If not, enter a zero in this
      field to indicate none. If you enter a number already assigned to an assemblage, the
      system prompts you to enter a new ID. Note: In most cases, the Assm Incr for non-
      standard assemblages should be zero.
      8.24.3.3. Sub Assm – In most instances, non-standard assemblages do not contain
      multiple sub-assemblages. If no sub-assemblages exist, enter a zero to indicate none. If
      multiple sub-assemblages do exist, the Load Non-standard Assemblage function must be
      used for each instance (i.e. once for sub-assm ―A,‖ once for sub-assm ―B,‖ etc.)
      8.24.3.4. Assm Description - Use to enter an abbreviated or colloquial description of the
      assemblage.
 316                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       8.24.3.5. Build Control Number – If known, use this field to capture the MRL Recnum
       or Fund Number to ensure funds are available for redistribution within the AFMS by
       providing a link between the fund record and assemblages. Otherwise, leave this field
       blank.
       8.24.3.6. Assemblage Item ID – No data is required for this field.
   8.24.4. Click ―Save‖ to load the non-standard assemblage. Once loaded, use the Non-
   Standard Assemblage Add function described in paragraph 8.25. to complete the process of
   creating a non-standard assemblage.
8.25. Non-Standard Assemblage Add.
   8.25.1. The Non-standard Assemblage Add is the second part of the two-part process to
   create non-standard assemblages in AM. Once the non-standard assemblage is loaded
   (paragraph 8.24.), use the Non-standard Assemblage Add function to complete the process of
   creating the initial instance of the assemblage. This option is also used to create additional
   instances of the assemblage using the same assemblage ID.
   8.25.2. Select ―Non-standard Assemblage Add‖ from the AM Navigate menu to access the
   Non-standard Assemblage Add window Figure 8.41. Data required in this window is the
   same data required when adding a standard assemblage. Follow the instructions provided in
   paragraph 8.21. to complete the process of creating a non-standard assemblage.

Figure 8.41. Non-Standard Assemblage Add Window.




8.26. Assemblage Description Change. Use this option to change the assemblage‘s descriptive
information after the initial assemblage load. While descriptive data may be modified, the scope
cannot be changed. For example, the assemblage cannot be changed from LOG owned to CO or
vice versa. Reference paragraph 8.21. for an explanation of the data fields available for
modification. The Trans ORG ID field is used in conjunction with the Assemblage Loss-War
Switch process explained in paragraph 8.17.2.5.
8.27. Duplicate Existing Assemblage. Use this function to replicate an existing assemblage.
The new assemblage instance may be placed in the same ORG or different ORG. The entire

assemblage is duplicated to include allowances as well as P/S relationships and E/S items if
chosen. The OH balances do not carry forward to the new assemblage instance.
8.28. Build Default Locations. Use the Build Default Locations function to create an
assemblage data location record for each line item, within the specified assemblage(s), that do
not have an existing location, balance OH, or due-ins. This action assigns a default location of
'NONE,' contains a ―zero‖ quantity, and the Incomplete indicator is checked. Essentially, this
action prevents you from having to click on the Add Item button to add a location record for
every individual item.
8.29. Assemblage Build Control Number (BCN)/Unit Type Code (UTC) Change. Click
either the ―UTC‖ or ―BCN‖ button and use the dropdowns to enter the assemblage ID and
increment number. Enter the Unit Type Code or Build Control Number and click ―Save.‖
8.30. QA.
   8.30.1. Use the AM QA process in conjunction with the IM QA process to review QA
   messages and drug recalls associated to WRM assets. WRM assets identified as suspect
   should be transferred to Stratification State of Suspended, Unserviceable, or as directed IAW
   the QA message so the items are not issued or deployed as serviceable materiel.
   8.30.2. During processing of receipts or gain transactions, DMLSS compares the item ID to
   the QA Record file and places a checkmark in the QA field in the Receipts window to
   identify that a QA record exists for that item. This form of notification allows you to ensure
   the quality of the asset being received or gained.
   8.30.3. QA is primarily managed in the IM module with suspended item records maintained
   by item ID. When an item is identified in the QA process as suspended and the item is
   associated to an assemblage, a pending action report is posted to the AM Inbox. There are
   three QA pending actions that will post to the AM Inbox throughout the life cycle of a QA
   message.
       8.30.3.1. QA Alert. WRM Supply Item. Serves as initial notice.
       8.30.3.2. QA Delinquency Notice. Supply Item Qty WRM. Appears when the initial QA
       Alert WRM Supply Item notice is not completed within the specified period, as identified
       in the IM QA Notification Class window.
       8.30.3.3. QA Review Only. No action required (WRM). Appears when notifications are
       received for review only. If applicable, a New QA Complaint should be opened and
       processed to document actions taken.
   8.30.4. When a QA message is processed in IM for an item with an allowance standard,
   DMLSS forwards the QA message to the QA Alert. WRM Supply Item pending action.
   Only users assigned these pending actions and assigned the applicable assemblages will see
   these messages. To open the report, select the report from the inbox and click the ―Jump To‖
   button at the bottom of the window. The QA Record Search window opens and defaults to
   the QA Details tab. The tab consists of the QA Record data from the QA message and a list
   of all assemblages that maintain an allowance standard for the item.
   8.30.5. Check all assemblages listed in the QA Record Search window to validate stock
   against the QA alert message. Click the ―Lot Number‖ button to view a list of lot numbers
   from the QA alert message against lot numbers maintained in the assemblage data records.

   The assemblage lot numbers will change as you view the different assemblages. In the
   Notify Quantity Column, enter the total number of items matching the QA message data. If
   the quantity found was ―0,‖ you must enter a ―0‖ in the field to record the action was
   accomplished. The example below Figure 8.42 represents an entry of the number of items
   that matched QA alert message data.

Figure 8.42. Quality Assurance Notification.




   8.30.6. After quantities are entered in the search window, click the ―Save‖ button located on
   the vertical toolbar to process your findings. All records with data entered are removed from
   the pending action. The pending action notification will remain in the inbox until all findings
   are processed.
   8.30.7. Use the ―Transfer‖ button to process internal transfers of assets between
   assemblages, stratification types, and states.
   8.30.8. Use the ―Print‖ button located on the vertical toolbar to print a list of all QA records.
   8.30.9. New QA Complaint. Use the AM New QA Complaint function same as the IM New
   QA Complaint function explained in Chapter 5, paragraph 7.21.2.
   8.30.10. QA Complaint Search.
       8.30.10.1. Use the QA Complaint Search function Figure 8.43 to search for all QA
       records within the DMLSS database. When supply or equipment items are identified as
       defective, the QA Complaint search function presents all of the required information
       from the QA message.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               319


Figure 8.43. Complaint Search Window.




       8.30.10.2. For supply items, DMLSS identifies all internal and external customer
       accounts having consumption history, and WRM assemblages that have an OH balance
       or due-in for the item. This function also enables QA monitors to select any additional
       customer accounts or WRM assemblages that should receive the QA notification pending
       actions.
       8.30.10.3. For equipment items, DMLSS identifies all equipment accounts and WRM
       assemblages that have the item and enables maintenance personnel to select any
       additional equipment accounts or WRM assemblages that should receive the QA
       notification pending actions.
       8.30.10.4. DMLSS associates all system identified and selected customer accounts,
       WRM assemblages, and equipment accounts with the QA notification pending actions so
       subsequent actions may be tracked and recorded.
       8.30.10.5. The QA Complaint Search function also provides a method to view SF 380s,
       Reporting and Processing Medical Materiel Complaints Quality Improvement Report,
       CAIM balances and links to QA complaints.
8.31. Status Edits.
   8.31.1. Use the AM Status Edits function to view, delete, and process status edits that are
   received as a result of submitting AM orders. The AM Status Edits function directly links to
   the IM Status Edits Report pending action, except it defaults to the AM scope and cannot be
   changed to IM or IM/AM. Local policy will dictate whether AM or IM personnel are
   responsible for reviewing and processing AM status edits.
   8.31.2. Select ―Status Edits‖ from the AM Navigate menu to access the Status Edits Report.

                            EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT (EM)

9.1. Purpose. The EM module of DMLSS AIS provides an automated EM system for the MHS.
It is designed from a life cycle management concept that supports all related processes including
equipment request, authorization, replacement budgeting, and disposition. The integrated
logistics approach minimizes administrative workload and duplication of data. The goal is to
develop and implement a standard integrated information management system that supports
customers, functional users, and managers at all levels in the processes associated with life cycle
management of equipment.
   9.1.1. For privileged users, the EM Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the EM
   application from the DMLSS System Navigation window. It can also be viewed by selecting
   ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities menu (review paragraph 9.19.1.). A detailed list of EM pending
   actions and their recommended use is available in Attachment 8.
   9.1.2. The EM main window also appears once the EM application is launched from the
   DMLSS System Navigation window. In this window, users can access the modules and
   functionalities of EM mainly through the (navigation) menu options. In some cases, you can
   also use the buttons on the horizontal toolbar at the top of the window to open EM module
   windows.
   9.1.3. The equipment management modules covered in this chapter in the same order as they
   appear in the Navigate and Utilities dropdown menus located on the menu toolbar.
9.2. EM Controlled Assets.
   9.2.1. Accountability for all EM-managed equipment, including on-loan equipment, is
   managed by expense center/customer ID.
   9.2.2. Additional Local Control. Any item, regardless of unit cost, may be maintained on
   record at the discretion of the Medical Logistics Flight Commander. These items are
   assigned an equipment commodity class (CC), maintained on EM accountable records, and
   processed in DMLSS.
   9.2.3. Items with the Maint Req Ind box checked on the MTF Catalog – Technical
   Equipment tab (Figure 9.1.) are assigned an ECN for maintenance control purposes
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              323


Figure 9.1. MTF Catalog Technical-Equipment Tab Window.




      9.2.3.1. Maintenance data for these items is stored in the equipment data records and
      updated as maintenance is performed by the maintenance activity/Biomedical Equipment
      Repair (BMER) office.
      9.2.3.2. Items with the Acct Equip Code marked ―Y‖ on the MTF Catalog – Technical
      Equipment tab (Figure 9.1.) appear on the Custodian Receipt/Location Listing Report.
      This report lists accountable equipment records for a customer account and account and
      includes a signature block for the custodian.
9.3. New Catalog Item.
   9.3.1. Coordinate with the local BMER shop before processing new equipment catalog items
   to ensure accurate information is entered in the equipment record. How equipment items are
   loaded is critical to the maintenance activity to ensure proper maintenance schedules and
   equipment classification.
   9.3.2. From the Navigate menu, select ―New Catalog Item‖ and click on ―MTF Catalog
   Items‖ to view the MTF Catalog Equipment-New window. As a minimum, enter all required
   information in the Basic tab. The CC is important because it determines the accountability,
   funding, and procurement of the item. See Figure 9.2 for a list of available CCs.
 324                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 9.2. EOR Commodity Class Relationship.




   9.3.3. Load any MTF restrictions, special requirements, and destruction methods as required.
   After the Basic tab is complete, go to the Technical-Equipment tab (Figure 9.1.). The
   Equipment Type is defaulted to ―Individual.‖ If the equipment item is a component of a
   system that is being purchased, change the equipment type to ―Component.‖ If the
   equipment item is a system, select ―System.‖
   9.3.4. The equipment nomenclature is an important element in the Technical Equipment tab
   because it generates the device class, device code, and life expectancy. The makeup of the
   device code is tied to maintenance procedures that are required by the BMET. Changes can
   be made to information in this screen but only to increase maintenance requirements.
       9.3.4.1. The maintenance required indicator cannot be unchecked for an equipment item
       with a device code that requires maintenance.
       9.3.4.2. The accountable equipment code cannot be ―N‖ for an equipment item with a
       device code that requires accountability. Device codes whose accountability is listed as
       local require a choice between ―Y‖ or ―N‖ that is at the discretion of the MLFC.
   9.3.5. Other areas that may require updating are the Electrical Requirements fields. The
   defaults for these fields are Voltage-110, Hertz-60, and Phase-Single. If OCONUS or if
   there are different electrical requirements, change the information.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    325


   9.3.6. After both the Basic and Technical-Equipment tabs are updated, click the ―Save‖ icon
   on the toolbar. The basic catalog record is built and saved. Additional information may be
   loaded in the remaining tabs.
   9.3.7. If there are acceptable equivalents for the equipment item, enter the MFG name, item
   number, and vendor item type in the Acceptable Equivalent tab. Multiple equivalents may be
   loaded in this tab. The equipment barcode number may be included in this tab for the
   primary item and all equivalents if known.
   9.3.8. The SOS Cat tab is where procurement information is entered. The default SOS will
   be loaded to the host MTF. Click the ―Add‖ button and load the SOS information for the
   item. Multiple SOSs may be loaded against the equipment item.
   9.3.9. The LOG Cat tab allows selection of the primary SOS for the equipment item if
   multiple SOSs are listed in the SOS Cat tab. If only one SOS is added in the SOS Cat tab for
   an item, that SOS will be the default in the LOG Cat tab.
   9.3.10. If loading multiple items against the same equipment nomenclature, click the Add
   Like icon on the toolbar. This leaves the basic equipment information intact. Enter a new
   item ID, CC, MFG cat number, electrical requirements, and SOS information.
   9.3.11. If loading multiple equipment items that are different, click the ―Add‖ icon on the
   toolbar. This will refresh the window to allow entry of data for the new item.
   9.3.12. The Find icon allows a search for item records in the MTF Catalog by item ID, short
   item description, NDC, NSN, UPN, or MFG catalog number. Enter at least 3 characters in
   any field to search the MTF catalog. The more information entered the narrower the search
   results will be. If a search doesn‘t return any results, change the search criteria and retry. If
   multiple items are listed after the search, view an item ID by clicking the ―Detail‖ button on
   the window side. The Print option, also available from this search window, will print the
   items returned from the search.
9.4. Catalog Search. The EM Catalog Search functions the same as used in IM. Reference
Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.3. for details.
9.5. SOS Search. The EM SOS Search functions the same as used in IM. Reference Chapter 5,
Paragraph 5.6.2. for details.
9.6. Equipment Accountability. The Equipment Accountability application allows users to
process any actions that affect the accountability of the ORG‘s equipment. Accountability
consists of gain, loss, transfer, and assembly/disassembly.
   9.6.1. Equipment Gain. Equipment gain is used to create records for equipment not acquired
   through the normal order/receipt process; for example, gifts, donations, or inventory
   adjustments.
      9.6.1.1. When gaining an accountable item, DMLSS automatically creates an audit trail,
      increases the in-use equipment quantity, updates the customer account, generates updates
      to accounting records, and provides the option to print a Custodian Action List.
      9.6.1.2. When gaining an item with a maintenance requirement, DMLSS creates a work
      order for an acceptance inspection.
 326                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       9.6.1.3. To access the Equipment Gain window (Figure 9.3.), from the Navigate menu,
       point to Equipment Accountability and click on ―Gain‖ or click the ―Gain‖ icon on the
       toolbar. In the Gain Information section, enter the ORG where the equipment is being
       gained and select a transaction reason. The selected reason may require additional fields
       to be completed before adding the item ID.

Figure 9.3. Equipment Gain Window.




       9.6.1.4. Click the ―Add‖ button and enter the item ID of the gaining item. If the item ID
       is unavailable, use the ―Jump To‖ icon to search for a similar item in the MTF Catalog or
       create a new item ID. After the item ID is entered, enter the quantity to be gained in the
       quantity field.
       9.6.1.5. In the ECN List box, complete all mandatory fields. If the MFG or common
       models are not listed in the dropdown menu, use the ―Jump To‖ icon to load the new
       data. The nameplate model data should be the official model designation found on the
       equipment data plate or tag. The acquisition cost should be actual cost of the equipment
       when new. DMLSS uses this dollar total to calculate maximum repair allowance (MRA)
       figures in MA records.
       9.6.1.6. Multiple items may be gained to an ORG by clicking the ―Add‖ button after all
       data is entered for the first item. Complete all information for the second item and
       continue adding items, if required.
       9.6.1.7. When all data is entered, click the ―Gain‖ icon on the toolbar. The user will be
       prompted to print a Custodian Actions List and barcodes during processing which is
       maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 11.00. If multiple records are generated, a
       Custodian Actions List and barcodes for each customer entered is printed. After the
       record is updated, the Equipment Gain window will display the assigned ECN along with
       the processed record data. An IGE transaction is written to the equipment Transaction
       History File to record the gain.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                327

Figure 9.5. Equipment Search Criteria Screen.




          9.6.2.1.3. After all information is entered, click ―OK‖ to process the loss. The user is
          prompted to print a copy of the Custodian Actions List for signature and it is
          maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R 11.00. An ILE transaction is written to the
          equipment Transaction History file. Note: Do not use the transaction reason
          ―Financial Liability Investigation‖ to record the loss of equipment due to inventory.
          Although it produces a Custodian Action List and documents an ILE transaction (with
          a transaction reason code of FLL), it does not generate the required Inventory
          Adjustment Document.
       9.6.2.2. Transfer.
          9.6.2.2.1. Equipment transfer is used to ensure that equipment appears on the primary
          user‘s customer account. At the request of a customer or during an equipment
          inventory, the user may find it necessary to change accountability for equipment
          items from one DEPT or work section to another. Users can also transfer equipment
          between ORGs supported by the same equipment manager.
          9.6.2.2.2. To process a transfer of equipment items, from the Navigate menu, point to
          Equipment Accountability and click on ―Loss‖ or ―Transfer.‖ The Equipment Search
          Criteria window opens. The user has the option to search by one or many Equipment
          Classification fields, Owner/Custodian fields, Service Information fields, DITMS
          fields, or Assemblage fields. Enter the required search information and click the
          ―Search‖ icon on the toolbar.
          9.6.2.2.3. The Equipment Search Results window displays the results. Select the
          ECNs that are being transferred and click the ―Details‖ icon on the toolbar to view the
          Equipment Detail record. Click the ―Transfer‖ icon on the toolbar to open the
          Equipment Transfer window.
          9.6.2.2.4. Select the ORG and customer the item is being transferred to and click
          ―OK.‖ DMLSS generates the CTE transaction to record the transfer and creates a
          Custodian Action List to reflect the changes to each custodian account.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                329


         9.6.2.2.5. Equipment items determined to be excess to the needs of the ORG and sub-
         ORGs may be transferred to the equipment excess account from the Equipment
         Transfers window. The equipment excess account is a SVC/CUST established in SS
         under customer ID xx5245. The account is identified as the excess account for the
         MTF in the Equipment Service Detail record.
         9.6.2.2.6. If the equipment item is considered excess, click the checkbox for Excess
         while in the Equipment Transfer window. The ORG and customer fields default to
         the host ORG and equipment excess account. Click ―OK‖ to process the transfer
         action. DMLSS generates the CTE transaction to record the transfer and creates a
         Custodian Action List to reflect the changes to each custodian account.
  9.6.3. Assembly/Disassembly. The Assembly/Disassembly function is designed to perform
  two different functions: to assemble or disassemble equipment records. The Assembly
  function is used to consolidate multiple pieces of equipment (ECNs) into a single ECN. The
  Disassembly function is used to separate a single ECN into multiple equipment records
  (ECNs). Equipment managers may need to use these functions to properly account for assets
  and maintenance personnel may need these functions for proper work order management.
  Assembly/Disassembly can be accessed by selecting ―Equipment Accountability‖ from the
  Navigate menu, then ―Assembly/Disassembly.‖ The Equipment Search Criteria window
  opens. Search for the desired equipment records by using the available criteria.
     9.6.3.1. Assembly.
         9.6.3.1.1. As previously stated, the Assembly function is used to consolidate ECNs.
         Therefore, DMLSS anticipates multiple ECNs to be selected when performing an
         assembly action. In the Equipment Search Results window, select the equipment
         records to be assembled and then click on the ―Asbly/Dsbly‖ icon located on the
         vertical toolbar. Each piece of equipment must be associated to the same customer in
         order to complete the assembly action.
         9.6.3.1.2. The highlighted equipment records appear in the Loss Information
         window. Add an item ID to the Gain Information window (item ID used to identify
         the Assembled Equipment record). If necessary, use the ―Jump To‖ icon to create a
         new catalog record and assign a new item ID. Note: For an assembly action, the
         gain quantity defaults to one and is not editable. When processing an assembly
         action the new ECN quantity will never be more than one.
         9.6.3.1.3. To complete the process, fill in all mandatory fields and optional fields if
         possible. Every attempt should be made to load the actual acquisition cost and ―2X‖
         should be loaded into the Acquisition Fund Code field. Once all data is entered, click
         the ―Gain‖ icon located on the vertical toolbar to process the assembly action.
         9.6.3.1.4. The assembly action produces an EAD transaction code using transaction
         reason Assembly Loss, Equipment for each ECN listed in the Loss Information
         window. Additionally, an EAD transaction with transaction reason Assembly Gain,
         Equipment is generated for the item ID listed in the Gain Information window and a
         new ECN is assigned.
     9.6.3.2. Disassembly.
330                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         9.6.3.2.1. As stated previously, the Disassembly function is used to separate a single
         ECN into multiple ECNs or equipment records. In this instance, DMLSS anticipates
         a single equipment record in the Loss Information window. Use the search function
         as explained in paragraph 9.6.3 to locate the ECN being disassembled.
         9.6.3.2.2. The highlighted record will appear in the Loss Information window. In the
         Gain Information window, add an item ID for each new equipment record. If
         necessary, use the ―Jump To‖ icon to create a new catalog record and assign a new
         item ID. Note: For disassembly action, a quantity must be loaded for each record
         added to the Gain Information window (multiple units of the same item may exist).
         9.6.3.2.3. To complete the process, fill in all mandatory fields and all optional fields,
         if possible. Every attempt should be made to load the actual acquisition cost and the
         acquisition fund code should be annotated. Once all data is entered, click the ―Gain‖
         icon located on the vertical toolbar to process the disassembly action.
         9.6.3.2.4. The disassembly action produces an EAD transaction code using
         transaction reason Disassembly Loss, Equipment for the ECN listed in the Loss
         Information window. Additionally, an EAD transaction with transaction reason
         Disassembly Gain, Equipment is generated for each item ID listed in the Gain
         Information window and new ECNs are assigned.
      9.6.3.3. Whether assembling or disassembling equipment records, DMLSS allows
      equipment mangers the option to print a Custodial Actions List and the option to generate
      new barcode labels upon saving changes. The dollar value of assembly action gains is
      reflected on line 8H and the value of disassembly action losses is reflected on line 9J of
      the Balance List by ARC and Strat (Balance In DFAS) Report.
  9.6.4. Equipment Record.
      9.6.4.1. EM uses equipment records to maintain physical accountability, custodial
      responsibility, and fiscal accountability of all assigned ORG assets. For this reason, a
      customer must be assigned to all custodian accounts. The equipment manager also uses
      equipment records to record loans, conduct inventories, and create equipment
      replacement schedules to support the budget process. Equipment records are also core
      components of the QA and Risk Management programs.
      9.6.4.2. Equipment records are created through the receipt/issue process in IM or the
      equipment gain process. Once the equipment records are established and identification
      data has been entered, in-use equipment is assigned to the equipment custodian for the
      customer account.
      9.6.4.3. Equipment records may be linked together to create an association of a system
      and the individual components that make up the system. Equipment records are used for
      identification of assets in an assemblage. Equipment records in assemblages are not used
      for assignment of custodial responsibility.
      9.6.4.4. Maintenance activities jointly utilize the accountable and assemblage equipment
      records for maintenance purposes and may create additional equipment records for
      maintenance purposes that are non-accountable. After the records are created, the
      maintenance activity responsible for maintenance of the equipment is entered in the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              331


      record along with data used for scheduling maintenance services. The scheduling
      information is used to create scheduled work orders. The equipment records are also
      used when an unscheduled work order is created. Data related to the cost of maintenance
      services that is entered on the work orders is accumulated in the equipment record and
      used to identify maintenance problems and support the equipment replacement process.
      9.6.4.5. Equipment Record Detail.
         9.6.4.5.1. The Equipment Detail Record (Figure 9.6.) provides current information
         along with the life cycle for an equipment item. The user has the ability to view
         currently active records that are maintained within the MTF or view records that are
         inactive and are no longer maintained as accountable records. This view option is
         available in the Equipment Search Criteria window. Accomplishing an equipment
         search will open up the Equipment Detail Record window.

Figure 9.6. Equipment Detail Record Window.




         9.6.4.5.2. The Equipment Detail Record window is divided into several tab
         categories. Users are encouraged to update all fill fields and keep data current to
         ensure the most accurate data is maintained. When changes are made to a tab, the
         user must click the ―Save‖ icon to record the change data before moving to a new tab.
         Clicking the ―Revert‖ icon reverts to the last saved state for the record. The
         information below outlines the use and data required for each tab.
         9.6.4.5.3. Main Tab. This tab contains the general information about an item,
         equipment owners, condition code, and equipment type. Many of the fields are
         populated from other equipment database records and cannot be updated in this
332                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         window. The MFG, nameplate model, and MFG serial number fields are mandatory
         fields.
         9.6.4.5.4. Location & Inventory Tab. This tab identifies the location of the selected
         equipment item to include room location, temporary location, loan data, last inventory
         date, and reason. When the last inventory date is within 90 days of the annual
         inventory anniversary date, a message is posted to the EM Inbox notifying the user of
         the required inventory.
         9.6.4.5.5. Approval/Acquisition Tab. Allows the user the ability to view and update
         approval, purchase, warranty, and acquisition information. This tab provides some
         historical reference on the procurement process and installation of the item.
         9.6.4.5.6. Maintenance Data Tab. This tab identifies the MA and team, other
         government agency, or contractor who is responsible for providing maintenance for
         the item. It further breaks down required maintenance cycles based on the procedure
         number assigned, operational status, risk levels, readiness code, and MEL and MRLC
         totals for repair determination.
         9.6.4.5.7. Maintenance Cost Tab. Provides a historical look at repair and labor time
         and cost on a piece of equipment. The tab displays downtime and number of
         unscheduled work orders and is divided into organizational and contract repairs and
         provides values for parts costs, unscheduled time and labor, and scheduled time and
         labor. The user can view a collective of all time and cost estimates by history or view
         by FY for up to ten years.
         9.6.4.5.8. Components Tab. The Components tab is enabled when an equipment
         type system detail record that contains components is selected. The tab lists all
         components of the system by ECN and item ID. When in this window, the user can
         select a component and double click to open the equipment detail record for the
         component.
         9.6.4.5.9. Software Tab. Displays information for equipment related software. The
         user can add software from this window or load software from Equipment Software
         in the Navigate menu. The user can also view information on existing software
         information loaded in the window.
         9.6.4.5.10. Notes Tab. Allows the user to add, edit, or delete notes for a specific
         equipment item.
         9.6.4.5.11. DITMS Tab. Information Technology (IT) equipment records identified
         in the MTF Catalog as DITMS require additional information procurement and
         product information. If the DITMS tab is accessible, update the information as
         required.
      9.6.4.6. Equipment Detail vertical toolbar. The Equipment Detail vertical toolbar allows
      the user to perform additional tasks when working in this window (Figure 9.6.).
         9.6.4.6.1. The Acquisition Cost icon allows the user the ability to factor in various
         elements that would affect the end acquisition cost of an equipment item. The actual
         cost of the equipment is important for the budgeting process when life expectancy is
         nearing an end or when determining repair versus replacement. After receipt or gain
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   333


          of an equipment item, this window allows the user to enter applied discounts, trade-in
          values, transportation costs, installation costs, upgrades, and any other cost associated
          with the value of the equipment. The new acquisition cost will be applied to the
          detail record.
          9.6.4.6.2. The Barcode icon allows the user to print a new barcode label for the
          selected equipment record. The barcode will print to the selected printer.
          9.6.4.6.3. The Contract icon is accessible if an item is associated with an existing
          contract. When a contract is initially loaded in DMLSS, the user should enter the
          associated ECNs that apply to the contract. Clicking the icon allows the user to view
          the contract information loaded in the Service Contracts module.
          9.6.4.6.4. The Item ID icon allows the user to perform an item ID change when there
          are like or similar items on the Equipment Detail records. Select the item ID that
          requires changing and open the Equipment Detail record. Click the ―Item ID‖ icon
          and enter the new item ID. The CC, equipment type, accountable equipment
          indicator, and maintenance required fields must match to process the item ID change.
          Changes to these fields may be performed in the MTF Catalog record. Click the
          ―Assign‖ button to process the item ID change. DMLSS processes a SNZ transaction
          and prints a Custodian Action List which is maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R
          09.00.
          9.6.4.6.5. The Print icon allows printing of a Historical Maintenance Report (HMR)
          or an Equipment Detail Report. The reports print to the user‘s local printer.
9.7. Equipment Balance.
   9.7.1. The Equipment Balance module provides the Equipment Manager the capability to
   manage authorizations and view equipment balances. Equipment authorizations may be
   created, edited, and deleted. When an equipment balance search is performed, the system
   displays the authorizations as well as the OH balances for accountable in-use equipment
   items that meet the search criteria.
   9.7.2. To access the Balances window, from the Navigate menu, click ―Equipment Balance‖
   or the user can click the ―Balance‖ button on the toolbar. The Equipment Balance search
   window opens and requires input to continue. The user must enter a device class, item ID,
   nomenclature, or Line Item Number (LIN).
   9.7.3. The Balances window (Figure 9.7.) displays the requested results by authorizations
   and balance information. Additional filter criteria can be entered in this window to further
   narrow the search parameters.
 334                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 9.7. EM Balances Window.




   9.7.4. When equipment balances exceed authorizations, managers should conduct research
   and add or edit authorizations to equal balances. At times, authorizations will exceed
   balances, i.e. an approved/unfunded equipment request may exist. Equipment managers
   could adjust authorizations upon approval of the AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request,
   thus reflecting the approved/unfunded requirement.
   9.7.5. The Balance Information box displays totals for equipment authorizations, in use, due-
   in, on-loan, leased, and excess by item ID. The authorizations should match the collective
   totals of the remaining fields (i.e. Authorization=In-Use+Due-In+On-Loan+Leased+Excess).
   Note: Valid conditions may exist causing the authorizations and balances not to equal, i.e.
   approved/unfunded requirements.
   9.7.6. Click the ―Add‖ button to create a new authorization detail for an item ID with a
   balance record and no authorization. In the Authorization Detail window, enter the item ID,
   ORG, authorization quantity, and authorization reference and click ―OK.‖ The increased
   item authorization quantity will be added to the Authorizations List box and the Balance
   Information box.
   9.7.7. DMLSS generates an IAE transaction for the equipment increase.
   9.7.8. Click the ―Edit‖ button to modify an existing authorization quantity. In the
   Authorization Detail window, enter the modified authorization quantity and click ―OK.‖ The
   quantity fields in both the Authorizations and Balances boxes reflect the increase or decrease
   in authorization quantities. If the quantity entered is zero, the authorization will no longer
   appear in the Authorization box after processing.
   9.7.9. DMLSS generates a DAE transaction for an equipment decrease and an IAE
   transaction for the equipment increase.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  335


9.8. Equipment Classification. Local business practices will determine whether EM or MA
personnel will establish and maintain Equipment Classification records. Procedures for creating
and updating devices, device classes, MFG, and common model data are contained in Chapter 10
of this manual.
   9.8.1. The Equipment Classification function supports both EM and MA requirements. It
   supports the requirement to manage medical equipment based on a medical-legal risk
   assessment and involves establishment of centralized tables. See paragraph 10.5. for more
   information.
9.9. Equipment Loan.
   9.9.1. New Loan.
       9.9.1.1. The Equipment Loan function is used to track equipment that is lent to patients
       and internal or external ORGs when authorized by the ORG‘s approval authority. The
       EM can establish, modify, or delete loan accounts as required. Unique loan account IDs
       are generated by DMLSS and cannot be duplicated within the ORG. Once a loan account
       has been created, information on equipment and/or durable items can be entered and
       associated with the loan account. The user can print the Loan Receipt/Location Lists and
       the Loan Action Lists for signatures and documentation of the loan.
       9.9.1.2. DMLSS sends messages to the EM Inbox to alert the user when loaned
       equipment and/or durable items are nearing, or have reached the end of the loan period.
       If a loan period requires an extension, click the ―Renew‖ icon on the Loan Information
       toolbar and enter the additional days required.
       9.9.1.3. To access the Loan Information window, from the Navigate menu, click
       ―Equipment Loan‖ or click the ―Loan‖ icon on the toolbar. This brings up the Loan
       Search window. Click ―Search‖ to view current loans. Select a loan then click ―Detail.‖
       Click ―New‖ to start a new loan.
       9.9.1.4. This is divided into three tabs: Borrower Info, Items, and Notes.
          9.9.1.4.1. Borrower Info Tab. This tab identifies the type of loan, loan-to
          information, and loan-from information. Enter the last name to access the remaining
          fields. Complete all accessible fields within the tab. Accurate data is important in the
          event the item is returned due to drug/equipment recall, equipment calibration, or loan
          times have exceeded time allowances.
          9.9.1.4.2. Items Tab. The Items tab is where durable items and equipment are
          assigned to the borrower.
              9.9.1.4.2.1. Click the ―Loan‖ button under Durable Items and enter the item ID,
              description, U/S price, quantity, and loan days. Click ―OK‖ to add the item to the
              Durable Items List. If multiple items are being loaned, click ―Loan‖ and enter the
              new information.
              9.9.1.4.2.2. Click the ―Loan‖ button under Equipment Items and enter ECN and
              loan days. Click ―OK‖ to add the item to the Equipment Items List. If multiple
              items are being loaned, click ―Loan‖ and enter the new information.
 336                                                       AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


           9.9.1.4.3. Notes Tab. Use the Notes tab to enter information about the loan. Click
           the ―Add‖ button to load a note. Notes could include training/use of the loan items,
           communications between the borrower and the loan office, or extension requests.
       9.9.1.5. DMLSS will prompt for a Loan Action List or Loan Receipt Location List to be
       printed.
       9.9.1.6. The borrower may have multiple loan items against a single loan account. As
       items are returned to the activity, the user can go into the Items tab and select the item
       being returned. Medical Maintenance inspects equipment items before they are returned
       to inventory. Check durable items for serviceability. Annotate the notes tab with the
       condition of the return.
       9.9.1.7. When all items are returned, click the ―Delete‖ icon on the toolbar to mark the
       account for deletion. The account will not be deleted until after two EOFYs, after all
       actions are completed against any equipment records.
       9.9.1.8. Records marked for deletion may be undeleted if the loan account still exists for
       the borrower. Click the ―Undelete‖ icon on the toolbar to undelete the loan account.
       Complete the tabs for the new loan items.
   9.9.2. Open Loan. Use the Open Loan function to search for, view, and update existing
   equipment loan records. Once an existing record is retrieved, it may be modified using same
   system functionality as loading a new loan record.
   9.9.3. Loan Reminder. In the ―Loaned Items Expiring. Check Loan Reminder List.‖
   pending action, equipment managers can view a list of loaned equipment items that are near
   or past their return dates. Use the Loan Reminder List as a tool to contact the patient. When
   the patient reminder letter is sent, the user can enter the Patient Letter Sent Date in this area.
   In the Loan Reminder List window, the user can also print one or more loan reminder
   records.
9.10. Equipment Request. The Equipment Request module in DMLSS is used for tracking an
equipment request through the process of requesting, approving, funding, ordering, and receipt of
equipment. The Equipment Request Process window is divided into multiple tabs that identify
the equipment item, replacement equipment items, customer, SOS, total funds required,
maintenance requirements, facility requirements, training requirements, and coordination. Note:
The Integrated Global Equipment Request System (TIGERS) allows the AFMS to capture MTF
expense equipment unfunded requirements prior to funding availability so those requirements
can potentially be added to e-commerce sources of procurement (ECAT and PV). TIGERS
utilizes an online equipment request form via the AFML website.
   9.10.1. New Request.
       9.10.1.1. While new equipment requests can be initiated from EM, it is recommended
       that customers initiate new equipment requests as explained in Chapter 7 Customer
       Support (CS), paragraph 7.13. Once the custodian has submitted the new request,
       MEMO personnel receive an EM Customer Equipment Request Submitted pending
       action inbox notice.
       9.10.1.2. The DMLSS equipment request process is designed to be an electronic process.
       However, if the custodian identifies attachments in the Main tab, he/she must hand
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                337


      deliver the documents to MEMO. MEMO personnel must retain these documents in the
      Equipment Request file.
      9.10.1.3. Each equipment request follows a standard routing process within DMLSS.
      Once a new request is submitted, it electronically flows to MEMO and then to the MA.
      MA receives an inbox pending action notifying them of the new request. The systems
      office should be included in the review process even though they do not receive
      electronic notification. Figure 9.8. reflects a typical Equipment Request routing process.

Figure 9.8. DMLSS Equipment Request Routing Process.




      9.10.1.4. Each equipment request contains 14 tabs (Figure 9.9.) requiring a specific
      category of information. Each tab contains mandatory and/or optional data fields used by
      the offices and personnel involved in the request process to explain and define the exact
      details of the equipment request. In most cases, a specific office or individual is
      responsible for a tab; however, in some instances, tabs may require input from multiple
      offices. Table 9.10. reflects the primary responsibility of each tab and/or data field.

              enter the item ID at this time. Otherwise, the item ID field is not mandatory at
              this time. Local procedures determine whether a new catalog record is created at
              this point or after the purchase is approved. It is recommended that catalog
              records be created after the request is approved to prevent the creation of
              unnecessary catalog records. The item ID must be assigned prior to processing
              the equipment order.
              9.10.1.6.3.2. FSC – The FSC is automatically assigned in conjunction with the
              item ID. The FSC is linked to the device nomenclature.
              9.10.1.6.3.3. Nomenclature (Device Nomenclature) – The nomenclature is
              populated upon assigning the item ID.

              from the internal MFG‘s table.
              9.10.1.6.3.5. Model – Enter the MFG‘s model number.
              9.10.1.6.3.6. MFG Division – This field is directly linked to each MFG within the
              MFG‘s table. If a division is assigned to a MFG, it will appear in the dropdown
              menu.
              9.10.1.6.3.7. Submit Order To – Auto populates upon assigning the item ID.
              This information is directly linked to the default SOS assigned in the MTF catalog
              record.
              9.10.1.6.3.8. External Procurement – Not required.
          9.10.1.6.4. Replacement ECN Tab. Verify the custodian entered the correct ECN(s)
          in this tab. Make corrections as necessary. Replacement ECN(s) are mandatory if the
          request type is Normal or Accelerated Replacement. The Replacement Item
          Received. Turn-in Replaced Item pending action appears in the EM Inbox upon
          issuing the new equipment to the customer. MEMO is responsible for ensuring the
          replaced equipment is turned-in and removed from custodial responsibility.
          9.10.1.6.5. Supplies Tab. Review and verify all supplies and repair parts, required as
          part of the initial purchase, are loaded into the Supplies tab. The need for the repair
          parts must be reviewed and verified by the MA prior to returning to MEMO.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               341


        9.10.1.6.6. Training Tab. Ensure all training requirements are documented in this
        tab. Required training could be OPR and/or equipment maintenance training.
        Generally, maintenance personnel will add maintenance training requirements during
        their review.
        9.10.1.6.7. Suggested Sources Tab. Verify the custodian has provided at least three
        possible SOSs. The Primary Source indicator should be checked for one SOS
        indicating the preferred source. If the Sole Source indicator in the Main tab is
        checked and the custodian provides a sole source letter, then only one suggested
        source is required. Assist the custodian with this tab as necessary.
        9.10.1.6.8. Status Tab. Once the local approval authority (i.e. ERAA) has approved
        or disapproved the request, update the Status tab appropriately. The Request Status
        field in the Main tab updates accordingly. Once funded, update the applicable
        funding information. The Funding Status field in the Main tab updates accordingly.
        Also, add status notes as necessary.
        9.10.1.6.9. Coordination Tab. Upon initial review, MEMO is responsible for adding
        required reviewers to the Coordination tab.          At a minimum, add MEMO,
        maintenance, facilities and system‘s POCs. However, it is highly recommended that
        MEMO add all individuals participating in the review process, including the approval
        authority. If local policy requires a printed copy to be presented during the ERAA
        meeting, the Coordination tab provides a signature block for all reviewers. MEMO
        should ensure the data fields in this tab should be updated even if a printed copy is
        used during the ERAA meeting.
        9.10.1.6.10. Summary Costs Tab. The Summary Cost tab provides the approval
        authority a picture of the total cost involved with purchasing the requested equipment.
        The price and cost fields are automatically calculated using the costs entered into
        related tabs and data fields. MEMO must identify the transportation requirements. In
        almost all instance, Free on Board (FOB) Destination applies. Obtain prior approval
        from the local contacting authority if FOB Origin applies. Enter additional
        transportation costs if FOB Origin is used. Additionally, check the Premium Trans
        indicator and enter the premium transportation fund cite if applicable.
     9.10.1.7. MA Responsibilities. The MA is responsible for entering data and identifying
     indicators related to the maintenance and upkeep of the requested item. The MA should
     focus on the following data fields as defined in Table 9.10.:

         quantity into the Approved Qty field in the Status tab and DMLSS automatically
         populates the Disapproved Qty with the difference between the requested and
         approved quantities. The Request Status field updates to Approved; however, the
         Status Notes within the Status tab reflect the approved and disapproved quantities.
      9.10.1.12. Disapproval.
         9.10.1.12.1. If the total request quantity is disapproved, MEMO accesses the
         equipment request and enters a quantity of zero into the Approved Qty field in the
         Status tab. The Disapproved Qty field is immediately populated with the request
         quantity. At this time, use the dropdown menu to assign a Disapproved Reason, click
         ―Save,‖ and then click ―Yes‖ in the message box to acknowledge disapproval. If
         disapproved, the process terminates.
         9.10.1.12.2. A partial disapproval equates to a partial approval explained in
         paragraph 9.10.8.2.
      9.10.1.13. Cancel. If at any time the custodian chooses to withdraw the equipment
      request, select the ―Cancel‖ button located on the vertical toolbar. Click ―Yes‖ to
      confirm cancellation when the message ―You have marked this record Cancelled by
      Customer and will not be able to change the record after the action is saved. Do you wish
      to continue?‖ appears. The Request Status changes to Cancelled. Do not use the
      cancellation function as a substitute for the disapproval function.

        updates to and remains Unfunded until MEMO updates the funding information in the
        Status tab. Before changing the funding status, the equipment nomenclature, MFG,
        and item ID (Equipment Info tab) are required. If locally funded, apply the applicable
        expense center. If centrally funded by AFMOA/SGAL, associate the request to the
        appropriate OP fund record.
        9.10.1.15.2. If the total request quantity is funded, the Funding Status updates to
        Funded once the funding information is applied to the request. The Order Status tab
        updates to Not Ordered.
        9.10.1.15.3. If a partial quantity is funded, the Funding Status updates to Partially
        Funded and the Order Status updates to Not Ordered. Note: The remaining
        unfunded quantity cannot be funded until the originally funded quantity is ordered.
        9.10.1.15.4. Once the total request quantity is funded, the Funding Status field
        updates to Funded.
        9.10.1.15.5. A Status Note is added reflecting the funded quantity each time funding
        is applied to the request.
     9.10.1.16. Ordering Equipment.
        9.10.1.16.1. MEMO places orders on approved and funded equipment. By clicking
        the ―Order‖ button, the IM Offline Order window appears. Data entered into the
        equipment request automatically populates the data fields within the Offline Orders
        window. After validating the data, MEMO executes the order. DMLSS creates IM
        due-in and due-out records and updates the equipment request with the document
        number of the order. The Order Status field updates to Ordered and the Receipt
        Status updates to Open Due-Outs.
        9.10.1.16.2. If a partial quantity was funded and ordered, the Order Status field
        updates to Partial Ordered and the Receipt Status updates to Open Due-Outs.
        9.10.1.16.3. Once the total request quantity is ordered, the Order Status field updates
        to Ordered and the Receipt Status remains at Open Due-Outs.
        9.10.1.16.4. A Status Note is added to the Status tab when the equipment order(s) are
        processed.
     9.10.1.17. Receiving Equipment.
        9.10.1.17.1. Once receipt(s) process for the total request quantity, the Receipt Status
        updates to Received.
        9.10.1.17.2. If a partial quantity is received, the Receipt Status updates to Partial
        Received.
        9.10.1.17.3. A Status Note is added to the Status tab when the equipment receipt(s)
        are processed.

   be performed with any of the criteria in the drop-down boxes. The Equipment Request
   Search function allows users to search for existing requests using the following criterion:
   ORG, customer, item ID, nomenclature, or request number by status and type. The main use
   of this function is to follow a request through the approval and funding process. It is
   essentially a tracking tool for both logisticians and customers. All notes and detailed
   information added during the review process are visible as the data is inputted and saved.
9.11. Equipment Software. The Equipment Software Management module provides the
capability to manage software records for installed, embedded in equipment, or stored software
for later distribution. Users can create the software records and link them to individual
equipment items. These records can help identify the type and version of software with
problems or requiring updates. The tracking of available software and installed software

          requests.
      9.11.1.2. Multiple software licenses can be loaded by clicking the ―Add License‖ button.
      This option is used when there are multiple software licenses from the same company.
      When software is no longer required for a piece of equipment and there is a requirement
      to return the software to the company or send the equipment to another installation or
      DRMO, the user will need to delete the software record. Click the ―Delete License‖
      button to remove the software license record. This will also remove the associated
      equipment.
      9.11.1.3. When all software from a particular company is no longer used, click the
      ―Delete‖ icon on the toolbar to mark the company for deletion. Once all actions are
      completed against an equipment record, the account will be deleted after two EOFYs . If
      software and equipment are still linked to the company, the user will be prompted with a
      message that records exist and will be deleted if the user continues any further.
      9.11.1.4. Records marked for deletion may be undeleted if the company still exists.
      Click the ―Undelete‖ icon on the toolbar to undelete the company. Add the new license
      info as required.

   conducting by ORG, company, nomenclature, version, and type. The main purpose of this
   function is to view and modify existing equipment software records and to minimize
   duplication of records.
9.12. Custodian Management.
   9.12.1. Custodian Management provides the capability for the equipment manager to
   manage data on equipment custodians. The equipment manager establishes new POC
   records, assigns custodians to customer accounts from new or existing POC records, modifies
   custodian records, changes custodial responsibilities, and removes custodians when no OH
   equipment or equipment due-ins exist for the customer account.
   9.12.2. The account custodian may be granted systems rights to establish, modify, or delete
   sub custodians. These sub custodians are responsible for small sections of the account. As
   an example, an eight dental treatment room (DTR) Dental Clinic has a primary property
   custodian assigned. The primary custodian may want to assign equipment accountability to
   the technician responsible for each DTR. The primary property custodian can appoint each
   technician as a sub custodian for each DTR. The sub custodians‘ name is associated to the
   customer account and once these records are established the application facilitates the
   assignment of equipment to sub custodians for custodial responsibility. Custodial

       the customer account.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               349


     9.12.4.10. Orientation Date - The date that training was provided to the custodian on
     their responsibilities.
     9.12.4.11. Departure Date - The date the individual is due to depart or has departed the
     MTF.
  9.12.5. The Custodian tab also allows the user to update the next scheduled inventory under
  Inventory Information. The inventory date entered cannot exceed 365 days. This date is
  used to send notice to the EM Inbox and to the customer 30 days prior to the official
  inventory date for the selected section. This allows for both the EM and customer to prepare
  for the inventory.
  9.12.6. Sub Custodian Tab. To add sub custodians to the account, click the ―Sub Custodian‖
  tab in the Custodian Detail window. Enter the sub custodian‘s basic information in the

     will be displayed in the Customer‘s Equipment, Assigned Equipment box.
     9.12.6.2. If there is a need to assign multiple sub custodians, click the ―Add Sub
     Custodian‖ button and enter the next sub custodian‘s information and assign the
     accountable equipment they will be responsible for. When multiple sub custodians exist
     for a customer ID, the VCR buttons and number of sub custodians are displayed at the
     top of the window. This allows the user to move freely through the records.
     9.12.6.3. There is a Print option available to the EM and primary account custodian that
     allows the printing of a Sub Custodian Receipt/Location List for each sub custodian.
     When this product is requested it will print to the requestor‘s local printer. The primary
     property custodian should maintain the current Sub Custodian Receipt/Location List in
     their accountable property records folder.
     9.12.6.4. Use the Change Sub Custodian button when the primary property custodian
     wants to make changes to sub custodian‘s basic information. Select the sub custodian
     that is being replaced and click the ―Change Sub Custodian‖ button. Complete the new
     record screen with the new custodian‘s information. When the user clicks the ―Save‖
     icon on the tool bar, the new record replaces the selected custodian‘s information and all
     equipment transfers to the new sub custodian. The primary custodian should ensure that
     the new sub custodian has validated the inventory records prior to accepting the account
     from the replaced sub custodian.
     9.12.6.5. Before a sub custodian can be deleted as an accountable property custodian, all
     assigned equipment must be reassigned to the primary property custodian. The primary
     property custodian may reassign the equipment to an existing sub custodian after the
     equipment is returned to the primary account. Click the ―Assign/Unassign Equipment‖
     button to disassociate assigned equipment. Select all equipment items using shift + click
     method and click the disassociate button‖>>‖ to move all records back to the unassigned

       equipment box should be empty. Click the ―Delete Sub Custodian‖ button to remove the
       sub custodian.
       9.12.6.6. The sub custodian is responsible for all items assigned to them; however, the
       primary property custodian is still responsible for all equipment assigned to their account.
       Discrepancies should be identified immediately to ensure quick resolution. AFI 41-209
       contains guidance for Reports of Surveys (ROSs).
   9.12.7. Notes Tab. The Notes tab allows the EM to enter small information bits (up to 256
   characters) concerning a custodian or the status of a custodian‘s account. This feature allows
   for tracking status of open issues, ROS actions, training conducted, or anything else relevant
   to the property account. An option to delete comments is also available when data becomes
   irrelevant or no longer needed.
       9.12.7.1. To access a note, double click in the Note field. The message box will open to
       allow notes to be entered at that time. When all notes are entered or updated, click the
       ―Save‖ icon on the toolbar.
   9.12.8. Change Custodian Icon. Custodial responsibility may be removed provided an
   inventory is accomplished prior to this action. Changing an existing primary property
   custodian is done by clicking the ―Change Custodian‖ icon in the Customer/Custodian List
   window. This opens the Custodian Detail window for which the customer ID custodian is
   responsible. Enter the new custodian‘s information in the Custodian tab and click ―Save.‖ If
   sub custodians exist for the account a message will display prompting the user to determine if
   the existing sub custodians will be retained. If ―Yes‖ is selected, all information is
   transferred under the new custodian. If ―No‖ is selected, all sub custodians are deleted and
   all equipment associated to the sub custodians is disassociated and returned to the new
   primary property custodian. The new custodian may reassign sub custodians as needed.
   9.12.9. Remove Icon. The Remove icon in the Customer/Custodian List window allows the
   EM to remove a custodian when no longer required. A custodian cannot be removed if
   accountable equipment records are OH or due-in or if the primary custodian has sub
   custodians assigned. These items must be located and transferred to other property
   custodians, EM hold account, or reported excess before the account is removed. When the
   user clicks the ―Remove‖ icon, all customer and custodian information is deleted from the
   Customer/Custodian List in DMLSS.
   9.12.10. Refresh Icon. The Refresh icon resets the window to what is current in the
   database. In some cases, changes that are made will not be reflected in the window until this
   icon is pushed or the user exits and reenters the window.
   9.12.11. Print Icon. The Print icon prints the results of the search in the Customer/Custodian
   List window. The printed report lists the customer ID, customer name, custodian name,
   custodian phone, last inventory date, and next inventory date. The user can sort the results
   before printing by clicking the column heading of the criteria to be sorted by.
9.13. Equipment Inventory.
   9.13.1. The Equipment Inventory module allows the user to create, conduct, reconcile, and
   resolve equipment inventories. The user can enter criteria for the inventory and DMLSS
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  351


   generates an inventory file for the selected parameters and assigns an ICN. Equipment
   inventories, regardless of method used, must be accomplished IAW AFI 41-209, Chapter 7.
   9.13.2. The equipment inventory method may be manual, HHT-Batch Mode or HHT-RF
   Mode. In the manual inventory mode, the user prints the equipment inventory list and uses it
   to perform the physical inventory. Once the physical part of the inventory is complete, the
   user returns to DMLSS and updates the inventory records. The HHT allows the user to
   perform the inventory by scanning bar code labels on the equipment instead of visually
   reading the labels. The HHT is also an alternative input device for updating the inventory
   file with the information from the physical inventory. The HHT can be used in a Batch
   Mode or an interactive RF mode.
   9.13.3. Once the inventory records have been input for update to the inventory file, the user
   can reconcile and complete the inventory. DMLSS displays the overage/shortage list when
   discrepancies exist for a customer account. The shortage list includes those equipment items
   that were not updated (not found). The overage list includes those equipment items that were
   manually added by the user or found during the HHT inventory process. The user can
   perform corrective actions for selected records on the overage/shortage screen.
   9.13.4. To access the inventory module from the Navigate menu, select ―Inventory‖ and
   click on ―New Inventory‖ or click the ―Inventory‖ icon on the toolbar. Search for existing
   inventories by entering search criteria or click the ―New‖ button to establish an inventory for
   an ORG, customer, or custodian.

      9.13.5.2. Inventory methods determine how the inventory will be performed. Choose
      between Manual, HHT-Batch, or HHT-RF.
      9.13.5.3. Inventory reasons identify why the inventory is being performed. Command
      directed, custodian change, equipment manager change, routine, and special are the
 352                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       reasons for inventory. Command directed and special inventories allows inventory of
       specific device classes and nomenclatures. An example of a special inventory could be
       conducting an inventory of all defibrillators in the MTF.
       9.13.5.4. ORG name identifies the organizational assets or the ORG of the customer‘s
       assets that will be inventoried.
       9.13.5.5. Scope identifies the equipment that will be inventoried. The scope can define
       all organizational equipment to be inventoried or specify specific customer‘s or
       custodian‘s equipment.
       9.13.5.6. Click ―OK‖ to process the inventory requirement and view the Equipment
       Inventory Listing window for selected scope criteria. During processing, DMLSS
       assigns an ICN to requirements. The purpose of the ICN is to keep track of inventories
       that are not complete.
       9.13.5.7. The Equipment Inventory Listing window Figure 9.12 lists all equipment items
       identified by the search criteria by customer ID, ECN, item ID, nomenclature, equipment
       type (Eq Ty), system ECN, permanent location, temporary location, and on loan status.
       As the inventory is updated, the inventoried, date inventoried, and inventory performed
       by fields are populated.

      9.13.7.10. The associated inventory fields in the DMLSS EM Inventory window are
      updated with the inventory results.
      9.13.7.11. Any items found during inventory not on the custodian‘s equipment property
      records should be added to the inventory for validation. Click the ―Add‖ button at the
      bottom of the inventory list to view the Add ECN to Inventory window and enter the
      ECN and Inventory location. Ensure the name of the individual who found the item is in
      the Performed By field. The item is added to the immediate inventory list. Scanned
      inventory items are added to the inventory during batch upload or in real time if
      inventory was performed in RF mode.
      9.13.7.12. Do not update equipment records for items that were not found during
      inventory. These records will be handled as part of inventory reconciliation.
      9.13.7.13. View the Equipment Items Detail record anytime during the inventory by
      clicking the ―Details‖ icon on the toolbar. The Equipment Details window provides
      information on items to aid in the inventory process.
      9.13.7.14. When the inventory is completed, click the ―Reconcile‖ icon on the toolbar to
      view the Equipment Shortage/Overage window. The window lists all shortages and
      overages identified during the inventory. This list must be validated before an inventory
      can be completed.
  9.13.8. Reconcile Shortages.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    355


     9.13.8.1. When shortages are discovered during the inventory, a letter requesting ROS
     action is completed prior to processing the loss transaction and finalizing the inventory.
     Click the ―Loss‖ icon on the toolbar to process the loss. In most cases, select ―Manual‖
     for form number. If research is found that the item was sent to another MTF or DRMO,
     select either DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document or DD Form
     1348-1A. There is the option to print a copy of the Custodian Actions List as a result of
     processing. DMLSS generates an ILE transaction to record the loss.
     9.13.8.2. The Match icon compares the items listed in shortages and overages and lines
     up items listed in both window views.
  9.13.9. Reconcile Overages.
     9.13.9.1. Research overages to determine the reason an overage exists. Equipment might
     have been changed between customers without coordination with the EM, excess
     equipment may have been received and not coordinated with EM, or documentation may
     have been submitted to turn an item in but the equipment was never given to maintenance
     or the Equipment Manager. The overage field provides ownership customer ID and
     where the overage was found.
     9.13.9.2. If the item is in this section as a result of transfer, click the ―Transfer‖ icon on
     the toolbar. DMLSS processes the CTE transaction to record the transfer action. The
     Custodian Actions List as a result of processing can be printed, if necessary. This item is
     considered reconciled for inventory purposes.
     9.13.9.3. If the item belongs to the custodian listed in the ownership field, click the
     ―Return‖ icon on the toolbar. The item is cleared from the inventory list and returned to
     the proper owner. The item is considered reconciled for inventory purposes.
     9.13.9.4. If the item is required in the inventoried location and it is not currently listed on
     a customer account, click the ―Gain‖ icon to add the item to the inventory. DMLSS
     prompts completion of the equipment gain. If a MTF Catalog Record doesn‘t exist,
     create one by using the ―Jump To‖ icon while in the Equipment Gain window.
     9.13.9.5. DMLSS processes the IGE transaction to record the gain action. The option to
     print the Custodian Actions List as a result of processing is available. This item is
     considered reconciled for inventory purposes.
  9.13.10. Complete Reconciliation.
     9.13.10.1. When corrective actions on all shortages and overages are complete, click the
     ―Reconcile‖ button on the toolbar to complete the inventory. The option exists to
     complete single user inventories or multiple inventories. Reconciling the inventory
     updates the equipment and custodian records and sets the next required inventory date in
     the equipment detail records.
     9.13.10.2. To print a copy of the Custodian Receipt/Location List, click the ―Reports‖
     icon on the horizontal toolbar, select ―Standard Inquiry,‖ and click ―Custodian
     Receipt/Location List‖ from the report name list. The printed copy will be sent to the
     user‘s local printer. There is an option to save the file as a .TXT file for instances when
     electronic copies are required.
 356                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   9.13.11. Open Inventory. To open an existing inventory that is not complete, click the
   ―Inventory‖ icon on the toolbar and select the ―ICN.‖ The inventory will open. Perform any
   updates as required.
9.14. Equipment Excess.
   9.14.1. EM Excess allows you to view, report, follow-up, and transfer potential excess items.
   Equipment items classified as excess are transferred to the EM Excess SVC/CUST 2X5245
   (SVC/CUST code changes based on finance guidance) identified in the EM Services Detail
   record. Serviceable items listed in this SVC/CUST are considered potential excess and are
   displayed in the EM Excess window.
   9.14.2. Access the EM Excess window Figure 9.13 from the Navigate menu by selecting
   ―Excess‖ or by clicking the ―Excess‖ icon on the toolbar. The EM Excess window displays
   ECNs for potential excess and reported excess. Basic item details are viewable for each
   equipment item as selected.

Figure 9.13. EM Excess Window.




   9.14.3. You have the ability to search for specific equipment items by limiting searches
   using the Filter icon. The filter option allows you to narrow the equipment search by ECN,
   item ID, or document number. The search will display the results by the equipment‘s current
   excess state: Potential Excess or Excess Reported.
   9.14.4. If an item currently in excess can be utilized within the main ORG or a sub ORG,
   transfer the item to the gaining custodian using the Remove icon on the toolbar. The
   Remove option performs an equipment transfer of the item from potential equipment excess
   records to the gaining custodian. A CTE transaction is processed and written to the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  357


   equipment Transaction History file. DMLSS also generates a Custodian Actions List to
   document the loss from the equipment account and the custodian gain.
   9.14.5. The Search icon is enabled when you are reviewing reported excess. Search allows
   you to search all excess records.
   9.14.6. Reporting Excess.
      9.14.6.1. Select an ECN from potential excess and click the ―Report‖ icon on the toolbar.
      The equipment is assigned a document number from the 7500-7999 serial block with
      status code ―ES‖ and moved to the Excess Report within the EM Excess window. The
      outgoing requirements are sent during EOP processing. To view the detail status of the
      Excess Report, click the ―Detail‖ icon on the toolbar. The detail window provides excess
      detail information and status for each reported item.
      9.14.6.2. Detail Status Processing. From the Excess Report Detail window, you can
      process follow-up or cancellation status against reported excess requirements. To process
      status against an equipment excess item, click the ―Status Request‖ icon on the toolbar.
      Excess status processing is completed from the IM module and updated equipment
      records.
      9.14.6.3. Generate follow-up status when you haven‘t received status from TRIMEDS
      within five days of the initial requirement being sent. Follow-up status generates status
      code ―EF‖ and posts the status to the Status tab within the window.
      9.14.6.4. Cancellation of an equipment item generates status code ―EC‖ and posts the
      status to the Status tab within the window.
      9.14.6.5. If you are not familiar with a status code listed in the Status tab, you can click
      the ―Description‖ icon on the toolbar to view the status codes description.
9.15. Contracts.
   9.15.1. The Contracts icon is linked to the Service Contracts module of DMLSS and
   provides a method for recording information on service contracts. The service contract
   records can be linked to equipment records to track equipment leases. When equipment is
   entered on service contract records, the equipment record reflects the service contract
   information. Once a service contract record has been created, users can record calls placed
   against that contract and record the receipt of the services.
   9.15.2. New Call.
      9.15.2.1. The New Call icon opens the Call detail window and allows you to enter call
      information associated with a contract for services required to be performed. Complete
      all required information and enter any applicable notes associated with the call. Multiple
      CLINs can be entered for a call by clicking the ―Add‖ button. Information for each
      CLIN, in most cases, is required for cost estimating.
      9.15.2.2. If the call is being performed against an equipment item with a work order,
      enter the work order number and ECN.
      9.15.2.3. Saving the call detail information adds the new call number to the Call Register
      file.
 358                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   9.15.3. Call Register.
       9.15.3.1. Click the ―Call Register‖ icon to view all call numbers associated to a selected
       contract. CLIN detail information is provided for each call selected within the window.
       Click the ―Call Detail‖ icon to perform updates to open contract calls. Entering the
       document number will close the call for services performed.
       9.15.3.2. When calls are complete, click the ―Receipts‖ icon to generate the DD250
       required by Finance. You will be required to enter the actual quantity (services
       performed based on CLIN information) received and the date performed. Click ―Save‖ to
       update the call register and generate the DD250. You can select the number of copies
       that are required during printing.
9.16. Transportation. This option provides outshipment and inshipment search screens from
the Distribution and Transportation Module (D&TM) that allow users to track all or selected
shipments and send advance shipment notices to gaining bases. EM users can process
transactions to another Military Treatment Facility (MTF) and DRMO. While processing
transactions to another MTF or DRMO shipments requiring transportation, it is imperative that
users check the block ―Transportation Required‖ to the right of the ―Use Form Number‖
dropdown on the Equipment Loss screen as this allows the request to be tracked within D&TM
Figure 9.14. See Attachment 4, DMLSS Distribution and Transportation Module, for additional
instruction.

Figure 9.14. EM Excess Window.




9.17. Equipment Reports. DMLSS provides a variety of standard reports and inquiries to help
managers. Access the EM Reports module to view the available reports. The difference
between a report and an inquiry is defined below.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     359


   9.17.1. Report: A report is a collection of data presented automatically on a periodic or
   event driven basis. Reports represent the status at that point in time and/or present data of a
   historical nature. The data is presented in a standardized format and cannot be manipulated.
   Reports are not available if the Report Date field is not populated.
   9.17.2. Standard Inquiry: An inquiry is similar to a report in that the inquiry presents data in
   a standard preprogrammed format. Inquiries are not produced automatically on a periodic
   schedule. Instead, inquiries are produced only when users request the information.
   9.17.3. View Inquiry: Select an inquiry and click the ―View‖ icon on the toolbar to review
   an inquiry. Most inquiries require criteria to be entered before the report is viewable. While
   in the inquiry preview window you have the option of printing or saving the inquiry to file.
   9.17.4. Refer to Chapter 13, Reports, for a brief description of each report in EM along with
   its content and use.
9.18. Transaction History.
   9.18.1. Transaction History provides an auditable record of transactions, such as gains,
   losses, or custodian changes that affect the accountable equipment inventory. DMLSS
   assigns a document number and creates a Transaction History record every time a transaction
   affects the quantity or dollar value of assets in inventory, the ID of assets in inventory, or the
   custodial responsibility of assets in inventory.
   9.18.2. Transaction History is used to verify that equipment transactions have been
   processed properly and to determine the necessary corrective actions when an error has been
   identified. Equipment gain and loss transactions can be reversed from EM Transaction
   History when it is determined erroneous processing occurred. Reversing a transaction
   processes all required actions in reverse order of how they were originally processed.
   9.18.3. To access the Equipment Transaction History Search window, click on the
   ―Navigate‖ menu, then select ―Transaction History.‖ In the Equipment Transaction History
   Search window, type or select the required search criteria and then click ―Search.‖ The
   Equipment Transaction History Details window will display the search results.
   9.18.4. A multitude of search criteria is available for conducting searches. It is
   recommended that you search for specific information to narrow the search results. This also
   minimizes the impact on server speed and processing.
9.19. DMLSS Equipment Depreciation.
   9.19.1. Depreciation is the gradual reduction of an asset‘s value and is tied to the life of the
   asset. DMLSS calculates depreciation on all equipment with acquisition cost of $100K or
   more and reports these values to DFAS. See the Annual Capital Equipment Depreciation
   report (paragraph 13.8.2.).
   9.19.2. Depreciation in DMLSS is calculated during the End-Of-Month (EOM) process.
      9.19.2.1. DMLLS calculates the current months depreciation as the acquisition price
      divided by 60 when the current month depreciation plus accumulated depreciation is less
      than or equal to the acquisition price of the equipment. If the calculated depreciation plus
      accumulated depreciation exceeds the acquisition price then the current month
      depreciation is calculated as the acquisition price minus the accumulated depreciation.
 360                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       9.19.2.2. The exception to this is during the first month the depreciation is calculated.
       When the accumulated depreciation is equal to zero and the acquisition date is prior to
       the current month the depreciation is calculated as the acquisition cost divided by 60
       times the age of the equipment in months.
   9.19.3. The following fields in the EM application affect the depreciation calculation:
       9.19.3.1. A blank acquisition date. When the acquisition date is blank, DMLSS
       generates a pending action message ―Blank Acquisition date in Capital Equipment
       record‖ in the EM inbox. The user must enter an acquisition date for the item. Once this
       date is entered, DMLSS calculates the deprecation correctly.
       9.19.3.2. Changes to the acquisition date. Changes to the acquisition date do not adjust
       any previous DMLSS calculations that were reported; however, it does change future
       calculations. Caution: Depreciation starts form the original date that depreciation was
       first calculated. Changes to an acquisition date may give the appearance that DMLSS
       took longer than 60 months to report the depreciation of the item even though all items
       should be fully depreciated in 60 months from the original acquisition date
       9.19.3.3. Changes to the acquisition price. DMLSS continues to calculate depreciation
       normally; however, the change alter the time it takes for this item to become fully
       depreciated. When the acquisition price changes, DMLSS calculates the current month‘s
       deprecation based off of the new acquisition price. If the new acquisition price is less
       than the accumulated depreciation, DMLSS no longer reports deprecation for that item.
       If the new acquisition price is greater than the accumulated depreciation, DMLSS does
       calculate deprecation.
          9.19.3.3.1. Example 1: The current deprecation for ECN 041213 is $376,034.29.
          The original acquisition cost of $528,108.70 would have been fully depreciated in 60
          months; however, the acquisition cost was changed to $454,802.52. Due to this
          change and when it took place the item will now fully depreciate in 58 months.
          9.19.3.3.2. Example 2: The current depreciation for ECN 048439 is $25,900.50.
          The original acquisition cost $310,806.00 would have been fully depreciated in 60
          months; however, the acquisition cost was changed to $362,000.00. Due to this
          change and when it took place the item will now fully depreciate in 64 months.
9.20. EM Utilities
   9.20.1. EM Utilities, Inbox. The inbox related to Equipment and Technology modules is
   slightly different than the inbox in other DMLSS modules; however, it serves the same
   purpose. When EM is accessed, the inbox opens automatically when pending actions or
   advisory notices exist. The inbox can also be accessed by selecting ―Utilities‖ from the menu
   bar and clicking on ―Inbox.‖
       9.20.1.1. Users must review and take action on items in the inbox daily to ensure proper
       management of all equipment related issues. Users can access processes or reports by
       clicking the action or advisory item and double clicking the report under the product
       heading. Make changes as required and save actions to complete the process and print
       any required reports as needed. When processes are complete, close the window to return
       to the inbox. The inbox can be closed or left open while in the EM module.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              361


     9.20.1.2. The Advisory panel displays pending action messages that do not require any
     action by the user. These may be deleted after review. However, some pending actions
     will come back every day until resolved (for example, EM Excess Troubled Ship.).
     These must be deleted manually.
     9.20.1.3. The Action Required panel displays pending action messages that require some
     action by the user. This section does not have a Delete button. Once required action is
     completed, the record will no longer appear.
  9.20.2. EM Utilities, Hand Held Terminal (HHT). Where available, PDAs may be used to
  perform inventories. With a HHT, users may scan bar code labels on the equipment, store the
  inventory, and systematically reconcile the inventory. The HHT may be used in Batch mode
  or in the interactive Radio Frequency (RF) mode, and users can switch between modes
  during inventory. In Batch mode, you download or upload information between the HHT and
  a personal computer (PC) using a docking port.
     9.20.2.1. Transfer to HHT. Use this option to download a batch inventory from the PC
     (personal computer) to the HHT (hand held terminal).
     9.20.2.2. Transfer from HHT. Use this option to download a batch inventory from the
     HHT to the PC. The HHT must be attached to the computer, a functioning ActiveSync,
     and the HHT must be in its cradle (because the file transfer is not using wireless mode).
     9.20.2.3. HHT Model Type. The type of HHT being used must be identified within
     DMLSS. To do so, access HHT from the Utilities menu and select ―Janus,‖ PDA, or
     Trakker. All sites should select PDA unless otherwise instructed.
 362                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


                                          Chapter 10

                              EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

10.1. Purpose. The Equipment Maintenance (MA) application provides users with a systematic
approach to equipment maintenance. It allows customers with appropriate privileges the ability
to request maintenance services and obtain status on work requested. The work order system
provides scheduled maintenance procedures and facilitates historical maintenance data
collection. The parts module interfaces to the supporting supply activity and the work order
system. The historical maintenance data is used to support the EM and budgeting processes.
   10.1.1. For privileged users the MA Inbox automatically opens upon accessing the MA
   application from the DMLSS System Navigation window. It can also be viewed by selecting
   ―Inbox‖ from the Utilities menu (review paragraph 10.18.1.). A detailed list of MA pending
   actions and their recommended use is available in Attachment 9.
   10.1.2. The MA main window also appears once the MA application is launched from the
   DMLSS System Navigation window. In this window users can access the modules and
   functionalities of MA mainly through the (navigation) menu options. In some cases you can
   also use the buttons on the horizontal toolbar at the top of the window to open MA module
   windows.
   10.1.3. The equipment maintenance modules covered in this chapter in the same order as
   they appear in the Navigate and Utilities dropdown menus located on the menu toolbar.
10.2. Repair Parts.
   10.2.1. Managing repair parts relates to the acquisition, receipt, storage, and issue of repair
   parts used in equipment maintenance. It also involves updating repair part inventory,
   equipment records, and work order records with parts used in the maintenance processes.
   10.2.2. A Repair Part Inventory record is actually a combination of the MTF Catalog record,
   the Customer Catalog record, and the Item Location record. An SOS record and SOS
   Catalog record must exist before a complete Repair Part Inventory record can be created.
   These records are built within the CAIM application. A CAIM icon is located on the Repair
   Part Search Results screen and the Repair Part Detail screen to accommodate transition to the
   CAIM application.
   10.2.3. Once the Repair Part Inventory records have been established, the process for
   ordering repair parts is included in the CAIM process for BPS Replenishment Orders. The
   replenishment inventory process triggers the requirement to build and process orders. In the
   Repair Parts Inventory system, requirements are identified during the issue of parts to work
   orders and during the establishment of new inventory records. Use the offline replenishment
   process to generate an emergency order for repair parts. In this process the user can
   manually input the requirement and initiate the order process.
   10.2.4. The Repair Part Issue screen provides the capability to issue repair parts to a work
   order or to a customer account and to record a part requirement against a work order. This
   screen will be displayed when the user selects the ―Issue‖ icon on the Repair Part Detail
   screen or when the user selects ―Repair Part Issue‖ from the Navigation menu.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               363


  10.2.5. The Repair Parts module consists of three functions: Open Part, Part Requirement
  List, and Part Issue. These three functions are accessed from the Navigate menu Repair Parts
  option. The Open Parts function can also be accessed by clicking the ―Parts‖ icon on the
  horizontal toolbar.
  10.2.6. Open Part.
     10.2.6.1. Accessing the Repair Parts module initially opens the Search window. The
     scope default is set to search for active records. Change the scope to search for deleted
     items by clicking the ―Deleted‖ radio button. The following search options are available
     to the user:
         10.2.6.1.1. Parts Criteria, which are Part Number, Description, MFR, Item ID, and/or
         Location.
         10.2.6.1.2. Equipment Criteria, which are ECN, MFR, and/or Common Model.
         10.2.6.1.3. The search results are displayed in the window. The user must then
         highlight the record that is to be reviewed and then press the Detail button to review
         the Record Detail. The Record Details are automatically displayed if only one record
         is found.
         10.2.6.1.4. The Repair Part Detail window is divided into four tabs:        Part Info,
         Pipeline Consumption, Equipment Info, and Note.
     10.2.6.2. Part Info Tab.
         10.2.6.2.1. The Part Info tab allows the user to view Repair Part Details and add or
         edit the record as required. Items that can be modified in this window include the
         customer item description, conversion information, issuing information, location,
         level, ROP (Reorder Point), expense center (if multiple expense centers are on file),
         SOS, and level type.
         10.2.6.2.2. Entering a quantity in the ROP field will dictate when the system
         generates a new requirement for that item. Frequently used parts should have a ROP
         assigned.
     10.2.6.3. Pipeline Consumption Tab. The Pipeline Consumption tab provides historical
     consumption data for 24 months on a selected item. This tab also records pipeline times
     and dates. This data is useful when determining whether an item should be stocked, not
     stocked, or deleted.
     10.2.6.4. Equipment Info Tab. From the Equipment Info tab, users can add or delete an
     equipment association to a repair part. Click the ―Add‖ button and enter a MFR,
     common model, and the nomenclature to establish the association. Click the ―Delete‖
     button to delete an association. Establishing these relationships is highly recommended
     during the parts ordering process. The link between parts and equipment helps managers
     identify and manage on-hand inventory.
     10.2.6.5. Notes Tab. The Notes tab allows users to enter unique information about the
     part or any issue associated with the part. This information serves as historical
     background for future requirements. Use the ―Delete‖ button to remove outdated or
     obsolete notes.

   10.2.7. The module (vertical) toolbar contains icons that allow users to perform multiple
   tasks within the Repair Parts Detail module. Standard icons include Find, Save, Revert,
   Delete, Close, and Help topics. The remaining icons link to other modules or applications to
   perform specific functions.
       10.2.7.1. Issue Icon. The Issue icon is a shortcut to the Part Issue module and allows
       users to process an issue or reserve spare parts against an open work order. Parts
       information will display OH quantities and available quantities. Reserved quantities are
       deducted from the quantity available and applied against the respective work order.
       10.2.7.2. Inventory Adjustment Icon.
          10.2.7.2.1. The Inventory Adjustment Icon is a shortcut to the Inventory Adjustment
          module and allows a user to process a gain or loss against the Repair Parts Detail
          record. The OH and available quantity will be either increased or decreased
          depending on what type of inventory adjustment is processed.
          10.2.7.2.2. Processing of an inventory adjustment generates a RPG or RPL
          transaction. Both transactions are written to Transaction History found in the IM
          application.
       10.2.7.3. CAIM Icon. The CAIM icon is a shortcut to the CAIM application and will
       automatically open the Maintenance Activity CAIM Customer Inbox. The shortcut is
       designed to allow the maintenance activity access to ordering capabilities for spare part
       replacement without having to open and close other modules and applications.
   10.2.8. Parts Requirement List.
       10.2.8.1. From the Navigate menu, select ―Repair Parts‖ and click on ―Parts
       Requirement List.‖ The Parts Requirements List window displays all parts requirements
       in Item ID sequence. Note: Parts may be issued when there is an OH quantity in bench
       stock and the required quantity does not exceed the OH balance. The Issue icon is not
       available when the OH quantity is zero.
       10.2.8.2. Details of the repair part may be accessed by selecting a part and clicking on
       the ―Detail‖ icon. A spare part can be reserved and a requirement can be established,
       increased, or decreased within this window.
       10.2.8.3. The Parts Ordering function can also be accessed by selecting the CAIM icon
       within the Parts Detail record. The Maintenance Activity Service Center is opened when
       this option is selected. Follow CAIM ordering procedures to order spare parts.
   10.2.9. Part Issue. This function can be accessed via the Navigate menu, Repair Parts, then
   Part Issue. Use this function to issue or request parts directly to a customer. First, enter the
   item ID of the required part. The Search results window will display work orders awaiting
   the part. Enter the reserve quantity and issue information if a part is needed to satisfy a work
   order requirement. Enter an issue quantity if the part is available for issue. Enter the
   required quantity in the Quantity Requirement field if the part is not available for issue.
10.3. Work Orders.
   10.3.1. The Work Order Management function plays a vital role in the overall success of the
   maintenance mission. The Work Order Management function allows the user to generate,
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             365


  create, update, track, and complete work orders and are maintained IAW AFRIMS T 41-04 R
  29.00. Multiple MAs can be created for a single MTF. However, users can be linked to only
  one MA; therefore, users can only access work orders linked to the assigned MA.
  10.3.2. This section includes a general overview of the Work Order Management function
  and discusses the following topics in detail:
     10.3.2.1. Locating Work Orders.
     10.3.2.2. Work Order Registers.
     10.3.2.3. Work Order Detail Records.
     10.3.2.4. Printing Work Orders.
  10.3.3. Once created, scheduled and unscheduled work orders follow the same chain of
  events that are listed below:
     10.3.3.1. Maintenance manager or team leader assigns the work order to a technician.
     Note: Assigning work orders to a technician is important to the data collection process
     used in other MA modules and reports.
     10.3.3.2. Technician or contractor updates work order.
     10.3.3.3. Technician completes work order upon completion of service or repair.
     10.3.3.4. Maintenance manager or team leader reviews work order for accuracy.
     10.3.3.5. Work order is retained for historical purposes.
  10.3.4. New Work Order.
     10.3.4.1. During the EOM processing, DMLSS generates scheduled work orders for all
     equipment items that have scheduled maintenance service due dates the next month.
     Scheduled work orders can be manually initiated, suspended, or reactivated before EOM
     processing. The suspend process disables generation of scheduled work orders on
     equipment that is lost or in mobilization status. Scheduled maintenance can be
     reactivated once the equipment is located or upon return from mobilization.
     10.3.4.2. Unscheduled work orders can be created as necessary using either the ECN or
     for non-ECN controlled items, ORG, nomenclature, and customer name can be used.
     10.3.4.3. DMLSS assigns a unique sequential number to all work orders, whether
     scheduled or unscheduled.        This work order number is formatted as follows:
     YYYYMMDDxxxx; where YYYYMMDD is the creation date and xxxx is a serial
     number that is reset to 0001 each day.
     10.3.4.4. Assign Work Orders. Work orders may be assigned to teams and/or to
     individual technicians. Work orders can be assigned from the open work order register or
     within the work order detail screen. The assignment process depends on the size of the
     maintenance staff and the requirements at the MTF. Note: Before assigning work orders
     to a technician, the maintenance manager has the ability to review the technician‘s
     workload. The maintenance manager can then reassign work orders based upon the
     number of work orders already assigned and estimated hours to complete assigned work.
     Reference Figure 10.1.

search criteria may be utilized to narrow the results and locate the desired record. Highlight a
record and click the ―Detail‖ icon to view details of a service contract. Details may be printed by
selecting the ―Print‖ option.
10.5. Equipment Classification.
   10.5.1. The Equipment Classification function supports both EM and MA requirements. It
   supports the requirement to manage medical equipment based on a medical-legal risk
   assessment. It involves establishment of centralized tables containing the following
   information:
       10.5.1.1. An equipment classification and nomenclature system.
       10.5.1.2. Standardized management guidance by type of equipment.
       10.5.1.3. Default data by type of equipment.
   10.5.2. Centrally managed classification tables were created as a tri-service project. The
   centrally managed records cannot be edited at the local MTF; however, classification records
   may be added to meet local requirements.
   10.5.3. The Equipment Classification and Nomenclature System includes:
       10.5.3.1. Standard Equipment Nomenclature (Device) and Device Code for Each
       Specific Type of Device. The standard classification system is based on ECRI‘s
       (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute) Universal Medical Device Code
       (UMDC) number and Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS).
       10.5.3.2. Device Class Name and Device Class Code for Each Device. The device
       classes associate the individual devices into groups that perform similar functions. For
       example, there are several types of infusion devices: Ambulatory Infusion Pump, General
       Purpose Infusion Pump, Warming/High Flow, Micro Infusion Pump, Multichannel
       Infusion Pump, and Syringe Infusion Pump. Each of these has a separate device code
       and equipment nomenclature, but all of them will be associated with the device class of
       ―Infusion Pumps.‖ This is used primarily to facilitate queries of equipment records for
       the purpose of easily retrieving multiple like items. This functionality helps the user

10.6. Maintenance Plan.
   10.6.1. The Maintenance Plan module provides a method to establish guidance on the type
   of scheduled maintenance services and the scheduled maintenance intervals for each type of
   device that has a maintenance requirement. Maintenance plans may be established centrally
   or locally at three different levels:
       10.6.1.1. Equipment nomenclature.
       10.6.1.2. Equipment nomenclature, MFR, and common model.
       10.6.1.3. Equipment control number.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 375


  10.6.2. Equipment records meeting the criteria of an established maintenance plan should be
  associated to that plan. Once the association is accomplished, the system applies the
  appropriate maintenance intervals to the equipment.
  10.6.3. Maintenance plans are used to identify maintenance responsibility and the agency or
  level of maintenance support required for each device (for example, depot maintenance,
  organizational, or calibration laboratory). A maintenance plan can be associated with a
  procedure number in order to identify the default maintenance procedure used while
  completing work orders.
  10.6.4. The maintenance intervals within each maintenance plan identify the number of
  months between scheduled maintenance. Each device that has a Maintenance Requirement
  Indicator of ―Y‖ should be associated to a maintenance plan so the system will generate
  scheduled work orders. The four different types of scheduled work orders are:
     10.6.4.1. Inspection (INSP).
     10.6.4.2. Preventive Maintenance (PM).
     10.6.4.3. Calibration (CAL).
     10.6.4.4. Scheduled Parts Replacement (SPR).
  10.6.5. Different maintenance intervals are established for the different operational statuses
  in which the device can be used:
     10.6.5.1. In-Use.
     10.6.5.2. Mobility (assets subject to short-term deployment).
     10.6.5.3. Stored.
  10.6.6. New Plan.
     10.6.6.1. To create a new equipment maintenance plan in DMLSS, from the Navigate

     information and click ―Save.‖ Note: New maintenance plans require management
     decisions to determine whether a central plan is non-existent, too lenient or too stringent,
     and may require prior approval with AFMOA/SGALE. Caution should be used when
     applying local procedures to items with a central maintenance plan since those
     procedures will also be tied to other items using the same nomenclature.
     10.6.6.2. Select the equipment nomenclature from the dropdown menu. Utilize the
     ―Jump To‖ button to create a new nomenclature if necessary. The equipment
     nomenclature establishes the associated device code, device class name, device class
     code, risk level, life expectancy, and specialty.
     10.6.6.3. Enter the maintenance responsibility. This field identifies the agency or
     organizational level responsible for performing maintenance.
     10.6.6.4. Enter the MFR‘s recommendation for maintenance intervals, as required, for
     the following scheduled maintenance types: inspection, PM, CAL, and SPR. These
     intervals may be modified based on the equipment‘s intended purpose; meaning, the
 376                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       operational status (in-use, mobility, stored) may dictate different intervals.
       AFMOA/SGALD can provide additional assistance with determining scheduled
       maintenance intervals if necessary.
       10.6.6.5. The MFR‘s name, common model, and procedure number may also be updated
       in this window. The level of scheduled maintenance may dictate whether or not theses
       fields need to be used.

  10.7.2. Staff records are established when individuals arrive for duty at a MA. The staff
  record should be inactivated upon departure. Maintenance personnel can be assigned to work
  orders once the staff record is established and a DMLSS login has been established.
  10.7.3. Certification and training records can be added for each individual in the MA. This
  information is used to document the professional certifications and training of the personnel
  and aids the supervisor in making work assignments as well as determining if the individual
  requires additional training. Master certification and training records are maintained so they
  can be linked to additional staff members without duplicating the information in each
  individual staff record. This DMLSS function is not intended to replace or supersede any
  official training records or documentation.
  10.7.4. The staff member‘s timesheet information should be entered at the end of each
  month. DMLSS uses this data to process performance information about individual staff
  members. DMLSS also combines data from multiple staff members to process information
  about teams and the overall MA.
  10.7.5. The monthly timesheet provides a method to record the time each person was
  available for work during the month. The timesheet provides a gross breakout of how time
  was spent and provides a basis for productivity analysis reports. The MEPRS data is derived
  from the hours entered into completed work orders and is summed for each customer
  account.
  10.7.6. New Staff. To add a new staff member, from the Navigate menu, select ―Personnel
  Management‖ and click ―New Staff.‖ This will open the Staff Detail window. The window

           10.7.10.2.7. Supervisory hours.
           10.7.10.2.8. Travel hours.
       10.7.10.3. The following values are automatically calculated based on input:
           10.7.10.3.1. Total hours = Regular hours + Overtime hours.
           10.7.10.3.2. Hours available for work = Total hours - (Non-duty absence + Duty
           absence).
           10.7.10.3.3. Hours available for maintenance = Hours available for work -
           (Administrative support hours + Technical training hours + Supervisory hours +
           Travel hours).
           10.7.10.3.4. DMLSS also calculates all column totals.
       10.7.10.4. Timesheets are available by selecting ―Timesheets from Personnel
       Management‖ under the Navigate menu or by selecting the ―Timesheet‖ icon while in the
       Team/Staff window.
       10.7.10.5. Monthly timesheets can be printed by using the ―Print‖ icon. The printed
       report mimics the on-screen display.
10.8. Maintenance Procedures. The Procedures module provides a means to develop and
distribute procedural guidance on scheduled maintenance services. Each procedure includes a
list of tasks performed on a routine basis. It also includes appropriate safety precautions, test
equipment, special tools, repair parts, miscellaneous supplies needed to perform the service, and
descriptive text on how to perform the tasks.
   10.8.1. Centrally managed maintenance procedures are provided as part of the DMLSS
   system. The Add Like function in the Procedures module provides a means for a user at a
   local MTF to use a centrally developed procedure to create a customized procedure. The
   Add Like function copies most parts of the selected procedure and uses it as a starting point
   to establish a new procedure. A maintenance procedure contains detailed steps and guidance
   for maintenance services. A procedure can be general enough to apply to several devices or
   specific enough to apply to a single ECN. When a work order is created for equipment that
   has an associated maintenance procedure, data from the procedure is entered on the Required
   Materials tab of the work order and a checklist is associated with the work order.
   10.8.2. New Procedure. To load a new procedure, from the Navigate menu, select
   ―Procedures‖ and click ―New Procedure‖ or click the ―Procedure‘ icon on the toolbar and
   click the ―New‖ button in the search criteria window. The following three tabs are available
   for updating when the procedure editor window opens: General Info, Applicable Devices,
   and Required Materials. The author of the new procedure will default to the first name and
   last name from the POC record associated with the user‘s login ID.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               381


     10.8.2.1. Enter a procedure title in the Procedure Editor window. The procedure title is

   allows users to view and/or print the Scheduled Maintenance Procedure Library by Index,
   Test Equipment/Special Tools table, Miscellaneous Supplies table, or the Special Character
   table. These tables provide useful information on procedures and the available data to aid in
   creating locally developed procedures.
10.9. Schedules.
   10.9.1. The Workload Forecasting module is an effective tool for the maintenance manager
   to identify potential scheduling problems and to identify adjustments to the maintenance
   schedule. The program will aid the manager in establishing and maintaining an effective
   maintenance schedule. It will facilitate management of the scheduled workload by ORG,
   customer, type of equipment, and whether the work is to be accomplished by various teams
   within the MA or by outside agencies such as contractors.
   10.9.2. Throughout the course of a year, the system generates a predictable quantity of
   scheduled maintenance work orders. The maintenance manager establishes a pattern of how
   this work will be scheduled. Many managers base the schedule on the ORG, customer,
   location of the equipment, and/or type of device. Once a methodology is established, new
   items are added to the schedule as they are received.
   10.9.3. Establishing and maintaining a scheduling methodology is necessary for efficient use
   of personnel. The manager needs to review the schedule periodically to ensure the workload
   is distributed throughout the year and that the workload is balanced among the various teams
   within the MA. In addition, the maintenance manager needs to ensure the individual items of
   equipment are still scheduled appropriately. This involves summarizing and displaying the
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               383


  estimated times required for each scheduled maintenance service. The workload forecasting
  program provides this capability.
  10.9.4. The Workload Forecasting Reports can be used to evaluate the workload for each
  month and the distribution of work for the entire year. It allows the manager to identify
  potential scheduling problems and make the necessary adjustments to the maintenance
  schedule. The manager will be able to access the information needed to redistribute the
  workload in order to achieve a balance that coincides with the staff availability or mission
  requirements. Workload Forecasting Reports will also provide an indication of the overall
  structure of the scheduling logic and shows the major customer areas that are scheduled each
  month. This is helpful in establishing a maintenance schedule for new equipment.
  10.9.5. Detailed Scheduled Workload Forecasting.         The system allows maintenance
  managers to generate Detailed Workload Reports related to equipment items scheduled for
  periodic maintenance. The Detailed Report shows the individual equipment that is scheduled
  for service during each month of the following year. The summary workload reports provide
  the summary information necessary to identify workload distribution problems. The Detailed
  Workload Report provides the details and the methods to correct workload distribution
  problems.
     10.9.5.1. To display the Detail Workload Request screen, select ―Navigate,‖
     ―Schedules,‖ and then ―Detailed Workload Forecasting.‖ The Detail Workload Request
     screen allows the user to enter search criteria used to produce a desired report. The user
     also dictates how the data is to be grouped and displayed. Available search criteria are:
     ORG name, DEPT name, customer name, device class name, equipment nomenclature,
     MFR name, common model, building number, floor number, room number, equipment
     location, team name, other government agency, contractor name, ERC, assemblage
     description, assemblage number/assemblage instance description, and scheduling factor.
     The report data can be grouped and displayed by: ORG, customer nomenclature, MFR,
     MFR and common model, team, other government agency, contractor, building number,
     equipment location, risk level, and ERC.
     10.9.5.2. When the user enters the search criteria and selects ―Search,‖ the system
     retrieves the records, prepares the report, and displays the Detail Scheduled Workload
     Report screen. The Detailed Scheduled Workload Report screen displays a truncated
     Equipment Nomenclature and Scheduling Factor and the services scheduled for the
     equipment during each of the next twelve months. The annual estimated hours for
     servicing the equipment are also displayed. The equipment is grouped according to the
     input criteria, and the number of hours required for each group is calculated and
     displayed.
     10.9.5.3. The user may reschedule the equipment services by moving them to another
     month on the display. When this is done, the system recalculates and displays the hours
     for the affected months. The user may also change the schedules by selecting an item of
     equipment and the Detail icon. The system will then display the Maintenance Data tab of
     the equipment record. In the Maintenance Data tab, the user can change the date due for
     each of the service types, change the scheduling factor, and change the team name. The
     user can also access the maintenance plan for the equipment to see the service type and
     intervals associated with the equipment.
384                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


      10.9.5.4. The system will display the ECN and equipment nomenclature in the Micro-
      help area (Lower left corner) of the screen when the user allows the mouse pointer to
      remain over an individual equipment item in the Detail Workload Request screen.
  10.9.6. Summary Scheduled Workload Forecasting. DMLSS allows users to generate
  Summary Workload Reports related to equipment items scheduled for periodic maintenance.
  The Summary Workload Report is used to evaluate the distribution of the scheduled
  maintenance workload with summarized data. By selecting the report using various criteria,
  the maintenance manager should be able to identify major workload distribution problems
  and determine appropriate solutions. The Detailed Workload Report provides the
  functionality to identify details related to the maintenance schedule and the means to balance
  the workload.
      10.9.6.1. To display the Summary Workload Request screen, select ―Navigate,‖ then
      ―Schedules‘, then ―Summary Workload Forecasting.‖ The Summary Workload Request
      screen provides a display that allows the user to enter search criteria used to produce a
      report. The user also dictates how the data is grouped and displayed in the report.
      Available search criteria include: ORG name, customer name, building number, team
      name, other government agency, and contractor name. Criteria used to group and display
      report data include: ORG, customer, building number, team, contractor name, other
      government agency, and service type.
      10.9.6.2. When the user enters the selection criteria and selects ―Search,‖ the system
      retrieves the records, prepares the report, and displays the Summary Scheduled Workload
      Report screen. The program uses the scheduling data, date due, and intervals to
      determine what maintenance services are due during the next 12 months. The program
      will then obtain the estimated service time and accumulate the amount of time currently
      scheduled for each time period. The program will then display the accumulated data on
      the Summary Scheduled Workload Report. The Summary Scheduled Workload Report
      has three tabs: Estimated Hours, Number of Work Orders, and Graphs.
      10.9.6.3. The Estimated Hours tab provides the number of estimated hours required for
      scheduled maintenance per month for the next twelve months. This data is grouped and
      summarized according to the selected criteria.
      10.9.6.4. The Number of Work Orders tab provides the number of work orders, which
      equals the number of equipment items, scheduled for servicing per month for the next
      twelve months. The data on this tab is also grouped and summarized according to the
      selected criteria.
      10.9.6.5. The Graphs tab provides the capability to graph the data included in the
      Summary Scheduled Workload Report. The user has the option to use the estimated
      hour‘s data or the number of work orders. The user may also select the type of graph, the
      months, and whether or not to use group or total data on the graph. The system will
      display the graph on the screen once the selections are made.
      10.9.6.6. The user may print the Summary Scheduled Workload Report and/or the graph.
      If the user selects the ―Print‖ icon while in the Estimated Hours tab, the system will
      produce the report displaying the estimated hours data. If the user selects the ―Print‖ icon
      while in the Number of Work Orders tab, the system will produce the report displaying
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     385


       the number of work orders data. The system will print the graph being displayed when
       the Print icon is selected.
       10.9.6.7. The Summary Scheduled Workload Report allows the maintenance manager to
       view the overall scheduled maintenance workload from several perspectives. The
       summary reports allow the manager to identify possible scheduling problems. By using
       the system in an iterative manner, the manager can investigate the possible problems in
       more detail and the impact of potential changes. The manager has two options for
       reducing the scope of identifying the scheduling problem and identifying possible
       solutions: Request an additional summary report with reduced selection criteria that is
       focused on the possible problem and request a Detailed Workload Report. If the user
       selects the Detailed Scheduled Workload Report, it will provide a means for the manager
       to view the individual equipment records and maintenance schedules that the summarized
       data represents.
10.10. Equipment Transaction History. Transaction History provides an auditable record of
transactions; such as, gains, losses, or custodian changes that affect the accountable equipment
inventory. DMLSS assigns a document number and creates a Transaction History record every
time a transaction affects the quantity or dollar value of assets in inventory, the identification of
assets in inventory, or the custodial responsibility of assets in inventory.
   10.10.1. Transaction History is used to verify that equipment transactions have been
   processed properly and to determine potential corrective actions when an error has been
   identified. Equipment gain and loss transactions can be reversed from Equipment
   Transaction History when it is determined erroneous processing occurred. Reversing a
   transaction processes all required actions in reverse order of how they were originally
   processed.
   10.10.2. Users have the option of searching for specific item criteria when performing
   searches in the Equipment Transaction History Details window. Maximizing search criteria
   will narrow the search results for specific information. This also minimizes the impact on
   server performance.
       10.10.2.1. In the Equipment Transaction History Search window, the user can search for
       transactions, such as gains or custodian changes that affect the accountable equipment
       inventory.
       10.10.2.2. To access the Equipment Transaction History Search window, click on the
       ―Navigate‖ menu, then select ―Transaction History.‖ In the Equipment Transaction
       History Search window, type or select the required search criteria and then click
       ―Search.‖ The Equipment Transaction History Details window will display the search
       results.
10.11. Equipment Accountability.
   10.11.1. Gain. See Chapter 9, paragraph 9.6.1 for equipment gain procedures. Note:
   ECN‘s can only be assigned in the MA application when the commodity class of the item is
   set to Maintenance Record. The transaction reason is always set to Maintenance Equipment
   Gain – No Accountability when performing an equipment gain within the MA module.
 386                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   10.11.2. Loss. See Chapter 9, paragraph 9.6.2 for equipment loss procedures. Note: Users
   processing losses within the MA module can only process losses on maintenance record
   items only.
   10.11.3. Equipment Record. See Chapter 9, paragraph 9.6.4 for equipment record search
   procedures.
10.12. Equipment Request. The MA Equipment Request functionality is the same process
used in EM. Refer to Chapter 9, paragraph 9.10 for details.
10.13. Equipment Software. The MA Equipment Software functionality is the same process
used in EM. Detailed instructions are available in Chapter 9, paragraph 9.11.
10.14. New Catalog Item/Catalog Search. Catalog search procedures are described in Chapter
5, paragraph 5.2. and 5.3.
10.15. QA. MA QA procedures are the same as discussed in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.21.
10.16. SOS. Refer to Chapter 5, paragraph 5.2.1.4.19. for SOS procedures.
10.17. Reports. The Equipment and Technology Management module contains reports that can
be used to manage MAs, as well as provide data required for higher headquarters. The user will
access the Reports module via the Navigation menu or Navigation toolbar. At that point, the
user can select ―Standard Inquiry‖ or ―Standard Reports.‖ Note: Users must possess the proper
privileges, assigned in SS, to access these reports.
   10.17.1. The user will be able to view standard reports that have been generated during EOP
   processing. The system will maintain these standard reports throughout the specified
   retention period. This allows users to view standard reports generated during previous EOP
   processing sessions. When viewing standard inquiries, the system will require the user to
   select a report and enter the input parameters. The user can view the reports and then elect to
   print the reports. Reports within the Standard Inquiry option are not accumulative and are
   over-written when a new report is produced. The user has the option to save these reports as
   .PSR files on the local PC. Saving these reports will allow for future reference.
   10.17.2. The following definitions describe what are normally considered reports:
       10.17.2.1. Report: A report is a collection of data presented automatically on a periodic
       or event driven basis. Reports represent the status at that point in time and/or present
       data of a historical nature. The data is presented in a standardized format and cannot be
       manipulated. Standard reports essential for the effective management of the activity are
       prepared automatically and are reviewed and analyzed locally as well as at the higher
       headquarters level.
       10.17.2.2. Standard Inquiry: An inquiry is similar to a report in that the inquiry will
       present data in a standard preprogrammed format. Inquiries are not produced
       automatically on a periodic schedule. Instead, inquiries are produced only when a user
       requests the information.
       10.17.2.3. On-line Data: Most, if not all, maintenance data is available and retrievable
       during on-line sessions. The desired information is obtained by processing the
       appropriate report.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              387


      10.17.2.4. Ad Hoc Inquiry: The system uses BOs as a standard Ad Hoc retrieval
      program used to retrieve customized information from the database.
      10.17.2.5. Refer to Chapter 13, Reports, for a brief description of each report in MA
      along with its content and use.
10.18. MA Utilities Menu.
   10.18.1. MA Utilities, Inbox.
      10.18.1.1. The Equipment Maintenance Inbox provides important information about
      actions requiring follow-up (pending actions). The inbox provides the ability to
      immediately view and resolve issues, thus preventing the possibility of problems
      developing and expanding. The inbox should be accessed daily, so issues can be
      addressed in a timely manner. When the Equipment Maintenance application is
      launched, the Inbox window appears if there are pending actions for a MA or individual.
      The user can also access the inbox from the Utilities menu.
      10.18.1.2. The Equipment Maintenance Inbox has three sections:
          10.18.1.2.1. MA Inbox - Displays pending action messages that pertain to the ORG
          ID of the MA.
          10.18.1.2.2. Individual Inbox - Displays pending action messages for a specific user
          ID.
          10.18.1.2.3. Details Section - Displays additional details about a selected pending
          action message in the MA or Individual Inbox, if they are available.
      10.18.1.3. The MA and Individual Inbox sections work the same way. Some pending
      actions are advisory messages and do not require user action. These pending actions are
      marked by a ―No‖ in the Action Required field. Other pending actions require an action
      on the user‘s part, and are marked by a ―Yes‖ in the Action Required field. If the user
      has the MA roles, privileges, and associated resources for pending actions, the user can
      use the ―Jump To‖ icon to access the relevant records.
      10.18.1.4. If the Action Required field for a pending action equals ―No,‖ the user can
      delete the pending action. If the Action Required field equals ―Yes,‖ the message will
      remain in the inbox until the user performs the action required. The user can click the
      ―Refresh‖ icon to refresh the window display.
   10.18.2. MA Utilities, Install Mobile Work Order Applications.
      10.18.2.1. Mobile Work Order Application.
          10.18.2.1.1. Mobile Visual Environment Overview. The mobile work order process
          allows greater flexibility to the maintenance technician. Because the Mobile Media
          window is smaller in nature there will be some visual differences to how information
          is accessed in the mobile environment. Information will be the same but may be
          distributed between multiple tabs verses a single window view.
          10.18.2.1.2. Mobile work order allows the maintenance technician the ability to
          download work orders from the DMLSS computer system to a mobile device such as
          a PDA, tablet/notebook PC, or Laptop. Once disconnected from the network, these
388                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


         devices become mobile and can be used anywhere maintenance is required. Once all
         updates are complete in the field, the mobile device is reconnected so the completed
         data can be uploaded into DMLSS. The Work Order module is updated to reflect the
         completed work. To use this option, the Mobile Work Order application must first be
         activated in DMLSS.
         10.18.2.1.3. Activities will also be required to install active sync software that is
         provided with the PDA on the PC located in the maintenance shop. Active sync
         allows the data to pass from the PC to the PDA and back.
         10.18.2.1.4. Laptop and table or notebook PC‘s are required to act as the DMLSS
         client in order to utilize the mobile work order function. Client in this case means the
         maintenance technician uses the laptop as his or her everyday LAN based PC
         applications. It is also the PC that runs DMLSS. This allows the user to disconnect
         the LAN and travel with the PC when work orders are exported. The data is staged in
         a DMLSS folder on the laptop hard drive until it is imported back to DMLSS.
      10.18.2.2. Roles and Resources.
         10.18.2.2.1. The privileges required to operate mobile work orders are assigned in
         SS. All maintenance technicians should be assigned the resources required to use
         mobile work order processing. The exception is if the AA or SA creates a local role
         and excludes this resource.
         10.18.2.2.2. Unlock Work Orders. This role is required to unlock work orders that
         are locked by other users. The role must be assigned through SS by the AA or SA. It
         is recommended that the use of this role be limited to the superintendent, NCOIC,
         and/or team leader.
      10.18.2.3. Install Procedure.
         10.18.2.3.1. Mobile work order supports two types of electronic devices: PDA and
         Laptop. Notebook and tablet PC‘s fall into the laptop category. The device(s) being
         used will determine which utility to install. Both devices will need to be loaded if
         both devices are used.
         10.18.2.3.2. To install a device, from the Utilities menu select ―Install Mobile Work
         Order Applications.‖ Select the mobile device type: PDA or Laptop.
         10.18.2.3.3. If the device is connected, the serial number, system name, and owner
         name will be updated in the window.
         10.18.2.3.4. An information message will be displayed if the device is not loaded.
         Check the connections and try again.
  10.18.3. MA Utilities, Unlock Exported Work Orders.
      10.18.3.1. Unlocking work orders that are already exported have grave consequences to
      work order management. The ability to import any work that has been performed and
      documented on a mobile device will be lost as a result of the unlocking process.
      Coordination must be accomplished before this process is executed.
      10.18.3.2. In some cases it might be prudent to unlock an exported work order. A piece
      of equipment might be brought to the maintenance shop by the property custodian for
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               389


      maintenance before the maintenance technician has a chance to perform scheduled
      maintenance. A review of open work orders identifies that the equipment as requiring
      scheduled maintenance. The maintenance shop technician may ask the superintendent to
      unlock the work order so the scheduled maintenance work order may be updated with the
      maintenance performed.
      10.18.3.3. The Filter button in the Unlock Work Orders window allows users to narrow
      search options when there are multiple exported work orders. Enter the search criteria in
      the fields located at the top of the window and click the ―Filter‖ button. Only the items
      matching that search will be displayed.
   10.18.4. MA Utilities, Export Work Orders.
      10.18.4.1. Exporting work orders is the process of downloading the work orders from
      DMLSS to a mobile device. Data can be exported to a mobile device by u sing either the
      Utilities menu or the Work Order menu. Either method will work provided the mobile
      device is installed.
      10.18.4.2. To download work orders from the Utilities menu, select ―Export Work
      Orders.‖ Within the Work Order Search window, select a scope and enter the applicable
      search criteria. Reference Figure 10.4.. Click the ―Search‖ button to process.

Figure 10.4. Work Order Search window.




      10.18.4.3. The system will display all records matching the search criteria. Work orders
      that have already been exported are identified with an ―E‖ in the exported field.
      10.18.4.4. One, multiple, or all work orders can be selected for downloading. Highlight
      the desired records and click the ―Export‖ icon to download the work orders to the
      mobile device. When the prompt appears, select the type of device and the work orders
      being downloaded (Figure 10.5.). Click the ―Export‖ button to complete the transfer.

       10.18.4.5. After the data is downloaded:
          10.18.4.5.1. Uncradle the PDA to begin mobile maintenance.
          10.18.4.5.2. Disconnect the LAN cable from the laptop to begin mobile maintenance.
   10.18.5. MA Utilities, Import Work Orders.
       10.18.5.1. Completed work order data contained on the mobile device should be
       transferred to the work order record in DMLSS. First, cradle the PDA or reconnect the
       laptop to a LAN connection before proceeding.
       10.18.5.2. Open DMLSS MA and from the Utilities menu, click ―Import Work Orders.‖
       Select the mobile device being used and click the ―Import‖ button. All data will be
       transferred to DMLSS, updating all affected maintenance work orders. If a record was
       unlocked within DMLSS, the data being transferred will NOT update the Maintenance
       Work Order record.
   10.18.6. MA Utilities, Hand Held Terminal (HHT). Where available, PDAs may be used to
   perform inventories. With a HHT, users may scan bar code labels on the equipment, store the
   inventory, and systematically reconcile the inventory. The HHT may be used in Batch mode
   or in the interactive Radio Frequency (RF) mode, and users can switch between modes
   during inventory. In Batch mode, you download or upload information between the HHT and
   a personal computer (PC) using a docking port.
       10.18.6.1. Transfer to HHT. Use this option to download a batch inventory from the PC
       (personal computer) to the HHT (hand held terminal).
       10.18.6.2. Transfer from HHT. Use this option to download a batch inventory from the
       HHT to the PC. The HHT must be attached to the computer, a functioning ActiveSync,
       and the HHT must be in its cradle (because the file transfer is not using wireless mode).
       10.18.6.3. HHT Model Type. The type of HHT being used must be identified within
       DMLSS. To do so, access HHT from the Utilities menu and select ―Janus,‖ PDA, or
       Trakker. All sites should select PDA unless otherwise instructed.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               391

                                         Chapter 11

                               SERVICE CONTRACTS (SC)

11.1. Purpose. The SC application provides a method for recording SC information and
associating work orders. Contracts can also be linked to a particular equipment item. System
transactions generated in the SC module do not interface outside of the DMLSS environment.
11.2. Contract Records.
   11.2.1. The SC record in DMLSS reflects the contract information from a specific contract
   managed by the MTF. The window is divided into several tabs that contain specific
   information concerning different elements of the contract.
   11.2.2. New Record.
       11.2.2.1. Main Tab. In the Service Contract Record – Main tab (Figure 11.1.) users can
       add or edit a service contract record and view contract record details. This tab provides
       general information about a contract like the contract period, contractor, issuing
       contracting office, and customer. The information on this tab is usually obtained from
       first page of an issued contract.

Figure 11.1. Service Contract Record – New, Main Tab.




       11.2.2.2. COR/COTR Tab. Use this tab to add or edit contract record details about the
       primary Contracting Officer‘s Representative (COR) or the Contracting Officer‘s
       Technical Representative (COTR). Also, identify if this individual has Quality
       Assurance Evaluator (QAE) responsibility from this tab. Complete all required fields and
       update as changes are identified.
       11.2.2.3. Contract Provisions Tab. Contract provisions are identified within the
       Statement of Work (SOW) and identify specific requirements about the contract. Place
       of performance, duty hours, overtime hours/days, labor rates, renewal options, and
       materiel cost basis are some of the areas that should be updated when loading contract
       information. Click the ―N/A‖ checkbox for items that do not apply to the contract.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 393


      11.2.2.4. Services Tab. This tab identifies CLINs referenced in the main contract and
      identifies the service requirements. Click the ―Add‖ button within the Services tab and
      enter the CLIN information from the contract. DMLSS currently does not allow for
      recording ―partial‖ hours when generating a call. A suggestion to allow partial hours
      billing is to set up a ―sub-CLIN‖ with a description referencing the partial hour and using
      a unit price of partial hour. Figure 11.2. reflects an example of loading CLINs for partial
      hours.

Figure 11.2. Loading Partial Service Hours.




          11.2.2.4.1. You can also view all associated equipment and components that a
          contract was written for by clicking the ―Associated Equipment‖ button. The
          information is populated from the Equipment tab. This information is linked to the
          equipment data record and updates contract repair/service costs associated to the ECN
          in maintenance history when receiving a call.
          11.2.2.4.2. The Provisions/Exclusion field is used to specify services and supplies
          materiel that are provided for in the contract. Complete if required.
          11.2.2.4.3. The Standard of Performance field identifies criteria that must be met for
          acceptance of services. These could be QAE responsibilities or state that the unit
          must be working IAW MFG specification upon completion.
      11.2.2.5. Equipment Tab. This tab associates equipment and components to the SC
      record and is available only for service types of Equipment-Maintenance or Equipment-
      Lease. From the window you can Add and/or Delete equipment information or view an
      equipment record‘s detailed information.

      the contract. You can set call number blocks to mirror local policy and set call number to
      auto-generate if required. You can also enter the total contract award amount to track
      expenses associated with the contract. Payment terms are found on the first page of the
      awarded contract.
      11.2.2.7. Notes Tab. It is important to document conversations, funds increase requests,
      training, and problems associated with any contract. Use the Notes tab to keep track of
      information regarding the contract. Some examples include, funds increase requests,
      vendor performance, and training received (QAE, COR).

                                           Chapter 12

                              FACILITY MANAGEMENT (FM)

12.1. Purpose. The FM application encompasses the inventories of installation, facility, room,
and RPIE as well as modules to capture maintenance procedures and PM schedules for the RPIE,
as well as, administrative/RC items (i.e. fire drills, safety training, etc). One of the main daily
functions of the FM application is tracking unscheduled work requests. Any work performed in
your MTF should be captured within DMLSS. FM also has the capability of capturing
requirements (unfunded work requests or projects) and projects (work that typically exceeds
$2500).
12.2. Budget Management. To access the Budget Management module, click ―Navigate,‖
―Budget Management‖ or the ―Budget Mgt‖ button on the horizontal toolbar. The Budget
Management module is utilized to see where funds for a particular expense center have been

a specific MTF/Installation.
12.10. Preventive Maintenance. To access the PM Schedule module, click ―Navigate,‖
―Preventive Maintenance (PM) Schedule‖ or the ―PM Sched‖ button on the horizontal toolbar.
The PM Schedule module is utilized to schedule RPIE for recurring maintenance. Once you
have the RPIE loaded in the FSI module and the maintenance procedures loaded in the
Maintenance Procedure module, you then combine those two to create a PM schedule. Any
given piece of equipment can have multiple PM schedules against it. You can have a
combination of any of the following frequencies: annual, bi-monthly, bi-weekly, daily, every 2
years, every 3 years, every 4 months, every 4 years, every 5 years, every 6 years, every 7 years,
monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and/or weekly.
   12.10.1. Assignment Tab. On the lower half of this tab you will find the Next Scheduled
   Date. This area will display the work projected dates for the next six scheduled PMs.
12.11. Project Management. To access the Project Management module, click ―Navigate,‖

                                      DMLSS REPORTS

Section 13A—DMLSS

13.1. Purpose. This chapter provides information on standard DMLSS reports and inquiries
contained in the IM, AM, CAIM, CS, EM, MA, and SS applications. Use this chapter to view a
brief description of each report including its purpose, content, and use.
13.2. DMLSS Report Types. DMLSS provides standard reports or inquiries contained in each
application, as well as ad-hoc type reporting via Business Objects.
       13.1.1.1. Standard Report. A standard report is a collection of data presented
       automatically on a periodic or event driven basis. Reports represent the status at that
       point in time and/or present data of a historical nature. The data is presented in a
       standardized format, and cannot be manipulated. Standard reports essential for the
       effective management of the activity are prepared automatically. Standard reports are
       produced for local MTF management, and to meet the requirements of higher
       headquarters reporting.
       13.1.1.2. Standard Inquiries. Standard inquiries are similar to reports in that the inquiry
       presents data in a standard pre-programmed format. Inquiries are not produced
       automatically on a periodic schedule. Instead, inquiries are produced only when the user
       requests the information.
       13.1.1.3. Ad-Hoc Reports. In addition to standard reports and inquiries, DMLSS
       supports adhoc reporting via a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) application, currently
       Business Objects, that allows users to build queries from which they can generate reports
       and perform analysis using their own business terms. Several standard/―canned‖ reports
       exist in Business Objects to assist local management and other higher headquarters
       reporting.
13.3. Access to Standard Reports and Inquiries. Standard reports are run in DMLSS with
criteria that are already set. Click Reports on the horizontal toolbar or select Reports on the
Navigation toolbar to run a standard report in each module. In the Report List window, you can
view, print, and save a listing of all standard reports.

                                  INVENTORY CONTROL

Section 14A—Managing Operating Inventory

14.1. Purpose. How you manage your inventory has an impact on the Air Force Working
Capital Fund (AFWCF) as well as the operation and maintenance (O&M) fund. The objective is
to provide logistical support with an economical investment in inventory. Section A of this
chapter covers inventory control procedures associated with establishing warehouse levels and
stock management of the operating inventory. Section B specifically covers customer area stock
management including set-up, inventory, and leveling procedures.
14.2. Establishing a Warehouse Stock Control Method. Medical logistics warehouse
inventory control policies require that we maintain sufficient stocks on-hand to provide recurring
use materiel upon demand.
   14.2.1. Inventory control concepts. The MLFC establishes the inventory control policy.
   The two main methods of inventory control are economic order quantity (EOQ) and
   stockless. These are not mutually exclusive and election to adopt a completely stockless
   warehouse methodology requires significant analysis of item characteristics and reliability of
   the source of supply.
   14.2.2. EOQ. The EOQ inventory control method uses a minimum-maximum system to
   control operating inventory. Unlike the stockless method, the EOQ method maintains
   warehouse inventories for regularly used items. It is best suited for items with long (greater
   than one week) pipeline times. Two critical stock positions identified in this method are the
   Stock Control Level (SCL) and Safety level.
       14.2.2.1. SCL. Under EOQ the planned maximum of an item (referred to as the stock
       control level) should consist of the on-hand and on-order minus due-outs at any one time
       for operating purposes.
       14.2.2.2. Safety Level. The planned minimum stock position under EOQ is the safety
       level. The safety level is the least amount of supplies you should have on hand (planned
       minimum) to support projected needs. This reserve can be used if receipts are delayed or
       if there are nonprojected increases in issues.
       14.2.2.3. The goal is to maintain stock between these two positions. While the on-hand
       quantity should not exceed the stock control level, requisitioning should occur in time to
       ensure receipt before stock on hand reaches the safety level. This will ensure seamless
       materiel availability. Using this method, inventory control is applied to assets centrally
       managed in the warehouse.
   14.2.3. Stockless. The stockless inventory method eliminates warehouse inventory and the
   associated overhead costs of managing warehouse inventory. Conversely, it increases
   procurement, receiving, and customer workload due to repetitive processing of smaller more
   frequent orders. Electing to use the stockless inventory method requires extremely reliable
   suppliers (90%> fill rate) and short delivery timeframes (24-48 hours ).
 460                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       14.2.3.1. Using this method, inventory control is applied to stock owned by and in the
       using activity. There is no stock level maintained and no materiel stored in the
       warehouse. Instead, all stock is issued to, delivered to, and stored by the using activity.
       The stock is inventoried based upon predetermined schedules, and requirements are
       identified depending on the replenishment method used.
       14.2.3.2. There are risks since no safety stocks are available for demand fluctuations, bad
       weather, etc. Consequently, this can also lead to excessive customer ordering/hoarding.
       Prior to implementing any form of stockless inventory policy, the MLFC should consider
       the reliability and availability requirements outlined in AFI 41-209, Chapter 3.
14.3. DMLSS warehouse level computation methods.
   14.3.1. For operating warehouse inventory, DMLSS has three methods available for the
   stock level computation method:
       14.3.1.1. Standard (STD) Leveling Algorithm.
       14.3.1.2. Days of Stock.
       14.3.1.3. Wilson EOQ.
   14.3.2. Air Force policy dictates that this option is set to ―Days of Stock.‖ The MLFC and
   materiel manager are responsible for monitoring information used for level computations so
   do not edit these settings without their approval or guidance.
   14.3.3. Level computation methods are located in the system services application on the

14.4. Factors used to compute a Days of Stock SCL. DMLSS uses a multitude of data from
each individual SOS record in order to compute SCLs for each item ID containing a level and
assigned level type code of ―Core.‖ Items coded for deletion are not calculated. DMLSS
computes a stock level based on the following factors:
   14.4.1. Daily Demand Rate (DDR) – All system computations related to the SCL rely on the
   DDR. This is the amount of stock consumed daily Table 14.2. If there are 12 months of
   history recorded, the system computes the DDR by dividing the total quantity issued during
   the 12 months by 365. If there is less than 12 months of history, DMLSS multiplies the
   number of available months by 30, then divides the resulting figure into the total quantity
   issued (For example, if there were 480 issues in three months, divide 480 by 90 to find the
   DDR).

Table 14.1. Daily Demand Rate (DDR).


 COMPUTATION
 - When 12 months of consumption is recorded – Total issues during the
 consumption period divided by 365 (see Example 1).
 - When less than 12 months of consumption is recorded – Total issues during
 consumption period divided by the number of months then multiplied by 30 (see
 Example 2).
 EXAMPLE 1:                                         EXAMPLE 2:
 1280 issues in 12 months                           480 issues in 3 months
 1280/365                                           480/90
 DDR = 3.50                                          DDR = 5.33


   14.4.2. Pipeline Time (PLT) – PLT time is the number of calendar days between the date a
   requisition is made and the date the materiel is received by medical materiel personnel.
   DMLSS computes PLT based on the document number date minus the transaction date the
   item is processed in DMLSS as being received.
       14.4.2.1. Average Pipeline Time (aPLT) – aPLT is the average number of days it takes
       for a specific item to be delivered. The aPLT for routine requisitions is computed and
       recorded as a result of processing receipts with a demand code of Recurring. DMLSS
       computes aPLT by totaling the pipeline days and dividing by the number of pipeline
       factors recorded Table 14. If sufficient factors are not recorded, the system uses the
       default average pipeline time factors of 31 days for the continental United States
       (CONUS), 70 days for overseas.

Table 14.2. Average Pipeline Time (PLT).


 COMPUTATION
 Sum of pipeline times divided by the number of pipeline times. NOTE: The number
 of pipeline times used is based on the dollar value of annual sales.
 EXAMPLE 1:
 462                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


 If item annual sales is less than $99.99 with pipeline times of 49 and 51 days.
 49 + 51 = 100/2
 PLT = 50 days

 EXAMPLE 2:
 If item annual sales is greater than $2,500.00 with pipeline times of 17, 15, 12, 17,
 11 and 18 days.
 17 + 15 + 12 + 17 + 11 + 18 = 90/6
 PLT = 15 days


       14.4.2.2. Pipeline time can be distorted if we fail to process receipts immediately or
       delay processing due-ins in DMLSS. See Chapter 5, paragraph 5.16.2.2.1.2. Overseas
       accounts must be especially cautious to avoid using abnormal pipeline times from
       unusual methods of shipment.
   14.4.3. Operating Level (Days) – Identifies the desired days of stock that should be
   maintained for normal daily operations. When the Operating (OPR) Level Days is multiplied
   by the daily demand rate it produces the EOQ. EOQ is the amount of stock deemed
   economically prudent to requisition, based on consumption history and item cost. The EOQ
   does not include Safety Level Days. Default operating level days are based on annual sales
   and the number of months of issue history. The information used to compute levels for items
   from a specific SOS can be found in the SOS Environment tab (see paragraph 14.6.2.).
   14.4.4. Safety Level Days – Identifies the desired days of stock that should be maintained if
   OPR stock is exhausted. The safety level for an item is determined by multiplying the daily
   demand rate times the safety level factor. To arrive at a quantity, multiply the safety level
   days times the DDR. The Safety Level Quantity is the number of days of stock that we want
   to keep in operating inventory to allow for fluctuations in demand and pipeline time. Default
   safety level days are based on annual sales and the number of months of issue history (see
   paragraph 14.6.2.).
   14.4.5. History Begin Date (HBD) – The HBD occurs when the first recurring issue of an
   item is recorded. Since other factors used to compute a stock control level are based on the
   months of history accumulated, an accurate HBD is important. DMLSS records up to 24
   months of issue history.
   14.4.6. Dollar Value of Annual Sales ($VS). Annual sales are used to compute the operating
   and safety level days. See Table 14.3.

Table 14.3. Dollar Value of Annual Sales.


 COMPUTATION
 DDR X 365 days X unit price
 EXAMPLE 1:
 An item has 480 issues in 3 months and the unit price is $0.60.
 (480/90) X 365 X $0.60
 $VS = $1167.27 (Annual sales category $1,000 - $2,499.99.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             463



 EXAMPLE 2:
 Same as the preceding example, except the unit price is $0.06.
 (480/90) X 365 X $0.06
 $VS = $116.73 (Annual sales category $100.00 - $499.99.


   14.4.7. Stock Control Level (SCL). The following stock control level computation Table
   14.4 is based on assignment of Days of Stock level computation method (AF policy) (see
   sample computations in Tables 14.2.and 14.3.). These examples also use the system defaults
   as outlined in the Environment Table in Figure 14.2. Each SOS contains an Environment
   Tab; therefore the OPR and Safety levels assigned are unique to each SOS.

Table 14.4. Stock Control Level (SCL).


 COMPUTATION
 (operating level days + safety level days + PLT days) X DDR
 EXAMPLE 1:
 An item with a DDR of 2 based on 12 months issue consumption, an average
 pipeline time of 28 days, and annual sales greater than $2,500.00.
 (14 + 10 + 28) X 2
 SCL = 104

 EXAMPLE 2:
 Same as the preceding example, except 6 months issue consumption and a dollar
 value less than $99.99.
 (42 + 7 + 28) X 2
 SCL = 154


   14.4.8. Reorder Point - While not part of the stock control level, the system computes a
   reorder point and uses it to determine when requisitioning action should occur. Generally,
   the reorder point is the pipeline time and safety level total Table 14.5.

Table 14.5. Reorder Point Percentage (ROP) and Reorder Point Quantity (ROQ).


 COMPUTATION




 EXAMPLE 1:
 An item has an average pipeline time of 32 days, 9 months issue consumption, and
 annual sales less than $99.99.
 464                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


 (32 + 7) / (32 + 42 + 7) = (39 / 81) X 100
 ROP = 48.14 % = 48% (rounded)

 EXAMPLE 2:
 The system uses the reorder point percentage and stock control level to compute the
 ROQ.
 Stock Control Level = 57; 48% of 57 = 27 ROQ (rounded)


       14.4.8.1. Re-Order Point (ROP) Percentage – A percentage point, based on the stock
       level, in which an item should be replenished to avoid stock exhaustion.
       14.4.8.2. Reorder Point Quantity (ROQ) – A quantity point, based on the stock level, in
       which an item should be replenished to avoid stock exhaustion.
14.5. DMLSS automates EOQ computation and ordering. Reliable supply sources should
allow the safety level and EOQ factors to be lowered from the initial defaults for a specific
supply source. Modifying and reviewing the inventory control method used is an ongoing
process. Regardless of inventory objectives and published goals, the MLFC will ensure the
medical mission is not compromised by an overly aggressive inventory control policy.
Variations in stock control levels may be necessary for certain items and under the conditions
outlined in AFI 41-209, Chapter 3.
14.6. DMLSS Level Computation Environment Factors. Users can establish and/or edit the
default level computation environment factors from the following modules. Manipulation of
these factors affects the SCL outcome.
   14.6.1. TMU Environment Table (Figure 14.2). This table holds the (default) leveling
   values that are used to initially fill each SOS Environment Tab. Specifically, it displays
   seven requirement codes based on annual sales. Nonmedical and repair parts are assigned
   their own category. The table also shows the operating (normal operating level or quantity
   on hand) and safety levels (minimum quantity of the item that should be kept on hand for
   necessities) for each different category by quantity issue history as follows:

Figure 14.2. TMU Environmental Table.




       14.6.1.1. Less than 3 months—short history
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 465


      14.6.1.2. 3 to 9 months—intermediate history
      14.6.1.3. 10 months or more—long history
      14.6.1.4. To access this table, go into the SS application and click on the TMU button on
      the horizontal toolbar or select Table Maintenance Utility from the Navigate menu.
      Users can only view tables in TMU if they have user privileges assigned to their User ID.
      14.6.1.5. Changes to this table affect the default values that are loaded into a new SOS
      Environment tab. CONUS and overseas accounts should carefully analyze these values
      based on their supply pipeline and whether or not they need to hold more stock.
   14.6.2. Inventory Management (IM) SOS Environment tab. In the SOS Environment tab see
   Figure 14.3, users can add and/or edit the environment factors that are used to compute levels
   for items from a specific SOS. For example, you may want to establish specific operating
   and safety level days for your pharmaceutical or medical/surgical prime vendor.

Figure 14.3. Inventory Management (IM) SOS Environment Tab (example).




      14.6.2.1. To access the SOS record, go into the IM application and from the Navigate
      menu, select Search SOS. In the SOS Type field, click ―Select‖ and choose the desired
      SOS. From the SOS Detail, click on the Environment tab to view the default operating
      and safety level factors for the SOS. The table is similar to the TMU Environment Table
      explained in paragraph 14.6.1.
      14.6.2.2. Carefully analyze these values and determine the appropriate values based on
      the supply pipeline for each SOS. In each of these categories, users may enter different
      operating and safety levels. Remember; do not adjust these factors without the approval
      of the MLFC or materiel manager.

   14.6.3. IM MTF Catalog, Log Cat tab Figure 14.4. In the IM application, users can change
   the computation method for an individual item. If you‘ll recall, in DMLSS, you can choose
   between three types of levels:

Figure 14.4. MTF Catalog, Log Cat Tab.




       14.6.3.1. Static—the user maintains the level. This option is set on new items. After 90
       days of consumption, the system will provide recommended level changes. Also,
       managers my use this level type to compensate for seasonal or other operational
       fluctuations.
       14.6.3.2. Core—computer controlled. This level type should constitute the majority of
       inventory records.
       14.6.3.3. Stockless—items with a recurring demand that are managed at the using
       activity location.
       14.6.3.4. To edit the computation method for an item, conduct a search for the catalog
       item you want to edit. In the Navigate menu, select Catalog Search. In the Catalog
       Search window, select the MTF Catalog scope and conduct a Generic Search. DMLSS
       will display the results of the search in the Search Summary Result tab. Select the
       catalog record and click the Detail button on the vertical toolbar. In the MTF Catalog –
       Supply window, click the Log Cat tab and then click on the Leveling button at the lower
       right hand side of the screen. This will display the IM Log – Leveling window.
       14.6.3.5. In this window, select and/or edit the level computation factors such as
       estimated monthly usage, level type, computation method, pipeline days and monthly
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   467


      demand quantities for the current fiscal year. There must be at least three months of data
      to calculate the level and reorder point (ROP) if you change the computation method.
      Remember; do not adjust these factors without the approval of the MLFC or materiel
      manager.
14.7. IM recommended level changes.
   14.7.1. DMLSS conducts automatic leveling during the end-of-month (EOM) processing and
   makes recommendations for level changes based on consumption history.             The
   recommendations are posted as an ―IM Recommended Level Changes‖ pending action
   message in the Inbox. DMLSS groups and displays recommended level changes into the
   following three categories and sequence:
      14.7.1.1. Core items with a recommended level of zero. Validate demand and delete
      level if indicated.
      14.7.1.2. Nonstocked items with a recommended level. Validate 90 days of consistent
      demand, activity storage capacity and number of users and create level if indicated.
      14.7.1.3. Static items with a recommended level change. Review after 6 months.
      Validate the items usage. If the consumption merits a change of the level type, establish
      a level and change to core.
   14.7.2. To access this report, double-click on the pending action in the Inbox or click the
   ―Jump To‖ button at the bottom of the window. DMLSS will then display the IM
   Recommended Level Changes window. In this window, users can perform the following
   tasks:
      14.7.2.1. Accept a recommended level change: Select the recommended level change(s)
      that you want to accept. Caution: Avoid clicking ―Select All‖ followed by the ―Accept‖
      button. It most likely will create an erroneous management decision to accept all of the
      recommended level changes at the same time. The Select All option is non-reversible,
      immediately applies all suggested levels, and potentially produces a drastic affect on the
      number of log orders.
      14.7.2.2. Edit a recommended level change: Select the recommended level change(s) that
      you want to edit and click ―Edit.‖ In the Edit window, enter the new suggested ROP,
      Level, and/or Type and click OK.
      14.7.2.3. Include/exclude stockless item(s) in the list of recommended level changes:
      Click the Incl Stock or Excl Stock from the vertical toolbar. Only one of these buttons is
      available at any time. For example, if the list already includes stockless items, the Excl
      Stock button is available. If a user clicks it to exclude stockless items, the button becomes
      the Incl Stock button.
      14.7.2.4. Reject a recommended level change: Select the recommended level change(s)
      that you want to reject or click ―Select All‖ and click ―Delete.‖Click ―Yes‖ in response to
      the confirmation message. Warning: Do not remove the message until all actions are
      complete. If a user deletes this pending action, it is deleted for all users.
14.8. Improving Inventory Control Effectiveness.
 468                                                    AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   14.8.1. Preliminary Work. Before any stock leveling takes place, managers should ensure
   daily pending actions and reports are worked. This helps prevent potential problems and sets
   up a sound foundation for managing stock. Specific pending actions are:
       14.8.1.1. IM Status Edits Report. Launch this pending action to correct errors, identify
       transactions held for further processing, and transactions that were processed in DMLSS.
       14.8.1.2. IM Troubled Due-In Report. Use this list to follow-up on potential problem
       requirements.
   14.8.2. Measure and analyze current data. Use a variety of standard reports, adhoc (Business
   Objects) reporting, and historical data to evaluate and gauge stock variances. Two examples
   of IM standard reports are:
       14.8.2.1. Zero Balance Stocked Items. This report lists every stocked item that is
       currently at zero balance, grouped by supplier. Aggressive action should be taken to
       resolve these stock outages.
       14.8.2.2. Supplier Performance Report. This report identifies by supplier the estimated
       lead days, actual lead days, number of receipts, number of items cataloged, dollar value
       on hand, total value of sales, and turnover rate for the selected time period.
       14.8.2.3. Use a variety of standard and BO reports to record and evaluate various
       inventory measurements such as: excess, dead inventory, levels with no consumption,
       static levels, zero balances with a level, aPLT, average customer wait time (aCWT), sell
       through rate, inventory turns, etc.
   14.8.3. Set Goals and Develop a Plan. In addition to an overall goal of balancing customer
   needs with a judicious use of resources, managers can set specific goals such as reducing out-
   of-stocks, workload, or minimizing inventory costs. Before making changes to SOS
   environment settings managers should understand how the stock control level works and test
   planned changes using BusinessObjects or a tutorial database so the outcome will not be a
   surprise. Example: If a SOS is changed on an item, the level may also be adjusted based on
   the environment settings of the new SOS.
   14.8.4. Make Incremental Changes. Use caution when editing the level computation
   environment factors. Drastic changes can bring unwanted surprises. Use the aPLT from
   DMLSS as a gauge for setting operating level (EOQ) days and safety level/safety factor (SF)
   days. A higher aPLT dictates higher EOQ/SF numbers, and a larger gap between EOQ and
   SF results in fewer orders.
   14.8.5. Measure effectiveness. Validate the changes by continuing to record and evaluate
   the various inventory measurements mentioned in paragraph 14.8.2.3. If the changes
   increase stock, review demand consistency, warehouse space and dated item management,
   excess and dead stock.

Section 14B—Managing Customer Inventory - Leveling

14.9. Customer Inventory. Medical Logistics seeks to provide complete support to MTF
customers by developing a proactive logistics function responsive to each of their needs. This
support should include the management of inventory within the customer area. Managing the
customer‘s inventory includes: set-up of their storage area, selecting the best replenishment
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 469


method, managing customer levels, and of course—processing stock replenishment, receiving
and delivering their supplies. This entire process allows for the rapid identification of
requirement for assets stored in each using activity.
   14.9.1. Service/Customer Inventory Control.
       14.9.1.1. Each medical using activity is authorized the minimum stocks of recurring
       demand consumable and durable supplies needed for continuity of operations until
       replacement items can be obtained. The actual stock level of each item is based upon its
       average usage and resupply frequency.
       14.9.1.2. Like warehouse operating stock, the computation method should always be set
       to Days of Stock for each customer. This method calculates customer levels based on
       the number of days of desired stock and the frequency of stocking. Both of these values
       are required in the Service/Customer Detail, Materiel tab when the days of stock option is
       selected. Chapter 4, paragraph 4.8.1.2.1. explains these entries; however, these numbers
       should be adjusted depending on the size / function of your MTF and delivery timeframes
       (i.e. day clinics, 24-hr clinics, etc). The days and inventory defaults are set to 7 and 3
       days respectively.
   14.9.2. The CAIM application provides the capability to manage customer area stock items
   by establishing stock levels.
14.10. New Item Inventory Control. AFI 41-209, Chapter 3, states inventory policy regarding
new items.
   14.10.1. Adding an Item to the Customer Catalog. CAIM customer catalogs are the
   foundation of the order life cycle; therefore, the accuracy of each record is crucial when it
   comes to order placement.
       14.10.1.1. Once the MTF catalog search is performed, select the desired item and click
       the ―Add Cust‖ icon on the vertical toolbar. Make changes on the Customer Catalog
       Detail – (New) screen and click the Save button.
       14.10.1.2. A location frame appears at the bottom of the detail window. The Add/ Edit
       buttons located at the bottom of the window are used to access the Item Location Detail
       window Figure 14.5. This window is also used to update the Estimated Monthly Usage
       field, location, and the level type.

Figure 14.5. Item Location Detail Window.
 470                                                        AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   14.10.2. Location Field. The location field is used to identify where the item is stored in the
   customers section. This is necessary because the customer may stock the item in several
   locations.
   14.10.3. Estimated Monthly Usage. When the item is new, there is no consumption data
   available and that is when the estimated monthly usage is used. The estimated monthly
   usage field is used to set the level and reorder point (ROP) when there is less than 3 month of
   issue consumption. The customer‘s level and ROP does not affect the Medical Logistics
   warehouse level and ROP for operating inventory. AFI 41-209, Chapter 3, describes how
   new item leveling is determined, as follows.
          14.10.3.1. The static level of new items should not normally exceed what is required to
          cover pipeline time plus one month‗s projected usage. The initial quantity backordered to
          the requesting activity should be no more than the projected customer catalog level. In
          the short term, closely control the initial issue of the new item to ensure accurate
          consumption history.
          14.10.3.2. Once a new item has consumption recorded in two separate months and three
          months have elapsed since the initial issue, DMLSS will suggest the static level in the
          stock control level be removed. Prior to removing the static level code, view the recorded
          consumption history to determine if realistic issue history has been recorded. If it appears
          that unrealistic issue history has been recorded, make appropriate adjustments and/or
          leave the static level code intact.
   14.10.4. Level Type. The Level Type is used to determine how the level is maintained.
   Table 14.6. explains what each of the different level types are and how they are used.

Table 14.6. Level Types.


 Level                                            Description
 Type
 Core           When using the core level type, the level is automatically adjusted monthly
                by CAIM using demand history (3+ months). Initially, managers can set their
                own levels with the core level type. An easy way to do this is to enter the
                estimated monthly usage. As a result, the level and ROP (reorder point) is
                calculated for you.
 Static         The level is not adjusted automatically and is independent of demand history.
                The user must set the level with this option.
 Non-           The level is 0. The customer orders the item as needed. No estimated on-hand
 Stocked        balance is maintained.


14.11. Replenishment Methods. The Replenishment Inventory module in the CAIM
application Figure 14.6 provides methods to reduce inventory time and increase inventory
accuracy. Chapter 6, paragraph 6.9. provides an explanation of this module. In addition, Medical
Logistics uses the following Personal Data Assistant (PDA) and CAIM replenishment
procedures for use in a forward logistics location.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               471


Figure 14.6. CAIM Replenishment Inventory Module.




   14.11.1. PDA Replenishment.         The PDA replenishment method may be conducted in
   Batch, Radio Frequency (RF) mode, or Store & Forward Mode. In order to conduct PDA
   inventories and replenishments; the customer needs to have all the items they wish to stock
   on their shelves in their Customer Catalog. PDA replenishment methods rely on two types of
   labels, the Shelf Bar Code Label (SBCL) and the Header Bar Code Label (HBL).
      14.11.1.1. PDA Batch Mode. Batch mode allows information to be transferred between
      the PDA and PC using a docking port. Users dock the PDA and transfer the scanned data
      via ActiveSync (Windows XP) or Window Mobile Device Center (Window
      Vista/Windows 7) to their PC. Each Hand Held Terminal (HHT) contains the DMLSS
      RFID application in its list of programs. Access to DMLSS RFID requires a username
      and password. The password that is used in batch mode is ―batch.‖ Select the Batch
      button on the DMLSS RFID login screen.
      14.11.1.2. PDA Radio Frequency (RF) mode. PDA‘s used in the RF mode, receive and
      transmit data in real time to the DMLSS CAIM application once replenishment is
      performed.      A smart card reader is used to allow Public Key Infrastructure
      (PKI)/Common Access Card (CAC) interface with the PDA/HHT. Presently, a DMLSS
      RFID password is required when using the PDA in the RF Mode and must be only 15
      characters in length. Longer passwords are truncated through the encryption process.
      14.11.1.3. Store and Forward Mode. This process is uses a combination of batch and RF
      modes. It allows the user to scan multiple customer areas without having to place the
      PDA in a docking station and download each order individually. In Store and Forward
      mode, the user may scan shelf bar code labels in batch mode, and then send the file in RF
      mode.
      14.11.1.4. Inventory Methods.       When a customer is established in DMLSS, an
      inventory method is also assigned. An inventory method tells DMLSS how to perform
      the inventory. There are three methods used to inventory the customer‘s shelves: Order
      Quantity, Empty Shelf, and Shelf count Table 14.7.

Table 14.7. CAIM Replenishment Inventory Method.
472                                                      AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


Inventory
Method                                          Description

Order          When an order quantity customer performs replenishment, the customer
quantity       enters the quantity that he or she wants into the personal data assistant
               (PDA). No calculations are performed; the system orders exactly what the
               customer has entered.
Empty          Very few CAIM customers select the empty shelf method. When the
shelf          customer performs empty shelf replenishment, he or she does not enter a
               quantity into the PDA. The system assumes zero balance in the location and
               orders up to the location level.
Shelf count    When the customer performs shelf count replenishment, he or she must
               count the items on the shelf, enter the quantity into the PDA, and the system
               orders the difference between the on-hand balance minus the authorized
               level minus the due-in and due-out quantities.


           14.11.1.4.1. Order Quantity is the default for all new customers that are created in the
           DMLSS system.
           14.11.1.4.2. The inventory method used for each customer is identified on the HBCL
           and is set in the System Services application of DMLSS using the Service Customer
           Detail Record-Materiel tab Figure 14.7. You will print HBL‘s and SBCL‘s for each
           customer to place on their shelves. The HBL is placed close to the storage area where
           it can be identified and accessed easily. Each SBCL is placed on the shelf, so the
           supply item you are scanning is identified. Once the labels are in place, one of the
           various PDA replenishment methods can be used. Note: Failure to print and properly
           post bar code changes may result in user orders rejecting prior to being passed to
           medical logistics.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                473

      14.11.1.5. Once the upload is complete, the PDA clears the data and performs a
      validation process. A Replenishment Exception pending action is sent to the customer‘s
      inbox to inform them of records that contained errors. Note: It is important to have the
      necessary user roles, resources, and pending actions assigned to manage the entire
      replenishment process.
   14.11.2. Manual Replenishment Process. If neither the Batch nor RF PDA replenishment
   process‘s are available, a manual replenishment is performed. Manual replenishments may be
   placed by customers who have access to the CAIM application and enter their order into
   DMLSS. Users can enter a single item ID, storage area or bar code number to replenish one
   item or select an item type and location to replenish a specific location. Customers have the
   following item types to choose from; non-stocked, stocked, all, core, and static. To view all
   items in the customer catalog select ALL. After entering the search information, click
   SEARCH on the vertical toolbar. Customers may want to print a Customer Catalog of active
   records prior to data entry into CAIM. See Chapter 6, paragraph 6.9.5 for additional manual
   replenishment procedures.
   14.11.3. CAIM Recommended Level Changes Pending Action. DMLSS performs a
   releveling process for all customer areas during the monthly EOP cycle. The system
   calculates a recommended level for non-stocked and static items. If the system determines
   that a core item‘s level should change, the system automatically adjusts the level. See
   Attachment 6, CAIM Pending Actions.
   14.11.4. CAIM Utilities, Adjust Periodic Automatic Resupply (PAR) Levels. PAR levels in
   CAIM represent the customer‘s storeroom levels. DMLSS generates recommended level
   changes as a result of processing recurring orders.    Access the Recommended Level
   Changes window by selecting ―Adjust PAR Levels‖ from the CAIM Utilities menu.
   Customer records are also posted to the CAIM Recommended Level Changes pending action

  after the item obtains 90 days of transaction history. See Chapter 6, paragraph 6.23.3 for
  additional procedures on adjusting PAR levels. Note: Users should have access to pending
  actions within CAIM in order to effectively manage these levels.

      DMLSS MTF/ORG–SERVICE AND LOGISTICS DEPARTMENT DETAILS

A2.1. Service Detail Records. Your existing organization and service detail records were
converted from the Military Service legacy system during the DMLSS installation. Use
TreeView or Search to view or edit information specific to the MM, EM, MA, and FM Service
Detail records. To ensure the integrity of the organizational structure, privileges (create, update,
and delete) should be tightly controlled. However, read only access is encouraged for all logistics
users to facilitate better understanding of the organizational structure modules.
   A2.1.1. Primary Support Activities. Service detail records (MM, EM, MA and FM) provide
   the necessary background data that equates to the primary support activities that must be
   selected when a new Org is created in the MTF/Unit (ORG) Detail (New) window (Figure
   A2.1).

Figure A2.1. MTF/Unit (ORG) Detail (New) – Basic Tab Window.




A2.2. MM Service Detail. Only one MM Service is authorized per DMLSS application. It was
established on the DMLSS system during implementation at your site and may not be deleted.
The MM Service identifies the MM Management Service and is always associated to the LOG
MTF/Unit. This window is audited by the system. Settings on this record, especially the
Appropriation Data tab (described below), critically impact the way the Log Department and Log
Fund manage orders and allocate funds.
   A2.2.1. In the MM Service Detail window, you can open and edit MM (Materiel) service
   information. To access the MM Service detail record using the search function, select ―MM –
   Materiel Mgt‖ in the ―type‖ field and click the Search button. Once retrieved, either double-
   click the MM Service record or highlight the record and click on the Detail button. A link to
   the MM Service is also available in the Basic tab of the LOG detail record. The MM Service
   detail record is segmented into the Basic, Appropriation Data, and Computation tabs. Each
   tab contains some mandatory data fields, but not all fields require data input.

   A2.2.2. MM Service Basic Tab (Figure A2.2). These data fields are present in the basic tab
   and should be utilized as described:

Figure A2.2. MM Service Detail – Basic Tab Window.




       A2.2.2.1. MM SVC ID – This is a mandatory field and it should always equal the LOG
       DEPT DODAAC. Do not change this field without proper authorization and
       documentation.
       A2.2.2.2. Name –      Mandatory    field   should always   equal ―Medical    Materiel
       Management.‖
       A2.2.2.3. Military Service – Defaults to ―Air Force.‖
       A2.2.2.4. Major COM – Although identified as an optional field; materiel managers
       should load their corresponding Major Command (MAJCOM) code. (i.e. MAJCOM
       code ―1L‖ identifies AMC bases)
       A2.2.2.5. Hub – Hub and spoke is an AF capability allowing one stock fund account to
       place orders for another stock fund account. When checked, this box MM indicates the
       MM Service is Spoke enabled.
       A2.2.2.6. MOF – Master Ordering Facility. This functionality is under development to
       allow selected accounts the ability to order from multiple PVs/SOSs.
       A2.2.2.7. Office Symbol – Optional field used to document the MM Service office
       symbol.
       A2.2.2.8. Marked for Deletion – This box indicates whether the record has been marked
       for deletion.
       A2.2.2.9. Local Use –The local use fields allow you to enter data which can later be
       accessed using BusinessObjects software.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                487


     A2.2.2.10. Related items – This button opens the Related MTF/Units List window where
     you can view or print the list of MTF/units associated with the service.
     A2.2.2.11. Supplementary Address/Bill to DODAAC – Load your support DFAS
     DODAAC into this field. When loaded, this DODAAC prints to all DD Form 1155s,
     Order for Supplies or Services, in the block 15 code field. This data is required for entry
     into Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).
     A2.2.2.12. Location Indicator – This checkbox identifies whether or not the MM Service
     Default location is used.
     A2.2.2.13. Reachback Enabled – This indicator identifies whether or not the logistics
     account provides Reachback services. It should only be checked if officially tasked by
     AFMOA/SGAL.
     A2.2.2.14. IM Location Cleanup – Should always be checked. Indicates that locations
     codes will be deleted during the next EOD process when balances are zero.
     A2.2.2.15. Summary Receipt By-Pass – Not used.
     A2.2.2.16. Auto Generate Delivery List – Should always be checked. When checked,
     DMLSS automatically generates a delivery list as part of processing a receipt or
     confirming a picklist.
     A2.2.2.17. AM Location Delete Indicator – Should always be checked. When checked,
     this indicates that AM locations are deleted when the on-hand (OH) quantity drops to
     zero. This action does not affect allowances.
     A2.2.2.18. Max Follow-Up Days – Identifies the maximum number of days before
     follow-up transactions are sent to a supplier.
     A2.2.2.19. Default Location – Identifies the default storage location within the MM
     Service. (i.e. the Warehouse)
     A2.2.2.20. Passing Action DODAAC – For Army use only.
     A2.2.2.21. Surcharge – Identifies the current FY surcharge rate. The surcharge rate
     could change annually and is provided to all sites via AFMOA/SGAL prior to each
     EOFY.
     A2.2.2.22. Discount – The discount field is essentially a ―negative surcharge‖ rate,
     allowing the billed price to be less than the advertised U/P price.
     A2.2.2.23. PV Region – Defaults to local DODAAC.
     A2.2.2.24. Routing Identifier Code (RIC) – RICs are assigned for processing inter/intra
     service/agency transactions. This is a mandatory field that identifies the RIC assigned to
     the MM Service (logistics DEPT). Do not change the RIC without proper authorization
     and documentation.
     A2.2.2.25. Force Activity Designator (FAD) – This is a mandatory field that identifies

Figure A2.4. MM Service Detail – Computations Tab Window.




       A2.2.4.1. Major Receipt Price Change – System defaults to 25%. Use this field to
       specify what percentage represents a "significant" difference between an order price and
       receipt price for an item. When an IM user processes a receipt and the receipt price is
       significantly different (i.e. 25% change) than the order price, a message is written to the
       IM Receipt Major Price Change pending action for review.
       A2.2.4.2. Level Computation Method – Should always be ―Days of Stock.‖

       A2.2.4.8. Stocking Level Algorithm Defaults.
       A2.2.4.9. Maximum Reorder Quantity (MRQ) Factors – Not recommended for AF use.
A2.3. EM Service Detail. Only one EM Service is authorized per DMLSS application. It was
established on the DMLSS system during implementation at your site and may not be deleted.
The EM Service identifies the Medical Equipment Management Office (MEMO) and is always
associated to the LOG MTF/Unit. This window is audited by the system.
   A2.3.1. To access the EM Service Detail record (Figure A2.5.) using the search function,
   select ―EM –Equipment Mgt‖ in the Type field and click the ―Search‖ button. Once
   retrieved, either double-click the EM Service record or highlight the record and click on the
   ―Detail‖ button. A link to the EM Service is also available in the Basic tab of the LOG detail
   record.

Figure A2.5. EM Service Detail Window.




   A2.3.2. The EM Service Detail record contains several data fields; most of which should
   never be changed unless directed by higher authority. A few of these fields are explained
   below.
      A2.3.2.1. EM SVC ID – Should always equal the LOG DODAAC. Do not change
      unless directed to do so by a higher authority.
      A2.3.2.2. Name – Should always be ―Medical Equipment Management Office.‖
      A2.3.2.3. Major COM - Optional field; however, materiel managers should load their
      corresponding MAJCOM code. (i.e. MAJCOM code ―1L‖ identifies AMC bases)
      A2.3.2.4. Office Symbol - Optional field used to document the EM Service office
      symbol.
      A2.3.2.5. Mark for Delete – Do not mark the EM Service for deletion unless it is being
      replaced with a new EM Service record. This action will be directed by a higher
      authority.
      A2.3.2.6. SVC/CUST Associations:      Reference Chapter 9 for further explanation of
      these accounts.
      A2.3.2.7. Excess – You can use the Excess field in this window to specify the customer
      that serves as the Excess account. Then, in EM, you can process excess records by
      transferring items to this Excess customer. The EM Service must be associated to a
      SVC/CUST record identified as the MEMO Excess account before equipment items can
      be transferred and reported excess.
      A2.3.2.8. Loaner - The EM Service must be associated to a SVC/CUST record identified
      as the MEMO Loan account before equipment items can be coded as on-loan.
      A2.3.2.9. Hold - The EM Service must be associated to a SVC/CUST record identified
      as the MEMO Hold account prior to transferring equipment items to ‗hold‘ status.
 492                                                   AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


       A2.3.2.10. POC – Associate the POC record for the MEMO. Within the POC detail
       record, this user should be associated to the POC type of ―EM Service‖ (reference
       paragraph 4.16.).
       A2.3.2.11. Related Items: Unit button. This button opens the Related MTF/Units List
       window where you can view or print the list of MTF/units associated with the service.
A2.4. MA Service Detail. A Maintenance Activity (MA) provides maintenance services for
equipment owned by organizations and customers and can be both a provider and a user of
services in the DMLSS organization. As a service provider, it uses the following DMLSS
modules: equipment, work orders, manufacturer, and procedures. It also requires the use of the
Customer Area Inventory Management (CAIM) module to maintain and inventory of repair
parts. In this role, it becomes a CAIM user and a customer of the Medical Materiel (MM)
service.
   A2.4.1. The default MA service was established on the DMLSS system during
   implementation at your site and may not be deleted, but multiple MAs can be loaded within a
   single application. MAs may exist in the host MTF, as well as supported organizations, so
   they may or may not belong to the Logistics Activity. In addition, there may be one or more
   maintenance activities in each organization.
   A2.4.2. The MA Service(s), (usually xx5761), identifies the MEMO(s) responsible for the
   supporting ORG(s) such as LOG. Note: Within User Privilege Assignment (UP Assign),
   DMLSS users can be assigned to only one MA at a time; meaning, maintenance personnel
   can only access maintenance records for the MA associated to their user ID.
   A2.4.3. Accessing an Existing MA Service record. To access the MA Service Detail record
   using the search function, select ―MA –―Maintenance Act‖ in the Type field and click the
   ―Search‖ button. Once retrieved, either double-click the MA Service record or highlight the
   record and click on the ―Detail‖ button. A link to the MA Service is also available in the
   Basic tab of the LOG detail record. The MA Detail Record contains three tabs: Basic,
   Materiel, and Funding tabs. These windows are audited by the system.
       A2.4.3.1. Basic Tab (Figure A2.6.). Most of the information in this tab will never
       require an update, but a few are explained below.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               493


Figure A2.6. MA Service/Customer Detail Window – Basic Tab.




         A2.4.3.1.1. MA SVC ID – Identifies the maintenance activity‘s SVC/CUST account
         number. This field should not be modified unless directed to do so by a higher
         authority. Most AF MAs are associated to xx5761.
         A2.4.3.1.2. Name – The name should be ―Medical Equipment Repair Center.‖
         A2.4.3.1.3. Military Service – Defaults to ―Air Force‖, never change this data.
         A2.4.3.1.4. Major COM – Although this is an optional field; materiel managers
         should load their corresponding MAJCOM code. (i.e. MAJCOM code ―1L‖
         identifies AMC bases).
         A2.4.3.1.5. Office Symbol - Optional field used to document the MA Service office
         symbol.
         A2.4.3.1.6. MEPRS Code – Optional field. This code is assigned by the local
         resource advisor and is used to track expenses associated to the MA.
         A2.4.3.1.7. Mark for Deletion - Do not mark the MA Service for deletion unless it is
         being replaced with a new MA Service record. This action will be directed by a
         higher authority.
         A2.4.3.1.8. Labor Rate – Mandatory field. The labor rate is determined by
         AFMOA/SGAL and is used to calculate labor costs associated to maintaining
         equipment. The labor rate is recalculated annually and published prior to the
         beginning of each new FY.
         A2.4.3.1.9. Delivery Location – Identifies the MA delivery location for equipment
         items.
         A2.4.3.1.10. Issue Document – Should always be ―Pick List.‖
         A2.4.3.1.11. DCM Printer – Identifies the primary DCM printer for MA forms and
         issue documents.
 494                                                     AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


          A2.4.3.1.12. POC - Associate the POC record for the Medical Maintenance
          Management Officer. Within the POC detail record, this user should be associated to
          the POC type of ―Maintenance Staff‖ (reference paragraph 4.16.).
       A2.4.3.2. Materiel Tab. The MA Service/Customer Detail window - Materiel tab is used
       to manage critical ordering information. The default data in the Materiel tab should be
       accepted with the exception of the default location. In the default location field, identify
       the MA‘s building and/or room location. Do not check the Verify Receipts indicator. If
       checked, maintenance personnel will have to manually verify and process customer
       receipts in CAIM.
       A2.4.3.3. Funding Tab. The MA contains a Funding tab because it doubles as a
       SVC/CUST record for the maintenance account. This tab allows the SA to create or
       change the expense center target and set the maximum order limit, as well manage
       expense center associations. The MA must be associated to an expense and project center
       before maintenance personnel can order supplies and repair parts. Use the data fields as
       described below.
          A2.4.3.3.1. Target Flag – Should always be ―Proj EOR.‖
          A2.4.3.3.2. Detailed Billing Req‘d – For use with authorized CAIM SOS accounts;
          however, it is not recommended for use.
          A2.4.3.3.3. Maximum Order Limit - For use with authorized CAIM SOS accounts;
          however, it is not recommended for use.
          A2.4.3.3.4. Associate Expense Centers – Refer to paragraph 4.11.
          A2.4.3.3.5. Default Expense Center – Refer to paragraph 4.11.
   A2.4.4. Creating a New MA Service.
       A2.4.4.1. The New MA function is located in the LOG MTF/ORG detail record. Using
       the Search function, select ―ORG – Med Facility/MTF‖ in the Type field and click the
       ―Search‖ button. Once results are retrieved, either double-click the LOG record or
       highlight the record and click on the ―Detail‖ button. Next, click on the ―New MA‖
       button located on the vertical toolbar. The MA detail record contains three tabs: Basic,
       Materiel, and Funding tabs.
       A2.4.4.2. A window appears requiring the new MA to be associated to a DEPT. Once
       associated, complete the Basic, Materiel, and Funding tabs as explained above.
       A2.4.4.3. DMLSS users can only be assigned to one MA at a time. Therefore,
       maintenance personnel can only access maintenance records for the MA associated to
       their user ID. Maintenance managers are only able to see maintenance reports for the
       MA assigned to their user ID and will not have a complete view of work throughout all
       MA activities. These limitations should be considered prior to using multiple MAs.
A2.5. FM Service Detail.
   A2.5.1. In the FM Service Detail window, you can open and edit FM service information.
   The FM service was established on the DMLSS system during implementation at your site
   and may not be deleted; however, multiple FMs can be loaded within a single application.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              495


   The FM Service(s) identifies the FM Office(s) responsible for supporting the ORG(s) such as
   LOG.
   A2.5.2. New FM service records are created in the FM module and should be accomplished
   by the facility manager or Medical Logistics Flight Commander. Select ―MTF Information‖
   from the FM Navigate dropdown menu and the click the ―New‖ button located on the
   vertical toolbar in the MTF Information window. Complete the mandatory data fields and as
   many optional data fields as possible. Click ―Save‖ before exiting. This window is audited
   by the system.
   A2.5.3. Unlike MA service accounts, DMLSS users may be associated to multiple FM
   activities at the same time. Therefore, FM personnel can access records for all FM service
   accounts associated to their user ID.
A2.6. LOG DEPT. Only one LOG DEPT is permitted for each DMLSS application. The sole
LOG DEPT was established during implementation at your site and may not be deleted. The
data contained in the Logistics Department Detail (Figure A2.7.) is critical for ordering and
contains informative data such as the LOG ID, name, and office symbol; materiel and services
currency types; conversion factors; LOGs associated FOA; the LOG POC and associated LOG
service accounts.

Figure A2.7. Logistics Department Detail Window.




   A2.6.1. While most of the LOG DEPT data fields are editable, they should not be changed
   without proper approval and documentation. Do not mark the LOG DEPT for deletion
   unless being replaced by a new LOG DEPT. This window is one of those audited by the
   system.

                    DMLSS USER PRIVILEGE ROLE MANAGEMENT

Table A3.1. DMLSS User Role Management.


In the User Privilege module (UP Assign and UP Manage), an authorized user can assign
one or more roles to a user ID, modify a role, or create a new role. Roles are assigned to
every user ID on the DMLSS system to protect the database from changes that the user is
not authorized to make. Note: The User Privilege buttons only appear on the System
Services Main window if you have the security manager role.
SS Security Manager           It is very important to note the elevated privilege of the SS
                              security manager, and that there should only be one SS
                              security manager per site. This user can give virtually any
                              rights in the system to him/herself or others. Only the SS
                              security manager has the unique ability to assign the
                              security manager attribute for other applications; every
                              other security manager is limited to the associated
                              application. For example, the FM security manager is only
                              able to assign FM security manager to another user,
                              whereas the SS security manager can assign security
                              manager for ARC, EM, MA, IM, AM, SS, FM, CS, MM,
                              PVI, and SC to any user ID, including his own. A user need
                              not have application access (have one or more application-
                              user roles) to be a security manager for that application.
 Security Manager            The   security manager role for each application is designed so
 Roles                       that only a limited number of users can assign user privileges
                             to other users. A user may be assigned the security manager
                             role for more than one application (for example, a user can be
 The following security both an FM AA and a CS AA). However, it is strongly
 manager roles are recommended that there be only one security manager for
 available in DMLSS:         each application per site. Only a limited amount of users
                             should be given access to UP to assign powerful capabilities
                             in areas such as Org and Funding.
     AM Security              Allows the user to manage user privileges for the
     Manager                  Assemblage Management (AM) application.
     ARC Security             Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Archive
     Manager                  Management application.
     CS Security              Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Customer
     Manager                  Support (CS) application.
     EM Security              Allows the user to manage user privileges for the
     Manager                  Equipment Management (EM) application.
     FM Security              Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Facility
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               497


    Manager            Management (FM) application.
    IM Security        Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Inventory
    Manager            Management (IM) application.
    MA Security        Allows the user to manage user privileges for the
    Manager            Equipment Maintenance (MA) application.
    MM Security        Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Customer
    Manager            Area Inventory Management (CAIM) application. Gives the
                       user access to the EOP Process Management and UDR
                       Delta Process Management functions.
    SC Security        Allows the user to manage user privileges for the Service
    Manager            Contract (SC) application.

General Rules for        Each DMLSS application has standard roles that cannot be
Application Roles:       edited. You can also create new, customized roles in
                         DMLSS, based on the centrally managed resources. A user
                         with the security manager role can then assign roles to other
                         users, thereby giving those users access to particular
                         processes, windows, and data.
                         The following rules apply when you associate roles with
                         users:
                       -    You can only add or remove a security manager role from
                            a User ID if you have the same security manager role.
                       -    You cannot remove a security manager role from your
                            own User ID.
                       -    In general, it is not necessary to assign more than one
                            application role per user ID.
                       -    Before you can edit a user's privileges, the user must exist
                            in the system. A new user is created through the DMLSS

                            privileges, the user needs to exit DMLSS and log in again,

                   CAIM service/customers at one time, the System removes all
                   of those selected except the last one, and informs you that the

            DMLSS DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSPORTATION MODULE

A4.1. Purpose. The Distribution and Transportation Module (D&TM) is a shared module
accessible through IM, AM, and EM modules. Its purpose is to enable users to track out-
shipment losses that require transportation and in-bound shipments sent from another DMLSS
system. Specifically:
   A4.1.1. IM users can process transactions requiring DRMO, Return to Source of Supply,
   Return Item for Trade-In, regular loss transactions, process Issues, Reachback orders, and
   process Excess type shipments that will be tracked within the D&TM module.
   A4.1.2. AM users can process transactions requiring DRMO, Return to Source of Supply,
   Return Item for Trade-In, Sell Assemblage, Ship Assemblage, regular loss transactions,
   Reachback orders, and ship Excess type transactions that will be tracked within the D&TM
   module.
   A4.1.3. EM users can process transactions to another Military Treatment Facility (MTF) and
   DRMO. While processing transactions to another MTF or DRMO shipments requiring
   transportation, it is imperative that you make sure to check the block "Transportation
   Required" to the right of the "Use Form Number" as this allows the request to be tracked
   within the D&TM module.
A4.2. D&TM Related Data Elements. For D&TM to be successful, the supplied data must be
accurate.
   A4.2.1. It is imperative for all users to make sure that in System Services, under MM
   Service Detail screen that the DRMO RIC, DRMO DODAAC, and DRMO Address are your
   locally assigned DRMO facility supporting the local area or base. DMLSS will
   automatically generate an electronic EDI 856 transaction for all DRMO shipments value
   greater than $800 and CIIC Code of J to Headquarters Battle Creek, Michigan (RIC S9D)
   informing them that the items will be delivered to the local DRMO office.
   A4.2.2. The user must make sure the Ship to Address in the TMU is correct and
   accurate. The RIC and DODAAC of the receiving unit must be valid so the electronic
   transaction works as designed. If not, the EDI transaction will not be translated by DAASC,
   resulting in reversing the transaction, cancelling the shipment and possibly requiring a data
   patch to fix the transaction. Additionally, while processing an out-shipment requiring
   transportation (paragraph A4.3.) make sure the Delivery Address on the pop up screen is
   accurate; if you are unsure of the information use the RIC/DODAAC lookup search provided
   on the screen as this will help prevent cancellations or data patches from occurring.
   A4.2.3. When creating a new catalog item, the users must make sure they complete the
   information required and the information is accurate, especially when selecting the Type
   Vendor Item and Type Item ID. If the item is not an NSN, don‘t use "NSN", as this will
   cause the system to put the wrong data elements on the DD 1348-1a and DD 1149.
   A4.2.4. Transportation Appropriation. The Transportation Appropriation is loaded from the
   TMU (IM) in System Services. Select IM and then Transportation Appropriation DD1149 to
   enter the correct line of appropriation.
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   509


   A4.2.5. Transportation Shipper. Users can add or delete carrier information on the
   Transportation Shipper screen. This information is loaded from the TMU in System
   Services. Select IM from the Application dropdown menu and then click on Transportation
   Shipper. Use the appropriate icon on the vertical toolbar to add or delete.
A4.3. Processing Loss Transactions. During the final step of processing a loss transaction, a
new Transportation print grid appears (Figure A4.1.). The grid is set up to select the source
document (DD 1348-1A or DD 1149), including the line of accounting when using a DD 1149 as
the source document, and requires the user to select "Yes" or "No" for that shipment being
processed through the local transportation office.

Figure A4.1. Outshipment Form/Transportation Selection screen.




   A4.3.1. If you do not know the type of transportation, you can select "Pending" to place the
   shipment into a future pending action. If the shipment is not being processed through the
   local transportation office, select "No" and select the type of shipper (i.e. Federal Express,
   UPS, local delivery, or no transportation required) for that shipment.
   A4.3.2. Lastly, users can add the commercial tracking number into the system while
   processing the loss, which will be added to the electronic advance shipping notice being sent
   to the receiving DMLSS site. When the print grid is completed, a DD 1348-1A or DD 1149
   will be printed with a 2D barcode and a new entry will be added to the D&TM.
A4.4. Supply Requisitions. Supply requisitions requiring transportation using DD 1149 require
you to update the Transportation Appropriation (DD 1149) in System Services under TMU for
IM. The new module and enhancements made to the source documents will eliminate the use of
WEBFORMS and transportation personnel from manually processing medical supply shipment
requests.
A4.5. Processing Issues. Additionally, this module provides a new way to process issues. The
new process gives you the ability to process issues throughout the day for a final consolidation
for all material going to the same RIC at a later time. If the issues require transportation it is
"important" to check the block "Transportation" on the screen, this will provide you the ability to
print the source document and track the shipment in D&TM. Once the user is ready to complete
the final process for the Issues pending, they need to open up the inbox of the module and look
for the pending action called "Transportation Issues Pending."
 510                                                       AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013


   A4.5.1. In the IM In Box select IM Transportation Issues Pending and double click or click
   the jump ahead icon. In the Transportation Issues window (Figure A4.2.), highlight the line
   item and insert the projected delivery date from the dropdown that the receiving customer
   requires the shipment and click the Process icon on the vertical toolbar. Verify the Customer
   ship to address (Figure A4.3.), and click ―OK.‖

Figure A4.2. Transportation Issues Window.




Figure A4.3. Customer Address Window.




   A4.5.2. In the Outshipment Form/Transportation Selection screen (Figure A4.1.) the user
   can modify/change the print form and the base transportation information. When complete,
   click ―OK.‖ On the Pending issue successful prompt click ―OK.‖
A4.6. Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS). CMOS is a standard ―DoD
transportation system‖ designed to bridge the gap between supply and base transportation by
eliminating manual processing of supply shipments requiring transportation, and improving in-
transit visibility by creating electronic transactions between the two systems with line item detail.
It also allows the gaining DMLSS user to receive tracking numbers in real-time within DMLSS.
   A4.6.1. Specifically, this interface provides DMLSS with the capability to pre-lodge line
   item details into CMOS by sending electronic transactions for all single item shipments and
   multipacks. Assemblages will pre-load information at the assemblage level not at the
   individual line item level.
   A4.6.2. CMOS Processing. While processing a shipment that requires transportation within
   AM, EM, or IM modules, the user must:
AFMAN41-216 13 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 511


       A4.6.2.1. Select DD1348-1a as the source document. If the user selects None from the
       Print Form dropdown, the source document won‘t be available for reprinting at a later
       date.
       A4.6.2.2. Select Yes for transportation needed which automatically defaults the shipper
       to Local TMO. This will allow TMO to see the pre-loaded supply data in CMOS.
       A4.6.2.3. Selecting Local TMO and clicking OK will trigger the electronic transaction
       process with CMOS. TMO will book the shipments through Fed Ex, UPS, or through the
       DoD transportation pipeline. Once the shipment is booked, CMOS will send in-check,
       in-transit status with the tracking number to DMLSS.
   A4.6.3. When using the Transportation module in DMLSS and selecting Base
   Transportation as your Shipping Method, an EDI 940 request is sent to CMOS with the
   shipment details and CMOS will eventually reply with an EDI 945 response that will
   ultimately include the Transportation Control Number(s). When the shipment is going to
   another MTF, an electronic Advance Shipping Notice (856) at line item detail is sent to the
   gaining DMLSS user and once the gaining unit has completed receipt of the in-bound
   material the user needs to complete the final process by selecting the Notify Shipper in the
   In-Shipment Results screen. This action will generate an electronic Receipt
   Acknowledgement (861) to ensure DMLSS maintains complete in-transit visibility of the
   shipment.
A4.7. Transportation Module Searches. The D&TM module includes Outshipment and
Inshipment search screen for each application (IM, AM, and EM), allowing users to track all or
selected shipments (Figure A4.4.). The search results include the current status of the shipment,
the lead document number and some additional functionality, such as the ability to get the
shipment line item details, to reprint the source document, to cancel the shipment, etc.
Additionally, when the TCN or commercial tracking number is available, it provides a hyperlink
to check real-time statuses through the use of GTN, Federal Express, and UPS.

A8.1. When EM is first opened, a message or a list of messages may appear in the In-Box
describing actions that advisory, were not completed, or need to be completed. These are called
Pending Action Messages. The following chart lists each message, describes the meaning of the
message, and suggest the action or actions to best remedy the problem.
A8.2. The Inbox is in tree view format. That is, if there are multiple pending actions of the same
type, the message appears only once, and you can click the + sign next to it, to see the individual
messages underneath. When you select an individual item under a pending action, the item
details appear in the Details section, in the lower portion of the window.
A8.3. The EM Inbox has sections for two different types of pending actions: Advisory Notices
and Action Required. Note: An Advisory Notice pending action message can be deleted, but

                 MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY (MA) PENDING ACTIONS

A9.1. When MA is first opened, a message or a list of messages may appear in the In-Box
describing advisory actions that must be reviewed/completed. These are called Pending Action
Messages. The following chart lists each message, describes the meaning of the message, and
suggest the action or actions to best remedy the problem.
A9.2. The Inbox is in tree view format. That is, if there are multiple pending actions of the same
type, the message appears only once, and you can click the + sign next to it, to see the individual
messages underneath. When you select an individual item under a pending action, the item
details appear in the Details section, in the lower portion of the window.
A9.3. The MA Inbox has sections for two different types of pending actions: Maintenance
Activity Inbox and Individual Inbox. Note: The Maintenance Activity Inbox displays pending
action messages that contain the MA Organization ID.
