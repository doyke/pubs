SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The revision
reduces the geographical area of application to Germany, and deletes references to Greece, Italy,
and Spain. It expands the procedural application and newly includes provisions and procedures
for the filling of positions through external candidate sources. To reflect these changes, the title
changes from Merit Promotion and In-Service Placement Program (Non-US Citizen Employees)
to Staffing of Non-US Positions. References and administrative procedures are updated
throughout the document.

              candidates in weekly vacancy lists.
              3.1.2.2.2. Publish positions with a traditionally high turnover rate by open
              continuous announcements for a minimum period of three months.
