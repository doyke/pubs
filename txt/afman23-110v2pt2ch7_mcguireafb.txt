AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 7, is supplemented as follows: This supplement pre-
scribes specific guidance for all McGuire AFB supply users/customers. Ensure that all records in this
supplement are maintained and disposed of in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of
Records, and the Air Force Records Disposition (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Refer rec-
ommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The basic publication has changed; however, the only revisions required in this supplement were made in
the date line, OPR line, leadline, supersession line, certifying, and approving authorities.
7.3.1. Each Flight Commander/Chief will be actively involved in ensuring rejects are cleared before they
become delinquent.
7.9.2.4. (Added) Primary/Alternate Flight Reject Monitors will be appointed in writing. Passwords for
Program D818, Cumulative Reject Processor, will only be issued to those individuals. NOTE: Each
reject monitor in LGRD and LGRV will be assigned a password to clear rejects, since some sections/ele-
ments are geographically separated from the main supply complex.
7.9.4. Flight Commanders/Chiefs will review Part Nine of the Daily Supply Surveillance Report (D20)
for suspected abuse in force deleting rejects. After review, maintain the listing for 30 days. Reference

reject option. The Flight Reject Monitor will enter the transaction serial number when processed under a
different document number.
7.21.1. (Added) G081 rejects (Activity Code ‘J’ documents) will be cleared using the 7132 listing.
