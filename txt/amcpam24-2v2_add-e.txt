This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 2, Airbus. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 2 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by Airbus S.A.S. Corporation. Airbus was first created in 1970 as Airbus Industrie
GIE, a multi-national consortium, and is currently owned by European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company (EADS). As of the date of this publication, Airbus S.A.S. has provided more
than 5,900 aircraft to carriers worldwide, with over 5,600 still in operation.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 2, Airbus Addenda. Volume 2 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 2 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Airbus
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 2, Airbus Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum E. Airbus A340 Series.
The aircraft in the A340 Series are wide-body, long-range aircraft, with a four engine design.
The later models (A340-500 and -600) are actually considered to be ultra-long range. Its sister
series, the A330, seems to be more numerous than the A340 series, apparently due mainly to the
reduced fuel economy of four versus two engines. However, Airbus tailored both series aircraft
to meet the needs of economy, fuel efficiency and cabin comfort (considered to be crucial to
long-range operations). Airbus maintains that the A340 offers “the quietest cabin in the sky”.

The A340 Series aircraft was launched concurrently with the A330 Series and shares many
characteristics in fuselage, wings, and tail design. The two series continued along the Airbus
concept of “commonality” which it started in earlier series. The common fly-by-wire architecture
and cockpit systems, not only in different aircraft in the A340 Series, but in the A320 and A330
Series as well, expanded upon this. The A340 and A330 series introduced cross-crew
qualification and mixed-fleet flying, in which airlines are able to switch their Airbus aircraft and
their pilot crews at short notice to better match capacity to demand.

The A340-200 and the A340-300 entered into service almost at the same time. The A340-300
had its first flight in October of 1991 and the A340-200 followed in April of 1992. Both aircraft
were type-certified at the same time in December, 1992. Very few A340-200’s were
manufactured, and it has the shortest-fuselage of the series. The A340-200 and -300 have a
combined delivery of 246, with 242 currently in operation.

The A340-600 became the third version of the series with its first flight in April of 2001 and
type-certification in May of 2002. The A340-600 is a "super-stretch" version of the A340’s,
having the longest fuselage of the series. Currently, 94 A340-600’s are in operation.

The A340-500 had its first flight in February of 2002, and was type-certified in December, 2002.
Although only 30 aircraft are currently in operation, the A340-500 boasts as being one of the
world’s longest-range commercial airliners.

AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 2, Addendum E will focus primarily on the:
A340-200      (Note: Quick reference tables are presented for the A340-200, however, there is
NO separate chapter for it, due to its limited numbers.)

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,

                                              2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of

                                              3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                              4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
                                              5) Reference number of L300 for this contour assigned by IATA for easy identification.
