Wing flying mission. Para 2.1.2 allows supervisors to approve temporary work schedule changes
due to mission requirements. Para 2.3 provides guidance on forms required for work schedule
change requests. Para 3.4 authorizes credit time earned and taken to be tracked on the AFRC
Automated Timecard. Para 9.1.3 allows the option of using either the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) Form 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence AFRC Automated
Timecard, email or other written correspondence to request and approve leave statutes in
advance.
1. Objectives.
     1.1. The objective of the AWS is to provide flexible, family-friendly work arrangements
     designed to optimize mission effectiveness, improve quality of life, and enhance the
     recruitment and retention of personnel. The AWS program allows employees to select a
     flexible (Flexitour and Gliding Programs) work schedule, or a compressed, fixed work
     schedule (commonly known as the 5/4/9 Program).
     1.2. This instruction supports the spirit of the President’s memorandums dated July 11, 1994
     and June 21, 1996, for providing flexible work arrangements.
2. Eligibility.
     2.1. Supervisors will determine the minimum numbers and kinds of employees required for
     any given tour of duty and may restrict an employee’s requested schedule. The extent of
     flexibility possible in a particular organization will be based on relevant considerations such
     as mission accomplishment, peak workload periods, and necessary contacts with other
     organizations.
        2.1.1. Safety and mission accomplishment will be the priority considerations for a
        supervisor’s denial of an employee’s requested Flexitour, Gliding or 5/4/9 schedule. At
        no time will the safety of an employee be put at risk for the purpose of satisfying an
        alternate work schedule request.
        2.1.2. Supervisors wishing to implement permanent work schedules outside of the
        approved Flexitour and Gliding work schedules or 5/4/9 guidelines (see Table 4.1 or
        Table 7.1), must coordinate through the Civilian Personnel Office and receive approval
        from the 482 FW Commander. There is no authority to establish hybrid work schedules
        or cross between established work schedules in an effort to provide unauthorized benefits
        for employees. Supervisors may approve temporary deviations from the base core work
        hours due to mission requirements, such as wing exercises, inspections, change to night
        flying schedule, etc. This may require changes to the employees work schedule to
        include removal from an alternate work schedule. Supervisors must provide at least one
        week notice to the employee and document the new work schedule on the timecard which
        will be signed by both the employee and supervisor. Deviations to the core hours may
        only apply to pay periods in which the mission activity affects the normal work schedule.
        All other requests for deviations to core hours require coordination through CPO and
        wing commander approval.
     2.2. Flexitour, Gliding and 5/4/9 program participants assigned Temporary Duty (TDY) or
     attending training will work the hours of the temporary duty or training location. An
     employee will be removed from the approved AWS for any pay period encompassing the
     TDY or training. Maximum possible advance notice, but not less than one week, will be

   given to affected employees when a change to their approved AWS is necessary. Duty hours
   will normally be determined by the OPR at the TDY or training location.
   2.3. The AFRC Automated Timecard will be used to request, annotate and approve an
   employee’s work schedule, and any temporary changes to their work schedule. Annotating
   schedules on the AFRC Timecard replaces the requirement for the 482 FW Form 1 through
   attrition and will become mandatory at the start of the 2009 pay year.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. The 482 FW Commander will retain the authority, and is responsible for making
   determinations concerning continued use of the AWS program, including any deviations to
   agency established Flexitour, Gliding, or 5/4/9 schedules.
   3.2. Group Commanders will forward, to the 482 FW Commander, any supervisory requests
   for deviations to the established Flexitour, Gliding or 5/4/9 schedules, and disapproved
   employee schedule requests.
   3.3. The Civilian Personnel Office will furnish guidance and assistance on the administration
   of the AWS program in accordance with governing authorities.
   3.4. Supervisory and management officials will utilize local time accounting methods to
   reflect each employee's entitlement to pay by documenting the number of hours of duty, and
   the nature and length of absences. The AFRC Automated Timecard record will also be
   utilized to track earned and used credit hours and travel comp time.
   3.5. Supervisors must ensure all AWS requests are in compliance with agency requirements
   prior to approval. Supervisors shall disapprove AWS requests when necessary for efficient
   operations and mission accomplishment. The wing commander has final authority to
   prohibit an employee’s AWS if it proves to interfere with basic mission accomplishment.
   Once schedules are approved, supervisors must ensure that employees comply with the
   approved schedule and should take appropriate action on any program abuses whenever
   necessary.
   3.6. Supervisors must allow employees, mission permitting, an opportunity to utilize
   available credi t hours prior to separation from the Federal service, transfer to another
   installation or agency, or conversion to the 5/4/9 schedule.
   3.7. Employees must comply with laws, Air Force instructions, and administrative
   procedures governing the AWS program.
4. Flexitour.
   4.1. The Flexitour (Flexible Work Schedule) program consists of an eight-hour per day, five
   day per week schedule in which the employee must be present during established core hours.
   Each employee may select the start, mid-day, and stop times they prefer; however, the hours
   selected are fixed. The AFRC Automate Timecard is used to request changes to the Flexitour
   AWS. Table 4.1 represents the approved core hours for civilian personnel assigned to the 482
   FW.
   4.2. Mid-day or lunch breaks are not part of the eight-hour basic work requirement and
   therefore, are not included in the 8-hour day computation. The start and stop times are
   requested in quarter-hour (15 minute) increments.
 4                                                                                     482FWI36-807 12 AUGUST 2010


     4.3. At the request of an employee and with at least one day advance notice, temporary
     deviations to the employee’s flexitour schedule (adjusted start, mid-day, and end of day
     times), may be approved by the supervisor.
     4.4. Refer to paragraph 2.2 and 2.3 for procedures when employees are TDY, attending
     training, or when mission requirements necessitate a change to the employee’s approved
     Flexitour schedule.
     4.5. Table 4.2, the Flexitour and Gliding Table illustrates the relationship between work-day
     start, stop and mid-day break times. Find the point at which the start time (left-hand column
     of the grid), intersects the total amount of time spent at mid-day (top row of grid). The
     intersect point identifies when the employees’ work-day ends.

5. Gliding Schedule.
    5.1. The Gliding program (Flexible Work Schedule), is an eight-hour day, five-day per week
    schedule similar to the Flexitour program. However, under the Gliding Schedule, employees
    may vary start, lunch and departure times on a daily basis.
 6                                                            482FWI36-807 12 AUGUST 2010


     5.2. All requirements for administration of the Flexitour program are also applicable when
     the Gliding Schedule is permitted.
     5.3. Employees are required to give advance notice of their intent to glide on a specific day
     to the supervisor.
6. Credit Hours.
     6.1. Credit hours are non-overtime pay hours of work which are in excess of an employee’s
     basic work requirement. The number of credit hours earned is equal to the number of excess
     hours worked (i.e. one credit hour earned for one excess hour worked). Credit hours may be
     earned and used in not less than one-quarter hour (15-minute) increments.
     6.2. Credit hours may only be earned and used by employees assigned to one of the flexible
     work schedules, (Flexitour or Gliding). By law, employees utilizing a compressed work
     schedule, (5/4/9) may not earn credit hours. Credit hours are only authorized to perform job
     or mission related duties.
     6.3. Credit hours are worked at the election of the employee consistent with agency policies.
     They are distinguished from overtime hours in that they are not officially ordered and
     approved in advance by management.
     6.4. An employee may not use credit hours to increase his or her entitlement to overtime pay
     or any other type of premium pay. An employee may not be paid overtime pay, Sunday
     premium pay, holiday pay, or earn credit hours for excess work (work in excess of the basic
     work requirement) performed on a holiday. Holiday premium pay must be paid for work
     performed on a holiday. Therefore, employees cannot be compensated by credit hours for
     work performed on a holiday.
     6.5. An employee with a regular schedule that includes Sundays will not be entitled to
     receive Sunday premium pay for that portion of the Sunday which reflects the use of credit
     hours.
     6.6. Credit hours must be considered for work during daytime (non-night pay) hours
     whenever possible. Whether an employee is entitled to night pay for credit hours on the day
     on which such hours are earned (worked) depends on the rules for night pay.
     6.7. Employees must earn credit hours before they can be used. Use of earned credit hours
     must be approved by the supervisor in advance. Credit hours may be earned and used on the
     same day provided the hours in which credit hours are earned occur prior to the hours
     requested for use (i.e., earn 1 credit hour prior to the regular start time and exhaust it by
     taking an extended lunch or leaving an hour early). Credit hours earned by employees are
     applied in the same way as annual leave or comp time so as to satisfy the basic work
     requirement. Just as with annual or sick leave, when credit hours are used, the employee’s
     basic rate of pay will be applied.
     6.8. A full-time employee may carry over up to 24 credit hours from one bi-weekly pay
     period to a subsequent pay period. A full-time employee may earn more then 24 credit hours
     in a pay period; however, failure to exhaust credit hours in excess of the 24 credit hour
     maximum will result in the forfeiture of these credit hours.
     6.9. A part-time employee may carry over credit hours from one pay period to the next
     subsequent pay period in an amount equal to one-fourth of the total of their bi-weekly basic
482FWI36-807 12 AUGUST 2010                                                                   7


   work requirement (i.e., a part-time employee with a bi-weekly basic work requirement of 64
   hours may carry over no more than 16 hours). A part-time employee may earn more than
   one-fourth of the total of their bi-weekly work requirement in a pay period; however, failure
   to exhaust credit hours in excess of the maximum will result in forfeiture of these credit
   hours.
   6.10. If an employee transfers or separates from Federal service contact the Civilian
   Personnel Office concerning unused credit hours.
7. The 5/4/9 Compressed Schedule.
   7.1. The 5/4/9 is a “fixed” tour of duty consisting of 8 nine-hour work-days, 1 eight-hour
   work-day, and 1 scheduled day off (SDO) each pay period. Selection of the SDO by the
   employee is contingent upon supervisor approval. The 5/4/9 offers no flexibility for
   reporting and quitting times. Employees are required to select one of 30 fixed-work
   schedules offering a lunch period of 30, 45, or 60 minutes from Table 7.1., 5/4/9 Fixed
   Schedule. Employees are required to complete the AFRC Automate Timecard annotating the
   new schedule request for approval by the supervisor. If approved, the schedule becomes the
   employee’s “fixed” schedule until a change in schedule is requested and approved through
   submission of a new AFRC Automate Timecard request.
   7.2. The SDO is normally scheduled for the first or second Monday, or, the first or second
   Friday of each pay period. Supervisors should limit the number of employees with the same
   SDO to 25% of the workforce.
   7.3. Employees are entitled to holiday pay (not to exceed nine hours) for the number of
   hours scheduled to work on a holiday (or the day designated as the "in lieu of" holiday). If
   the actual holiday falls on a Sunday, the next scheduled workday, Monday, is the observed
   holiday. If the employee’s scheduled SDO is a Monday and it falls on a holiday or observed
   holiday, then schedule the SDO for the following Tuesday. If the employee’s SDO is a
   Friday and it falls on the holiday or observed holiday, then schedule the SDO for the
   preceding Thursday. Remember to keep the SDO in the same pay period as it was originally
   scheduled.

    7.4. Time off during a 5/4/9 employee’s basic work requirement must be charged to the
    appropriate leave category. For example, a 5/4/9 employee who takes a day of annual leave
    will be charged for the scheduled duty hours that day (i.e., eight or nine hours). Employees
    on Flexitour, Gliding and 5/4/9 who have prescheduled and been approved for leave will take
    priority over requested SDO changes.
    7.5. Work week changes will not be made for the sole purpose of increasing an employee’s
    entitlement to holiday pay or other premium pay.
    7.6. Employees in a TDY status, scheduled for training, or those who are otherwise required
    to modify their 5/4/9 schedule to meet mission requirements because of inspections by higher
    headquarters, staff assistance visits, exercises, deployments etc., must convert the 5/4/9 to a
    Flexitour schedule for the pay period(s) required. Refer to paragraph 2.

8. Time and Attendance Folders.
   8.1. Timekeepers will utilize a standard six-part folder for each employee to maintain time
   and attendance records.
      8.1.1. An AFRC Automate Timecard will be kept for each pay period with copies of all
      supporting documents (certified military documents, AF Form 428, Request for
      Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay and Compensatory Time, work Schedule changes, leave
      requests, civilian TDY orders, Pay system printout, etc) and will be filed chronologically
      with the most recent on top.
      8.1.2. Time cards for each quarter will be kept in separate sections of the six-part folder,
      with the first quarter beginning in the first section on the left. Any audit documentation
      should be filed on top on that quarter.
      8.1.3. Employees may also request leave statuses in advance through the AFRC
      Automate Timecard, email or other written correspondence. Leave approved in advance
      on the AFRC Automate Timecards can be removed once the end of the pay period is
      completed and employee and supervisors both sign the timecard annotating proper work
      hours were completed as shown.

Terms
Alternate Work Schedule (AWS)—Includes Flexible Work Schedules, (FWS) and Compressed
Work Schedules, (CWS).
Basic Work Requirement—The number of hours, excluding overtime hours, which an
employee is required to work or to account for by leave or otherwise.
Compressed Work Schedule (CWS)—(1) In the case of a full-time employee, an 80-hour bi-
weekly basic work requirement that is scheduled by an agency for less than 10 workdays; and,
(2) In the case of a part-time employee, a bi-weekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours
that is scheduled by an agency for less than 10 workdays and that may require the employee to
work more than 8 hours in a day.
Core Hours—The time periods during the workday, workweek, or pay period that are within the
tour of duty during which an employee covered by a flexible work schedule is required by the
agency to be present for work.
Credit Hours—Those hours within a flexible work schedule that an employee elects to work in
excess of his or her basic work requirement so as to vary the length of a workweek or workday
(See chapter 6). By law, employees participating in the 5/4/9 program are not entitled to earn
credit hours.
Flexible Hours—The times during the workday, workweek, or pay period within the tour of
duty during which an employee covered by a flexible work schedule may choose to vary his or
her times of arrival to and departure from the work site consistent with the duties and
requirements of the position (also referred to as flexible time bands).
Flexible Work Schedule (FWS)—A work schedule that, (1) In the case of a full-time employee,
has an 80-hour biweekly basic work requirement allowing an employee to determine his or her
own schedule within the limits set by the agency; and, (2) In the case of a part-time employee,
has a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours allowing an employee to determine
his or her own schedule within the limits set by the agency.
Flexitour—A type of flexible work schedule of 8 hours each day, five days a week in which an
employee is allowed to select starting and stopping times within the flexible hours. Once
selected, the hours are fixed until the agency provides an opportunity to select different starting
and stopping times. (See Chapter 4)
Gliding Schedule—A type of flexible work schedule in which a full—time employee has a basic
work requirement of 8 hours each day and 40 hours each week. The employee may select a
starting and stopping time each day, and may change starting and stopping times daily within the
established flexible hours. (See Chapter 5)
5-4-9—A type of compressed work schedule that, by law, consists of a “fixed” schedule selected
is “fixed” because the employee may not change the schedule from those options provided by the
agency, and as negotiated with the union. (See Chapter 7)

Organization—An entity within an agency that is headed by an official with the authority to
establish tours of duty.
Overtime hours—When used with respect to Flexitour and Gliding schedules, refers to all hours
in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week that are officially ordered in advance, but
does not include credit hours. With respect to the 5/4/9 program, refers to any hours in excess of
those specified hours for full-time employees that constitute the compressed work schedule. For
part-time employees, overtime hours are hours in excess of the compressed work schedule for a
day (but must be more than 8 hours) or, for a week (but must be more than 40 hours).
Part-time employment (Flexitour and Gliding)—Under AWS, the definition of part-time
permanent employment is a bi—weekly requirement of 32 to 64 hours. A part-time employee
participating in a flexible work schedule may earn credit hours for hours worked in excess of the
basic work requirement for the part time position. When a part-time employee performs non-
overtime work on a Sunday under a flexible work schedule, the part-time employee is paid at
their basic rate of pay for the hours worked on Sunday. By law, a part-time employee is not
entitled to additional Sunday premium pay under a flexible work schedule.
Tour of duty—Under a flexible work schedule, the limits set by an agency within which an
employee must complete his or her basic work requirement. Under a compressed work schedule
or other fixed schedule, tour of duty is synonymous with basic work requirement.
