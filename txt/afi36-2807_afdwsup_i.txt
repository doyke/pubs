                                     GRAY EAGLE AWARD

2.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for the Gray Eagle Award, assigns
appropriate responsibilities, and establishes selection criteria. All Air Force general officer line

broad aviation knowledge of senior Air Force pilots. By honoring the pilot with the longest
continuous aviation service, the Air Force reinforces the camaraderie and heritage within the
pilot fraternity, recognizes the distinct accomplishments of Air Force pilots, and highlights the
total force strength of the United States Air Force. Senior pilots set an example for those who
follow, and this award recognizes their leadership and achievements.

display at Headquarters Air Force and a miniature replica presented to the recipient. The name of
the winner will be engraved on the permanent trophy.

officer pilot on active duty or in the ARC on EAD, holding the longest original rating date with
at least one year of retainability as of 15 June, not recalled and without a break in service, will be
designated the Gray Eagle. A ―break in service‖ is a period of more than 12 months when the

pilots have the same original rating date, the senior officer (based upon date of rank in current
grade) will be designated the Gray Eagle.

                             AIRFIELD OPERATIONS AWARDS

3.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedural guidance for the US Air Force Airfield
Management (AM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) Awards Program; explains the Lt General
Gordon A. Blake Aircraft Save Award and Aircraft Assist Award, eligibility, and procedures for
submissions; describes the annual AM and ATC awards and nomination procedures. It specifies
procedures to recognize personnel who have made notable contributions to the AM or ATC
fields. It provides for US Air Force participation in the Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA)
awards competition. This award applies to all Air Force activities that provide AM or ATC
services. Air Force Recognition Ribbon Eligibility; award of this ribbon is authorized to
recipients selected or announced as recipients of AF level special trophies and awards. Named
individuals who receive a functional AF level award managed by the functional area, who
participate in AF wide competition in that functional specialty are entitled to wear the Air Force
Recognition Ribbon.
3.2. Lt General Gordon A. Blake Aircraft Save Award and Aircraft Award and Aircraft
Assist Award:
   3.2.1. Award Criteria. Aircraft ―Save‖ Award is for any action taken by ATC or AM
   personnel that result in the safe recovery of an imperiled airborne aircraft or help given to an
   endangered aircraft on the ground. The performance must clearly extend beyond normal duty
   requirements, be professional, and cast no reasonable doubt that, without this action,
   probable damage would have resulted. If a nomination is not approved for a ―Save,‖ then it
   will be considered for the Aircraft ―Assist‖ Award. ―Assist‖ Awards will be awarded to
   personnel using the ―Save‖ criteria, except that the performance does not have to extend
   beyond normal duty requirements.
   3.2.2. Award Eligibility. All US Air Force air traffic controllers and airfield management
   personnel are eligible. Any other military or civilian performing ATC or AM duties in a US
   Air Force-operated or augmented facility, or in an ANG-unit facility, are eligible.
   Recognition under this program does not make individuals ineligible for awards under AFI
   36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program.

   individual's actions may submit a nomination for this award.

  services. The Operations Support Squadron Commander (or equivalent) signs the nomination
  package.

7.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance and procedures for the annual selection
process of the Field of Aeronautics and Astronautics (FOAA) Awards. The FOAA Awards are

   of a military nature by an Air Force officer or enlisted member.‖ Limit joint nominations to
   two individuals. The act must have occurred during the current calendar year. Posthumous
   awards are accepted. Mrs. Mary Schofield and Mrs. Ruth Cheney Streeter, mother and sister
   of the late First lieutenant William H. Cheney, to honor the memory of Lieutenant Cheney,
   who was killed in an air collision at Foggia, Italy, on 20 January 1918, established the award

   of Staff, USAF selects the recipient, and, subject to concurrence by the donor, presents the
   award.
   7.2.3. Mackay Trophy. The trophy is presented for ―the most meritorious flight of the
   year‖ performed by an Air Force military member or an aircrew. First consideration is given
   to an individual member. The award may also be given for ―gallantry, intrepidity, unusual
   initiative, resourcefulness, and achievement of outstanding results with unusual presence of
   mind under combat or noncombat conditions.‖ Mr. Clarence H. Mackay, who was the head
   of the Postal and Telegraph Commercial Cable Companies at the time, established the award
   in 1912. The NAA sponsors the award. The trophy, which consists of a large silver cup on a
   mahogany base, remains in the custody of the National Air and Space museum, Smithsonian
   Institution. Award elements consist of a plaque, certificate and engraved presentation folder.
   The Chief of Staff, USAF makes the selection and presentation.
   7.2.4. General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy. The trophy is awarded for ―the
   most outstanding contribution to the nation’s progress in aerospace‖ during the current
   calendar year. An active duty Air Force military member or a Department of the Air Force
   civilian employee, with first consideration being given to an active duty Air Force military
   member, is eligible. Do not submit units, retired individuals, ―joint,‖ or posthumous

   nominations. The late Dr Thomas W. McKnew, National Geographic Society, to encourage
   and inspire further conquests of space after the example set by General White, established the
   trophy in 1961. The trophy depicts a bronze male figure, hurling a Saturn rocket into space
   with his right hand and holding a re-entry vehicle similar to the Dyna-Soar in his left hand.
   The figure is framed in a complex of golden orbits representing those of the earth, moon and
   a man-made space vehicle. It rests on a cube of Swedish Bonacord black granite. The trophy

                                   WEATHER AWARDS

14.1. Introduction. This chapter implements the annual Air Force weather awards program
administered by the Headquarters US Air Force Director of Weather (HQ USAF/A3O-W). Final
selections for these awards are approved and announced by the HQ USAF/A3O-W.
14.2. Annual Weather Awards.
   14.2.1. Nomination Requirements. Each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, Air Staff or Secretariat
   2-letter office, Combatant Command, the Joint Staff, or agency possessing Air Force weather
   forces may submit one nomination for any given award (except Air National Guard and Air
   Force Reserve Award as noted in Table 14.3). Awards are based solely on accomplishments
   directly related to the weather mission, to include the space weather mission, during the
   preceding calendar year. With the exception of the Air Reserve Component Weather
   Officer/Enlisted Force Member of the Year Awards, ―whole person‖ accomplishments (e.g.,
   self improvement, community service) do not apply.
      14.2.1.1. Eligibility. All active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, DoD
      civilian personnel, organizations, and teams meeting the below award criteria are eligible
      for nomination.
      14.2.1.2. Individuals. To be eligible for an individual award, the member must have a
      core duty AF Specialty Code (AFSC) of 15WX (officers) or 1W0X1 (enlisted).
      Individuals may only be submitted for one award each year (e.g., a SNCO cannot be
      nominated for both the Air Force Weather SNCO of the Year and Air Force Weather
      Staff Enlisted Member of the Year). This rule does not apply to the Outstanding
      Technical Achievement Award, i.e., nominees for the Outstanding Technical
      Achievement Award (either as a team member or individual) remains eligible for an
      individual award. The organization to which the member was assigned on 31 December
      is responsible for award submission; however, award inputs should be solicited from the
      losing organization. In addition, the individual’s duty AFSC, rank, and/or primary duties
      for the majority (183 days or more) of the calendar year determine the eligibility and
      award category. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel serving on Title 10
      orders for the majority (183 days or more) of the calendar year may compete for any
      individual award for which they meet the award criteria; however, they are still limited to
      a single individual award nomination.
      14.2.1.3. Teams. A team is defined as two or more persons, typically not more than ten,
      organized for a specific purpose during a limited timeframe (i.e., not a standing group,
      squadron, flight, division, branch, section, or equivalent). At least one member of the
      team must have a core duty AFSC of 15WX (officer) or 1W0X1 (enlisted). Air National
      Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel serving on Title 10 orders for the majority (183
      days or more) of the calendar year may compete for any team award for which they meet
      the award criteria.

     14.2.1.4. Organizations. Organizations may only be nominated for one award each year
     (note: this does not preclude squadron-level organizations from nominating a subordinate
     organization for the flight-level award).
     14.2.1.5. Format. Use AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, for each nomination.
     Nominations will be in bullet format, front side only, and will focus on actions and
     impacts directly related to the weather mission unless otherwise stated. Submissions for
     all squadron-level organization awards will include the official unit mission description
     on the reverse of the AF Form 1206.
  14.2.2. Procedures.
     14.2.2.1. HQ AF/A3O-W must receive nominations NLT 1 March following the

     af.xoowp@af.pentagon.smil.mil.
     14.2.2.2. HQ AF/A3O-W will serve as the president of the weather awards board and
     will have final approval of all selectees. The board will normally consist of four 3-person
     panels (enlisted, officer/civilian, Reserve Component, and team/organization), each
     headed by a Colonel.
     14.2.2.3. As appropriate, HQ USAF/A3O-W will announce award winners to MAJCOM
     vice commanders, SAF and HQ USAF 2-letter offices, combatant/unified command J3s,
     FOA and DRU commanders, and commanders of the award winner’s unit on or about
     1 April. If AF/A3O-W or a designated representative cannot present the awards, they will
     be forwarded through appropriate command channels for presentation.
     14.2.2.4. Unit commanders will provide award winners with a copy of the HQ
     USAF/A3O-W announcement message to retain as proof of earning an award. Units must

     identified on the AF Form 1206 or attachment with full name, rank, SSAN, and unit,
     including office symbol if appropriate. Civilian recipients of individual and team awards
     are entitled to wear the Air Force Recognition Lapel Pin. See AFI 36-2805 for Air Force

                 AIR FORCE INFORMATION OPERATIONS AWARDS

23.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes guidelines of the annual Air Force Information
Operations (IO) Awards Program (AFIOAP) for active duty, civilian and Air Reserve
Components (ARC) administered by the Headquarters United States Air Force Division of
Information Operations (HQ USAF/A3O-CI). The annual AFIOAP conveys the highest honors
available to Air Force Information Operations professionals and provides an opportunity each
year to recognize the active duty Air Force, Air Reserve Components (ARC) and civilians who
have made significant contributions to Information Operations functions and missions. As
defined in AFDD 2-5, Information Operations, the three IO capabilities—influence operations,
electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations—while separate and distinct,
when linked, can achieve operationally important IO effects.
   23.1.1. Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of
   leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect
   behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander’s intent, and project accurate
   information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should
   result in differing behavior or a change in the adversary’s decision cycle, which aligns with
   the commander’s objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are
   psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), operations security
   (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, counterpropaganda operations and public
   affairs (PA) operations.
   23.1.2. Network warfare operations are the integrated planning, employment, and
   assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog
   and digital network portion of the battle space. Network warfare operations are conducted in
   the information domain through the combination of hardware, software, data, and human
   interaction. Networks in this context are defined as any collection of systems transmitting
   information. Examples include, but are not limited to, radio nets, satellite links, tactical
   digital information links (TADIL), telemetry, digital track files, telecommunications, and
   wireless communications networks and systems. The operational activities of network
   warfare operations are network attack (NetA), network defense (NetD) and network warfare
   support (NS).
   23.1.3. Electronic warfare operations are the integrated planning, employment, and
   assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electro- magnetic
   domain in support of operational objectives. Electronic warfare operates across the
   electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, visible, infrared, microwave, directed energy, and
   all other frequencies. It is responsible for coordination and deconfliction of all friendly uses
   of the spectrum (air, land, sea, and space) as well as attacking and denying enemy uses. For
   this reason it is a historically important coordinating element in all operations, especially as
   current and future friendly uses of the electromagnetic spectrum multiply. The military
   capabilities of electronic warfare operations are electronic attack, electronic protection, and
   electronic warfare support.
AFI36-2807_AFDWSUP_I 20 APRIL 2012                                                              79


23.2. Eligibility Criteria. Military officer nominees for the AFIOAP awards must have one of
the following Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC): 11XX, 12XX, 13XX, 14NX, 16XX, 21RX,
31PX, 33SX, 35PX, 42PX, 42SX, 51JX, 61SxB, 62EX or 71SX. Enlisted nominees may have
any AFSC in support of IO capabilities. Civilian nominees may be from any Federal
Government General Schedule (GS) or General Grade (GG) series in support of IO capabilities
(if nominees have been moved into National Security Personnel System (NSPS), the NSPS
classification structure of corresponding career groups, pay schedules, pay bands and
occupational codes should be used for the nomination). Nominees for the contributor awards
may have any AFSC/civilian series in support of IO capabilities.
    23.2.1. Military personnel must not have undergone judicial, non-judicial (Uniform Code of
    Military Justice [UCMJ]; AFI 51-202, Non-Judicial Punishment Guide) or negative
    administrative actions (AFI 36-2907, Air Force Unfavorable Information File (UIF), during
    the nomination period. If a nominee undergoes such an action after nomination, but before
    the selection board meets, the selection board will not consider the nominee for that award
    cycle. Military personnel must meet the minimum physical fitness standards set forth in AFI
    10-248, Fitness Program. Nominating authorities must immediately notify HQ USAF/A3O-
    CI of any adverse actions affecting the nominee’s eligibility.
    23.2.2. Civilian personnel must not have received any actual or pending adverse
    administrative action for the nomination period and must not have received an overall
    performance rating of ―acceptable.‖ DoD plans to phase organizations into NSPS
    incrementally over the next few years. If you have been moved into NSPS, the NSPS
    classification structure of corresponding career groups, pay schedules, pay bands and
    occupational codes should be used for the nomination.
23.3. Award Categories. The AFIOAP consists of 16 award categories that seek to
