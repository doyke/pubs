SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been completely revised and must be reviewed completely. This
revision renames the program from SENSOR OLYMPICS Program to the Major General
Larson Awards Program. Several significant changes were made to the program including:
inclusion of the quota development process, changed the eligibility requirements for competing
Airmen, added uniform requirement for finalists, updated non-secure internet protocol router
network (NIPRNet), secure internet protocol router network (SIPRNet) and joint worldwide
information communications system (JWICS) addresses, correct mailing address for the Maj Gen
Larson Awards Program staff, and eliminated the designation of units outside of AFISRA that
are eligible to compete in the Maj Gen Larson Awards Program.
1. Program Overview. The Maj Gen Larson Awards Program began in 1979 to identify,
recognize, and reward the best technicians in AFISRA through an annual competition. This
program favorably influences the morale, training, and retention of outstanding AFISRA
technicians worldwide by recognizing technical ability, proficiency, and performance. Maj Gen
Larson Awards competition encourages technical excellence, increases individual initiative, and
fosters unit morale.
     1.1. The best-qualified individuals in key Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and
     mission-enabling Air Force specialty codes (AFSCs) or reporting identifiers (RIs) are
     selected by their Parent Unit (defined in this publication) to compete in the AFISRA-level
     Maj Gen Larson Awards competition. Eligible AFSCs/RIs and selection criteria are detailed
     in paragraph 2.
        1.1.1. Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units will receive quotas
        through their associated active duty parent unit in coordination with HQ AFRC/A2 and
        NGB/A2.

4                                                  AFISRAI36-2801 23 SEPTEMBER 2011

     GROUND RULES FOR WING/CENTER/UNIT MAJ GEN LARSON AWARDS
                         TRUSTED AGENTS

A2.1. The Maj Gen Larson Awards Trusted Agent’s purpose is to ensure the integrity and
security of the Maj Gen Larson Awards testing process. The prestige of the Maj Gen Larson
Awards Program depends on an airtight testing process that ensures we identify the ―best of the
best technicians.‖
A2.2. A Trusted Agent should be someone not eligible to take a Maj Gen Larson Awards test
(i.e., MSgt-select to CMSgt; a commissioned officer; or a DOD civilian or contractor who is not
a reserve TSgt or below). Although the tests are changed every year, anyone who has had access
to a Maj Gen Larson Awards test will have a significant advantage should they ever have to take
the test.
A2.3. The Trusted Agent for the wing/center/unit is the single point of contact between that
wing/center/unit and the Maj Gen Larson Awards Staff (AFISRA/CCCO), is authorized to
appoint subordinate Trusted Agent(s) to assist in carrying out their Maj Gen Larson Awards
duties, and is responsible for the actions of their subordinate Trusted Agents.
A2.4. Security of the test is paramount. No one, other than a Trusted Agent (outside of testing),
has the authority to see a Maj Gen Larson Awards test or the "need to know" what is contained
in the test. Enforce test security as strictly as possible.
A2.5. A Trusted Agent must proctor all Maj Gen Larson Awards tests.
A2.6. Maj Gen Larson Awards tests will be sent to the wing/center/unit Trusted Agent via e-
mail. Some tests may require the competitor to use a computer to see moving graphics or hear
an audio file.
   A2.6.1. For those tests that don’t require the use of a computer, print out a separate copy (on
   a color printer, if possible) of the test for each competitor.
   A2.6.2. Competitors MAY NOT write on the test, only answers on the answer sheet will
   count.
   A2.6.3. No working aids of any kind (including calculators) may be used (Exception:
   1N2X1A).
   A2.6.4. Time limit for the test is 1hour and 30minutes.
   A2.6.5. Tests consist of at least 75 and no more than 100 questions.
   A2.6.6. Destroy the test, preferably by shredding, immediately after the testing session.
   A2.6.7. Once all of your competitors have taken their tests, delete any electronic copies of
   the tests. Units are not authorized to keep any Maj Gen Larson Awards tests.
A2.7. Trusted Agents are responsible for ensuring the answer sheets and critiques from their
wing/center/unit (and subordinate units) get to the Maj Gen Larson Awards office on time. To
ensure you have an answer sheet and critique for every person your wing/center/unit nominated,
please consolidate the answer sheets and critiques from your subordinate units and send all of the
 10                                                   AFISRAI36-2801 23 SEPTEMBER 2011


tests and critiques via accountable means (i.e., certified mail, express mail, etc.) in enough time
to meet the deadline.
A2.8. Any test challenges should be documented on blank paper by the competitor and given to
the Trusted Agent with the test and critique. The challenge must take place during the testing
session only. The Trusted Agent should send the test challenge to the Maj Gen Larson Awards
Staff via e-mail for resolution and destroy the paper. This procedure will enable us to keep test
challenges within the Maj Gen Larson Awards Trusted Agent channels and ensure information is
properly protected.
A2.9. Comments (positive or negative) about the Maj Gen Larson Awards Program are welcome
(and encouraged) and should be put on the critiques that are forwarded with the test answer
sheets.

                             CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

Contract requiring (Rank)____________ (Name) _______________________________, a
prospective Maj Gen Larson Awards test creator and/or Maj Gen Larson Awards Trusted Agent;
confidentiality in connection with the development of any test-related data.

You have been assigned duties developing or handling testing material for the Air Force ISR
Agency’s Maj Gen Larson Awards Program. In this capacity, you will become a ―Trusted
Agent‖ of data and information whose unauthorized disclosure has the potential to give Maj Gen
Larson Awards competitors an advantage in testing. Trusted Agents have access to information
concerning the research, development, grading, and results of annual Maj Gen Larson Awards
testing products and procedures. Safeguarding such information, no matter how obtained is a
military duty.

As a condition to taking on the responsibilities as a test developer, you agree that all information
used to develop Maj Gen Larson Awards tests to include the testing materials and answer sheets
will be kept within Maj Gen Larson Awards Trusted Agent channels. Additionally, you agree to
not share any potential testing data to any person other than a Trusted Agent or a member of the
Maj Gen Larson Awards staff. If you identify anyone who needs to assist you in the development
of the Maj Gen Larson Awards test, you agree to provide him/her with a copy of this
confidentiality agreement and indicate agreement before they begin assisting you in
development. Provide the original copy of the signed agreement to the Maj Gen Larson Awards
Staff within three duty days of being signed.

You agree that any material gathered to construct Maj Gen Larson Awards tests will not be used
in any way detrimental to the integrity of the program. All testing material will be treated as
belonging to the Maj Gen Larson Awards Program, and shall not be disclosed in any manner, in
whole or in part, to anyone who is not a Trusted Agent or a member of the Maj Gen Larson
Awards Staff. The testing material shall not be used other than for the purpose of the Maj Gen
Larson Awards Program.

You agree that your participation in controlling and/or developing Maj Gen Larson Awards
testing materials makes you ineligible to participate as a competitor in Maj Gen Larson Awards
competition for two years following the year of your last involvement in test development.

If you are in agreement with this, please sign and return to the Maj Gen Larson Awards Staff in
Building 2088, Room 7, or mail it to: AFISRA/CCCO, Attn: Maj Gen Larson Awards, 102 Hall
Blvd., Suite 201, San Antonio, Texas 78243-7019.
