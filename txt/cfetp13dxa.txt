Part I

Preface

1. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle
qualification, education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core
task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to
success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field initial training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; officers, supervisors, commanders and trainers use both
parts to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression
information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C
associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other);
and, Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment,
and facilities. Section E explains documentation at each level of training.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support initial qualification training (IQT). Air
Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and
correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
standards supervisors will use to determine if officers have satisfied training requirements.
Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package
(QTP), which may be developed to support upgrade or proficiency training; these packages are
available at the e-Publishing website, www.e-publishing.af.mil. Section D identifies a training
course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included
here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training
requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated
qualification needs.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables us to
train today’s force for tomorrow’s capabilities. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II
to validate initial training competencies, and conduct training commensurate with the overall
goals of this plan.

                                                5
Section A – General Information
1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field
Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career
field training program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in
order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade,
qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial qualification is the AFS specific training
an officer requires for entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of
the 1-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training
centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and
correspondence completion requirements for award of an advanced skill (3, 4) level.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an officer
in a specific duty position. This training occurs both during and after the upgrade training
process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.
Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected officers. Proficiency training is
additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job
training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
required for upgrade.
This CFETP has several purposes, some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Also, it is used to help commanders and supervisors identify training at the appropriate
point in an individual’s career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
delivery method.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints, which impact implementation of the desired career field
training process.
2. Use. The plan will be used by MFMs, commanders and supervisors at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, nonresident, field and
exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of
the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining
resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable
courses may satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training, to support this
AFSC, must be identified for inclusion in this plan.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
2.4. Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) are developed and maintained by MFMs and/or
units in coordination with AETC. Unit-developed QTPs will be provided to their MAJCOM for
approval and, upon approval by the AFCFM, included in the CFETP course index (Part II,
Section C).
3. Coordination and Approval. AF/A3O-A is the approval authority. MAJCOM representatives
and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training
requirements. The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this
document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part
II, will eliminate duplicate training.

Section D – Resource Constraints
9. Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints precluding optimal/desired
training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower.
Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect


                                               9
each constraint has on training are included. Also included in this section are actions required,
office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates. Resource constraints will be, as a
minimum, reviewed and updated annually.
10. Entry Level Training:
10.1. Formal School Constraint. Formal school availability and sequencing during Initial
Qualification Training pipeline is not currently provided at the level needed and may lengthen
overall pipeline. All 13D1A are required to attend S-V94-C and S-V86-A prior to pipeline
completion.
11. Qualified Level Training: Constraint. Formal schools (PR-241, PR-301, and AOCIQT-PR)
availability and sequencing are not currently provided at the level needed to sustain the CRO
career field development.
12. Staff Level Training: No constraint exists.

Section E – Documentation
13. Training records. Officers in the USAF do not require an AF Form 623, Individual Training
Record. In lieu of the AF Form 623, an individual training and evaluation folder will be
maintained for all CRO personnel in the grades of O-1 thru O-4, maintenance of training folders
for officers in the rank of O-5 and above is optional.
14. Records Documentation: Documentation is an important part of the training and evaluation
process. Concise and factual documentation provides a history of tasks accomplished and the
conditions under which they were accomplished. Proper documentation supports the trend
analysis program, an important part of the command and unit cross-tell programs. Improper
documentation results in a poor or incomplete picture of the individual’s performance and may
hinder the commander/supervisor as he prepares the individual for career development or re-
trains the officer for re-qualification evaluation. An individual training and evaluation folder will
be opened at the officer’s first duty station and will be transferred with the CRO upon each
permanent change of assignment. Unless on Temporary Duty, the Tab 5, Evaluation Record, will
be located in the Standards and Evaluations (Stan/Eval) section for security of evaluation
documents. Maintenance responsibility for the folder is shared by Stan/Eval and training sections
per direction in paragraph 16.
15. Individual Training and Evaluation Folder. The unit training office will build and maintain
the officer’s folder upon arrival at his first duty station. Use of a 1.5 inch 3-ring binder is the
approved method of managing the individual training and evaluation documentation. Place an
8x12 inch paper placard into the front cover of the binder which contains the title “INDIVIDUAL
TRAINING and EVALUATION FOLDER” with the officer’s full name and rank on a separate
line, AFSC and duty title on the next line and unit of assignment on the next line. The bottom of
the placard should contain the following privacy act statement: "This document may contain
information which must be protected IAW AFI 33-332 Privacy Act Program and DoD
Regulation 5400.11, Privacy Act of 1974 as amended applies, and it is For Official Use Only
(FOUO)." All text on the binder cover will be formatted in Times New Roman, #14, bold print.
Use of a 3-ring binder provides a more durable hard cover, allows ease of reading, and also
enables the user to easily add/remove changes. Divide the individual training and evaluation
folder into eight tabs:
15.1. Tab 1 – CFETP. For historical documentation, the original CFETP part II the CRO was
trained to as a 13D1A will be maintained in this tab along with a completed HAF CFETP
guidance letter for all CROs awarded the AFSC prior to the first CFETP being published.
15.2. Tab 2 – Mission Qualification Training Upgrade. MAJCOM approved quality training

Notes:
- First assignment should be to an operational rescue squadron to complete 3-level
requirements & recovery team commander qualifications.
- Either second or third assignment should be to a SERE training squadron or a SERE-
focused staff job.
- An officer entering the career field directly from officer training should anticipate 2 or 3
assignments at the squadron level, with at least one being in a tactical rescue unit, one in
a SERE/PR unit and the remainder determined by the needs of the career field.
- Instructor/evaluator upgrade can be reasonably expected at the 5-8 year point,
depending upon the individual and the needs of the unit.

PART II
Section A – Specialty Training Standard (STS)
1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC beginning
Jun 08.
2. Purpose. The purpose of this STS is to identify core specialty tasks required by the functional
user to accomplish the mission of a CRO. This STS describes a CRO in terms of tasks and
knowledge which an individual in this specialty may be expected to perform after initial
qualification training, and identifies the training provided. This STS serves as a contract between
AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall initial training requirements for the
Air Force specialty code 13D1A are taught in formal schools and correspondence courses.
3. Documentation.
3.1. Column 1. Task, Knowledge, and Technical References. This column identifies the core
tasks and knowledge necessary for officers to perform duties in the 1, 3, and 4 levels. It also
provides technical references (TR). Task statements are numbered sequentially (i.e. 1.1, 1.2, and
2.1.)
3.2. Column 2. Additional Information, This area can be used to identify additional, trainer
instructor/trainer comments as well as specific deficiencies.
3.3 Column 3. Pre-requisite skills, requirements acquired thru pre-requisite courses. This
column identifies tasks and knowledge acquired during prerequisite formal courses prior to the
AFSC awarding initial qualification training course. If no pre-requisite skill is identified, the skill
will be taught in the L3OBP13D1A-0R0B Combat Rescue Officer course.
3.4 Column 4. 13D1A Skills, CRO Course, Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Skills. This
column identifies tasks and knowledge acquired during the AFSC awarding initial qualification
training course. Behavioral statement codes are used to indicate skill level performance required.
This column indicates the proficiency to be demonstrated by the graduate as a result of training
on the task and knowledge. Each STS task has a documented behavior code. The details of each
statement and the verb selected reflect the level of training required. CRO initial qualification
requirements do not change for wartime course. Performance coding is explained in the
Proficiency Code Key, table 3.
3.4. Standard STS. The 13D1A initial qualification course is unique among officers in that a
specialty training standard exists to qualify personnel in this career field. The STS identifies the
tasks and knowledge required for an officer to graduate a formal AFSC awarding course.
4. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to
37TRG/DOS, 1222 Trumper Drive, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5717. Cite a reference to specific
STS paragraphs. A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the
supervisor's convenience to identify graduates who may have received over or under training on
tasks/knowledge items listed in this STS. For a quick response to problems, call our CSIL,
Defense Switched Network (DSN) 473-2917.

                                         (Evaluation)
Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge
for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any
specific task or for a subject common to several tasks.
NOTE: Combat Rescue Officer course and pre-requisite pipeline courses do not change during wartime.
