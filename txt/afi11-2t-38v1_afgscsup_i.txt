        qualification.
1.2. Phases of Training:
     1.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
     for duties in the T-38 aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for specific unit mission or local area requirements. Training may be incorporated in
     MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT requirements.
     1.2.2. (AFGSC) Mission Qualification Training (MQT). Before performing instructor
     duties, IPs will complete local sorties in contact, instrument, formation, and low-level
     navigation (not applicable for IPs trained locally).
     1.2.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of proficiency and/or increase flight qualifications. It provides
     minimum ground and flight training event requirements. Squadron commanders will
     designate aircrew members as “experienced” or “inexperienced” for CT purposes. For the
     purposes of this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG commander,
     deputy OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron operations officer are
     designated as experienced aircrew. Flight commanders are responsible for scheduling aircrew
     CT missions and flight training objectives for assigned or attached personnel. Using

   time in the T-38 if previously or currently experienced in another aircraft, or 450 hours of
   FP/IP/MP time in the T-38 if not.
       1.2.3.1. Inexperienced Aircrew. Aircrew not designated as experienced will progress
       through a program managed by the flight commander to develop sound flying skills.
       Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the new aircrew’s performance in
       IQT and past flying experience. No time limit has been established to transition from
       inexperienced to experienced.
       1.2.3.2. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise periodic CT meetings for
       aircrew members. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and
       mission-related topics and to increase general knowledge. A cockpit and/or crew resource
       management (CRM) topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting referring
       to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
       Program. Using MAJCOMs will detail CT meeting requirements in their MAJCOM
       supplement.
       1.2.3.2. (AFGSC) CT Meetings. Units will conduct meetings at least quarterly. These
       meetings may be conducted in conjunction with other safety or primary MDS specific
       meetings.
       1.2.3.3. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Training. NVG training is not authorized.
1.3. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.3.1. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander will determine the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP)
   may be required. If mission objectives require directed supervision, a squadron supervisor
   may be warranted.
   1.3.2. IPs and flight lead-qualified squadron supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited
   portions of a mission if the pilot has been appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
   used to allow a pilot to practice events in which he or she is already qualified or to help
   determine if a pilot is ready for an upgrade program. In either case, the IP or squadron
   supervisor is responsible for the flight.
   1.3.3. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle except
   where specifically excepted. Using MAJCOMs will detail the training cycle in their
   MAJCOM supplement.
   1.3.3. (AFGSC) The AFGSC aircrew training cycle is 12 months and will be aligned to the
   primary MDS training cycle. Sortie requirements in Table 5.1 include the 12 month
   requirement.

      1.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Pilot Utilization Policy:
         1.3.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Commanders will ensure that wing pilots fill only authorized
         positions IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The
         overall objective is for pilots to perform operations-related duties. Supervisors may
         assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board (FEB)
         member, mishap board member, etc.) but must continually weigh the factors involved,
         such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
         1.3.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Duties required by various publications that may be assigned
         to aircrew position indicator (API)-1 pilots are weapons and tactics officer, programmer,
         flying safety officer, supervisor of flying (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training
         (except ARMS documentation), standardization/evaluation liaison officer (SELO),
         squadron life support officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related
         to flying operations. API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff
         positions unless total wing pilot API-1/6 manning is 100 percent or better. Commanders
         will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower
         standards documents and authorized in unit manning documents (UMD).
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
      1.4.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations in accordance with
      (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2, and the RDS.
      1.4.2. Maintain formal course or equivalent training records for assigned and attached
      aircrew.
      1.4.3. Maintain documentation for each certification in the individual’s training records, or
      on an AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF
      Aircrew Certifications.
      1.4.3. (AFGSC) Maintain source documents certifying and/or decertifying pilots for flying
      and flying related qualifications in the individuals training folder for all qualifications
      maintained on the squadron Letter of Xs.
      1.4.4. Prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives.
      1.4.5. Document training in ARMS, using the forms or IMTs specified in AFI 11-202,
      Volume 1.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                          9


   1.4.6. Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable:
       1.4.6.1. Ground training dates accomplished and due.
       1.4.6.2. Flying hours by 30/60/90-day and cumulative totals.
       1.4.6.3. Event requirements and accomplishments by cumulative total and amount
       remaining for the training cycle.
       1.4.6.4. Sortie and event currencies and expiration dates.      Note: Units may specify
       additional training folder requirements.
1.5. Sortie Allocation Guidance. Units will use the following guidance to determine priority
for unit training sortie allocation:
   1.5.1. Higher headquarters-directed missions and aerial events.
   1.5.2. Deployment support.
   1.5.3. Evaluations.
   1.5.4. API-1 CT, including upgrade-directed support.

1.7. Progress Reviews. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus or command directive
for progress review procedures.
1.8. Fuel Conservation. It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum
extent possible. Individual crew members and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel
as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout
all phases of mission planning and execution. Once the objectives of training are complete,
sorties will be terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration will
not be the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission.
1.9. Waivers. HQ AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements established by
AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Except as specified elsewhere in this instruction the MAJCOM/A3 is
waiver authority for this instruction.
   1.9.1. Request waivers through applicable stan/eval channels to MAJCOM/A3, (or
   equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to HQ USAF/A3O-A, with
   an information copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.

                                            Chapter 2

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the IQT program for the T-38. The primary method of
initial qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in
education and training course announcement (ETCA). Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies basic qualification training requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units will request waivers from the MAJCOM/A3 to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware.
2.1. (AFGSC)General. T-38 IQT will be conducted using the T-38 Pilot Training Qualification
Course (ACC Course T38IQT) syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. An AETC
formal T-38 qualification course will suffice for qualification.
   2.1.1. Upon completion of the IQT program, aircrew will be qualified IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2, T-
   38 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing IQT will receive
   ground and flight instruction with minimum interruption and complete training within the
   time specified by the syllabus. For formal training course IQT, failure to complete training
   within the specified time limit requires notifying the gaining wing commander of the
   aircrew’s name and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
       2.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Dual-Qualified Candidates. An upgrading T-38 pilot will
       be removed from primary mission design series (MDS) flying duties when the flying
       portion of the T-38 qualification course begins. The pilot will remain in this status until
       completion of or removal from the course. OG/CC is the waiver authority. Note: This
       restriction only applies to initial qualification and IP upgrade.
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites. In addition, all personnel maintaining
flying status will meet the physical examination; physiological training; and survival, evasion,
resistance, and escape (SERE) training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before flying.
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow, but may
be tailored to local conditions and the individual’s background and experience. For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available.
2.4. Flying Training. Aircrew in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM supplement. Formal
course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. Additional
training due to student nonprogression is available within the constraints of the formal course
syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and upgrade training requirements during IQT if the
appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows it.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
 12                                        AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


2.6. Flight Surgeon (FS) Training:
   2.6.1. Ground Training. Ground training will include:
       2.6.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       2.6.1.2. Cockpit and/or crew resource management (CRM) training IAW AFI 11-290,
       Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program.
       2.6.1.3. Aircrew flight equipment and procedures training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1,
       Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program.
       2.6.1.4. Egress training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1.
       2.6.1.5. An instrument and emergency procedure (EP) review with an instructor.
       2.6.1.6. The completion of an FS examination IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
   2.6.2. Flying Training. A FS is qualified to occupy the RCP. An FS will not operate the
   controls unless an IP is at the controls and will not fly during critical phases of flight.
2.7. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
qualification evaluation or loss of currency exceeding 6 months (paragraph 4.3). Follow the
requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
2.8. IP Requalification Training. See paragraph 4.4.2.
2.9. Conversion and/or Difference Qualification. Conversion qualification follows the
guidance in this chapter and the formal course conversion syllabus. Difference training is
authorized for pilots converting from the T-38C to the T-38A/B or vice a versa. MAJCOMs will
provide difference training guidance.
2.9. (AFGSC)Conversion and/or Difference Qualification. T-38C qualified pilots will
complete an OG approved difference qualification course prior to flying unsupervised in the T-
38A.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                      13

                     MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General. MAJCOM will determine MQT requirements.
3.1. (AFGSC)General. MQT sorties will include normal operations and emergency situations
in the local area such as diversions, single runway operations, and emergency airfields. These
sorties will be flown with an IP familiar with local operating procedures. Record MQT in the
training record folder.
 14                                           AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


                                            Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines minimum ground and flying training requirements for T-38
aircrew CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic flying
skills, which ensures safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-
related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions or taskings. Taskings may be
locally generated or higher headquarters directed. Using MAJCOMs will define additional
currencies and requirements in their MAJCOM supplement.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, specifies ground training requirements. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional
ground training requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. Units will track ground training
requirements in ARMS.
4.2. (AFGSC)Ground Training. Complete the ancillary/ground training listed in Table 4.6
   4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). This
   training is not an evaluation, but a review of T-38 abnormal/emergency procedures and
   aircraft systems operations and limitations during realistic scenarios. SEPT should be
   accomplished one on one, but small flight-sized groups may be used so all members
   participate to the maximum extent possible. BOLDFACE and squadron special interest items
   should be emphasized.
       4.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Accomplish SEPT each calendar month. Failure to
       accomplish by the end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently
       completed.
       4.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Formal course student SEPT may satisfy the monthly SEPT
       requirement for the IP who administers the training.
       4.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Incorporate the following elements into the squadron SEPT
       program:
           4.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) SQ/CC or DO involvement in the selection of a
           monthly SEPT topic.
           4.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) When applicable, integrate T-38 mishaps/incidents into
           SEPT scenarios.
           4.2.1.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Discuss at least one EP for each phase of flight (takeoff,
           cruise and landing) during each session.
           4.2.1.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Accomplish two SEPTs each training period with an IP
           or squadron supervisor to include minimum fuel and emergency divert training. Note:
           If dual qualified, primary MDS SEPT does not satisfy this requirement.
4.3. Flying Training Currencies and Recurrency:
   4.3.1. Currency. Table 4.1 lists minimum currency requirements for T-38 aircrew. Using
   MAJCOMs may specify additional events or sortie currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                                   15


     If an aircrew member loses a particular currency, he or she may not perform that sortie or
     event except to regain currency.
     4.3.1. (AFGSC) Currency. Aircrew members will maintain the currency requirements in
     Table 4.1 as applicable. In addition, the requirements in Table 4.2 will be maintained.

 NOTES:
 1. See paragraph 4.3.3 of this instruction.
 2. Non current pilots will increase their weather minimum by one category. To regain currency,
 supervision level is a current and qualified instructor in the aircraft or element. If the instructor
 is in the aircraft, the instructor’s weather minimums may be used.
 3. Instrument approaches may be flown from either cockpit when simulating instrument
 meteorological conditions (IMC) with a qualified safety observer or during actual IMC.
 MAJCOMs determine limitations when instrument approach currency is expired.
 4. Rear cockpit (RCP) landings update both RCP landing currency and normal landing
 currency. FCP landing currency is good day or night.
 5. Accomplish night landings between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
 morning civil twilight. To regain RCP night landing currency, three night landings must be
 accomplished from the RCP and the FCP IP must be qualified (not necessarily current) in FCP
 and RCP night landings. See paragraph 4.3.2 of this instruction.

accomplished. Accomplish night landings between the end of evening civil twilight and the
beginning of morning civil twilight.


  4.3.2. Recurrency. Recurrency is required when an aircrew member does not meet a
  currency requirement in this instruction. Supervision level is a current and qualified
  instructor in the aircraft or element. Training identified as “affects basic aircraft qualification
  (BAQ)” requires regression to an unqualified status until recurrency training is completed.
  Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, supervisory requirements pertaining to
  recurrency may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as
  determined by the squadron commander.
  4.3.3. Landing Recurrency. Landing currency is required to maintain BAQ. Loss of
  landing currency over 210 days (225 days experienced) requires requalification training IAW
  AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2. Loss of landing currency less than 210
  days (225 days experienced) requires the following action: (Note: Timing starts from last
  landing.)
      4.3.3.1. For 31 to 90 Days (46 to 90 Days Experienced). Accomplish at least three
      satisfactory landings with a landing-current IP.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                           17


       4.3.3.2. For 91 to 135 Days. Comply with the actions in paragraph 4.3.3.1 and complete
       an instructor-supervised EP and instrument review session (normal, emergency, and
       instrument procedures).
       4.3.3.3. For 136 to 210 Days (to 225 days Experienced). Comply with the actions in
       paragraphs 4.3.3.1 and 4.3.3.2, and complete the qualification written examinations and
       an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, is not required.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Instructor Event or Sortie Currency. If an instructor becomes noncurrent in an
   event or sortie not affecting basic aircraft qualification BAQ, instructor status may be
   retained, but he or she will not instruct in that event or sortie until the required currency is
   regained. Table 4.1 lists supervision required for recurrency training.
   4.4.2. Loss of Instructor Qualification and Requalification. An instructor will be
   unqualified for:
       4.4.2.1. Cause IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.2. A failed flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, an instructor must
       successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.3. A failed qualification or instrument written examination. To regain instructor
       status, an instructor must successfully re-accomplish the written examination.
   4.4.3. Demanding Sortie. MAJCOMs will list sorties or events requiring demanding sortie
   currency in their MAJCOM supplement. Aircrew who do not have demanding sortie or event
   currency will not participate in demanding sorties without the proper level of supervision as
   determined by the squadron commander.
   4.4.4. Flight Surgeon (FS). FSs will accomplish CT IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   4.4.4. (AFGSC) Flight Surgeon (FS). Complete a Boldface/Critical Action Test once per
   week (when scheduled) prior to flying that week.
   4.4.5. Higher Headquarters API-8 Aircrew. For training other than that conducted in
   support of a formal inspection, higher headquarters personnel must coordinate with the
   supporting unit as follows:
       4.4.5.1. Aircrew will ensure appropriate ARMS data is maintained and provided IAW
       AFI 11-401.
       4.4.5.2. Units will review the qualifications and currencies of higher headquarters-
       assigned aircrew before authorizing them to fly. Units will evaluate the demands of each
       mission scenario and ensure higher headquarters-assigned aircrew ability and proficiency
       will not be exceeded.
       4.4.5.3. Aircrew will submit qualification and authorization documentation to the
       supporting squadron commander or operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
4.5. Annual Training Requirements:
 18                                       AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


   4.5.1. MAJCOMs. Will determine minimum annual requirements. Sorties and events
   accomplished during MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in
   which they were accomplished. Before an aircrew member may fly in the new training cycle,
   the OG commander will determine if additional training is required. (Note: Additional
   training may be required, depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.)
   4.5.1. (AFGSC) Aircrew members will accomplish sortie and event requirements listed in
   Table 4.3 and in Table 4.4 as applicable. If an aircrew member fails to maintain sortie or
   event requirements, the OG/CC will review the crewmember's status to determine if
   additional training is required.

                          SPECIALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS

5.1. Overview. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capabilities and
qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting point and may need to be
modified by the squadron commander, based on the unit’s requirements and the aircrew’s
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal
course syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed
academics and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted IAW a program approved by the
squadron commander. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional specialized training programs in
their MAJCOM supplement.
5.1. (AFGSC)Overview. The T-38 is used in the B-2 Companion Trainer Program to support
the training, proficiency, instrument, chase, and other mission support duties as directed by the
WG and OG leadership. Pilots assigned or attached to the B-2 program are upgraded in the T-38
in phases. One phase of training is not necessarily a prerequisite of another phase. This training
is accomplished according to 509 BW T-38 CTP specialized training courses. The objectives of
these courses are to produce pilots proficient and qualified in T-38 formation, LLNAV, and
night. The T-38 program consists of the following T-38 qualifications:
   5.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Basic T-38 Qualified:
       5.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) General.
           5.1.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Eligibility Requirements. Participants must be pilots
           on active flying status assigned to HQ AFGSC, 8 AF, 509 BW, or attached units.
           These pilots are qualified in the T-38 to supplement proficiency training received in
           the mission aircraft due to limited number of training sorties and hours available in
           the B-2 program. Additionally, pilots in flying billets not qualified in the B-2 receive
           their sole proficiency training in the T-38.
           5.1.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) The basic T-38 qualification allows pilots to perform
           basic instrument, cross-country, and transition sorties. With appropriate CT upgrade
           training, pilots may become qualified to fly LLNAV, and formation sorties (from
           both the lead and wing position).
           5.1.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Basic qualification allows pilots to fly traffic pattern
           stalls and all AHC demonstrations described in AFMAN 11-250V1 except for low-
           speed stability exercises and full aft-stick stalls, which require an IP. The required
           AHC sorties stipulated in Table 4.3 will be flown with an IP.
       5.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Training Program. Use ACC syllabus course T38IQT for
       training.
5.2. Instructor Upgrade. Follow a MAJCOM-approved formal course syllabus.
   5.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) T-38 CTP Instructor:
       5.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) General. These are pilots who have completed a MAJCOM-
       approved upgrade program and are qualified to instruct all phases of T-38 training. This
       includes:
 22                                         AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


          5.2.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) ACC syllabus course T38IQT.
          5.2.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) ACC syllabus course T38IP (ACC Instructor Pilot
          Upgrade course).
          5.2.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) CT         upgrade    programs     (formation,   night,   IP
          Familiarization, and LLNAV).
      5.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Upon completion, the pilot will be qualified according to AFI
      11-401 and AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and applicable grading volumes. IP upgrade
      will normally be conducted using the USAF T-38 Instructor Pilot Upgrade Training
      Course (ACC course T38IP) syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. An AETC
      T-38 instructor pilot course (PIT) may also be used for IP qualification. Dual-qualified
      pilots upgrading to T-38 IP will be relieved of primary MDS flying duties when the
      flying portion of the T-38 IP course begins. The pilot will remain in this status until
      completion of or removal from the course. OG/CC is the waiver authority.
      5.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Course prerequisites for the ACC Course T-38 IP (T38IP)
      include:
          5.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Track I and II: Pilot must be Flight Lead and LLNAV
          qualified and have 50 hours in T-38 since initial qualification or requalification
          (waiverable by HQ AFGSC/A3T).
          5.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Track III: Pilot must be a previously qualified T-38A or
          T-38C instructor pilot.
      5.2.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Following satisfactory completion of upgrade requirements,
      the OG/CC will personally interview the upgrading IP and review IP responsibilities,
      scope of duties, authority, and philosophy. Failure to complete scheduled training events
      need not delay certification. The SQ/CC will certify the upgrading IP by providing the
      necessary documentation, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format.
5.3. RCP Night Landing Qualification Training:
   5.3.1. Spatial Disorientation (SD) Ground Training. SD ground training will consist of
   both an SD briefing and an SD training system demonstration that focus on prevention,
   recognition and recovery. SD briefing requirements are met by currency in the instrument
   refresher course. If an SD training system is not available, ground training may consist of a
   SD briefing only, but special emphasis on SD prevention, recognition and recovery must be
   made during the briefing.
   5.3.2. Flying Training. For initial qualification, an IP qualified in RCP night landings must
   occupy the FCP. The IP being night qualified will accomplish a minimum of three RCP
   landings. Night landings to gain or regain night landing qualification will be accomplished
   between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.
5.4. Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish formation and/or
flight lead training programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course
syllabus may satisfy this requirement.
5.4. (AFGSC)Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Refer to paragraph 5.1.1.1.2 as
applicable.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                           23


5.5. Low Altitude Training Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish low altitude upgrade
programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course syllabus may satisfy
this requirement.
5.5. (AFGSC)Low Altitude Training Upgrade. AFGSC T-38s will not be used to conduct
Low-Altitude Training (LOWAT) mission-oriented operations (aerial attack or threat reactions).
   5.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Low-Level Navigation (LLNAV). Low-level navigation flight
   will be conducted IAW AFMAN 11-250V1 and AFI 11-2T-38V3 at or above 1,000 AGL in
   MOAs, restricted airspace, or warning areas. Refer to paragraph 5.1.1.1.2 as applicable.
5.6. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. MAJCOMs will publish FCF pilot training
requirements in their MAJCOM supplements.
5.6. (AFGSC)Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. FCF pilots will be trained IAW OG

AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication
AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training
AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications
5.8. (Added-AFGSC) Night Qualification. Prior to flying unsupervised at night, pilots will
complete an OG developed night qualification program. The program should address night-time
considerations for aircraft lighting, spatial disorientation, landings and emergency procedures.
Record night qualification training information in the individual’s training folder and annotate on
the LOX. For operations between sunset and sunrise, the Pilot in Command must be current and
qualified (as applicable) for night operations.
5.9. (Added-AFGSC) Other Duties Requiring T-38 Qualification. T-38 FE and squadron
SELOs will be assigned according to AFI 11-202V2_AFGSCSUP.
5.10. (Added-AFGSC) Sortie Requirements. The annual sortie requirements are depicted in

Terms
Aircraft handling characteristics (AHC)—Training for proficiency in utilization and
exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with operational and safety constraints, that
includes (but is not limited to) high or maximum angle of attack maneuvering, energy
management, minimum time turns, maximum or optimum acceleration, deceleration techniques,
and confidence maneuvers (AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures).
Basic aircraft qualification (BAQ)—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
(AFI 11-202, Vol. 1)
Cockpit familiarization trainer—A training device in which the controls, switches, and
instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist use, normal procedures,
and emergency procedures.
Continuation training (CT)—The program that provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification
level.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure the average aircrew member maintains a minimum level of
proficiency in a given event.
Emergency procedures evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and noncritical emergency procedures (EP) conducted by a stan/eval
flight examiner orally or in a cockpit training device.
Experienced—Aircrew who meet the experience qualifications defined in MAJCOM
supplements (see inexperienced).
Flight lead—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct of the
mission from preflight preparation and briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of his or her
actual position within the formation. A certified four-ship flight lead may lead formations and
missions in excess of four aircraft unless restricted by the unit commander. A two-ship flight
lead may lead an element in a larger formation.
Formal course—Training courses listed in Air Force ETCA.
Inexperienced—Aircrew who do not qualify as experienced or are not certified as such by the
squadron commander (see experienced).

aircrew duties in an assigned position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit's
operational mission.
Initial qualification training (IQT)—Training needed to qualify for basic aircrew duties in an
assigned position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s operational mission. This
training is the minimum requirement for BAQ.
Low altitude training—Mission-oriented operations in the certified low-altitude block (500 feet
to 1,000 feet AGL).
Low-level navigation—Visual flight rules point-to-point navigation in the 500 to 5,000 feet
AGL altitude block.
Mission qualification—An aircrew member engaged in training to qualify in an assigned
aircrew position to perform a command or unit mission.
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time (AFI 11-202,
Volume 3).
Night landing—A landing conducted between the end of evening civil twilight and the
