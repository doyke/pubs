1. Concept of Operations .
   1.1. Mentoring is an on-going process of professional development and is the responsibility of mem-
   bers and supervisors alike. Normally a member's mentor will be the member's immediate supervisor.
   However, a member may request a specific person to mentor him/her. Key to success in the program
   is the support of all commanders and supervisors to ensure that each member of the wing understands
   his/her performance and career progression.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. 939th Air Refueling Wing Commander will:
       2.1.1. Ensure the implementation of the mentor program IAW AFI 36-3401, AFRC Sup 1.
   2.2. 939th Air Refueling Wing Vice Commander will:
       2.2.1. Manage the wing mentor program.
       2.2.2. Coordinate with unit commanders to implement a robust mentor program.

3. Wing Mentoring Program.
    3.1. The 939th Air Refueling Wing Mentor Program is intended to help members prepare for
    increased responsibilities as they progress through their military careers. To that end, all commanders
    and supervisors will take an active role in the professional development of their subordinates.
    3.2. As a minimum, group commanders will accomplish the following:
       3.2.1. Establish a formal mentoring program, using AFRC Pamphlet 36-3401, AFRC Mentoring
       Program as a guide.
       3.2.2. Establish procedures to accomplish formal mentoring sessions on each member of the
       group at least once each year. Pursuant to AFRCP 36-3401, the mentoring session will normally
       be accomplished during the subordinate's mid-course enlisted performance report or officer per-
       formance report feedback session. Use AFRC Form 141, Mentoring Process Guide, to guide the
       mentor and to provide written feedback of the mentoring session to the subordinate.
       3.2.3. Establish a program to document the accomplishment of each mentoring session. Do not
       maintain the AFRC Form 141 or any copies. That form is to be kept strictly confidential between
       the mentor and subordinate.
