                                                Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. INTRODUCTION. USAF uses aerial demonstrations to exhibit the capabilities of USAF aircraft.
AMC is designated lead command and will establish criteria for aircraft capabilities demonstrations for
C-5, C-9, C-12, C-17, C-20, C-21, C-22, C-32, C-37, C-38, C-130, C-141, E-4, KC-10, KC-135, C-135,
NKC-135, UH-1, and VC-25 aircraft. MAJCOMs flying aircraft capabilities demonstrations with these
MDS aircraft will comply with this instruction. The directives listed in Attachment 1 provide further pol-
icy or procedural guidance in the conduct of these events. Flying procedures and guidance within this AFI
do not constitute authority to deviate from AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events, AFI
11-2MDS, Vol 1, MDS Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, MDS Operations Procedures, and AFI
11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules.

1.2. Terms Explained. Unless otherwise indicated, terms and definitions used in AFI 11-209, Air Force
Participation in Aerial Events; AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures; and this instruction
are the same. For the purposes of this AFI, the terminology “aircraft capabilities demonstration,” “aircraft
demonstration” and “aircraft capability exercise (CAPEX)” are used interchangeably. See Attachment 1
for Terms.

1.3. Flyovers and Aerial Reviews. AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events, provides guidance for flyovers
(including funeral service, memorial service or memorial flyovers) and aerial reviews. Additional guid-
ance appears in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, MDS Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, MDS Operations
Procedures, AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, and in MAJCOM directives. Flyovers (whether
flown by an aircraft in “clean” configuration or by an aircraft configured with landing gear and/or flaps
and/or boom deployed) and aerial reviews are not aircraft capabilities demonstrations, as defined in this
instruction, and are not specifically addressed in this instruction.

1.4. Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration. Aircraft capabilities demonstrations (applicable to fixed or
rotary wing) include the following: Aerobatics; Assault Landing; Assault Takeoff; Maximum Perfor-
mance Takeoff; Tactical Takeoff; Tactical Departure; Aircraft High Performance Maneuvering; Personnel
Airdrop (High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or Static Line); Equipment Airdrop; Container Delivery
System (CDS) Airdrop; Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration; and, Helicopter Flight Demonstra-
tions consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel Alter-
nate Insertion/Extraction (AIE) (See Attachment 1, Table A1.). Engine Running Offload (ERO) and
Aircraft Backing maneuvers are also aircraft capabilities demonstrations when executed as part of an
aerial performance scenario that includes ground operations. All the following expressions mean the same
as “aircraft capabilities demonstration”: Aerial Demonstration (Aerial Demo); Aircraft Demonstration
(Aircraft Demo); Capabilities Demonstration, and [Aircraft] Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX). HQ AMC
has developed aircraft capabilities demonstrations in the form of “Standard Profiles” for the following
MDS aircraft, only: C-17, C-130, C-141, KC-135 (including C-135 & NKC-135), and UH-1N. MAJ-
COMs operating these aircraft to perform aircraft capabilities demonstrations will adhere to the Standard
Profiles in Chapter 3.

1.5. Non-Standard Profiles. Aircrews desiring to fly a “one-time” aircraft capabilities demonstration dif-
fering from the standard profiles in Chapter 3 must gain participation approval from their respective
AFI11-246V6 20 APRIL 2004                                                                               3


MAJCOM/CC (can be delegated to MAJCOM/DO) for the non-standard profile. In the approval request,
explain why the standard profiles are not applicable and include sufficient information on the proposed
non-standard profile to permit evaluation at the headquarters.
   1.5.1. The information submitted to the MAJCOM headquarters will include a brief synopsis of what
   will take place and will address the following issues, at a minimum:
       1.5.1.1. MDS aircraft (and number) and types of formations (similar/dissimilar), if applicable
       1.5.1.2. Airspeeds and altitudes to be flown
       1.5.1.3. Holding patterns, if applicable
       1.5.1.4. Ground tracks to be flown (entry/demonstration/exit tracks)
       1.5.1.5. Type of aircraft capabilities demonstration to be flown
       1.5.1.6. Type of airdrop (personnel/heavy equipment/CDS—include airdrop intended point of
       impact relative to the crowd line and show line), if applicable
       1.5.1.7. On-scene ground supervisor and on-scene communications and control procedures
       1.5.1.8. Qualification and certification of the participating aircrew members in the maneuvers to
       be flown.
   1.5.2. The authority delegated to MAJCOMS in paragraph 1.5., above, to approve non-standard pro-
   files is intended to expedite the approval process for “one-time” aircraft capabilities demonstrations
   flown in unique situations.

1.6. Waiver Authority. HQ USAF/XO delegates waiver authority for this instruction to HQ AMC/CC.

1.7. MAJCOMs will submit proposals to change AFI 11-246, Vol 6, to change the existing standard pro-
files, or to create entirely new profiles for aircraft capabilities demonstrations to HQ AMC (OPR: AMC/
A33O, DSN 779-2089)—AMC/CC delegates approval authority to AMC/A3. Proposals should be
approved at the MAJCOM before being submitted to HQ AMC. Once approved at HQ AMC, change pro-
posals are forwarded to AF/XO for final approval.

                                                 Chapter 2

          AIRCREW TRAINING, QUALIFICATION, CERTIFICATION & CRITIQUE

2.1. Requirements. AMC, AETC, ACC, AFRC, PACAF, USAFE, AFMC, AFSPC and ANG aircrews
flying the MDS aircraft in paragraph 1.4. to perform aircraft demonstrations must be trained, qualified
and certified in the maneuvers being flown. Aircrew performance during aircraft capabilities demonstra-
tions flown at military or civilian events will be critiqued with results reported to the MAJCOM. RCS:
HAF-XOO(AR)0212, continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data
requirements as prescribe, but may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports.

2.2. Training and Qualification. The standard profiles for aircraft capabilities demonstrations are compi-
lations of basic flying maneuvers such as assault takoff/landing, personnel/equipment airdrop, random
steep approach, spiral up departure, closed traffic pattern, in flight refueling procedures, hovering proce-
dures, aircraft backing procedures etc. AFI 11-2MDS, Volumes I, II and III fully documents these basic
flying procedures and aircraft maneuvers—MAJCOMs will ensure all aircrew members who fly the stan-
dard profiles at approved events are trained and qualified in these basic flying procedures and aircraft
maneuvers. Training and qualification will normally be accomplished at the wing level IAW applicable
Air Force Instructions, MAJCOM Instructions and procedures, and Wing training and evaluation proce-
dures. Guidance for aircrew training and qualification, in addition to the AFI 11-2MDS series of instruc-
tions, appears in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-401, Flight Management.

2.3. MAJCOM Certification Process. MAJCOMs will delineate in a supplement to this AFI or other suit-
able publication, such as a concept of operations (CONOPS), the processes in place to certify their air-
crews to fly the standard profiles, i.e., to certify their aircrews in the basic flying procedures and aircraft
maneuvers constituting the approved aircraft capabilities demonstrations.

2.4. Participation Approval Procedures. AFI 11-209 and MAJCOM supplements describe the approval
process for Air Force aerial participation in approved military and civilian events such as military open
houses, civilian air shows, international air and trade shows, etc. All requests for participation approval to
fly an aircraft capabilities demonstration in an approved event must flow through proper channels, must
clearly specify the MDS and standard profile to be flown, and must warrant that the aircrew is qualified
and certified in the maneuvers to be flown.

2.5. Critique and Review Process. MAJCOMs will implement procedures to critique the flying perfor-
mances of their own aircrews participating in aircraft capabilities demonstrations flown at military and
civilian events and to review the results at the appropriate headquarters level. The process will be docu-
mented in the MAJCOM supplement or CONOPS and will specify the criteria for the critique, the content
guidelines and format for the critique results, the medium for communicating the results, and the head-
quarters level to which the results are to flow.
    2.5.1. When the presence of an Aerial Control Team (ACT) is required by AFI 11-209 at a military or
    civilian event, the MAJCOM will coordinate with the ACT, arranging for the team chief to critique
    aircrew performance and forward results to the appropriate headquarters level.
    2.5.2. If the ACT will not be present, the MAJCOM will coordinate with the event on-scene ground
    supervisor to perform the critique and forward results to the appropriate headquarters level.
AFI11-246V6 20 APRIL 2004                                                                                   5


  2.5.3. If neither an ACT nor an on-scene ground supervisor (or Air Boss) are available, the MAJCOM
  can assign an additional pilot or navigator to the aircrew to perform an airborne critique and forward
  the results to the appropriate headquarters level.
  2.5.4. If the proposed guidelines in paragraphs 2.5.1. through 2.5.3., above, are not workable or not
  practical for a given situation, a final alternative is to simply ask the aircrew about their flying perfor-
  mance upon their return to home station (i.e., interview the aircrew). The purpose of the interview is
  to ascertain the aircrew’s own assessment of their flying performance—an appropriate level of leader-
  ship within the wing to which the aircrew is assigned will conduct the interview. The results will be
  forwarded to the appropriate headquarters level. The MAJCOM will develop this procedure in the
  MAJCOM supplement or CONOPS to this instruction, specifying the level of wing leadership to con-
  duct the interview and the headquarters level to which the feedback will be forwarded.

                                        STANDARD PROFILES

3.1. The Standard Profiles for the C/KC/NKC-135, C-141, C-130, C-17 and UH-1N aircraft are at
https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3o/A33O/index.htm, the AMC web site (A33O home page). Click on
the desired MDS aircraft to view a specific standard profile. The profiles are based on the aircraft capabil-
ities demonstrations listed in paragraph 1.4., having been compiled from basic flying maneuvers common
to the MDS selected. The profiles by MDS are summarized here.

3.2. KC-135 Stratotanker (Includes C-135 and NKC-135). Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstra-
tion of approximately seven minutes duration. It begins with a take off to a VFR closed pattern followed
by high-speed and low-speed passes and ends with a full stop at the same airfield.

3.3. C-141 Starlifter. Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration that starts with the C-141 already
airborne. The aircraft capabilities demonstrated follow in this sequence: personnel airdrop; airdrop
escape; VFR overhead pattern; and, finally a full stop landing. Profile 2 is an aircraft capabilities demon-
stration that begins with a C-141 on the airfield. The aircraft capabilities demonstrated follow in this
sequence: take off; spiral-up tactical departure; overhead VFR pattern; and, full stop recovery at the same
airfield.

3.4. C-130 Hercules. Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration (airdrop) flown by a single-ship
C-130 or a C-130 formation. A C-130 formation may contain multiple elements involving a number of
aircraft up to the limits authorized by DoD, USAF and AMC guidance. Mission planners may use any
combination of C-130 single-ships and formations to airdrop heavy equipment (HE), Container Delivery
System (CDS) supply containers and personnel—all as part of the same capabilities demonstration—to
present the full range of C-130 delivery capabilities. The aircraft capabilities demonstrated include: Per-
sonnel airdrop (HALO / Static Line); Equipment airdrop (heavy equipment / CDS); Random steep or
shallow approach; Assault landing; Backing demonstration (optional ERO or upload); and, Assault take-
off (maximum effort takeoff). Profile 2 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration that starts with an assault
takeoff (maximum effort takeoff) and includes the following: Random shallow or steep approach; Assault
landing; Backing demonstration (optional ERO or upload); and, Optional assault takeoff (maximum effort
takeoff). Profile 3 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration starting with a C-130 already airborne and
includes the following: Random shallow or steep approach; Assault landing; Backing demonstration
(optional ERO or upload); and, Optional assault takeoff (maximum effort takeoff).

3.5. C-17 Globemaster. Profiles 1, 2, and 3 are aircraft capabilities demonstrations involving the perfor-
mance maneuvering of the aircraft in a runway environment, each with a different duration: 6, 10, and, 12
minutes, respectively. Profile 4 depicts three separate aircraft capabilities demonstrations—basic airdrop,
overhead pattern to a simulated short-field landing (optional backing demonstration and ERO/upload),
and, an assault takeoff (maximum effort takeoff). The airdrop demonstration is flown by a single-ship
C-17 or a C-17 formation. A C-17 formation may contain multiple elements involving a number of air-
craft up to the limits authorized by DoD, USAF and AMC guidance. Mission planners may use any com-
bination of C-17 single-ships and formations to airdrop heavy equipment (HE), Container Delivery
System (CDS) supply containers and personnel—all as part of the same capabilities demonstration—to
present the full range of C-17 delivery capabilities.
AFI11-246V6 20 APRIL 2004                                                                                       7


3.6. UH-1 Iroquois. All demonstrations will be performed over a runway or open area (taxiway, grass
infield, etc.) at a military or civilian airfield, or over an open area not associated with an airfield that meets
USAF/FAA requirements for a helicopter landing site or flight demonstration site. All profiles involving
Alternate Insertion/Extractions (AIE) may include actual insertion and extraction of qualified personnel.
Authorized AIEs are those listed in AFI 11-2H-1, Vol 3, Helicopter Operations, and MAJCOM supple-
ments. They will be performed at an altitude consistent with the unit's mission and governing directives.
Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration highlighting a steep approach to landing (optional
maneuvers include a hover or AIE demonstration) followed by a maximum performance takeoff and
departure. As a guide, the hover demonstration is performed at approximately four feet and may include a
180o turn about the transmission, a 180o turn about the nose and a 360o turn about the tail (all with a max-
imum turn rate of 90 degrees in four seconds). Profile 2 is flown as a single-ship or a formation. The size
and composition of the formation will be similar to that required by the unit's typical operational or train-
ing mission profile. The aircraft or formation approaches the landing area low-level at 90 KIAS. The crew
performs a tactical approach and quick-stop maneuver, followed by a landing or AIE demonstration. After
the landing or AIE is complete, the aircrew egresses the area with a tactical departure. Profile 3 consists
of a fire suppression demonstration using the “Bambi Bucket.” Simulated employment altitudes and air-
speeds will be IAW MAJCOM procedures—the fire is simulated. The aircraft then departs the area. Pro-
file 4 demonstrates a basic static line and/or HALO personnel airdrop and is performed over a
Service-approved drop zone or over a military or civilian airfield. Following release, the helicopter
departs the area.

Terms
Aerial Performance—A subset of Aviation Support involving the exhibition of an aircraft in flight. This
generic phrase includes virtually every type of aerial participation in military or civilian events: flyover,
aerial review and aircraft capabilities demonstration (see definitions, below, for each of these). See Table
A-1, below.
Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration—An aerial performance in which an aircraft (fixed or rotary
wing) conducts maneuvers usually associated with its employment and which are common to the airframe
being shown. The purpose is to illustrate the unique flying capabilities of the aircraft. Aircraft capabilities
demonstration includes the following: Aerobatics; Assault Landing; Assault Takeoff; Maximum
Performance Takeoff; Tactical Takeoff; Tactical Departure; Aircraft High Performance Maneuvering;
Personnel Airdrop (High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or Static Line); Equipment Airdrop; Container
Delivery System (CDS) Airdrop; Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration; and, Helicopter Flight
Demonstrations consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and
personnel Alternate Insertion/Extraction (AIE). Engine Running Offload (ERO) and Aircraft Backing
maneuvers are also aircraft capabilities demonstrations when executed as part of an aerial performance
scenario that includes ground operations. The following phrases are synonymous with the phrase “aircraft
capabilities demonstration” and can be used interchangeably: Aerial Demonstration (Aerial Demo);
Aircraft Demonstration; Capabilities Demonstration; and, [Aircraft] Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX). See
Table A-1, below.
Aviation Support—Aviation support is an overarching class of aviation-related activities, including
exhibits or displays, provided to military or civil event sponsors. It includes the following categories: 1)
Aircraft static display; and, 2) Aerial performance. Aerial Performance is broken down as follows: 1)
AFI11-246V6 20 APRIL 2004                                                                               9


Parachute Demonstration Team; 2) Flyover; 3) Aerial review; and, 4) Aircraft Capabilities
Demonstration. A whole family of flying activities falls under Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration (See
definition, above, and Table A-1, below).
Civil Event—Affairs or occurrences that are of, pertaining to, or befitting ordinary citizens and
associated with ordinary community life, as distinguished from the military—in essence, they are
non-military, civilian occasions and can be either domestic (i.e., U.S.) or foreign.
Funeral Service, Memorial Service or Memorial Flyover—An aerial performance consisting of a
single-pass flyover at a funeral service, memorial service or memorial event, respectively, by a single
aircraft or by as single formation (up to four aircraft). The formation may be flown as a missing-man
formation, with the appropriate approval.
High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Airdrop Demonstration—A n                 aircraft    capabilities
demonstration involving the airdrop of a qualified parachute demonstration team from an altitude
prescribed in the team's governing directives (usually above 5,000 AGL). The parachutists free fall to a
predetermined altitude before deploying their parachutes to complete the descent.
Military Event—A U.S. military affair, celebration, occasion or ceremony held on a DoD installation
and serving to celebrate military traditions (retreat ceremonies, military parades, changes of command,
dedications of military schools or building, etc.), to formally recognize a military member or group
(military funeral services, memorial services, memorial occasions, etc.) or to display Air Force resources
or capabilities (base Open House event, CAPSTONE Aerospace Power Demonstration, etc.). Military
events may or may not be open to the general public. Military events sponsored by other nations will be
clearly referred to as “foreign military events.”

This instruction implements guidance in AFPD 11-2, Flight Rules And Procedures, and AFI 11-209, Air
Force Aerial Events. It provides guidance and procedures in performing specified aircraft capabilities
demonstrations using specific Air Force model, design, series (MDS) aircraft. It designates Air Mobility
Command as lead command for aircraft capabilities demonstrations applicable to C-5, C-9, C-12, C-17,
C-20, C-21, C-22, C-32, C-37, C-38, C-130, C-141, E-4, KC-10, KC-135, C-135, NKC-135, UH-1N, and
VC-25 aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the Air National Guard is functionally considered to be
a major command (MAJCOM). MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA) and direct reporting units
(DRU) may supplement this instruction. Forward one copy to HQ AMC/A33 and HQ USAF/XOOO after
publication. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting information. Ensure all records
created by this AFI are maintained and disposed of IAW AFMAN 37-139, “Records Disposition Sched-
ule.”
1.3. Flyovers and Aerial Reviews. AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events, provides guidance for flyovers
(including funeral service, memorial service or memorial flyovers) and aerial reviews. Additional guid-
ance appears in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, MDS Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, MDS Operations
Procedures, AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, and in MAJCOM directives. Flyovers (whether
flown by an aircraft in “clean” configuration or by an aircraft configured with landing gear and/or flaps
and/or boom deployed) and aerial reviews are not aircraft capabilities demonstrations, as defined in this
instruction, and are not specifically addressed in this instruction.
1.4. Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration. Aircraft capabilities demonstrations (applicable to fixed or
rotary wing) include the following: Aerobatics; Assault Landing; Assault Takeoff; Maximum Perfor-
mance Takeoff; Tactical Takeoff; Tactical Departure; Aircraft High Performance Maneuvering; Personnel
Airdrop (High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or Static Line); Equipment Airdrop; Container Delivery
System (CDS) Airdrop; Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration; and, Helicopter Flight Demonstra-
tions consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel Alter-
nate Insertion/Extraction (AIE) (See Attachment 1, Table A1.). Engine Running Offload (ERO) and
Aircraft Backing maneuvers are also aircraft capabilities demonstrations when executed as part of an
aerial performance scenario that includes ground operations. All the following expressions mean the same
as “aircraft capabilities demonstration”: Aerial Demonstration (Aerial Demo); Aircraft Demonstration

(Aircraft Demo); Capabilities Demonstration, and [Aircraft] Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX). HQ AMC
has developed aircraft capabilities demonstrations in the form of “Standard Profiles” for the following
MDS aircraft, only: C-17, C-130, C-141, KC-135 (including C-135 & NKC-135), and UH-1N. MAJ-
COMs operating these aircraft to perform aircraft capabilities demonstrations will adhere to the Standard
Profiles in Chapter 3.
1.5.2. The authority delegated to MAJCOMS in paragraph 1.5, above, to approve non-standard profiles is
intended to expedite the approval process for “one-time” aircraft capabilities demonstrations flown in
unique situations.
1.7. MAJCOMs will submit proposals to change AFI 11-246, Vol 6, to change the existing standard pro-
files, or to create entirely new profiles for aircraft capabilities demonstrations to HQ AMC (OPR: AMC/
A33O, DSN 779-2089)—AMC/CC delegates approval authority to AMC/A3. Proposals should be
approved at the MAJCOM before being submitted to HQ AMC. Once approved at HQ AMC, change pro-
posals are forwarded to AF/XO for final approval.
2.5.3. If neither an ACT nor an on-scene ground supervisor (or Air Boss) are available, the MAJCOM can
assign an additional pilot or navigator to the aircrew to perform an airborne critique and forward the
results to the appropriate headquarters level.
2.5.4. If the proposed guidelines in paragraphs 2.5.1 through 2.5.3, above, are not workable or not practi-
cal for a given situation, a final alternative is to simply ask the aircrew about their flying performance
upon their return to home station (i.e., interview the aircrew). The purpose of the interview is to ascertain
the aircrew’s own assessment of their flying performance—an appropriate level of leadership within the
wing to which the aircrew is assigned will conduct the interview. The results will be forwarded to the
appropriate headquarters level. The MAJCOM will develop this procedure in the MAJCOM supplement
or CONOPS to this instruction, specifying the level of wing leadership to conduct the interview and the
headquarters level to which the feedback will be forwarded.
3.1. The Standard Profiles for the C/KC/NKC-135, C-141, C-130, C-17 and UH-1N aircraft are at
https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3o/A33O/index.htm, the AMC web site (A33O home page). Click on
the desired MDS aircraft to view a specific standard profile. The profiles are based on the aircraft capabil-
ities demonstrations listed in paragraph 1.4., having been compiled from basic flying maneuvers common
to the MDS selected. The profiles by MDS are summarized here.
4. C-130 Hercules. Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration (airdrop) flown by a single-ship
C-130 or a C-130 formation. A C-130 formation may contain multiple elements involving a number of
aircraft up to the limits authorized by DoD, USAF and AMC guidance. Mission planners may use any
combination of C-130 single-ships and formations to airdrop heavy equipment (HE), Container Delivery
System (CDS) supply containers and personnel—all as part of the same capabilities demonstration—to
present the full range of C-130 delivery capabilities. The aircraft capabilities demonstrated include: Per-
sonnel airdrop (HALO / Static Line); Equipment airdrop (heavy equipment / CDS); Random steep or
shallow approach; Assault landing; Backing demonstration (optional ERO or upload); and, Assault take-
off (maximum effort takeoff). Profile 2 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration that starts with an assault
takeoff (maximum effort takeoff) and includes the following: Random shallow or steep approach; Assault
landing; Backing demonstration (optional ERO or upload); and, Optional assault takeoff (maximum effort
takeoff). Profile 3 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration starting with a C-130 already airborne and
includes the following: Random shallow or steep approach; Assault landing; Backing demonstration
(optional ERO or upload); and, Optional assault takeoff (maximum effort takeoff).

3.5. C-17 Globemaster. Profiles 1, 2, and 3 are aircraft capabilities demonstrations involving the perfor-
mance maneuvering of the aircraft in a runway environment, each with a different duration: 6, 10, and, 12
minutes, respectively. Profile 4 depicts three separate aircraft capabilities demonstrations—basic airdrop,
overhead pattern to a simulated short-field landing (optional backing demonstration and ERO/upload),
and, an assault takeoff (maximum effort takeoff). The airdrop demonstration is flown by a single-ship
C-17 or a C-17 formation. A C-17 formation may contain multiple elements involving a number of air-
craft up to the limits authorized by DoD, USAF and AMC guidance. Mission planners may use any com-
bination of C-17 single-ships and formations to airdrop heavy equipment (HE), Container Delivery
System (CDS) supply containers and personnel—all as part of the same capabilities demonstration—to
present the full range of C-17 delivery capabilities.
3.6. UH-1 Iroquois. All demonstrations will be performed over a runway or open area (taxiway, grass
infield, etc.) at a military or civilian airfield, or over an open area not associated with an airfield that meets
USAF/FAA requirements for a helicopter landing site or flight demonstration site. All profiles involving
Alternate Insertion/Extractions (AIE) may include actual insertion and extraction of qualified personnel.
Authorized AIEs are those listed in AFI 11-2H-1, Vol 3, Helicopter Operations, and MAJCOM supple-
ments. They will be performed at an altitude consistent with the unit's mission and governing directives.
Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration highlighting a steep approach to landing (optional
maneuvers include a hover or AIE demonstration) followed by a maximum performance takeoff and
departure. As a guide, the hover demonstration is performed at approximately four feet and may include a
180o turn about the transmission, a 180o turn about the nose and a 360o turn about the tail (all with a max-
imum turn rate of 90 degrees in four seconds). Profile 2 is flown as a single-ship or a formation. The size
and composition of the formation will be similar to that required by the unit's typical operational or train-
ing mission profile. The aircraft or formation approaches the landing area low-level at 90 KIAS. The crew
performs a tactical approach and quick-stop maneuver, followed by a landing or AIE demonstration. After
the landing or AIE is complete, the aircrew egresses the area with a tactical departure. Profile 3 consists
of a fire suppression demonstration using the “Bambi Bucket.” Simulated employment altitudes and air-
speeds will be IAW MAJCOM procedures—the fire is simulated. The aircraft then departs the area. Pro-
file 4 demonstrates a basic static line and/or HALO personnel airdrop and is performed over a
Service-approved drop zone or over a military or civilian airfield. Following release, the helicopter
departs the area.

Terms
Aerial Performance—A subset of Aviation Support involving the exhibition of an aircraft in flight. This
generic phrase includes virtually every type of aerial participation in military or civilian events: flyover,
aerial review and aircraft capabilities demonstration (see definitions, below, for each of these). See Table
A-1, below.
Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration—An aerial performance in which an aircraft (fixed or rotary wing)
conducts maneuvers usually associated with its employment and which are common to the airframe being
shown. The purpose is to illustrate the unique flying capabilities of the aircraft. Aircraft capabilities dem-
onstration includes the following: Aerobatics; Assault Landing; Assault Takeoff; Maximum Performance
Takeoff; Tactical Takeoff; Tactical Departure; Aircraft High Performance Maneuvering; Personnel Air-
drop (High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or Static Line); Equipment Airdrop; Container Delivery Sys-
tem (CDS) Airdrop; Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration; and, Helicopter Flight Demonstrations
consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel Alternate

Insertion/Extraction (AIE). Engine Running Offload (ERO) and Aircraft Backing maneuvers are also air-
craft capabilities demonstrations when executed as part of an aerial performance scenario that includes
ground operations. The following phrases are synonymous with the phrase “aircraft capabilities demon-
stration” and can be used interchangeably: Aerial Demonstration (Aerial Demo); Aircraft Demonstration;
Capabilities Demonstration; and, [Aircraft] Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX). See Table A-1, below.
Aviation Support—Aviation support is an overarching class of aviation-related activities, including
exhibits or displays, provided to military or civil event sponsors. It includes the following categories: 1)
Aircraft static display; and, 2) Aerial performance. Aerial Performance is broken down as follows: 1)
Parachute Demonstration Team; 2) Flyover; 3) Aerial review; and, 4) Aircraft Capabilities Demonstra-
tion. A whole family of flying activities falls under Aircraft Capabilities Demonstration (See definition,
above, and Table A-1, below).
Civil Event—Affairs or occurrences that are of, pertaining to, or befitting ordinary citizens and associ-
ated with ordinary community life, as distinguished from the military—in essence, they are non-military,
civilian occasions and can be either domestic (i.e., U.S.) or foreign.
Funeral Service, Memorial Service or Memorial Flyover—An aerial performance consisting of a sin-
gle-pass flyover at a funeral service, memorial service or memorial event, respectively, by a single aircraft
or by as single formation (up to four aircraft). The formation may be flown as a missing-man formation,
with the appropriate approval.
High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Airdrop Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration
involving the airdrop of a qualified parachute demonstration team from an altitude prescribed in the
team's governing directives (usually above 5,000 AGL). The parachutists free fall to a predetermined alti-
tude before deploying their parachutes to complete the descent.
Military Event—A U.S. military affair, celebration, occasion or ceremony held on a DoD installation and
serving to celebrate military traditions (retreat ceremonies, military parades, changes of command, dedi-
cations of military schools or building, etc.), to formally recognize a military member or group (military
funeral services, memorial services, memorial occasions, etc.) or to display Air Force resources or capa-
bilities (base Open House event, CAPSTONE Aerospace Power Demonstration, etc.). Military events
may or may not be open to the general public. Military events sponsored by other nations will be clearly
referred to as “foreign military events.”
