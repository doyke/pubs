                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Evaluation Processes. The 576 FLTS will develop processes to conduct evaluations of test
operations personnel to validate training and provide feedback to the individuals and squadron
on a team member’s demonstrated performance in order to fulfill evaluation program
requirements outlined in this instruction.
     2.1.1. Upon completion of training for a specific test operation, the test team must be
     evaluated prior to mission certification and subsequent test execution.
     2.1.2. Only certified evaluators, or personnel under the supervision of a certified evaluator,
     will conduct and document mission certification evaluations.
     2.1.3. The 576 FLTS will develop and maintain a Plan of Evaluation (POE) to guide
     evaluations and implement evaluation program requirements outlined in this instruction.
2.2. Evaluation Categories. Evaluations given by the 576 FLTS will fall into one of two
specific categories.
     2.2.1. Full-Check. Full-check evaluations are given to test operations personnel following
     mission certification training (MCT).
     2.2.2. Special-Check. Special-check evaluations are given to evaluate specific tasks or to
     fulfill corrective action requirements.
2.3. Evaluation Types.
     2.3.1. Launch Team Certification Evaluation. Launch team certification evaluations are full-
     check evaluations given in the Countdown Procedures Trainer (CPT) to determine
     proficiency and capability of test operations personnel upon completion of MCT.
        2.3.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, the 576 FLTS will ensure all required (“R”)
        JPRs, as specified in the JPRL, and associated with a specific mission or test operation
        are evaluated.
     2.3.2. Mission Director (MD) Certification Evaluation. MD certification evaluations are
     full-check evaluations given to determine proficiency and capability of MDs upon

                                             Chapter 3

                      EVALUATOR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION

3.1. Training and Certification Program. The evaluator training and certification program is
designed to instruct and evaluate test operations evaluators on the proper manner by which to
correctly assess test team proficiency.
     3.1.1. Evaluators will complete the appropriate training program before certification.
3.2. Evaluator Training Requirements. Evaluator trainees will be observed and supervised by
a certified evaluator during all evaluator training activities.
     3.2.1. Prior to certification, evaluator trainees must accomplish the following actions:
        3.2.1.1. Observe a minimum of one evaluation conducted by a certified evaluator.
            3.2.1.1.1. Evaluation examinations will not satisfy the observation requirement.
            3.2.1.1.2. Observing an evaluation includes participation in pre- and post-evaluation
            activities and error determination requirements.
        3.2.1.2. Evaluator trainees must receive instruction on the following items:
            3.2.1.2.1. Evaluator Responsibilities.
            3.2.1.2.2. Evaluation presentation techniques.

        50% of the training sessions for any mission or test operation for which they were never
        certified. For example, an individual with software operations testing background would
        need to attend five operational test launch certification training sessions prior to
        evaluating an operational test launch.
3.3. Evaluator Certification. Only certified evaluators or evaluator trainees under direct
supervision of a certified evaluator may conduct and document operations evaluations.
Evaluators will be trained, observed, recommended and appointed for certification.

   4.1.2. Scenarios administered to an individual or team may consist of a single task, a group
   of tasks strung together or multiple tasks occurring simultaneously.
   4.1.3. Evaluation scenario results are based on crew member performance on each task or
   subtask with respect to the applicable performance standard.
4.2. Evaluation Scenario Conduct. Evaluators will ensure all scenario stimuli are presented as
written in the script and will provide a fair and unbiased evaluation of the crew.
   4.2.1. Evaluators will ensure the team being evaluated will only use approved training
   materials or job aids during an evaluation.
   4.2.2. During an evaluation, the evaluators will ensure evaluatees are not challenged,
   corrected, or prompted as to the validity of the actions performed except to provide proper
   weapon system status.
       4.2.2.1. If the team under evaluation in the CPT passes direction to another agency, that
       agency should take the actions directed by the team regardless if the direction is
       incorrect.
   4.2.3. Evaluatees are only permitted to ask questions to clarify a stimulus. Evaluators will
   not give more information than would normally be available or that would prompt a
   response.
   4.2.4. Evaluatees will be given the opportunity to correctly perform the action or to take an
   incorrect action; however, evaluators must intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to
   any equipment. Errors will be assessed in accordance with Chapter 5 of this publication.
   4.2.5. During an evaluation, the evaluator may ask questions to clarify an evaluatee’s
   response to a task. Evaluators will ensure questions will not interfere with team actions or
   prompt the evaluatee.
   4.2.6. Evaluators must always provide status that team members would normally detect with
   their senses (e.g., heat, air, smoke, etc.) when it cannot be simulated by the CPT. Status
   cards will be used to the maximum extent possible. Evaluators will ensure proper
   configuration is programmed whenever possible or briefed to the evaluatees.
4.3. Evaluation Scripts. The 576 FLTS will design and use scripts to conduct evaluation
scenarios. Unit-level evaluations will verify proficiency and validate unit training through
scenarios that adhere to technical orders (T.O.s) and all higher-headquarters evaluation
standards.
   4.3.1. All simulation materials will be marked as such.
AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  11


   4.3.2. Scripts will contain valid stimuli. Stimuli will be identified by JPR, task description,
   scenario support personnel initiation and response agencies and notes or expected responses
   (e.g., evaluator notes and expected evaluatee response).
       4.3.2.1. Estimated scenario run times are for scenario presentation only and do not
       establish a time standard for completing actions. Applicable proficiency time standards
       must be annotated within the script.
       4.3.2.2. Scripts must have a plan for presentation of problem sequences and events that
       specify instructions for evaluators and CPT operators. Scripts will include instructions for
       simulated inputs, status cards or briefings and will identify proper team responses.
   4.3.3. Evaluators should follow the script as written. However, if following the script as it is
   written causes inaccurate presentation, use evaluator judgment and provide accurate status.
   4.3.4. Use status cards or briefings to introduce stimuli that cannot be presented in a more
   realistic manner. Cards and briefs must not prompt, but must have enough information for the
   evaluatee to clearly understand the input.
   4.3.5. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety, cause
   equipment damage or result in mission degradation.
   4.3.6. Simulate realistic operational environments requiring evaluatees to prioritize actions.
       4.3.6.1. Multiple inputs may be introduced to determine a team’s capability to establish
       priorities. Do not inject unrelated tasks or status (e.g., two events occurring
       simultaneously where one task does not logically lead to another) while the team is
       accomplishing critical phases of performance. This does not preclude the presentation of
       expected follow-on weapon system indications related to previous inputs, provided those
       indications do not directly interfere with the team's ability to execute its critical actions.
   4.3.7. Scripts must be fully coordinated with scenario support personnel and all other
   participating or approval agencies prior to being used for documented training.
4.4. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the evaluators to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of an evaluation.
   4.4.1. Evaluators will conduct a pre-brief for evaluatees to set the environment of the
   evaluation and to ensure the evaluatees clearly understand expectations, responsibilities,
   limitations and other rules of engagement before being administered the evaluation.
   4.4.2. Safety and operational requirements take priority over simulated activities.
       4.4.2.1. Evaluators will intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to equipment.
       Additionally, for evaluations conducted in the operational environment, evaluators will
       intervene to prevent mission failure or degradation.
   4.4.3. Evaluators may use briefings as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario
   presentation and to alleviate the crew from performing unnecessary actions.
       4.4.3.1. The 576 FLTS will standardize phrases used during evaluation breaks, between
       script events and termination. Standardized verbiage eliminates evaluator prompting that
       could occur when a team has not completed all required actions before evaluation
       termination.
 12                                                    AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012


       4.4.3.2. If the team has correctly accomplished a task, the task re-occurs, and is not
       intended to be evaluated again, an evaluator may brief the task accomplished when the
       team identifies the requirement to re-accomplish the task.
       4.4.3.3. If a task is not intended to be evaluated, and is not the result of a team’s incorrect
       action, evaluators may brief the task accomplished when the team identifies the
       requirement to accomplish the task.
4.5. Evaluation Scenario Termination. Once an evaluation is started, all efforts will be made
by the evaluator to complete the evaluation.
   4.5.1. Situations may arise in which early evaluation termination would be required.
   Evaluations terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally
   stopped, or the evaluation may be completely re-accomplished.
   4.5.2. Before deviating from the approved script and terminating the evaluation, the
   evaluators must determine if the minimum evaluation requirements outlined in paragraph 2.3.
   have been met to warrant a valid evaluation.
4.6. Outbriefing the Evaluatee. The outbrief provides qualification ratings and feedback to the
evaluatee and the evaluation program.
   4.6.1. Evaluators will brief results to the certifying official as soon as practical after
   completion of an evaluation.
       4.6.1.1. The outbrief should include discussion of positive performance, strengths, any
       noted deficiencies, root causes, areas for improvement and direct/indirect impacts to the
       mission, personnel, and other organizations.
          4.6.1.1.1. The certifying official may direct or request additional training and
          evaluation regardless of rating.
4.7. Operational Evaluations. Operational evaluations are conducted in an operational
environment by evaluating tasks based on actual status as it occurs and those tasks directed by
technical orders or regulations.
   4.7.1. Prior to conducting an evaluation scenario in the operational environment, units must
   gauge impact to mission operations before dispatching evaluators. Units will use risk
   management processes to ensure decisions mitigate any adverse operational impact and
   unnecessary operational risks are avoided.
   4.7.2. Safety and operational actions take priority over simulated actions. Evaluators will
   intervene to prevent a safety hazard, damage to equipment, mission failure or degradation.
   4.7.3. If the evaluatee does not react to situations requiring immediate crew response to
   prevent personnel injury, damage to equipment, or mission degradation, the evaluators will
   bring the situation to their attention as follows:
       4.7.3.1. If the evaluatee is not in position to note an operational status change, the
       evaluator will immediately bring it to their attention. Do not assess a deficiency for
       bringing the status change to the evaluatee's attention.
       4.7.3.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, but does not
       act, the evaluator will immediately bring it to his or her attention. If in the opinion of the
AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                            13


     evaluator the individual had sufficient time to observe the status change and failed to
     recognize or take appropriate action, assess and rate the appropriate task deficiency.
  4.7.4. If the evaluatee does not react to operational situations not covered by paragraph
  4.7.3., the evaluators will bring the situation to their attention as follows:
     4.7.4.1. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, and the
     response has an associated time standard, bring the status change to their attention after
     the evaluatee has had reasonable time to note the change. Evaluators will assess the
     appropriate deficiency.
     4.7.4.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, and the
     response has no associated time standard, bring the status change to their attention after
     evaluation phase termination and assess the appropriate deficiency.

                        OTL EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

5.1. Evaluation Documentation. Evaluation documentation provides a means to identify
trends, track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s
supervisor and serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
   5.1.1. An AFGSC Form 94, OTL Evaluation and Corrective Action Worksheet, or other
   standardized evaluation report will be used for each evaluated test team member to document
   details of administered evaluations/observations.
      5.1.1.1. In addition to evaluator and evaluatee information, the following information
      will be included on the evaluation report:
          5.1.1.1.1. All errors will be documented. Errors will be documented against the task
          or subtask for which the error is attributed.
             5.1.1.1.1.1. If a test team recognizes the status change but fails to perform a
             required task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that
             should have been performed.
             5.1.1.1.1.2. If a test team recognizes the status change but performs the wrong
             task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that should have
             been performed. However, give credit to the task or subtask that was performed.
             5.1.1.1.1.3. If a test team does not recognize a status change and a resulting task
             or subtask requirement, document the error against the required task or subtask
             that should have been accomplished.
             5.1.1.1.1.4. When the task or subtask being performed directs transition to
             another task or subtask and the evaluatee fails to perform the subsequent task or
             subtask or fails to identify the requirement to transition, document the error
             against the task or subtask that directed the transition.
             5.1.1.1.1.5. If a test team performs an unnecessary task or subtask, which causes
             or results in an error, document the error against the unnecessary task or subtask
             being performed.
             5.1.1.1.1.6. Error descriptions on the evaluation report will be unclassified.
          5.1.1.1.2. The evaluation report will identify the script or examination presented and
          evaluators will list all tasks and subtasks exposed during the conduct of each
          evaluation.
             5.1.1.1.2.1. A test team member will receive credit for a JPR by performing any
             portion of a task, regardless if a checklist is used or if all actions are contained
             within another checklist.
             5.1.1.1.2.2. Evaluators awarding JPR credit are documenting the crew was
             exposed to a portion of the task.
AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  15


          5.1.1.1.3. A place must be provided for the certifying official to document
          requirements for corrective actions, restricted status, and/or requalification
          evaluations as a result of the evaluation.
          5.1.1.1.4. An evaluation type must be listed for each individual.
   5.1.2. Evaluation reports will be maintained in the Individual Qualification Folder (IQF) for
   each evaluatee.
       5.1.2.1. The 576 FLTS will maintain copies of all evaluation reports for trend analysis.
       5.1.2.2. The evaluation report will be coordinated through all appropriate agencies to
       ensure all evaluatee records are kept current.
5.2. Error Determination. Upon completion of an evaluation, evaluators will identify, assess
and document errors.
   5.2.1. Error determination must be based upon the actions or inactions of the evaluatee.
   5.2.2. When the evaluatee causes a script deviation and an error results, evaluators will
   assess the error.
       5.2.2.1. If a crew takes multiple incorrect actions that lead to an action warranting a more
       severe error, assess only the highest degree error, and fully describe the other incorrect
       actions in the error description (commonly referred to as snowballing).
   5.2.3. Assess errors to only one test team member when, in the evaluator’s judgment, the
   other test team members were not in a position to detect and had no requirement to detect the
   incorrect action.
   5.2.4. Use the Deficiency Codes in Attachment 3 of AFGSCI 13-5303v1 to describe why an
   evaluatee committed an error.
   5.2.5. Evaluators will use definitions and/or examples of errors in paragraphs 5.4. through
   5.5. for error determinations.
   5.2.6. If the evaluators through the Chief, ICBM Test Stan/Eval cannot ascertain how to
   assess an error for an on-going evaluation, the evaluators will conduct a formal review with
   the 576 FLTS/CC. If resolution cannot been reached, a formal request for error
   determination must be initiated with HQ AFGSC/A3T.
5.3. Error Consummation. Evaluation errors will not be assessed based on possible
consequences of incorrect test team actions, but on the actions themselves.
   5.3.1. Errors are based on decision points and may be consummated upon task completion,
   at clock advances or check phase termination.
       5.3.1.1. Errors will be assessed on incorrect actions at the point of consummation
       regardless of the scripted outcome.
       5.3.1.2. If a clock advance would remove the team’s ability to accomplish a required
       action or would result in error consummation, the evaluator will use evaluator judgment
       prior to advancing the clock.
 16                                                   AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012


   5.3.2. If a script is written to brief a crew out of actions but the crew has performed an
   incorrect action that could impact future events, allow the crew to continue their actions
   through consummation of the error.
   5.3.3. If a test team takes an incorrect action, document the appropriate error. If recovery to
   a less severe error is possible, evaluators will allow the test team the opportunity to correct
   their action.
       5.3.3.1. An incorrect report to an outside entity can be corrected to no error if the test
       team takes corrective actions prior to termination of the report or call. If the crew takes
       corrective actions prior to expiration of any timing standard, clock advance or evaluation
       termination, recovery to a less severe error is possible.
       5.3.3.2. If the test team transmits an incorrect command or incorrectly accomplishes an
       internal command or test, the error is consummated immediately upon the action taken
       and recovery is not possible.
       5.3.3.3. Momentary mistakes due to status monitoring, inadvertent actions, or
       miscalculations that are immediately corrected, and do not result in system degradation,
       or degradation to a redundant system, may be recoverable to a lesser severity of error.
5.4. Critical Errors. Assess a critical error when evaluatee actions result, or would reasonably
be expected to result, in operational mission failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury,
or death.
   5.4.1. A mission-critical error results in a failure to certify for a test operation. A test team
   member(s) will not be mission certified and will not perform test operations until a successful
   completion of a requalification evaluation.
   5.4.2. Some examples of critical errors are as follows:
       5.4.2.1. Failure to comply with warnings or T.O. safety precautions that could
       reasonably be expected to result in endangerment of human life, serious injury, or death.
       5.4.2.2. Allowing a test asset to be taken off-alert or shut-down when not required.
       5.4.2.3. Failure to note, initiate, direct, or coordinate corrective actions to maintain
       optimum or established system configuration, restore a system outage required to satisfy
       safety requirements or to meet a Category 1 mission objective.
       5.4.2.4. Failure to detect an outage to a system required to satisfy range safety
       requirements or to meet a Category 1 mission objective.
       5.4.2.5. Failure to report, or submitting an incorrect report in response to a change in
       system status, systems capability, or operations capability that has degraded the
       operational mission.
       5.4.2.6. Any action taken that resulted in damage to equipment or that would not allow a
       launch or the ability to prevent a launch.
       5.4.2.7. Launch of a missile when not authorized.
       5.4.2.8. Failure to achieve a passing score on an evaluation examination.
       5.4.2.9. Failure to ensure security measures are accomplished.
AFGSCI 13-5303V2 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     17


           5.4.2.9.1. Information Security (INFOSEC) and Operations Security (OPSEC).
           Examples include loss of control of classified and passing classified information over
           an unsecure line.
5.5. Minor Errors. Assess a minor error for any procedural error, omission, or deficiency
which is not significant enough to meet critical error criteria.
   5.5.1. Minor errors will be assessed regardless of operational impact.
   5.5.2. Evaluators may assess a minor error for lack of knowledge when evaluatees display a
   lack of knowledge on a procedural task that is not significant enough to meet critical error
   criteria.
5.6. Evaluation Ratings. Overall evaluation performances are rated by qualification levels.
   5.6.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the desired level of
   performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within prescribed
   tolerances.
       5.6.1.1. Criteria for a Q1 rating consist of no critical errors and three or fewer minor
       errors.
   5.6.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the ability to perform
   duties safely, but may need additional training at the discretion of the 576 FLTS/CC or 576
   FLTS/TE.
       5.6.2.1. Criteria for a Q2 rating consist of no critical errors and four or more minor
       errors.
       5.6.2.2. The level of training and other corrective actions for any errors (briefing, formal
       training or evaluation) and possible restriction for the evaluatee will be determined by the
       576 FLTS/CC or designated representative.
   5.6.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3) indicates an evaluatee is unqualified based on an
   unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
       5.6.3.1. Criteria for a Q3 rating consist of one or more critical errors.
       5.6.3.2. The level of training for any errors (briefing or formal training) will be
       determined by the 576 FLTS/CC or designated representative.
       5.6.3.3. A requalification evaluation including all tasks with critical errors is required.
       5.6.3.4. The evaluatee may not perform test operations duty until completion of
       retraining and successful completion of an evaluation on all tasks where critical errors
       were committed.
6.1. Critical Error during operations.
   6.1.1. Critical errors committed during operations will be handled at the commander’s
   discretion.
