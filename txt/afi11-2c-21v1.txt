    school syllabuses and is the approval authority for any changes in coordination with lead and
    user commands according to AFI 11-202v1. AMC is responsible for FTU formal school
    course requirements, training tasks, quota control and Aircrew Training System (ATS)
    contract management in coordination with lead and user commands. AMC/A3 designates
    AMC/A3T to oversee formal school courses and syllabus management in coordination with
    the ATS contractor. Monitor all actions associated with the C-21 training program through
    close coordination with AMC/A3T. Formal school syllabi are available from AMC/A3TA or
    the FTU. AMC/A3TF manages the Programmed Flying Training (PFT) process and
    determines the formal school capacity.
       1.4.2.1. Progress Review (PR). See AFI 11-202v1. AMC/A3T will notify the student’s
       gaining unit of PR action. If the PR recommends a Flying Evaluation Board, AMC/A3T
       will notify the student’s gaining MAJCOM.
       1.4.2.2. AETC maintains a list of formal school courses on the ETCA web site. The site
       address is: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
       1.4.2.3. Post-graduate Critiques.    AETC/A3Z maintains the Aircrew Graduate
       Evaluation Program (AGEP) on-line. FTU will notify gaining unit commanders when a
       survey is available for completion. Gaining unit commanders will ensure surveys are
       completed 90 days following initial qualification and 30 days following instructor pilot
       qualification. The purpose of AGEP is to ensure the quality and effectiveness of training
       provided by the FTU.

AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                 9


  1.4.4. Wing Commander. WG/CC will ensure unit/local level agencies and facilities support
  aircrew ground training programs. Host and/or co-located units will develop local
  agreements to consolidate aircrew training support base-wide.
  1.4.5. Operations Group.
     1.4.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will convene a Training Review Panel (TRP) to be
     chaired by the OG/CC or a designated representative. Panel members should include
     representatives from squadron training, tactics, operations, safety and other areas as
     determined by the commander, e.g. ATS contractors, Host Aviation Resource
     Management (HARM) and Squadron Resource Management (SARM).
         1.4.5.1.1. TRP Requirements. Convene the TRP semi-annually and maintain
         minutes for a period of two years (commanders may increase this frequency as
         required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated with their OG may conduct
         their own panel or provide representation to the OG TRP. Forward panel minutes
         from non-collocated squadron TRP to the OG for inclusion in the OG TRP.
         1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
         actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.
         Suggested TRP topics include, but are not limited to, current and forecast Flight
         Training Levels, (FTL), Upgrade and Continuation Training status, Semi-Annual
         requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander,
         Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. OG/CC’s should review all ―X‖ events for
         relevancy to the unit’s mission during the TRP. This review will be documented in
         the TRP minutes.
     1.4.5.2. OG/CC will develop and maintain procedures with their local servicing Military
     Personnel Flight (MPF) for individual crewmember counseling and personnel system
     updates affecting an Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) incurred from training
     described in this AFI. See AFI 11-202v1, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
     Commitments, and course listing in ETCA for more information.
     1.4.5.3. OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include such requirements in a
     local supplement to this AFI.
     1.4.5.4. The operations group, in coordination with the flying squadrons will determine
     the functions and responsibilities of the operations support squadron (OSS) training
     flight, where established. Any operations group training functions stipulated in this
     instruction may also be performed by appropriate OSS training flight personnel.
     1.4.5.5. OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic training
     program for non-ATS courses (may be delegated to squadron level). The OG (or
     squadron) OPR will:
         1.4.5.5.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-ATS course to be
         taught.
         1.4.5.5.2. Publish a ground training schedule (ANG as required) to include date,
         time, location, instructor and designated crewmembers for each course (both ATS and
         non-ATS). Units may include such details in a local supplement to this AFI.
10                                                             AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012


         1.4.5.5.3. Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course
         content, currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids.
         Squadrons recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or additional
         academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback.
         1.4.5.5.4. Instructor Selection and Training. OG/CC will select course instructors for
         non-ATS courses on the basis of professional qualifications and aptitude to teach.
         Local academic instructor program will follow guidance in AFMAN 36-2236,
         Guidebook for Air Force Instructors. An individual who instructs a class receives
         credit for that academic training requirement.
         1.4.5.5.5. Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses
         through appropriate channels to appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy to
         AMC/A3T.
  1.4.6. Squadrons/Units. SQ/CC (or designated representative) will:
     1.4.6.1. Select DOT Chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
     Previous Evaluator or FTU experience is highly desired. ARC units with a single
     squadron may use the OST Chief for this purpose.
     1.4.6.2. Ensure squadron DOT is manned with a minimum of one instructor pilot.
     Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability, and time on station to
     ensure continuity of operations. ARC units with a single squadron may use the OST
     Chief for this purpose.
     1.4.6.3. Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the SQ/CC
     and/or SQ/DO. Panel members should include representatives from squadron training,
     squadron stan/eval, ADOs and instructors. SQ/CCs should utilize the STRP to focus
     training objectives, ensure standards are being met, select upgrade candidates, and ensure
     completion of required continuation training.
         1.4.6.3.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly and
         maintain minutes for a period of two years. STRP minutes will be approved by the
         SQ/CC and may be produced/distributed/stored electronically by the SQ/DOT. ANG
         units may conduct STRP on a quarterly basis.
         1.4.6.3.2. STRP Format.         The STRP should review staff and crewmember
         management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
         programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
         current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
         upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
         level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but
         are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training
         (i.e. crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including
         performance during training and current certification status), future training
         (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current waivers,
         projected waivers, and continuation training status.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                      11


      1.4.6.4. Commanders will ensure crewmembers complete training in accordance with
      Table 1.2. Training Time Limitations. Failure to reasonably progress may require action
      for removal.
      1.4.6.5. Commanders will assign Flying Training Levels (FTL), and levels of
      qualification (evaluator, instructor, etc.) to assigned and attached crewmembers before
      each semiannual training period. Base TL assignments on pilot experience and aircraft
      proficiency. Use the date of the initial qualification in-flight evaluation for determining
      an individual’s time in the Mission Design Series (MDS).
      1.4.6.6. Commanders will ensure effective training continuity and supervision of
      assigned and attached crewmember. Commanders may assign additional requirements
      based on individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency.
      1.4.6.7. Commanders or director of operations will review training and evaluation
      records of newly assigned crewmembers and those completing formal training, to
      determine the necessary training required to complete or certify the individual as Basic
      Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR).
      1.4.6.8. Approve squadron-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction.
      1.4.6.9. Progress Review Board (PRB). If at any time during a trainee’s flight
      instruction, progress is considered unsatisfactory, the responsible unit will convene a
      PRB to review the trainee’s record and determine whether to continue, modify, terminate
      training, or conduct a Flight Evaluation Board or Aircrew Evaluation Board. For ATS
      instruction, see Chapter 6.
      1.4.6.10. Coordinate with the group training function in developing training programs.
      1.4.6.11. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for Flight Surgeons
      (FS).
      1.4.6.12. Ensure DOT or DOT designated representatives monitor quality of training,
      document waivers, identify training deficiencies, and advise the Sq/CC of additional
      training needs.
   1.4.7. Formal School with Aircrew Training Systems Contractor (ATS). The C-21 Aircrew
   Training System (ATS) contractor is responsible for academic and aircrew training device
   (ATD) instruction at the ATS site. This responsibility includes developing, updating and
   publishing courseware and supporting documents in accordance with the ATS contract.
1.5. Waiver Authority.
   1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this AFI. Report deviations
   without a waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T who, in turn, should notify the OPR
   (lead command), for follow-on action, if necessary.

   1.5.3. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for flying hour prerequisites for entry into in-
   unit upgrade courses (see Table 5.1).
       1.5.3.1. AMC/A3 designated AMC/A3T as waiver authority for flying training syllabus
       and formal school prerequisites (EXCEPTION: senior officer syllabus). All requests for
       a syllabus waiver must include supporting rationale. User command training staff should
       submit prerequisite waiver requests direct to AMC/A3T. All waivers must be approved
       before the crewmember departs for formal training. File a copy of all waivers in the
       individual’s training folder.
       1.5.3.2. If required for unit’s designated mission, accomplish events waived at formal
       school in-unit before assigning mission-ready (MR) status.
   1.5.4. Senior Officer Course (SOC). SOC and syllabus waiver authority is AMC/A3 with
   concurrence of gaining MAJCOM/A3. IAW AFI 11-202v1, waiver authority for attending
   SOC qualification courses is AF A3O-A.
   1.5.5. Continuation Training. The OG/CC or ANG-equivalent is designated waiver
   authority for training requirements listed in Table 4.4 for assigned or attached aircrew.
   OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver for ground training events
   (the training should be completed at the earliest opportunity). See paragraph 4.10, of this
   instruction. Waivers for training events missed in consecutive semi-annual training periods
   require MAJCOM approval.
   1.5.6. In-Unit Training Waiver. Waivers must be approved by MAJCOM training staff (or
   equivalent) on a case-by-case basis.
       1.5.6.1. Before requesting a waiver, review the appropriate syllabus and consider
       availability of formal instruction and ATD requirements.
       1.5.6.2. In the text of the waiver request, identify the shortfall of formal training
       availability and the operational impact if an in-unit waiver is not approved.
   1.5.7. Waiver Format. For AMC units use on-line waiver request service on AMC/A3T web
   site: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers. If necessary, submit a written request
   through OG/CC or equivalent in the format at Figure 1.1, to the appropriate MAJCOM OPR.
   Asterisked (*) items are required for processing. Place copies of MAJCOM approved waiver
   information in the individual's training folder or FEF. OG/CC or designated unit agency will
   maintain a permanent record of approved waiver(s). Retain unit file copies for two years.

NOTES:
1. May run concurrently with mission qualification training.
   1.7.1. Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly
   contributing to qualification and upgrade: e.g. Computer-based training (CBT) lesson,
   ground training, flight, etc.), or 45 days (90 days ANG) after being attached or assigned to
   the unit after completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first (or as specified in
   MAJCOM supplement). TDY days spent at SV-80A, SV-86A and SV-90 do not count
   against the mission qualification timeline limitations. Training time ends with an evaluation
   or instructor sign-off. . For USAFE units, timing for MQT will start on the first training work
   day after completing base in-processing and/or permissive TDY IAW MAJCOM
   supplement.
   1.7.2. Unit/CC may extend training time up to 60 days (120 days ANG); no notification to
   MAJCOM/A3T is required. Extensions exceeding the Unit/CC-extended 60 days require
   MAJCOM//A3T approval (120 days for ANG units). Units will notify the appropriate
   MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) in writing or via AMC/A3T web site BEFORE the
   crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits.
       1.7.2.1. Use the waiver request format shown in Figure 1.1 or MAJCOM equivalent.
       Include training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and
       estimated completion date.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                   15


1.8. Training Documentation. Units will use the AF IMT 4324, Aviation Resource
Management System (ARMS) Upgrade Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS.
Block 22 will be used to document award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers. Specifically,
block 11 will contain the following minimum information: ―Q‖ code (i.e. QXXX), Certification
Name (i.e. Tactics), and date of certification. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. See
Attachment 2 for additional training documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight examiners as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. If an examiner is used as a primary instructor to
train an individual or makes the recommendation for evaluation, the same evaluator should not
administer the associated evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below). Instructors must be current and
   qualified in any event that they instruct. Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructors are only
   required to maintain BMC.
   1.10.2. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor pilot.
       1.10.2.1. All non-current crewmembers (See paragraph 4.2.4).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training on
       training syllabus sorties or missions. (EXCEPTION: Not required during Observation
       mission when not seated or required to be seated at a set of controls).
       1.10.2.3. All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8,
       Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, as prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
       Standardization/Evaluation Program Organization and Administration.
       1.10.2.4. For FTL E crewmembers, an instructor will be at a set of controls during
       critical phases of flight.
       1.10.2.5. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
1.11. Distribution. Units may establish hard copy distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. When a crewmember transfers from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review, assess and assign the appropriate TL.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is "duty not involving
flying (DNIF)" may complete ground training events. Crewmembers may receive credit for
ground and flight training events while attending simulator training, if the member's physical
condition allows it.     Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty, action (prescribed by AFI 48-123,
Medical Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Program Requirements Document (PRD). According to AFI 11-412, Aircrew
   Management, USAF/A3O projects long-range training requirements annually in a process
   called the PRD. Lead and user commands contribute to the PRD, which becomes a key long-
 16                                                            AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012


   range planning tool for training requirements. See AFI 11-202v1 for guidance on the
   Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) and aircrew rated management process.
   1.14.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AMC/A3 designates AMC/A3T to manage
   the C-21 PFT process in coordination with lead and user commands. The PFT balances
   available training quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacity and course requirements on
   a Fiscal Year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements to their respective
   MAJCOM training staff, who in turn forward projects to the PFT manager at AMC/A3TF.
       1.14.2.1. USAF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference (normally held in early
       December for the following fiscal year) for attendees to consider training capacity,
       MAJCOM training requests, and pipeline students. Upon validation, AMC/A3T
       approves the PFT and allocates quotas to lead and each user command, who in turn
       allocate training quotas to each unit. AMC/A3T will publish the annual PFT quota
       workbook on the AMC CoP.
       1.14.2.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and PFT managers use
       assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into the MDS
       formal school classes. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on
       "Quota Management" documents.
1.15. Information Management. AMC Aircrew Training Division (AMC/A3T) manages a
host    of   aircrew   information.  The    A3T    Division  CoP  is   located at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a Progress Review
(PR). The PR can recommend continuation in training or AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action, e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to the
individual’s unit commander. The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to progress
IAW the applicable ATS contract as outlined in Chapter 6. If a crewmember fails to complete a
formal course the formal school will send a recommendation to the individual’s unit. The
recommendation will state whether he should complete training in-unit, return to the formal
school to complete training, or be referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment.
1.17. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC’s
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program , 36-2107, AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management, and is
mandatory for all AMC units. For USAFE units please follow USAFE/A3T guidance.
   1.17.1. Training allocations requirements will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF
   quota manager NLT 30 Sep for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and
   crosscheck requests with the Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS). The results are
   internally coordinated and submitted to AETC and Air Staff during the annual Graduate
   Program Requirements Document (GPRD) data call and the annual Programmed Flying
   Training (PFT) conference.
   1.17.2. AMC/A3TF will breakout the command quota allocations from the approved PFT
   according to requirements, requested number, PAMS data, training review panel (TRP)
   submissions, and overall allocation. The initial draft will be sent to the Operations Support
   Squadron (OSS) training offices in June/July with a one-week coordination and review
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                     17


  period. The final version will be released NLT 31 July. Changes past this point are
  coordinated on a case-by-case basis.
  1.17.3. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class
  number to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any
  internal processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior
  to CSD will be offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices
  should reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to
  ensure notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders
  issued.     Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
  AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
     1.17.3.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow
     for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate
     for each allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 – 45 days
     prior to CSD, notify AMC/A3TF with the alternate’s information. If the primary
     becomes unavailable within 30 days of CSD, contact your host MPF formal training
     section to locally substitute the alternate IAW AMCI 36-2204 – provide a copy of the
     local substitution letter to AMC/A3TF.
     1.17.3.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted (they must also be
     identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement’s full data
     to AMC/A3TF.
  1.17.4. Submit requests for local upgrades/secondary method (include use of academic only
  quotas)             via                the             AMC/A3TF                  web-site:
  https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm
     1.17.4.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
     normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
     and AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement,
     is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal Training office for
     additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically generate ADSC
     requirements.
  1.17.5. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  days prior to CSD.
  1.17.6. All no-shows and late cancellations (within 7 days of CSD) must be explained.
  Report circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24 hours of course
  start date. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation from
  the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AMC.A3T@scott.af.mil and courtesy copy AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
  1.17.7. Senior Officer Training coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
  AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management

NOTES:
1. Accomplish prior to first flight; accomplish SS01 prior to first flight at unit of
assignment.
2. Once per PCS.
3. May be accomplished at FTU or unit of assignment.
4. Not required for 375 OG Det 1 or SOC graduates.
5. May be accomplished at FTU for CONUS assigned personnel (base specific
courseware must be utilized.)


2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202v1, formal school courseware, and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. Conversion/Difference
Training guidance may be found in AFI 11-202v1. When possible, qualified personnel in other
units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Initial cadre should be restricted to only those instructors and evaluators required to
establish a core training force and not to alleviate training difficulties or shortfalls. The following
conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
   2.5.1. Conversion Training. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel
   (initial cadre) to begin aircrew conversion. Converting units may request initial cadre waiver
   of PAI time requirement. Send waivers request through MAJCOM training staff following
   the format in paragraph 1.5. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft flown and total
   time in that aircraft in the remarks section.
       2.5.1.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held
       unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
       2.5.1.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors
       and flight examiners by crew qualification.
   2.5.2. Difference Training. C-21 units should apply difference qualification training (DQT)
   for major modifications (i.e., Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)-compliant avionics,
   flight management computer (FMC) differences) as directed by MAJCOM. Difference
   training may be applied to NC-21A to C-21A transfers. For fleet-wide modifications, apply
   initial cadre criteria in paragraph 2.5.1. AMC, in coordination with other MAJCOM will
   provide guidance and overprinted AF IMT 4024, Training Accomplishment Report.
   Overprinting will be done in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
   Management.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 contains multiple qualification training
guidance. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualification in different model aircraft will, as a
minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft. EXCEPTION: Senior
Officers; see paragraph 2.7
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                      21


2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 identifies senior
officer qualification requirements. These officers will be assigned FTL E for continuation
training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see paragraph
4.3.1.5).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202v1, and with OG/CC approval, senior officers
   (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or qualification.
   The unit DOT office is responsible for determining training requirements based on the senior
   officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. AMC/A3T or
   appropriate MAJCOM DOT/A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior to execution.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log
time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph
3.6 for training requirements.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (EXCEPTION: When
authorized multiple qualification). The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew
member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty Service
Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202v1 for additional re-
qualification training limits and requirements.
   2.9.1. Individuals requalifying as C-21 crewmembers will complete in-unit or formal school
   training (IAW AFI 11-202v1) and accomplish those mission certification events from Table
   2.1 and Table 3.1 that have expired or are overdue.
   2.9.2. Former C-21 instructors may accomplish instructor requalification concurrent with
   basic requalification (in-unit or formal course) for their crew position. For loss of
   qualification exceeding 39 months in all cases, all special qualifications and certifications
   must be re-accomplished.
   2.9.3. Requalification Training Courses. Unqualified crew members will complete the
   appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 (longest to shortest) courses outlined below.
       2.9.3.1. Pilot TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:
           2.9.3.1.1. Unqualified C-21 pilots (over 8 years) will complete the Initial
           Qualification (PIQ) formal school flying training course (TX-1) and a flight
           evaluation. An active duty or ANG service commitment is required.
           2.9.3.1.2. Unqualified C-21 pilots (greater than 39 months at the end of a non-flying
           assignment or 52 months at the end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years) will
           complete the Requalification (RQ) formal school flying training course (TX-2) as
           appropriate and a flight evaluation. An active duty or ANG service commitment is
           required.
           2.9.3.1.3. Unqualified C-21 pilots (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
           assignment or 52 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will complete a
           Sq/CC directed requalification (TX-3) course in-unit and a flight evaluation. Note:
           The Requalification formal school flying training courses in paragraph 2.9.3.1.2

          may be substituted for the in-unit training. An active duty or ANG service
          commitment is required if the formal course option is utilized.
              2.9.3.1.3.1. Squadron Commanders may tailor or expand the TX-3 course based
              on individual proficiency and experience. Unqualified pilots will complete
              training in all delinquent items, additional training as directed by the squadron
              commander, and a flight evaluation. The flying unit Sq/CC will determine
              requirements for accomplishment of events from Table 3.1 that are not
              continuation training events.
2.10. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Guidance. The C-21 Formal Training Unit conducts
training located at Scott AFB. Specific course information is maintained by 375 OSS/OST.
Formal syllabi, when published, will be the lead document concerning requalification courses

                           MISSION CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. Except where specifically stated, units may
arrange mission sequence or sequence of items as necessary to use flying training hours
effectively and accomplish the unit mission. Both pilots must be qualified when passengers are
on board IAW AFI 11-401.
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See paragraph 1.7 and Table 1.2. A
crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training and flying
training requirements. Additionally, Aircraft Commanders must be certified by the Sq/CC or
Review and Certification (R & C) Board before performing duties as Pilot in Command (PIC).
See AFI 11-202v2, AMC Supplement.
   3.2.1. Local training or operational missions may be flown before completing all MR items,
   provided the BAQ qualified aircrew member has completed all grounding items.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish events in Table 3.1.
All academic ground training required for mission qualification will be completed before
qualification or certification in the unit operational mission (not applicable for senior officers or
staff officers maintaining BAQ). Ensure ground training requirements in Table 2.1 are also
accomplished and tracked IAW paragraph 4.5.2.6 of this instruction prior to mission
certification.

                                            Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure crewmembers receive
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. Crewmembers are assigned Mission Ready, Basic Mission Capable, Basic
Aircraft Qualification, or Non-Mission Ready status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For SORTS reporting, operational tasking, and deployments, a
   MR crewmember is defined as an available, qualified crew member. Aircraft commander
   certification is a prerequisite to serving as a MR aircraft commander. FTU instructors must
   be qualified in the training unit mission before performing instructor duties.
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training. See paragraph 4.10 for specific guidance on
   crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training.
      4.2.2.1. If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training,
      OG/CC has two options:
          4.2.2.1.1. Waive the required training in accordance with paragraph 4.10.1 or
          4.10.3.3 The individual remains on MR status.
          4.2.2.1.2. Place the crewmember in supervised status according to paragraph 4.2.2.4
      4.2.2.2. Supervised Status. If the crewmember is NMR for failure to maintain currency
      per paragraphs 4.10.1 or 4.10.3.3, place the crewmember in supervised status for that
      event (individual flies with an instructor ) until required training is accomplished.
      EXCEPTION: Non-current crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local, routine, and
      non-contingency missions on which events in the delinquent category are not
      accomplished (OG/CC approval, not required).
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission-ready crewmember assigned to
   MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 AOC, Contingency Response Wing (CRW), AMOG,
   formal schoolhouse, or direct reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission
   qualification training and does not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the
   command or unit operational mission. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some
   aspects of the unit mission and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45
   days. See note after paragraph 4.3.1.1 for Training Level requirement. BMC crewmembers
   may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the mission for which they are current
   and qualified. Otherwise, they will log FP time.
      4.2.3.1. FTU crewmembers must comply with Table 3.1 to fly CONUS-only 618 AOC
      or Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC) directed operational missions.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A pilot (FP) that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                     27


   4.2.5. In addition to the above, MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must have accomplished
   and/or maintained the requirements in AFI 11-202v1 for their respective status, as well as all
   events listed in the applicable ground and semiannual flying continuation tables.
4.3. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
   4.3.1. The Unit/CC determines the training level (TL) (see paragraph 1.4.5.2) before each
   semi-annual period. Assign new unit crewmembers a TL during in-processing. Base the TL
   on experience and proficiency. Crewmembers may be assigned a TL that is more restrictive,
   but never less restrictive, than the requirements under this paragraph.
       4.3.1.1. FTL A -- Highly Experienced Crewmembers. (As a guide, crewmembers having
       10 or more years of operational flying experience) This may include MR or NMR
       MAJCOM headquarters and 618 AOC personnel, FTU instructors, NAF personnel,
       AMWC instructors, Wg/CC, OG/CC, and Unit/CC, operations officers, OG-level
       evaluators, and any instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Unit/CC may assign
       highly experienced MR line crewmembers to this level. NOTE: _ NMR crewmembers
       assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 AOC, AMWC, CRW, AMOGs, combat
       crew training schools (CCTS), or direct reporting unit are categorized as BMC and
       assigned to FTL A. In addition, these individuals must also accomplish annual CRM
       training requirements. These individuals may fly unsupervised on CONUS training
       missions provided they are current and qualified. They require instructor supervision on
       all other missions. If these crewmembers do not maintain MR status, they cannot log MP
       time (may log EP, IP, or FP time). If refresher simulator training requirements are not
       met, the individual must fly with an instructor of like specialty unless waived (see
       paragraph 4.10).
       4.3.1.2. FTL B – Experienced MR Crewmember. (As a guide, crewmembers having
       between 5-10 years of operational flying experience)
       4.3.1.3. FTL C -- MR Crewmember. Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers
       FTL C and individuals pursuing MR status after initial Qualification training. (As a
       guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying experience) Unit/CC
       may assign highly proficient FPs to FTL A or FTL B.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D – No longer used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E -- BAQ, non-instructor staff (may include senior officers, MAJCOM,
       NAF, and 618 AOC individuals that are not maintaining MR or instructor status). FTL E
       requirements are insufficient for MR status. Crewmembers assigned to FTL E will fly
       with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins; do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
   change FTLs after upgrade; i.e. instructor upgrade. BAQ crewmembers may be assigned a
   different FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training
   levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are located in Chapter 7. Unit defined events will be designated ―X‖ events (i.e. X020) and
listed in MAJCOM Supplement or local supplement/OG-OI.
 28                                                             AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012


   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.           Credit events accomplished on training,
   operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency requirements and
   establish a subsequent due date. Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all
   flying training currency events that were successfully accomplished during the formal course
   evaluation. Continuation training events accomplished during upgrade training prior to the
   evaluation may be credited towards the requirements for the current crew position.
   4.4.2. Unsatisfactory flight evaluation. Do not log continuation training requirements for
   those items graded unsatisfactory until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   4.4.4. Instructor Training Requirements and Responsibilities. Instructors and flight
   examiners may credit 50% of their volume requirements while instructing or evaluating.
   EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or landings
   flown by another pilot. Instructor upgrade simulator training may count as a semiannual
   refresher simulator (G250) and CRM academics/simulator (G230/240).
   4.4.5. Simulator Credit for Training Events.         Crewmembers should credit events
   accomplished in the simulator unless otherwise specified by the respective event description
   in Chapter 7, MAJCOM Supplement, or Table 4.4. Pilots may maintain or regain currency
   events accomplished in the simulator.
4.5. Ground Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the
   individual crewmember. Crewmembers should actively work with unit schedulers and
   training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this
   chapter.
   4.5.2. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1, and Table 4.2. See
   Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 or Table 4.3 leads to non-mission
      ready status. See paragraph 4.10 for regaining mission ready status. Local training
      missions may be flown before completing all MR items, provided all grounding items are
      complete, i.e., Flight Physical, Physiological Training, Aircrew Flight Equipment
      Familiarization Training, Emergency Egress Training, and Marshaling Exam are
      accomplished.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions.
      4.5.2.3. Ancillary training events, for example C and E events do not affect mission
      ready status nor restrict crewmembers from any mission.
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers (i.e. NAF, MAJCOM, etc.) may accomplish ground training
      events at locations other than their home units or units of attachment. Individuals are
      responsible for reporting all accomplished training to their home units or unit of
      attachment Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) office.
      4.5.2.5. Assigned or attached flight surgeons comply with requirements of Table 4.3.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                      29


       4.5.2.6. Centralized Aircrew Training Record. All training events will be recorded in the
       ARMS database. Combined events may have only one consolidated ARMS entry. All
       one-time events will be input in the ARMS database to include one-time events
       completed during initial qualification and mission certification.

NOTES:
 1. Mandatory grounding item.

 2. Flight Surgeons without an aviation unit mobility requirement (e.g. non-operational
 staff or leadership role in Aerospace Medicine, and Flight Surgeons undergoing training
 in the USAF Residency in Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.

 3. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.10.

 4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.

 5. See Chapter 7 for requirements. IAW AFI 11-202v1, paragraph 6, refer to HQ
 USAF/A3O-AT reference publications for current ancillary training frequencies. See
 event description in Chapter 7 for additional information.

 6. S-V80-A establishes initial training completion date for SS02, SS03 and SS20.

 7. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum requirements in
 primary unit aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90
 days.

 8. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one
 sortie per single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie
 requirements.

 9. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of
 flight duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI
 11-401.

4.6. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Table 4.4 lists standardized flying
continuation training requirements. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
   4.6.1. Dual-Seat Qualification.     Pilots will be dual seat qualified, and may accomplish
   training events in either seat.
   4.6.2. Senior Officers and Crewmembers Maintaining BAQ. Senior Officer Qualification
   course (A004) and have a BAQ AF Form 8 shall maintain a minimum FTL E continuation
   training requirement. For annual simulator refresher course (G250) attempt to schedule the
   Senior Officer if possible. If not, ensure that the Senior Officer is afforded all the training in
   the aircraft that would have been accomplished in the simulator. Provide this training on a
   local sortie, not on a mission. Include approaches, transition work, and all applicable CRM,
   Emergency and mission orientation briefings. Instructors will log annual CRM refresher
   (G230) and simulator refresher course (G250) for the Senior Officer upon completion of the
   local training flight. In addition to always flying with an instructor of like specialty, FTL E
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                      33


   senior pilots must be current in takeoffs, landings, and instrument approaches before carrying
   passengers.
   4.6.3. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Flight events creditable in the ATD are listed
   in Table 4.4. For ARMS tracking, events accomplished in the simulator will be annotated
   with an ―S‖ on the MAR and entered into the Training Accomplishment window with a
   method of accomplishment ―S‖.
       4.6.3.1. Mission profile simulators will be flown in the same manner as the aircraft, to
       include the wear and use of professional gear, as applicable (headsets, etc.).
       4.6.3.2. Simulator TDYs will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS.
       4.6.3.3. Simulator sortie cancellation authority will reside with the OG/CC (or
       designated representative).
       4.6.3.4. Mission profile, EPE, and refresher simulators will be scheduled with an AC or
       IP on the crew.

NOTES:
1. Pilots should dual log an M010 during simulator training.
2. Unqualified in the aircraft if non-current in excess of 6 months.
3. If an NDB approach is not available, use RMI only procedures. NDB currency for USAFE is
120-days.
4. As directed by MAJCOM; units with appropriately equipped aircraft and in conjunction with
LL04 when practicable.
5. Only applicable to crewmembers tactics certified. Accomplish one high and one low tactical
arrival/departure and when possible, rotate between day and night events.
6. Base frequency is semi-annual; MAJCOMs may direct annual refresher.
4.7. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202v1. Flight surgeons require one sortie in any
qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202v1 table for flying continuation-training
requirements. See paragraph 4.10.2.1 for regaining mission ready status.
   4.7.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in the C-21 as a secondary airframe must be on
   Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC 8A status, be current in their periodic flight physical and
   physiological training, and must have completed the Flight Surgeon Aircrew Qualification
   exam. The AC or their designated crewmember must also give FS a briefing on oxygen
   equipment and egress procedures prior to flight.
4.8. Ancillary Training. Training that contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate
from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2C-21v1 is not the governing
directive for completion of ancillary training events. In accordance with AFI 11-202v1, the
source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver has been
authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative to ensure compliance with additional
non-aircrew specific training requirements. Ancillary training not affecting MR status may be
tracked via other means (e.g. ADLS) in lieu of ARMS.
4.9. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                     35


due to contingency alerts and contingency TDYs when the contingency precludes training for
certain mission events (USAFE: also contingency operations from home station).
   4.9.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: Event volume required, divided
   by the number of months in the training period, and multiplied by the number of months
   available. Perform the following formula steps to determine training requirements for a
   select training period:
          4.9.1.1. Step 1 – Convert number of days not available to number of months prorated
          (See Table 4.5).
          4.9.1.2. Step 2 – Subtract prorated months from six (months in the semi-annual training
          period). Remaining months are considered months available.
          4.9.1.3. Step 3 - Look up Event Volume required.
          4.9.1.4. Step 4       – Determine Prorated Event Volume required using the following
          formula:

Figure 4.1. Proration Computation.




          4.9.1.5. Use Table 4.5 to determine the number allowable months of proration. Prorate
          only if absence is at least 15-cumulative days.
   4.9.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle to a
   unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
   accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time not
   available during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for CONUS,
   14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment of the first
   training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated
   event volume required to determine remaining requirements.
   4.9.3. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.

4.10. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. Designate individuals
NMR if they fail to complete ground or semiannual flying continuation training requirements.
The following guidance applies:
   4.10.1. Flight Training. At the end of each training period, the Unit/CC will review ARMS
   products for those crewmembers who failed to accomplish all required flying training events
   (includes all events listed in the flying continuation training tables). The Unit/CC will either
   direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request OG/CC waiver. If
   the ARMS review shows enough flying events were recently accomplished to ensure MR
   proficiency, OG/CC or equivalent may waive the requirements. The same flying training
   events will not be waived for two consecutive training periods. This waiver authority must
   be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure crewmembers receive the proper quantity of
   flying events to remain proficient and allow OG/CC to determine MR status and additional
   training requirements when those training quotas are not met.
   4.10.2. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in any flying currency event in
   supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR. Crewmembers are non-
   current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., a crewmember that accomplished an event
   with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-current on 1 November).
          4.10.2.1. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
          Command Surgeon of Flight Surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties (AMC units
          send notification to AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC). Flight surgeons that exceed 60 days
          between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems conducted by a
          member of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to the flight
          to regain flying currency.
             4.10.2.1.1. The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the
             AMC/SGP memo or other approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated
             form/memo, etc.) Note: documentation on AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
             Flight Data Document, is not acceptable. The Flight surgeon must submit this
             documentation to the local Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager
             (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in
             conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the
             flight surgeon’s ARMS training folder and maintain on file IAW applicable ground
             training records retention requirements.
             4.10.2.1.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will
             result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                       37


   4.10.3. Regaining Currency. Regain currency IAW AFI 11-202v1. Also see AFI 11-2C-21,
   Volume 3, C-21 Operations Procedures, Chapter 3, for additional guidance on non-current
   pilots flying missions with passengers.
       4.10.3.1. For a loss of currency up to 6-months, a crewmember must demonstrate
       proficiency in the aircraft or simulator with an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor for
       simulator creditable events) in all delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for up to
       6-months will maintain their current training level.
       4.10.3.2. For loss of currency exceeding 6 months: for flying currency events identified
       in Table 4.4, the crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft and must complete Sq/CC-
       directed requalification training and an aircrew evaluation. For all other currency events,
       regain currency by demonstrating proficiency in the aircraft or simulator to the
       satisfaction of an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor for simulator creditable events)
       in all delinquent items.
          4.10.3.2.1. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require completion
          of LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a certified aircrew
          instructor prior to the next flight.
       4.10.3.3. Failure to complete ground training events in Table 4.1 leads to NMR status
       and prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties until the
       overdue event is completed or waived. Except for mandatory grounding items in Table
       4.1 and Table 4.3, the operations group commander or equivalent may waive ground
       continuation training. This waiver authority must be used judiciously. The decision to
       grant a waiver will be based on the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency
       level (i.e., waivers will not be based on a crewmember’s availability). The operations
       group commander will determine the allowable time period of the waiver (the training
       should be completed at the earliest opportunity). This waiver is allowed for unforeseen
       circumstances and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment.
       4.10.3.4. The SQ/CC, or designated representative, may approve an individual NMR for
       failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training (G182) to fly unsupervised on local
       training missions not requiring the overdue event.
   4.10.4. Refer to AFI 11-202v1 for individuals transferring between aircraft or leaving active
   flying status. These provisions also apply to all simulator training.

                                       UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade.
     5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the crewmember
     having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s
     missions. Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.
     Crewmembers will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions
     before entering the formal upgrade program.
     5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for all flying hour prerequisites for entry into
     in-unit upgrade courses.

NOTES:
1. Only primary and secondary time is creditable towards PAA time. Total primary aircraft
authorized (PAA) hour requirements must be met prior to beginning MP Upgrade. Candidates will
complete an evaluation and/or certification.
2. All flying-hour requirements must be attained prior to entry into the IP upgrade program. Only
primary and secondary time is creditable towards PAA time. 100 hours PAA does not apply to
those previously qualified as C-21 instructors.
3. Unit Chief of Training must ensure AF IMT 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC)
Acknowledgement Statement, is signed prior to beginning upgrade training according to AFI 36-
2107.

4. Unit CC recommendation not required for HHQ flight examiners.

5. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a ―military‖
pilot including UPT, Student, and ―Other‖ time (but does not include time in another aircrew
specialty). Simulator time is creditable towards PAA time, except simulator time logged as a UP
for PQP MP upgrade.


5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). MPD is the AMC training process to develop
Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) graduates through aircraft commander
qualification. The MPD program includes the Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) formal training
course, continuation training, and the local upgrade process. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat
qualified. MPD pilots are not Aircraft Commanders but should be considered in continuous
aircraft commander training upon graduation from the PIQ course until AC certification. As
always, training timelines are based on performance, and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should
be tailored to match an individual’s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training. (N/A for 375 OG/Det 1)
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as V280
   and V281 respectively; the AMC Tour/GRACC is optional and documented in ARMS as
   V282. Document the completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC
   certification using ARMS event identifier Q280. All three events (V280-282) must be
   completed to award Q280.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I and II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T Sharepoint. Workbooks should be carried on all sorties to maximize training
   opportunities.
   5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter Phase I of
   continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which
   focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems
   knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD should not have additional
   squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe
   and learn from their aircrew leadership.
       5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
       right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
       train in the right seat during refresher simulators and may occupy the left or right seats
       for available proficiency time at the end of refresher simulators. Phase I MPD pilots will
       complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC) after becoming
       mission ready.
       5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
       months from the training start date (as defined in paragraph 1.7.1), have a minimum of
       100 PAA (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these
       requirements are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP.
       (Note: MPD pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue
       under the previous GRACC workbook for up to 6 months beyond the release date of this
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                     41


     AFI at Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with all other requirements in this paragraph).
     Phase I applies to first-assignment pilots only.
  5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
  which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
  management required for Aircraft Commander certification. Prior MAF Aircraft
  Commanders are required to accomplish the Phase II training before AC certification and
  may log Q280 after completing only V281.
     5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
     in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
     pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
     skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.
     5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II MPD
     pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD Phase
     II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II MPD
     pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD pilots
     require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready certification and
     prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for prior MAF AC or non- mobility
     weapon system pilots).
     5.3.4.3. AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth look
     at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to interact
     with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
     Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning local Aircraft
     Commander upgrade training. GRACC is optional but highly encouraged for C-21 pilots,
     and transferable between all mobility weapon systems.
  5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade. After the Sq/CC determines (via the
  STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time begins and the upgrade candidate will
  begin applicable training events, as required (see Table 1.2 for in-unit training time
  limitations). Prior to starting training, the training office will open and maintain an AF Form
  4022 or Electronic Gradebook (EGB) until the upgrade candidate is certified as an Aircraft
  Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a pilots training progress may
  combine those into a single training folder at the unit’s discretion. Training guides are
  authorized.
     5.3.5.1. Complete applicable ground and flying training requirements of this volume.
     5.3.5.2. C-21 MP qualification training is conducted in-unit.
     5.3.5.3. AC Certification. A pilot will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all
     ground and flying training requirements. Additionally, Aircraft Commanders must be
     certified by the Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R & C) Board before performing
     duties as Pilot in Command (PIC).
  5.3.6. MPD Designation Codes.         AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For
  standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status
  for a MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate). (This ARMS

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Course is designed to teach selected crewmembers
fundamentals and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on
experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.4.1. For instructor upgrade prerequisites, see Table 5.1.
       5.4.1.1. For ground and flight training requirements, all initial instructor upgrade
       candidates will complete training on the principles of instruction through an Instructor
       Preparatory Course (IPC) at the formal school and simulator training (see paragraph
       5.5.4 for in-unit upgrades).
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                      43


     5.4.1.2. Each unit will give IP candidates at least three right-seat training flights (Pre-
     IAC course) and ensure IP candidates are proficient with right seat operations prior to
     formal school. Complete pre-upgrade events listed in an OST approved training guide if
     available.
     5.4.1.3. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor course for
     instructor qualification and were instructor certified in any US Air Force fixed-wing
     aircraft may upgrade in-unit without completing the contractor provided IPC and
     simulator instructor course. In-unit instructor upgrades require OG/CC approval.
     MAJCOM waivers are not required. Unit commanders determine training required to
     complete upgrade. Refer to Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limits. Crewmembers
     previously qualified as C-21 instructors are exempt from the instructor upgrade flying
     time prerequisites in Table 5.
  5.4.2. Instructor Ground Training.
     5.4.2.1. An instructor must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft systems and equipment,
     normal and emergency operating procedures, prohibited maneuvers, and aircraft
     performance under all conditions of flight. Instructor candidates will demonstrate
     knowledge by organizing and conducting ground briefings on a cross-section of subjects
     from applicable directives. Briefings may be conducted as part of the existing
     continuation training or flying safety program, but the briefing must be critiqued by a
     same crew position instructor for content, organization, and delivery.
     5.4.2.2. The instructor candidate will receive training on training documentation
     described in Attachment 2.
     5.4.2.3. Instructor written examinations. AFI 11-2C-21v2, C-21 Aircrew Evaluation
     Criteria, defines this requirement. Scenario-driven instructor questions are incorporated
     into the instructor qualification open-book examination.
     5.4.2.4. Instructor/Examiner CRM. Initial instructor CRM should be included in formal
     and in-unit upgrade. Units develop course material locally for in-unit upgrades.
  5.4.3. Flying Training.
     5.4.3.1. If, at any time, during the flight the judgment or proficiency of a student at the
     controls raises a question in the instructor's mind as to the student's ability to complete a
     prescribed maneuver safely, the instructor will take over the controls of the aircraft
     immediately. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper methods of
     conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming control of the aircraft.
     5.4.3.2. IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis will be on right-
     seat proficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, practical emergency situation
     set-up, and operating aircraft systems. A minimum of one touch and go landing should
     be accomplished in the left seat, emphasizing the differences in cockpit layout and
     aircrew duties that affect left seat instructing.
     5.4.3.3. An initial instructor flight evaluation is required.
     5.4.3.4. Instructor proficiency guidelines. Following upgrade, emphasis should be
     placed on flying the newly certified IP in the local pattern to reinforce upgrade training
     and to gain experience in the local flying environment.
 44                                                               AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012


       5.4.3.5. Instructor Preparatory Course (IPC). All instructor candidates must have
       attended an IPC at a formal Air Force school or at the unit level.
       5.4.3.6. FTU instructors will complete the FTU Faculty Instructor Upgrade Program.
   5.4.4. Unit level IPC.      Wings may conduct IPC for instructor candidates at the
   squadron/GSU level with MAJCOM/A3T approval on an individual basis if formal slots are
   not available. Each IPC program will have a primary instructor appointed by the applicable
   Unit/CC to be responsible for course content, scheduling, records, and training of new IPC
   instructors. IPC staff may be of any size but should be limited to only enough to accomplish
   unit requirements.
       5.4.4.1. IPC Guidance. Unit level IPC will be conducted according to a plan submitted
       to and approved by the appropriate OSS/OST and an information copy will be forwarded
       to MAJCOM/DOT/A3T. Unit level IPC guidance in addition to that provided by the
       formal school and the ATS is encouraged.
   5.4.5. For ground and flight training requirements, all initial instructor upgrade candidates
   will complete training on the principles of instruction at the formal school if available.
5.5. Flight Examiner Certification. Unit/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner
certification. Instructors identified for certification as flight examiners must possess satisfactory
knowledge of MAJCOM training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to
administer an evaluation according to AFI 11-2C-21v2 (N/A for HHQ flight examiners).
   5.5.1. IAW local guidance, flight examiner candidates will complete a flight examiner
   certification course. Unit/CC may waive this requirement if the candidate is a previously
   qualified flight examiner in any AMC aircraft. Upgrade will include, but is not limited to the
   following:
       5.5.1.1. Observation of qualified examiners conducting a cross-section of evaluations, to
       include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge. The
       candidate may observe the in-flight portion of an evaluation.
       5.5.1.2. Receive a briefing on command policies and interpretations of AFI 11-202v1
       and 2, AFI 11-2C-21v1 and 2, and MAJCOM supplements.
5.6. Special Qualifications and Certifications. Certain aircrew qualifications and
certifications are trained after completion of formal qualification and do not affect mission ready
status. Special qualifications and certifications may require an evaluation or only an AF Form
4324 update. These programs are usually taught at the unit level by Air Force instructors of like
specialty.
   5.6.1. Tactics Certification Training. Pilots will be tactics certified prior to AC certification
   or OCONUS deployment as required by the respective reporting instructions or other theater
   requirements. Document certification as ―Tactics Certified‖ with ARMS event identifier
   Q044 via an AF Form 4324.
AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                     45


                                           Chapter 6

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. Normally, the ATS contractor provides academic and simulator training and
the Air Force conducts all flight training and evaluations.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.2.1. This chapter applies to all crewmembers attending formal schools using ATS
   courseware. AMC/A3T manages the content of C-21 contractor provided training. NOTE:
   The current simulator contract governs Air Force-contractor relationships and obligations and
   may only be modified by the contracting officer. Units will not levy additional requirements
   on contractors. Contact the MAJCOM training office with recommended changes to the
   aircrew training program.
   6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the ATS program is to optimize aircrew training through the
   integrated use of academics, ATD, and flight line aircraft instruction. The C-21 ATS by
   contract establishes performance requirements in the ATS Contract Statement of Work
   (SOW) and system specification. The ATS Master Task Listing/Evaluation Standards
   Document (MTL/ESD), objective media analysis report (OMAR), and media selection
   syllabus report (MSSR) products help define course content, standards, and media selected
   for each task and objective, respectively.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202v1. It is imperative that students
complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will enroll on a full-time
basis. Relieve students of duties not directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory
personnel may continue their normal duties as time permits.
6.4. ATS Course Prerequisites. Each ATS course is designed and based on student
prerequisites being met. Prerequisites may include a minimum number of flying hours, unit
operations officer recommendation, and completion of applicable training guides. Consult the
course summary document (CSD) or Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) to
determine student entry level for each course.
6.5. Lesson Objectives.
   6.5.1. Lesson Objective Development. Instructors and evaluators use lesson objectives as a
   reference document to establish training and evaluation standards. The contractor developed
   lesson plans are an integral part of the formal syllabus and outline course requirements.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
   6.6.1. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the
   government representative (wing training, operations officer, etc.). Following review of the
   student's record, the government representative will determine whether to continue or
   terminate training. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or
   training office for students who display substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. The contractor and contracting officer must receive prompt
   notification of unsatisfactory performance following a contracted course. Local procedures
   must ensure that notification is completed within 24 hours of failure to complete a course and

6.7. Courseware Changes. Submit courseware changes through appropriate MAJCOM
channels, with information copies to AMC/A3T. The reporting requirement in this paragraph is
exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information Collections And
Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, And Interagency Air force
Information Collections.
   6.7.1. Master Task List (MTL) and Evaluation Standards Document (ESD).
       6.7.1.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD provides the basis for courseware
       development. The MTL/ESD, as approved by AMC/A3T, is the evaluation criteria for
       validating a crewmember’s performance. Flight examiners and instructors who evaluate
       or train crewmembers will use the MTL/ESD to determine the ability of an individual to
       meet the performance levels required to be mission qualified.
       6.7.1.2. MTL/ESD Use. The MTL/ESD will be used by flight examiners and instructors
       in the training and evaluation of crewmembers. Distribution of the MTL/ESD is
       sufficient to ensure each unit has reference copies for each crew position. Recommended
       changes will be submitted through Air Force channels using an approved quality
       assurance change proposal (QACP) process. Changes to the MTL/ESD frequently result
       in changes to associated courseware.
6.8. Scheduling. Student schedule for simulator courses is coordinated through FTU registrar.
Registrar will coordinate schedule and all changes with MAJCOM POC (AMC unit schedules
are coordinated through 375OSS/OST). MAJCOM POC will notify registrar NLT 30 days prior
to class start date if unable to fill assigned slot. Student name changes within 21 days of class
start date will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and only be approved by the registrar.
6.9. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors. Contractor personnel may fly according
to the terms of the current government contract, and must have a valid FAA Class 2 physical and
comply with applicable DOD and AFI guidance, to include DOD 4515.3R and AFI 11-401.

                        AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF IMT
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew training guides
(TG).
   A2.1.1. Initiate an AF Form 4022 or MAJCOM-approved pilot training guide (PTG), for
   ETCA formal training (either at formal school or in-unit), mission qualification, certification
   training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification
   training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.
      A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
      corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
      examiner who evaluated the crewmember's performance will enter comments pertinent to
      the training deficiency on AF IMT 4023 or the training guide. Use the existing training
      folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
      A2.1.1.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, training guides for an individual
      undergoing more than one training program in a short period of time may be combined
      into one AF Form 4022; e.g., a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to MP may
      have his or her mission upgrade combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
      A2.1.1.3. Special qualification programs such as FCF, EP, or FGIP do not require a
      4022, but the documentation or proof of local supplement checklist completion must be
      kept on file for one year.
   A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee's
   gaining unit. Unit commanders will review formal school training records and enter
   appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023.
   A2.1.3. Units will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
   accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder
   at any time.
   A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF IMT 4023 and
   4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously
   accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional training, will be noted for
   possible inclusion during the current training period. Commanders or operations officers will
   review active training folders quarterly, and flight commanders or unit training
   representatives will conduct a monthly review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be
   annotated on AF IMT 4023 or in the training guide.
   A2.1.5. Units will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents or MAJCOM-approved training guides
   for 1 year, and then return them to the crewmember; units may retain a copy of the AF Form
   4025 in organizational files. Do not insert AF Form/IMT 4022 contents or training guides
   into FEFs.
 82                                                              AFI11-2C-21V1 30 MAY 2012


   A2.1.6. If training guides are not used; AF Form/IMT 4022, 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be
   used for ATS and formal school courses.
   A2.1.7. Units may overprint versions of AF Form 4022, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and/or 4025
   in accordance with AFI 33-360. Review requirements/restrictions in AFI 33-360 with
   special emphasis on 3.7.4., ―Overprint (pre-fill blocks with standard information) an
   electronic or physical form when the number of man-hours saved in filling in the form
   justifies the extra cost of overprinting the fill-in data. Do not alter lines or captions, or add
   blocks and captions to an existing form as this action is a revision of the original design and
   requires form OPR approval. This guidance applies to both physical and electronic forms.
   Insert a statement at the bottom of overprinted forms indicating the activity responsible for
   the overprinted material (e.g., ―375 OG overprint.‖).
   A2.1.8. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be
   considered all training conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or
   artificial training device.
A2.2. Instructions for AF Form 4022. The folder is constructed of cardstock and the inside
covers are designed for documenting training. AF IMT 4023, 4024, and 4025 and additional
information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be centered and attached to folder fasteners.
Units may elect to use more durable binders for the training guide as a substitute to the AF Form
4022. AF IMT 4022 will be closed upon successful completion of one of the following: flight
evaluation (if required as part of the training program), instructor validation of successful
program completion (―sign-off‖) or squadron commander certification (if required as part of the
training program). NOTE: Formal school instructors using ATS courseware are not required to
complete the following sections of the AF Form 4022: ground training summary, written
evaluations, and flying training summary if this information is tracked by other means and sent
to the gaining unit with AF Form 4022. 4023s will be placed on the left side of the folder in
chronological order with the most recent on top. 4024s will be placed on the right side of the
folder. Waivers will be placed on the left side in chronological order within the 4023s based on
date of approval. PTGs may be kept in the 4022 and should be kept on the right side on top of
the 4024s.

      event and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level
      the crew member must achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a
      knowledge standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The
      standards for specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and
      evaluation standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in the AFI 11-
      2MDS-specific volume. For those weapons systems that do not have any RPL listing, all
      events will have an RPL of "3" for performance and "C" for knowledge (if knowledge
      standards are used in addition to performance standards). EXCEPTION: One-time events
      required for familiarization and not listed in the MTL and ESD or specific AFI 11-MDS
      volume will not have performance and knowledge standard assigned. Performance and
      knowledge standards are listed in Table A2.1.
