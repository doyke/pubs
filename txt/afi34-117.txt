                                   GRADING PRACTICES

A3.1. Ensure all instructors are grading against a uniform standard and the applicant’s progress
is assessed against their ability to meet the requirements of FAA Practical Test Standards (PTS)
for the desired certificate or rating. Unless waived by AFPC/SVPCR, the following grades shall
be used on the applicant’s training record.
A3.2. Individual Maneuver/Task Grade
   A3.2.1. P = Proficient. The applicant meets the applicable FAA PTS for the individual
   maneuver/task without intervention or verbal assistance from the flight instructor.
   A3.2.2. S = Safe. While the applicant does not fully meet the PTS, they are able to
   consistently perform the maneuver/task safely, without flight instructor intervention or verbal
   assistance. The applicant is cleared to perform this maneuver/task solo.
   A3.2.3. A = Accomplished. Unsafe to perform this maneuver/task solo. The applicant is
   unable to perform the maneuver/task without demonstration, intervention, or verbal
   assistance from the flight instructor, or the applicant's relative experience makes it impossible
   to determine if they could perform the maneuver/task without assistance.
   A3.2.4. D = Demonstrated Only. The flight instructor demonstrated the maneuver/task;
   however, the student was not allowed to accomplish the maneuver/task. (NOTE: If the
   instructor demonstrated the maneuver/task and then allowed the applicant to perform it, the
   grade shall reflect the applicant's performance.)
   A3.2.5.
   appropriate box to indicate they performed the maneuver one or more times while solo.
A3.3. Overall Grade.
   A3.3.1. The following grades will be used to assess the students overall performance for the
   flight. If an applicant receives a grade of below average or below acceptable standards, the
   chief flight instructor shall review the applicant’s performance with their flight instructor
   prior to the applicant’s next flight.
   A3.3.2. 1 = Excellent. The applicant’s performance exceeded expectations, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.3. 2 = Above Average. The applicant’s performance was above average, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.4. 3 = Average. The applicant’s performance was average, given their phase of
   training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.5. 4 = Below Average. The applicant’s performance was below average, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.6. 5 = Below Acceptable Standards. The applicant’s performance was below average
   given their phase of training, experience, etc. NOTE: The FAA PTS does not fully cover all
   maneuvers/tasks; therefore, the chief flight instructor shall supplement the PTS in instances
   where the PTS performance level is not specific or adequate.
