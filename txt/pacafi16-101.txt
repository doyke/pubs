                                          GENERAL

1.1. General Information. The GLOBAL Theater Security Cooperation Management
Information System (G-TSCMIS) is PACOM’s database of record for capturing OAAs
associated with TCP and Phase-0 events building partnership events. Use of G-TSCMIS is
mandatory per the PACOM Theater Campaign Plan The PACOM Theater Campaign Base Plan
states that all components will contribute towards a theater security cooperation common
operating picture by loading and assessing OAAs in the Global Theater Security Cooperation
Management Information System. Additionally, PACOM Theater Campaign Plan, Annex R
(Assessment) states that G-TSCMIS will be the primary task assessment tool for the Theater
Campaign Plan.
1.2. Use of G-TSCMIS. Accordingly, HQ PACAF, 5 AF, 7 AF, 11 AF, and all other units
assigned to the PACAF MAJCOM will use G-TSCMIS as the database of record for capturing
OAAs associated with TCP and Phase-0 events. PACAF units will utilize G-TSCMIS to capture
objective data as well as subjective assessments. G-TSCMIS is used to plan and manage TCP
events and track allocation of TCP resources. Information in G-TSCMIS also allows PACOM
and the components to coordinate and de-conflict their TCP activities. G-TSCMIS is the tool to
inform leaders and staffs at the COCOM, component and Joint Staff levels on all TCP activities
across the PACOM AOR, so maintaining complete and accurate information is important.
   1.2.1. Objective G-TSCMIS data will include how many OAA's were executed, which
   "Engagement Categories", (as defined within G-TSCMIS) were emphasized, and how much
   funding was spent on TCP activities with a given country or time period. Such data will
   contribute to an objective measure of effort.
   1.2.2. Subjective G-TSCMIS data will typically include assessments of OAAs—either
   individually or as part of a larger line of operation. Such data will contribute to a subjective
   measure of performance or an end-of-year subjective measure of effectiveness.
1.3. Events Entered into G-TSCMIS. Events entered into G-TSCMIS should have a strategic
impact on one or more foreign nations and shall support one or more of PACOM’s objectives.
Additionally, there are cases where senior leaders meet to discuss business on a frequent and
routine basis. Though the individual visits may not by themselves have a significant strategic
impact, over the series of the meetings there is obvious strategic value. It is recommended that a
particular series of meetings be entered as a single G-TSCMIS entry at the end of each quarter
covering the series of meetings within that quarter. PACAF International Affairs Division
(PACAF/A5I) is the authority on whether an event should be recorded in G-TSCMIS for PACAF
and will readily entertain any questions or recommendations to G-TSCMIS entries.
1.4. G-TSCMIS                Portal. G-TSCMIS              is           on         SIPRNET
http://www.hq.pacom.smil.mil/J5/J56/J564/. This website includes links to the login page, the
training portal and other useful information. Information on establishing a G-TSCMIS account
can also be obtained by contacting PACOM/J564 at 477-0040 “(area code 808 for commercial or
315 for DSN).

1.5. PACAF's International Affairs Division (PACAF/A5I). Serves as PACAF’s OPR for G-
TSCMIS. PACAF A5IP may be contacted at 449-4946 or 449-“(area code 808 for commercial

                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. All PACAF-Assigned Units or Personnel. All PACAF-assigned units or personnel
responsible for planning, conducting or assessing TCP/Phase-0 OAAs will enter all such events
in G-TSCMIS as identified in Table A2.1. PACAF G-TSCMIS Reporting Responsibilities
Matrix (Attachment 2). This matrix will be periodically updated as required.
2.2. G-TSCMIS Entries. Users are encouraged to submit entries, even if proposed or
incomplete, as soon as possible in order to maximize cross-command situational awareness and
coordination. G-TSCMIS entries can be entered at least two fiscal years in advance, or at any
time before the end of the fiscal year in which the event takes place.
2.3. Data Included as a Minimum in G-TSCMIS. G-TSCMIS entries will, as a minimum,
include the data described below in the appropriate tab. All fields marked with a red asterisk on
the website are required to pass the Quality Assurance (QA) test and shall be entered. Event
planners can use the “QA This Event” button to make sure their G-TSCMIS entry is compliant.
   2.3.1. General Tab. Data fields are self-explanatory. Note that OAAs which are classified
   above SECRET are not suitable for entry in G-TSCMIS. Event managers shall update the
   “Event Status” pull-down menu as their event status changes from “Proposed” to “Pending”
   and “In-Progress" to "Completed." Each term has a specific meaning and is used to assess
   the TCP program. The aforementioned terms are defined within G-TSCMIS. (Click the blue
   ‘i’ icon for help on that field) However the terms "Rejected," "Rescinded," and "Cancelled"
   are not specifically defined in G-TSCMIS but are defined as follows. Rejected means the
   proposed event was not approved by the approving official or an erroneous entry. (Note:
   Please notify PACAF/A5I of erroneous entries to get them permanently removed from the
   data base) Rescinded means the organizer or approving official decided to cancel the event
   after approving the event. Cancelled means the intended foreign participant(s) decided not to
   participate. Event POCs shall enter the reason for rejecting, rescinding, or cancelling.
       2.3.1.1. Event Title. Each event title will be prefaced with the prefix identified in Table
       A4.1 Event Title Prefixes and Conductor Values (Attachment 4). The guidelines for
       unit responsibility by event category are defined in Table A2.1 PACAF G-TSCMIS
       Reporting Responsibilities Matrix (Attachment 2). Example: COBRA GOLD would be
       entered as (PACAF) COBRA GOLD.
       2.3.1.2. Conductor. The conductor shall match the prefix as assigned to the event title.
       See Attachment 2 for more details. Example: Conductor for COBRA GOLD would be
       PACAF.
   2.3.2. Purpose Tab. Description of OAA should be simple. Users are encouraged to cut-
   and-paste from other source material (e.g. EXORDs or planning conference slides) as a
   means to promote efficiency. For “Military Engagement Themes,” multiple entries are fine
   but users are encouraged not to “over-think” this step—the initial response of the user is
   generally the most accurate. Only one theme is required to be QA compliant.
   2.3.3. Series Tab. This tab is available only on the "Combined/Multinational Exercises"
   engagement category. Fields on this tab are self-explanatory. Query functionality of the
 6                                                             PACAFI16-101 9 OCTOBER 2014


     fields in this tab is limited but will be expanded in the future. Example: RED FLAG- Alaska
     (RF-A) 09-1, Series Name would be 09-1.
     2.3.4. Location Tab. For each event, location must be selected at the City/Facility level. If
     the required city/facility is not available from the dropdown list, please contact PACAF/A5IP
     or the PACOM G-TSCMIS Support Team in J564 at PACOM-G-
     TSCMIS@pacom.smil.mil to add the facility to the list.
     2.3.5. Countries Tab. Add the participating nations to the event. If one of the nations is not
     in the PACOM AOR, the G-TSCMIS Helpdesk can quickly add that nation to the list.
     Additionally, in the list of participating countries, the United States is located on the top row.
     Clicking "Unit(s)" in that row allows you to enter the units that participated/will participate at
     the bottom half of the screen. PACOM will be adding functionality to this data field in the
     coming releases. Listing participating units is highly encouraged.
     2.3.6. Individuals Tab. PACOM and PACAF encourage entry of this information, but it is
     not required.
     2.3.7. Resources Tab. Users will identify approximate costs and resource type(s) for OAAs
     whenever possible. The list in Attachment 3 identifies those resource (funding) types that
     are most pertinent to PACAF. Each G-TSCMIS event should identify at least one of these
     resource (funding) options if at all possible. This item may be left blank on those occasions
     when it is too difficult to readily identify an approximate cost for a given OAA (e.g. a
     bomber sortie from Guam).
     2.3.8. Objectives Tab. This is the critical data entry point in linking your event to PACOM’s
     objectives for the respective countries. At present, G-TSCMIS does not support uploading of
     component (PACAF) objectives; therefore you will only be able to link your event to the
     PACOM objectives that it supports. However, PACAF objectives are derived in part from
     PACOM end states and objectives. If the event cannot be linked to any of PACOM’s
     objectives, consider reshaping the event to match PACOM’s objectives.
     2.3.9. Milestones Tab. PACOM and PACAF do not generally track this data point.
     2.3.10. Admin Tab. PACOM and PACAF do not generally track this data point.
     2.3.11. Assessments Tab. Users must enter this data in order to close-out an event. Users
     are encouraged to add after-action reports (AAR), out-brief slides, or similar correspondence
     which may amplify the assessment. In order to add a file, forward it to the PACOM G-
     TSCMIS Support Team in J564 at PACOM-G-TSCMIS@pacom.smil.mil. It is acceptable
     for OAA sponsors or project officers to assess their unit’s own event. It is also acceptable for
     units to establish a more rigorous assessment methodology if desired, however, PACAF/A5I
     must be provided a summary of the methodology used. Event POCs shall support their
     assessments with comments in the “Comments” section. (Note: Subjective remarks,
     assessments, and AAR's may fall into the HUMINT type reporting category. As such, they
     should be marked accordingly within G-TSCMIS and NOT be made available for outside
     dissemination without the originator's approval.)
2.4. Obtaining a G-TSCMIS Account. Anyone with a SECRET clearance can obtain a G-
TSCMIS account. PACAF Numbered Air Forces (NAF) and Directorates may establish a single
person or office to be that unit’s designated G-TSCMIS authority in order to provide centralized

management oversight. The unit’s G-TSCMIS authority will provide PACAF/A5IP the unit’s G-
TSCMIS POC information.
2.5. Command for G-TSCMIS. PACAF/A5I will act as the command’s OPR for G-TSCMIS
operations. PACAF/A5I will routinely coordinate with PACOM and the G-TSCMIS Support
Team to publish new G-TSCMIS guidance as required.
   2.5.1. PACAF/A5I will supplement available PACOM training by providing additional easy-
   to-use G-TSCMIS training and reference materials for PACAF personnel. Additionally,
   PACAF/A5I will provide on-site training to PACAF units and personnel as time and
   resources permit.
   2.5.2. PACAF/A5I will reference the data in G-TSCMIS when compiling TCP/Phase-0
   briefings and updates as required.
2.6. Feedback. Defense Attaches, Offices of Defense Cooperation (ODC) and the PACAF
Foreign Policy Advisor (POLAD) are encouraged to provide feedback to PACAF/A5I on all air
component-centric senior leader visits, office calls and events with our partner nations.
PACAF/A5I will use this feedback to support assessments in G-TSCMIS.

3.1. Request to Complete or Correction of Entries in G-TSCMIS. Both the PACOM G-
TSCMIS Support Team and PACAF/A5I will periodically send out requests to complete or
correct existing entries within G-TSCMIS. Upon receipt of such requests, PACAF units and/or
personnel shall comply as soon as practical. PACAF/A5I will provide assistance as required.

4.1. G-TSCMIS inputs. Inputs will be finalized and closed 30 days after the end of the event.
The event database for each fiscal year will be locked approximately 30 days after the end of that
fiscal year so that PACOM and PACAF staffs can conduct annual end-of-year TCP/Phase-0
assessments based on G-TSCMIS data (i.e., the database for FY2013 events will be locked on or
about 1 Nov 2013 but the database for FY2014 events will remain open).
4.2. Global G-TSCMIS System. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has directed the
establishment of a global G-TSCMIS database (G-TSCMIS). Headquarters Joint Forces
Command is the lead command for this effort. Implementation date of G-TSCMIS is underway.

A2.1. PACAF G-TSCMIS Reporting Responsibilities Matrix. This matrix provides a list of
potential security cooperation and/or Phase-0 tools for consideration when conducting campaign
planning. It is not necessarily exhaustive. While all tools on this list have potential utility for
TCP/Phase-0, some of these tools are primarily intended for another function (e.g. training for
US forces). This list is based on the Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF) Annex C.
