This instruction implements AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures. It establishes
approval authority, briefing and reporting procedures, and responsibilities for participation in
exercises, deployments, and competitions. This instruction applies to any unit (except Civil Air
Patrol [CAP]-US Air Force/CAP) participating in flying activities involving exercises,
deployments, and major command-sponsored competitions beyond normal syllabus, continuation
training (CT), or established Air Force guidance. It also applies to all levels of command within
Air Education and Training Command (AETC). This instruction does not apply to the Air
National Guard and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. Submit suggested
improvements to this supplement using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Send the completed AF Form 847 through standardization and evaluation
(stan/eval) channels to AETC/A3V, 73 Main Street, Suite 2, JBSA-Randolph, TX 78150-4549.
Units will coordinate supplements with AETC/A3V prior to approval. Unless otherwise
specified, AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for this supplement. Attachment 1 contains a
glossary of references and supporting information. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

(paragraph 4.4); Added, Impact to PFT (A2.2.7). Waivers. Policy and procedures are enacted to
provide quality and consistency in training and evaluation whether at an undergraduate or
graduate level. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special consideration and
possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is important to preserve
fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation throughout the command, a process
must be established for review of proposed waivers. Waivers that change the intent of the policy
outlined in this instruction are not authorized without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2) approval. Unless
otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval authority for individual
personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual
circumstances.        Coordinate T-2 waivers through AETC/A3VO as appropriate. Squadron
commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests through command channels in electronic
format. Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual or unit cannot comply with
requirements. AETC/A3VO and the units will file a copy of approved waivers to this volume
according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Operations Group (OG)
Commander. The OG/CC of local supplements will handle waivers to unit supplemental
guidance.
