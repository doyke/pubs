                                                                           (Mr. Bernard Josten)
                                                                                     Pages: 13


This instruction provides guidance for the production support technician/production support
specialists (PST/PSS) to perform research, and take actions necessary to prevent and correct
materiel and Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) errors. These
procedures augment the PST/PSS responsibilities outlined in Air Force Materiel Command
Instruction (AFMCI) 21-130, Depot Maintenance Materiel Control. This instruction does not
apply to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, and the 571st Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron operating location, Randolph Air Force Base. These units follow the
standard base supply rules in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, USAF Supply Manual,
volume two, part 2. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air
Force Information Management Tool (AF IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMTs 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command.

1. General Information. This instruction identifies the types of errors, the research, and
processes necessary to validate materiel transactions through various reports and systems. This
instruction outlines how these errors can be prevented, which is the ultimate goal. The PST/PSS
must have access to the required maintenance and supply systems to perform the research and

analysis necessary to correct errors. Knowledge of these systems is essential to ensure materiel
and cost transactions are documented and posted accurately. The following systems required to
perform this research are: Automated Bill of Materiel (ABOM); Naval Air Industrial Materiel
Management System (NIMMS); DIFMS; Depot Cost and Scheduling Tool (DCAST);
Exchangeable Production System (EPS/G402A); Distribution Standard System (DSS);
Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS/D035K); Financial Inventory
Accounting and Billing System (FIABS/D035J); COGNOS (NIMMS history reports); Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) DSS Materiel Release Order Tracker and Materiel Error Correction
Alert (MECA) Smartboard.
2. Responsibilities. PST/PSS are responsible to ensure materiel transactions are processed
correctly. It is their responsibility to monitor, research and take action to correct materiel and
financial errors in ABOM and NIMMS. All research and corrective action procedures applicable
to these errors are located on the 309th Maintenance Wing (309 MXW) Workload Analysis &
Materiel                 SharePoint                 website,              located                at
https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/309MXWOPS/IADP/workloading/default.aspx in the material
support folder, which is located on the left side under documents. Throughout this instruction,
the reference to this website will be referred to as SharePoint. The information on SharePoint
will be used in conjunction with this instruction. Research is a key function at all levels to
ensure the transactions impacting end-item sale prices (EISP) are as accurate as possible, to
prevent overstating or understating materiel costs. The PST/PSS will work closely with
production, financial management (FM) and DLA personnel in order to correct and prevent
errors.
3. Procedures. This instruction will be divided into different types of materiel and financial
errors, and how to access the information on SharePoint to perform research and corrective
actions. This information will also provide some measures to prevent errors.
     3.1. Materiel Errors. These errors generate when materiel transactions are processed through
     ABOM/NIMMS with erroneous data, or the data coming back from the supply system does
     not match. If these materiel errors are worked in a timely manner, financial errors will not
     generate when the next billing cycle occurs. The types of materiel errors outlined in this
     instruction are: 230 status error report; 507 exception report; and awaiting parts (AWP)
     exception report. NOTE: Detailed information on research and corrective actions can be
     found on the SharePoint link.
        3.1.1. 230 Error Report.       230 errors generate when status is returned from
        WARRS/D035K, and it is not able to update NIMMS or the ABOM history file. This is
        due to quantity in NIMMS being zeroed out when the backorder is valid in
        WARRS/D035K. The 230 error report is accessed through the ABOM verify module.
        This report will be worked daily by the PST/PSS and/or when a job order number (JON)
        is being closed or cancelled. NOTE: Some 230 errors should be worked before, or in
        conjunction with working the 507 error report.
            3.1.1.1. The research required for the 230 error report is located on SharePoint. In
            order to access the training packages for researching the 230 errors, the following
            must occur: first click on the SharePoint link, then the material support folder. Next
            select the errors folder which will take you to a sub-folder titled material errors (230,
            507, AWP); once you are in the material errors folder you will select the OBW
309MXWI23-110 16 March 2012                                                                    3


        ABOM 230 report. Open this folder and follow the instructions for the 230 Material
        Errors (Attachment 2).
        3.1.1.2. When the corrective action is complete, the errors will drop off the 230 error
        report once the 309 MXW Production Support Office (309 MXW/OBWP) resends
        the report in ABOM at close of business each day.
     3.1.2. 507 Error Report. These errors are suspended transactions that generate when the
     following occurs:
        3.1.2.1. Due establishment errors are displayed on the 507 error report in the record
        code column as a 12, which is referred to as a REC CD 12 in the training package.
        These errors generate when a materiel due record is being manually established,
        incorrect data is entered or the JON is closed. NOTE: See Record Codes on 507
        Error Report (Attachment 3).
        3.1.2.2. Receipt errors are displayed on the 507 error report in the record code
        column as a 31, which is referred to as a REC CD 31 in the training package. These
        errors generate when a receipt was passed from EPS/G402A to NIMMS, and the
        receipt was not able to process successfully. The common reasons these errors occur
        are: due complete transaction was rejected; materiel due record was not found;
        materiel record was not found; the stock numbers were not linked.
        3.1.2.3. Store issue errors are displayed on the 507 error report in the record code
        column as a 32, which is referred to as a REC CD 32 in the training package. These
        errors generate when materiel is being issued from the AWP store, to a fully
        supportable end-item in ABOM and the transaction does not process successfully.
        The 507 error report can be accessed through DCAST or the MECA Smartboard.
        DCAST can be found through the Ogden Portal and requires a system access request .
        The MECA Smartboard is open to all production support personnel, and is accessed
        through COGNOS.
        3.1.2.4. The research required to clear the 507 errors is located on SharePoint. In
        order to access the training packages used to clear the errors, the following must
        occur: first click on the SharePoint link and then the material support folder. Next
        select the errors folder which will take you to a sub-folder titled material errors (230,
        507, AWP). Once you are in the material errors folder you will select the 507 errors
        folder, and follow the instructions to correct the 507 error. The errors should be
        worked daily and/or when the JON is closing or being cancelled. 507 errors have a
        suspense key and can only be cleared by accessing the MN061P Screen in NIMMS.
        SharePoint has a complete list of 507 error indicators.
     3.1.3. AWP Exceptions. AWP exceptions generate when data is missing, or does not
     match between ABOM and WARRS/D035K when placing end-items in formal AWP.
     The ABOM AWP exception report will be reviewed every time an end-item is placed in
     formal AWP, and corrective action will be taken immediately.
        3.1.3.1. Research required to determine the cause of AWP exceptions are found on
        SharePoint. Once you are in the material support folder, click on the errors folder.
        Next click on materiel errors (230, 507, AWP) and then select the OBW ABOM
        AWP exception sub-folder, and follow the steps to perform the research and
4                                                             309MXWI23-110 16 March 2012


           corrective action. At completion of the corrective action, ABOM will automatically
           delete the exception.
    3.2. DIFMS Financial Errors. DIFMS financial errors generate when a billing cycle has run
    (usually the 2d weekend of the month), and there is no receipt (R3), receipt reversal (-R3), or
    C2 to match the bill (B5) or credit bill (B9). NOTE: See DIFMS Codes on Financial Error
    Report (Attachment 4). These errors either understate or overstate materiel costs, and
    impact future rates and EISP if not corrected. These errors are displayed on the financial
    report which is located on Headquarters (HQ) AFMC FM (Attachment 5)
    https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-FM-
    MJ-O3-22-2&Filter=OO-FM-MJ-O3. Listed below are the common and most frequent
    types of financial errors, and also provide the root cause of the errors. The research required
    to clear Financial Errors (Attachment 6) are located on SharePoint.
       3.2.1. The 469 Materiel in Transit (MIT) Errors. 469 MIT errors generate when a due
       record is in NIMMS, B5, or B9 has passed from FIABS/D035J and the matching R3, C2,
       or open bill (B5) has not processed in NIMMS/DIFMS. There are two types of 469
       errors:
           3.2.1.1. B5 errors generate when a due is established in NIMMS and a bill has
           generated from FIABS/D035J, but a receipt hasn’t processed in NIMMS.
           3.2.1.2. B9 errors generate when a due is established in NIMMS and a credit bill was
           sent from FIABS/D035J, but there are no matching C2, open B5 or the R3 has been
           reversed in NIMMS. Refer to SharePoint for research and corrective action.
           SharePoint also has a list of NIMMS/DIFMS codes.
       3.2.2. 478 Accounts Receivable Errors. 478 errors generate when a turn-in (D6) is
       processed in NIMMS with credit requested, but no B9 was received; the turn-in was
       processed incorrectly (i.e., found on base D6 requesting credit); the price entered in the
       D6 was different than the credit received.
           3.2.2.1. Research required to determine the cause of 478 errors and the corrective
           action is located on SharePoint.
       3.2.3. 472 Accounts Payable Errors. 472 errors generate when a R3 has processed in
       NIMMS, but no matching B5 has been received from FIABS/D035J and the quantity on
       the bill and receipt do not match. Likely reasons for these types of errors are:
           3.2.3.1. A receipt was processed in error and materiel is still on backorder in
           WARRS/D035K;
       3.2.3.2. The materiel issue needs to be processed in WARRS/D035K;
           3.2.3.3. Research required to determine the cause of 472 errors and perform the
           corrective action is located on SharePoint.

     3.2.4. 484 Unmatched Bill Errors. 484 errors generate when a B5 is received from
     FIABS/D035J and there is no materiel due record in NIMMS; there was no R3 processed
     in NIMMS to match a B5; there was no C2 to match a B9 from FIABS/D035J.
        3.2.4.1. Detailed step-by-step instructions for research and corrective actions are
        located on SharePoint.
