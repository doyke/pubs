                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Program Definition. Military information is a national security asset which must be
conserved and protected and which may be shared with foreign representatives only when there
is a clearly defined advantage to the United States. It is United States policy to avoid creating
false impressions of its readiness to make defense articles, technologies, services or information
available. Therefore, Air Force personnel must ensure compliance with this Air Force Instruction
(AFI) as part of the initial planning for international activities. Only designated foreign
disclosure officers (FDOs) may approve the disclosure of classified and controlled unclassified
military information to foreign representatives. This instruction documents requirements of the
United States Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program; its applicability
to Air Force organizations and activities; responsibilities of Major Command (MAJCOM),
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) and Field Operating Agency (FOA) Commanders; responsibilities
of Foreign Disclosure Officers at all command levels; and guidance for authorizing the
disclosure of Classified Military Information (CMI) and Controlled Unclassified Military
Information (CUMI) to foreign representatives. (See explanation of terms CMI and CUMI.) This
AFI also provides guidance for authorizing disclosures of information that is not CMI or CUMI
and for approving foreign national visits to bases and facilities.
1.2. Applicability. Guidance in this instruction applies to:
   1.2.1. United States Air Force disclosures of CMI and CUMI to foreign representatives in
   support of official approved United States Air Force international programs. This AFI does

   Intelligence, Counterintelligence, Atomic Information, Strategic Planning and Guidance, and
   Narcotics Intelligence.
   1.2.2. United States Air Force decisions for disclosing information (including foreign
   government information) to which access or distribution limitations have been applied in
   accordance with national laws, policies, and regulations of the originating country.
   1.2.3. United States Air Force reviews of US contractor requests to export defense articles,
   services and technical data controlled by the Department of State, Directorate of Defense
   Trade Controls or Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security.
   1.2.4. Foreign government or international organization sponsored visits and assignments of
   foreign personnel or their representatives to United States Air Force facilities that involve
   access to CMI or CUMI.
   1.2.5. Notification and approval process for visits that are sponsored, controlled,
   administered and recorded by US European Command under its Joint Contact Team
   Program; by US Southern Command under its Latin American Fund or Traditional
   Commanders Activities Programs; by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research; or by the
   Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Department of State.
   1.2.6. Unclassified visits by Canadian government officials and certified Canadian
   contractors under the United States-Canada Joint Certification Program.

                                           Chapter 2

        UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FOREIGN DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY

2.1. Introduction. United States Air Force FDOs authorize disclosures of CMI and CUMI.
This chapter identifies how disclosure authority is delegated to United States Air Force, the
parameters for United States Air Force’s general disclosure authority, the criteria which must be
satisfied before disclosures can be authorized, how authority is delegated and redelegated within
United States Air Force, how United States Air Force disclosure guidance is documented, the
process for formulating disclosure guidance for new programs or initiatives, and who exercises
United States Air Force disclosure authority. Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7, and
Chapter 8 explain how to apply disclosure guidance to various foreign disclosure and
technology transfer processes.
2.2. Air Force Disclosure Authority for CMI. National Policy and Procedures for the
Disclosure of Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
Organizations (Short title: National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1)) provides national policy and
procedures to US Executive Branch departments and agencies for the disclosure of CMI to
foreign representatives. It also delegates general release authority for CMI to the head of the
department or agency originating CMI. The Secretary of the Air Force designates The Deputy
Under Secretary of the Air Force (International Affairs) (SAF/IA) as the Air Force Principal
Disclosure Authority. SAF/IA designates the Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer
Division (SAF/IAPD) as the Air Force Designated Disclosure Authority.
2.3. Air Force Disclosure Authority for CUMI. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and
Export Administration Act (EAA), as amended, legislate the policies and procedures for the
export of defense articles, services, and technical data having a military or space application or
being of dual-use interest, respectively. The Secretary of the Air Force designates SAF/IAPD as
the Air Force OPR for exports of technology, defense articles, technical data, and services under
both the AECA and EAA. SAF/IAPD formulates and recommends to the Defense Technology
Security Administration (DTSA) Air Force positions regarding exports of defense articles,
services, and technical data.
2.4. Air Force Disclosure Authority Parameters.
   2.4.1. Consistent with paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3, SAF/IAPD develops and delegates
   disclosure guidelines for CMI and CUMI originated by or for the Air Force for purposes such
   as, but not limited to, foreign military sales, exercises, military training, co-development or
   co-production programs, armaments cooperation initiatives, foreign national visits, foreign
   national information requests or munitions license requests. NDP-1 delegates authority to
   disclose eight categories of CMI to certain foreign governments and international
   organizations. A description of the categories is at Attachment 2.
   2.4.2. SAF/IAPD develops and delegates disclosure guidelines for CMI or CUMI officially
   obtained from a foreign source, combined military information, joint information,
   information originated by or for any US department or agency, or proprietary information
   only with the consent of the originator.

   2.4.3. SAF/IAPD disclosure authority does not extend to the following information.
   However, SAF/IAPD will assist proponents in obtaining disclosure approval from the
   appropriate authorities:
       2.4.3.1. Information marked Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) in
       accordance with DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence
       Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy.
       2.4.3.2. Originator Controlled (ORCON), or Caution-Proprietary Information Involved
       (PROPIN) in accordance with DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of
       Intelligence Information.
       2.4.3.3. Information marked with a Special Access Required caveat in accordance with
       AFI16-701, Special Access Programs.
       2.4.3.4. Information marked Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD).
2.5. Disclosure Criteria. In order to exercise general disclosure authority and responsibilities
under NDP-1, DoDD 5230.11, and DoDD 2040.2, International Transfers of Technology,
Goods, Services, and Munitions, SAF/IAPD ensures all disclosures of CMI and CUMI satisfy the
following NDP-1 criteria:
2.5. (AFMC)Local foreign disclosure authorities must examine the entire scope of a
program when reviewing information proposed for release. The Foreign Disclosure Office
must consider the classification of hardware, software, documents, and other information or
material needed for operations, maintenance, and training as well as information on
vulnerabilities of the system that will be released, or that could be discerned, through
exploitation of the disclosed material. The Foreign Disclosure Office’s initial disclosure review
must not be limited solely to introductory or promotional material but must consider the “whole
picture” and evaluate any possible follow-on releases that might result. Air Force designated
disclosure authorities may authorize disclosures when all the basic disclosure criteria identified
in AFI 16-201 are satisfied. This criteria review is applicable to, and required, for all
disclosures. Programs involving classified information will have a Security Classification Guide
(SCG). The local FDO should contact the Program Office for access to the latest SCG.
   2.5.1. Disclosure is consistent with US foreign policy and national security objectives
   concerning the foreign government or international organization.
   2.5.2. Disclosure is consistent with US military and security objectives.
   2.5.3. The foreign recipient will afford US information the same degree of security
   protection as that provided to it by the United States.
   2.5.4. Disclosure will result in a clearly defined benefit for the United States.
   2.5.5. Disclosure is limited to information necessary to the purpose for which disclosure is
   made.
2.6. Requests Exceeding Air Force General Disclosure Authority. Requests for disclosure
approval that exceed United States Air Force disclosure authority may be authorized if they
satisfy all disclosure criteria. SAF/IAPD must coordinate with either the NDPC or the agency
originating the information to obtain disclosure authority. Requests approved by the NDPC are
known as Exceptions to National Disclosure Policy (ENDPs). An NDPC decision may be
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                  15


appealed to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. After receiving all required inputs from functional
offices, SAF/IAPD will usually require ten working days to prepare the ENDP request and
another ten working days for coordination within the Headquarters Air Force before submission
to the NDPC. The NDPC usually concludes its review in ten working days. Requests for
exceptions contain the following elements:
   2.6.1. A concise statement of the action proposed and why an exception to policy is required.
   2.6.2. A detailed technical description of the equipment or information to be disclosed
   (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
   2.6.3. An assessment of how each of the disclosure criteria and conditions will be met
   (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
   2.6.4. Identification of any limitations placed on the proposed disclosure in terms of
   information to be disclosed, disclosure timing, or other pertinent caveats that may affect
   NDPC approval or denial of the request.
   2.6.5. A statement that the requested exception is either a continuing exception, subject to
   annual review, or a one-time exception.
   2.6.6. US embassy country team and theater command assessments of the proposed
   disclosure (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
   2.6.7. The opinion of other interested departments or agencies if joint service or shared
   information is involved.
   2.6.8. Any other information that would assist the NDPC members in evaluating the
   proposal.
2.7. Coordination of Disclosures Involving Military Equipment. Exports of military
equipment constitute disclosures of information subject to the requirements of this instruction.
Therefore, disclosure initiatives that involve foreign military sales or direct commercial sales of
Air Force systems and commercially developed non-US inventory systems are coordinated and
approved in accordance with the “Topline” process. SAF/IAPD is the Air Force OPR for Topline
Coordination.
   2.7.1. Each Topline proposal will contain the following elements:
       2.7.1.1. A thorough description of what is proposed for sale (provided by the office
       requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.2. An explanation of the benefits for the United States (provided by the office
       requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.3. An evaluation of the risk of compromise or unintended end use based on General
       Security of Military Information Agreements (GSOMIA), National Disclosure Policy
       Committee country security surveys, or intelligence community assessments.
       2.7.1.4. An assessment of foreign availability of similar weapons systems, technologies
       or capabilities (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.5. A description of precedent cases, if any.

  2.7.2. Foreign sales initiatives will be coordinated through SAF/AQ, SAF/IA, SAF/US, HQ
  USAF/XO, HQ USAF/XP, HQ USAF/IL, HQ USAF/XI and approved by HQ USAF/CC
  when any of the following conditions apply:
     2.7.2.1. Low Observable (LO), Counter Low Observable (CLO) and Non-Cooperative
     Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities or technologies are involved.
     2.7.2.2. The proposed sale will result in foreign access to US classified software source
     code.
     2.7.2.3. The system, technology, or capability is unique to the United States (i.e., No
     equivalent substitutes are available from foreign sources) and provides United States Air
     Force a significant military advantage over potential adversaries.
     2.7.2.4. The United States has no effective countermeasures or defenses against the
     system or capability.
     2.7.2.5. The proposed recipient government’s ability or willingness to protect US
     military information or use it for the intended US purpose is doubtful.
     2.7.2.6. The system proposed for sale is derived from a special access program.
  2.7.3. Proposed international sales that involve any of the following items will be
  coordinated at the division (Colonel) level by subject matter experts in SAF/AQ, SAF/US,
  HQ USAF/XO, HQ USAF/XP, HQ USAF/IL, HQ USAF/XI and approved by SAF/IA:
     2.7.3.1. Aircraft and air vehicles
     2.7.3.2. Jet or rocket engines
     2.7.3.3. Precision guided munitions and precision targeting systems
     2.7.3.4. Unmanned aerial vehicles
     2.7.3.5. Night and adverse weather terrain avoidance flight navigation systems
     2.7.3.6. Radars
     2.7.3.7. Intelligence collection systems
     2.7.3.8. Command, control and communications systems
     2.7.3.9. Information warfare and defensive countermeasure systems
     2.7.3.10. Ballistic missile defense systems, or
     2.7.3.11. Unclassified software source code for any of the aforementioned items
  2.7.4. In instances when consensus cannot be reached, dissenting opinions will be elevated
  to the appropriate assistant secretary or deputy chief of staff, or to HQ USAF/CC (if
  necessary) for resolution.
  2.7.5. Staff officer recommendations to non-concur and to impose conditions and limitations
  on a proposed sale must be justified in writing. Their justification will be based on
  substantiated risk to US military security, national security, or foreign policy objectives.
  2.7.6. SAF/IAPD normally requires ten working days to prepare the Topline request. The
  coordination process should normally be completed within an additional ten working days.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                 17


2.8. Delegation of Air Force Disclosure Authority. The United States Air Force Foreign
Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program relies on the principle of delegation to ensure
disclosure decisions are made promptly and effectively. After satisfying the disclosure criteria
identified in paragraph 2.5 or obtaining approval from the appropriate authority, SAF/IAPD
may delegate specific disclosure authority to be exercised by United States Air Force FDOs.
   2.8.1. SAF/IAPD may delegate disclosure authority to United States Air Force MAJCOM,
   DRU or FOA FDOs.
   2.8.2. MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA FDOs may redelegate disclosure authority to their
   subordinate FDOs in order to support international programs, foreign requests for
   information, or foreign visits.
   2.8.3. FDOs will notify United States Air Force personnel responsible for implementation of
   international programs when disclosure guidance related to their program has been received.
2.9. Documentation of Delegated Disclosure Authority. SAF/IAPD is the approval authority
for delegated disclosure authority to MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA FDOs in support of both one-
time and continuing disclosure requirements. One-time disclosure authorizations may be
documented in a specific memorandum or visit authorization. Requirements for continuing
information disclosures are normally documented in Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letters
(DDLs). Should the disclosure of information be required to support an international program
prior to issuance of a DDL, SAF/IAPD may approve disclosure guidance to support the program
until a DDL is approved.
   2.9.1. To establish disclosure guidance for new international programs:
       2.9.1.1. Proponents for international programs will identify program objectives, program
       information proposed for disclosure, and the classification and originator of the
       information proposed for disclosure to their supporting FDO. Proponents must also be
       prepared to assist the FDO in documenting how the program satisfies the disclosure
       criteria in paragraph 2.5.
       2.9.1.2. FDOs supporting international programs must participate in initial and
       continuing international program planning activities as necessary to ensure that disclosure
       guidance can be developed, coordinated at the local levels, and forwarded to SAF/IAPD
       in advance of program activities commencing.
       2.9.1.3. Servicing FDOs must forward requests for initial or updated program disclosure
       guidance, including the evaluation of the appropriate disclosure criteria, through
       disclosure channels to SAF/IAPD. MAJCOM, DRU or FOA FDOs should coordinate
       requests for disclosure guidance with all command offices having a functional interest in
       the program and information to be disclosed prior to forwarding to SAF/IAPD.
           2.9.1.3.1. Proponents for armaments cooperation programs will forward proposed
           DDLs to SAF/IAPQ as part of the coordination package required by AFI 16-110. All
           proponents must coordinate the proposed disclosure guidance with their MAJCOM,
           DRU, or FOA FDO prior to submission to SAF/IAPQ.
           2.9.1.3.2. Proposed DDLs for international initiatives originating within subordinate
           elements are prepared by the servicing FDO and forwarded to SAF/IAPD through the
           MAJCOM, DRU or FOA FDO.
 18                                                    AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


        2.9.1.4. FDOs will ensure proposed DDLs are consistent with the format at Attachment
        3.
            2.9.1.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Contact AFLCMC/WFNJ for current guidance or
            support before preparing a DDL.
        2.9.1.5. SAF/IAPD prepares and approves DDLs for disclosure initiatives originating at
        Headquarters Air Force.
2.10. Dissemination of DDLs. Generally, SAF/IAPD limits dissemination of DDLs to foreign
disclosure offices. Broader dissemination increases the risk of misinterpretation and disclosure
approvals made by unauthorized individuals. However, certain circumstances may warrant
dissemination outside disclosure offices. The following guidelines apply to these situations.
   2.10.1. FDOs may provide information copies of DDLs to Air Force offices to guide
   international program development, support assignment of foreign representatives in United
   States Air Force organizations or to facilitate sanitization of information in preparation for
   disclosure review. An FDO’s decision to provide DDL copies outside of FDO channels is
   based on a program proponent’s need for frequent access to the DDL and when physical
   separation from the FDO makes it impractical to review the DDL at the disclosure office.
   2.10.2. The FDO will transmit the DDL under a cover memo that documents specifically
   why the DDL is being provided, that the DDL may not be copied, in whole or in part, may
   not be incorporated into other documents and that the transmittal memo must remain attached
   to the DDL. A sample transmittal memo is at Attachment 4.
   2.10.3. The following statement must be conspicuously typed, printed or stamped on the
   front page of any Air Force DDL disseminated outside of foreign disclosure channels:
      “This DDL is for information only. It does not constitute authority to release equipment,
      technology or information and may not be used for such purpose. This DDL may not be
      copied in whole or in part. Information contained in the DDL may not be incorporated into
      other documents.”
   2.10.4. SAF/IAPD must approve, in writing, all delegations of United States Air Force
   disclosure authority outside United States Air Force. Proponents for such delegation must
   justify their request in writing to SAF/IAPD through disclosure channels.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                     19


                                            Chapter 3

                                 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Introduction. The National Disclosure Policy requires all departments and agencies which
are responsible for implementation of National Disclosure Policy to issue directives and
instructions to assure that disclosure decisions are made promptly and disclosure activities under
their jurisdiction are carried out effectively. To this end, the following program management
requirements have been developed.
3.2. Program Oversight. SAF/IAPD will evaluate implementation and management of
MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Programs. Staff
assistance visits will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines at Attachment 5.
SAF/IAPD will determine the staff assistance schedule.
3.3. MAJCOM, FOA and DRU Supplements to this Instruction. Coordinate all MAJCOM,
FOA and DRU supplements with SAF/IAPD.
3.4. United States Air Force Standard Suspenses for Disclosure Activities. In order to
respond promptly to disclosure requests made by supported activities, FDOs will track their
response time for document and visit requests.
   3.4.1. The United States Air Force standard for responding to document requests is ten
   working days from the date of receipt. Within the ten-day period, FDOs will approve, deny,
   return without action (if the requestor provides insufficient information on which to make a
   disclosure decision), coordinate an extension (if necessary), or refer the request to the
   appropriate disclosure authority.
   3.4.1. (AFMC) Requests for technical order releases and/or any information defined as
   technical data in accordance with International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), § 120.10
   are considered documentary disclosures and are subject to the standard 10 day suspense.
   3.4.2. The United States Air Force standard for responding to visit requests is no later than
   five working days prior to the visit start date for one-time visits, if the request is submitted at
   least 15 working days prior to the visit start date. Responses to visit requests received less
   than15 days before the start date will be made as far in advance of the visit start date as
   possible. Responses for recurring and extended visits should be made within 30 calendar
   days of receipt of a visit request or prior to any visit or assignment of a foreign
   representative.
3.5. Staffing and Recording of Disclosure Decisions. Air Force FDOs will use SPAN for
staffing and recording cases, decisions and reference data in support of departmental
responsibilities assigned by the National Disclosure Policy, the Arms Export Control Act and the
Export Administration Act.
   3.5.1. FDOs will document SIPRNet communications requirements to establish SPAN
   access locally.
   3.5.2. All disclosure decisions related to CMI and CUMI will be documented in the Foreign
   Disclosure System. FDOs without SPAN connectivity will use the SPAN off-line application
 20                                                   AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


   to document disclosure decisions locally and provide that information electronically to
   SAF/IAPD on a recurring basis as established by SAF/IAPD.
   3.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Only disclosures of Classified Information need to be documented
   in the Foreign Disclosure System (FDS). Reference para 1.3.9.5. of this supplement for
   guidance on documentation of CUI disclosures.
3.6. Training Requirements. Prior to authorizing disclosures of CMI, FDOs must complete the
United States Air Force Foreign Disclosure Officer Training Course sponsored by SAF/IAPD.
3.6. (AFMC)AFMC Foreign Disclosure Officer Training Program.
   3.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Newly appointed AFMC FDOs are required to attend the following
   training:
      3.6.1.1. (Added-AFMC) SAF/IAPD Foreign Disclosure Training. This training is
      scheduled through AFLCMC/WFNJ. A letter of appointment accomplishes this action.

      3.6.1.4. (Added-AFMC) International Programs Security Requirements (IPSR). This
      course is available as a standalone course (recommended) or, at the time of publication of
      this supplement, IPSR training is included in DISAM SCM-C course curriculum
      (abbreviated training). Online IPSR training can also be scheduled through the DISAM
      website at www.disam.dsca.mil.
      3.6.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Completion of courses listed in sections 3.6.1.1. and 3.6.1.2.
      allow for CUI release authority upon receipt of appointment letter as an AFMC FDO. It
      is the responsibility of the foreign disclosure officer to maintain copies of completion
      certificates and provide to AFLCMC/WFNJ.
      3.6.1.6. (Added-AFMC) Increased levels of disclosure authority, Confidential and
      Secret, will be issued by the Chief, AFLCMC/WFNJ. Classified disclosure authority is
      based on completion of training requirements and demonstrated proficiency in the
      execution of the AFMC Foreign Disclosure Program.
3.7. Outsourcing of National Disclosure Policy Functions. Within Air Force, FDOs may
obtain contractor support for National Disclosure Policy functions subject to the following
criteria.
   3.7.1. Contractors will not exercise foreign disclosure decision authority for disclosures of
   CMI and CUMI.
   3.7.2. Contractors may research and conduct analyses of technical, operational, policy and
   political and military factors related to proposed international programs.
   3.7.3. Contractors may draft supporting justification and disclosure guidance for
   international programs.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                  21


   3.7.4. Contractors may perform administrative functions such as coordination of disclosure
   initiatives and record keeping related to disclosure activities.
   3.7.5. (Added-AFMC) Field foreign disclosure offices that obtain contractor support must
   notify AFLCMC/WFNJ.
3.8. Waivers to Air Force Policy. SAF/IAPD will consider and may approve United States Air
Force requests to waive disclosure policies and procedures when the policy will negatively
impact a United States Air Force international program, and the waiver does not conflict with US
law or interagency policies and procedures. Personnel in the grade of Colonel or higher
(military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian) must sign all requests for waiver to this instruction. The
written request will identify the following:
   3.8.1. The specific policy to be waived;
   3.8.2. The specific impact if the policy is not waived;
   3.8.3. The reasons why the policy cannot be met; and
   3.8.4. The procedures to be implemented until such time as the waiver expires. Such
   procedures will ensure the intent of Air Force disclosure and technology transfer policy is
   met.

                                            Chapter 4

                               DISCLOSING INFORMATION

4.1. Introduction. FDOs authorize disclosures of CMI or CUMI to foreign representatives.
FDO approval is not required to provide United States Air Force information that has been
officially approved for public release or information that is unclassified and not controlled to a
foreign government or international organization. Disclosures are made for various reasons, i.e.,
in response to written requests for information related to foreign military sales, armaments
cooperation agreements, or Air Force activities in general, during visits by foreign
representatives, and during exercises or operational activities. There are three methods by which
information can be disclosed: oral, visual and documentary. Documentary disclosures occur
when control of information in tangible form (i.e., equipment, written material, floppy disk,
audio or video tape, e.) is transferred to a foreign government or international organization. This
chapter serves several purposes. First, it identifies the process through which United States Air
Force personnel request disclosure approvals. Second, it identifies FDO requirements for
processing and approving disclosure requests. This chapter identifies administrative actions that
must be completed after a disclosure decision is made. Establishes a process for disclosing
unclassified information that is not controlled. Finally, it identifies the requirement to obtain
SAF/AA approval for foreign attendance at symposia, conferences and contract-related meetings.
4.2. Submitting Requests To Disclose Information.
   4.2.1. SAF/IA country directors will submit foreign embassy requests for CMI or CUMI to
   the MAJCOM, DRU or FOA FDO having disclosure authority over the information
   requested. SAF/IAPD will assist country directors as necessary.
       4.2.1.1. Unless other government-to-government channels are established (see
       paragraph 4.2.2.1), foreign governments or international organizations should submit
       requests for information through their accredited attaché in Washington DC. Foreign
       governments and international organizations should submit electronic requests via the
       Foreign Disclosure System or via written request, if they are not a SPAN user. Requests
       contain information specified by the SPAN Foreign Disclosure System or as documented
       in the Handbook for Service Attaches Accredited to the Department of the Air Force.
   4.2.2. United States Air Force personnel will submit requests to disclose CMI or CUMI to
   foreign recipients, either in the United States or abroad, to their servicing FDO.
       4.2.2.1. When designated by their government to conduct business with the United States
       Air Force, foreign representatives should use established procedures to submit requests
       related to specific foreign military sales programs or armaments cooperation agreements.
       Generally, such requests are submitted directly to United States Air Force individuals
       appointed as case managers or technical project officers, respectively. The case manager
       or technical project officer will submit requests to the servicing FDO.
       4.2.2.2. The actual transfer of US technical data to foreign representatives in most cases
       must be pursuant to a foreign military sale, loan, lease or grant agreement, export license
       or cooperative agreement (MOU, MOA).
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                               23


   4.2.3. United States Air Force proponents must provide a written request to their servicing
   FDO. (If the disclosure action is based on a written request from a foreign government or
   international organization, an additional request from the United States Air Force proponent
   may not be necessary if the request contains the information required below.) The United
   States Air Force proponent will include the following information in the request to the FDO:
       4.2.3.1. The proposed foreign recipient including country, classification of information
       to be disclosed, and originator of the information.
       4.2.3.2. The purpose of disclosure (i.e., foreign military sales program, armaments
       cooperation agreement, operational or exercise requirement, etc.).
       4.2.3.3. The benefit the United States is expected to receive from the disclosure or the
       resulting impact expected if the request is denied.
       4.2.3.4. For documentary disclosures, proponents must provide a copy of the document
       to be disclosed and identify any portions of the document that are not part of the
       disclosure request.
       4.2.3.5. For oral and visual disclosures, proponents must provide written details
       identifying information to be discussed.
       4.2.3.6. Requested release date.
   4.2.4. Air Force organizations will obtain assistance from their servicing FDO when
   receiving requests directly from foreign governments, international organizations, etc.
4.3. Processing Requests To Disclose Information. FDOs will coordinate disclosure
proposals with offices having a functional interest in the information to be disclosed. This
coordination ensures programmatic, policy, operational, technology and security related issues
are evaluated. Subject matter experts will be enlisted to provide assessments within their
functional area.
4.4. Approving Requests To Disclose Information.
   4.4.1. FDOs approve disclosure requests consistent with delegated disclosure authority.
   FDOs will ensure disclosure approvals are consistent with the formats at Attachment 6 and
   Attachment 7.
       4.4.1.1. When continuing authority is appropriate, FDOs will assist Air Force proponents
       in requesting a new, or revising a current, DDL.
       4.4.1.2. FDOs will forward requests through disclosure channels to SAF/IAPD when
       their delegated authority is exceeded. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU FDOs will forward
       requests to SAF/IAPD when their authority is exceeded.
          4.4.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Disclosure requests that exceed AFMC field FDO
          delegated authority must be forwarded to AFLCMC/WFNJ. Requests should include
          comprehensive supporting justification in accordance with AFI 16-201. Incomplete
          requests will be returned without action. If release determination cannot be made at
          the Command level, a Command position will be added, and the request will be
          forwarded to SAF/IAPD for a final decision. Use of AFMC Form 458, Foreign
          Disclosure Release Worksheet, is required when delegated authority is not at the field
          level. Guidance for use of AFMC Form 458 is at Attachment 16. The SAF/IAPD

          decision will be routed back to the field foreign disclosure office through official
          disclosure channels.
       4.4.1.3. Requests must include the information required by paragraph 4.2.3.
   4.4.2. FDOs include the following requirements in approvals to disclose information:
       4.4.2.1. Removal of bibliographies, reference lists and distribution lists when these
       references are not, or would not be, approved for release to the recipient country.
       4.4.2.2. The following statement must be stamped or typed on the front or cover page of
       documents containing CMI or CUMI:
        “This information is furnished on the condition that it will not be released to another
        nation without specific authority of the Department of the Air Force of the United
        States, that it will be used for military purposes only, that individual or corporate
        rights originating in the information, whether patented or not, will be respected, that
        the recipient will report promptly to the United States any known or suspected
        compromise, and that the information will be provided substantially the same degree
        of security afforded it by the Department of Defense of the United States. Also,
        regardless of any other markings on the document, it will not be downgraded or
        declassified without written approval of the originating US agency.”
       4.4.2.3. Include the following statement at the beginning of electronic media containing
       CMI or CUMI:
        “This information is furnished on the condition that it will be given substantially the

   by the appropriate policy authorities of the sending and receiving governments. FDOs or Air
   Force proponents will use Air Force Form 349, Receipt for Documents Released to
   Accredited Representatives of Foreign Nations when transmitting CMI to a foreign
   government or international organization. Air Force organizations releasing classified
   information maintain forms as prescribed in AFMAN 37-139, Records Distribution
   Schedule.
4.6. Documenting Disclosure Decisions. FDOs will document disclosures and denials of CMI
and CUMI in the Foreign Disclosure System, unless this requirement has been exempted.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                  25


4.7. Disclosures Not Requiring FDO Authorization. Subject to all of the following
conditions, Air Force personnel do not require FDO authorization to disclose unclassified
information to which no access or distribution limitations have been applied:
   4.7.1. The intended recipient is a representative of a foreign government or international
   organization and the information is being provided for an official United States Air Force
   purpose. (Note: Air Force personnel must ensure any information to be provided to the
   general public, including foreign nationals, must be released in accordance with the
   provisions of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. A FOIA release
   determination, in accordance with DoDR 5400.7-R/AFSUP, DoD Freedom of Information
   Act Program. must be made if a written request has been received for Air Force Records.),
   and
   4.7.2. The information is unclassified and related to the roles, missions, doctrine,
   organization and general capabilities of the United States Air Force, MAJCOMs or any
   subordinate units, general information on the function, purpose and general capabilities and
   characteristics of defense equipment or general scientific, mathematical or engineering
   principles commonly taught in schools, colleges, or universities; and
   4.7.3. The information is not CUMI; and
   4.7.4. No access or distribution limitations have been applied to the information in
   accordance with applicable US or foreign laws or regulations, e.g., Freedom of Information
   Act; and
   4.7.5. The disclosure is for information purposes only. There is no US government intent to
   sell, loan, lease, co-develop, or co-produce defense articles, participate in any operational or
   exercise activities, support any current foreign military sales or armaments cooperation
   program or assign foreign nationals to Air Force organizations; and
   4.7.6. Originator consent for the disclosure is obtained; and
   4.7.7. The following statement is conspicuously displayed at the front or beginning of the
   disclosed information, “This briefing, presentation, or document is for information only. No
   US Government commitment to sell, loan, lease, co-develop or co-produce defense articles
   or provide defense services is implied or intended.”
4.8. Foreign Attendance at Symposia, Conferences and Contract-Related Meetings.
   4.8.1. In addition to requests for disclosure approval, Air Force personnel sponsoring, co-
   sponsoring or conducting conferences, symposia and other similar meetings must also obtain
   approval for such gatherings from SAF/AA consistent with AFI 61-205, Sponsoring or Co-
   Sponsoring, Conducting, and Presenting DoD-Related Scientific Papers at Unclassified and
   Classified Conferences, Symposia and Other Similar Meetings.
       4.8.1.1. The requirement to appoint a DoD security sponsor for classified meetings
       involving contractor participants does not exempt contractors from the licensing
       requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
4.9. Foreign Access to Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Non-secure
Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) or Stand-Alone Systems. AFI 33-202,

foreign nationals does not equate to authority to disclose data or access systems located on that
network. A disclosure review by the servicing FDO is a prerequisite for access to information
resident on SIPRNet, NIPRNet, or other networks.
   4.9.1. (Added-AFMC) MAJCOM FDO approval is required IAW AFMAN 33-282,
   Computer Security (COMPUSEC) and AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA)

Security Assistance Technical Order Data System (SATODS) in accordance with the Software
User Manual for the Security Assistance Technical Order Data System.
   4.10.1. United States Air Force technical orders are government furnished equipment and in
   accordance with the Arms Export Control Act may not be exported except when they support
   sales of US government furnished equipment. United States Air Force technical orders may
   be released to a foreign contractor after proper FDO review in direct support of an Air Force
   contract. United States Air Force technical orders may also be released in support of FMS
   activity through the Security Assistance Technical Order Distribution System (SATODS)
   only when the following conditions are met:
       4.10.1.1. The FMS customer’s system configuration is the same as the system
       documented in the technical order or so similar to the US system that the unrelated data
       does not complicate or confuse the operating or maintenance instruction; and
       4.10.1.2. All reference information in the technical order is releasable.
   4.10.2. For safety reasons, FDOs will not sanitize United States Air Force technical orders.
   4.10.3. If these conditions cannot be met, a Country Standard Technical Order should be
   developed to match the FMS customer’s configuration.

                                            Chapter 5

 ONE-TIME AND RECURRING VISITS BETWEEN AIR FORCE PERSONNEL AND
  REPRESENTATIVES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL
                        ORGANIZATIONS

5.1. Introduction. The AECA requires the US Government obtain security, non-transfer and
end-use assurances from foreign governments and international organizations before transferring
defense articles, services or technical data (classified or unclassified). Information disclosed
under the auspices of a foreign visit may constitute a defense article, service or technical data.
Accordingly, the International Visits Program (IVP) was established to ensure CMI and CUMI
information proposed for release to visitors has been properly authorized for disclosure to the
requesting government or international organization. This chapter includes DoD International
Visit Program (IVP) requirements and United States Air Force requirements for processing visits
to which the IVP does not apply. Visits to Air Force facilities should not interfere with the
facility’s mission requirements. Foreign governments and international organizations are
required to provide validated security clearances, need-to-know verification and government
sponsorship regarding their citizens or representatives. FDOs are responsible for approving or
denying the disclosure of CMI and CUMI to foreign representatives during visits to Air Force or
contractor facilities, or when Air Force personnel visit foreign government or international
organization facilities abroad or in the United States. In specific cases, FDOs may also approve
disclosures by US contractors supporting Air Force programs. See para 7.5 for guidance on
sponsored visits. All visits subject to the requirements of this chapter can be defined as either a
one-time or recurring. Extended visits are addressed in Chapter 6, Assignments and Placements
of Foreign Nationals.
5.2. General Visit Policies and Procedures.
   5.2.1. Air Force personnel disclose CMI and CUMI only to foreign representatives who
   possess an appropriate security clearance and need-to-know as verified in their visit request
   and in accordance with disclosure guidance provided by the FDO.
   5.2.2. A visit authorization does not constitute the legal basis for providing defense articles,
   services (including training) or technical data to foreign representatives. Letters of Offer and
   Acceptance (LOAs), international agreements with a foreign government or international
   organization, or other appropriate legal arrangement must be concluded prior to FDOs
   authorizing disclosures of CMI and CUMI related to the transfer of defense articles, services,
   or technical data.
   5.2.3. Foreign governments are required to submit visit requests for US citizens acting on
   their behalf when visiting Air Force facilities.
   5.2.4. The US contact officer for any foreign representative and foreign national visit must
   ensure physical controls are implemented to limit visitor access to that information
   authorized for disclosure. SAF/IAPD does not usually require written security plans for one-
   time or recurring visits. However, SAF/IAPD or other functional program managers, in
   response to specific circumstances may require US contact officers to prepare security plans
   on a case-by-case basis for one-time or recurring visits. One-time and recurring visits do not
   meet the requirements for unescorted access to Air Force facilities.

   5.2.5. Air Force organizations ensure a badge or pass is issued that clearly identifies the
   bearer as a foreign representative.
   5.2.6. Air Force military or civilian personnel assigned to the organization will escort
   foreign representatives in facilities where access to CMI or CUMI will or may occur. Escorts
   for foreign representatives to and within other facilities are subject to local base security
   procedures.
   5.2.6. (AFMC) Installation Security Forces control installation access for official and
   unofficial (social) visits. Requests by or for foreign national attendance at unofficial
   installation functions should be referred to the appropriate Security Forces office.
   5.2.7. Air Force contact officers organizing US guest lecturers for professional military
   education activities will inform such guests that foreign nationals are in attendance and that
   the guests must obtain disclosure approval from their servicing FDO prior to any presentation
   where CMI or CUMI may be discussed.
   5.2.8. Air Force contact officers organizing foreign guest lecturers for professional military
   education activities will brief students regarding disclosure guidelines prior to the arrival of
   foreign guest lecturers.
5.3. Submitting Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. Air Force and foreign
proponents of foreign representative visits will submit requests to the servicing Air Force foreign
disclosure office as required below.
   5.3.1. Visits to Air Force Organizations and Installations.
       5.3.1.1. Foreign governments will submit requests under IVP for visits proposed by their
       representatives and when invited by an Air Force organization. SPAN will automatically
       assign visit responsibility to either SAF/IAPD or to a subordinate FDO based on
       SAF/IAPD guidance.
       5.3.1.2. Public Affairs Officers approve foreign national participation in public affairs
       activities subject to their visit approval process. No visit request under the IVP is
       required.
       5.3.1.3. DoD proponents responsible for managing peacetime engagement programs,
       such as the EUCOM military contact program and Latin American Cooperation Fund,
       will submit visit requests to SAF/IAPD. Requests will include proposed dates of visit,
       facility to be visited, points of contact, purpose of visit, and the visitor’s name, rank,
       position, organization of assignment, date of birth, citizenship, place of birth, and
       identification or passport number.
       5.3.1.4. Air Force proponents for basic research visits by foreign nationals will submit
       proposals to the servicing FDO of the activity to be visited and provide information
       copies to additional organizations as appropriate. The European Office of Aerospace
       Research and Development (EOARD), the Asian Office of Aerospace Research and
       Development (AOARD) and External Programs & Resources Interface, Air Force Office
       of Scientific Research (AFOSR/NI) are the Air Force proponents for basic research visits
       to the United States Air Force.
       5.3.1.5. Air Force personnel will coordinate with their servicing FDO before extending
       visit invitations to foreign representatives. Invitations may be extended only after FDOs
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                    29


     approve disclosure guidelines for the visit. Foreign representatives are required to submit
     security assurances via the IVP even though invited by Air Force activities.
         5.3.1.5.1. Proponents will provide the supporting FDO with the names of the
         proposed visitors, organization/agency, nationality, visit location, and specific
         purpose for the visit. Justification for the visit will include the advantage to the
         United States for the visit. If there is no established program, the visit dates and the
         information to be disclosed during the visit will be outlined.
     5.3.1.6. US defense contractors employing foreign nationals may directly arrange visits
     to Air Force organizations consistent with the requirements of the National Industrial
     Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). Air Force organizations to be visited
     will request a copy of the export license or other written authorization, as applicable, to
     assist in planning for the visit. Foreign national access to CMI in these cases is not
     authorized unless the US Government has granted the individual a Limited Access
     Authorization. Air Force hosts must coordinate the visit with their servicing FDO.
     5.3.1.7. The NATO security office submits visit requests for representatives of any
     NATO Command or Agency or the NATO International Staff (including US citizens
     assigned to NATO positions or schools).
         5.3.1.7.1. NATO security officials process visits of representatives of NATO
         Commands, Agencies, schools or the NATO International Staff under the United
         States Security Authority for North Atlantic Treaty Organization Affairs (USSAN)
         Instruction 1-69 only when access to NATO classified information is required.
         Recurring visits related to NATO Production and Logistics Organization or NATO
         Industrial Advisory Group activities shall be processed under USSAN 1-70.
     5.3.1.8. Foreign students who participate in security assistance training on Invitational
     Travel Orders (ITOs) pursuant to DoD 5105.38-M are not required to submit a visit
     request to attend training. In accordance with DoD guidance, Air Force recognizes ITOs
     issued by SAOs as validation of security assurances for international military students
     participating in formal Air Force training courses. The SAO must obtain the required
     security assurances from the parent government before students arrive for training. SAOs
     issue ITOs consistent with the requirements of AFI 16-105, Joint Security Assistance
     Training and when the training is approved for disclosure to the foreign government.
         5.3.1.8.1. Air Force personnel responsible for administration of training courses with
         foreign students will coordinate visits to other Air Force or DoD organizations that
         are part of the formal approved course through their servicing FDO.
         5.3.1.8.2. Students wishing to participate in official activities that are not part of their
         formal training program must submit a visit request through their Embassy in
         Washington DC.
  5.3.2. Visits Including Flights on US Military Aircraft
     5.3.2.1. Foreign visits that include flights on Air Force aircraft require specific approval
     for the flight itself in accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, in addition to
     authorization for the visit.
 30                                                      AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


       5.3.2.2. No visit request is required for flying missions performed by Air Force units
       under the sponsorship of a Combatant Commander, Unified Command or other Service,
       unless Air Force organizations will disclose CMI or CUMI. Air Force units must
       coordinate such missions with their servicing FDO to obtain disclosure guidance.
       5.3.2.3. Visit requests are not required for foreign nationals participating in public affairs
       travel.
       5.3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Requests for foreign nationals flying on US Air Force aircraft
       from AFMC units will be staffed in accordance with AFMC Supplement I to AFI 11-401,
       Aviation Management, to the appropriate CC, by the hosting organization. See AFMC
       Supplement I to AFI 11-401, for specific instructions. Approvals are contingent upon the
       local foreign disclosure review and approval. Circumstances vary considerably which
       require each request to be reviewed for foreign disclosure on a case by case basis
       depending on purpose, justification and access involved. If purpose is validated and
       covered by existing delegated policy, disclosure approval, with limitations, will be
       accomplished by the local field foreign disclosure office. If the request exceeds field unit
       foreign disclosure authority, the request should be forwarded to AFLCMC/WFNJ for a
       release determination.
   5.3.3. Visits to US Contractor Facilities
       5.3.3.1. Section 5, Chapter 10 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating
       Manual, describe the procedures that the United States and foreign governments have
       established to control international visits to contractor facilities.
       5.3.3.2. Foreign governments and international organizations must submit visit requests
       consistent with the IVP for visits to contractor facilities when access to CMI is
       reasonably anticipated.
       5.3.3.3. Foreign governments and international organizations should directly arrange
       unclassified visits to US contractors when the contractor is authorized to disclose
       information pursuant to either the State Department’s International Traffic in Arms
       Regulation or the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations.
       5.3.3.4. Foreign governments and international organizations must submit visit requests

   directly arrange visits to Air Force organizations and contractor facilities which meet the
   conditions and procedures under the United States-Canada Joint Certification Program.
5.4. Coordinating Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. FDOs will establish
processes, so that all functional offices with an interest in a proposed visit have an opportunity to
review and make recommendations regarding the request.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                 31


5.5. Approving Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. FDOs approve foreign
representative visits consistent with delegated disclosure authority. FDOs shall notify both the
requester and US contact officer when a visit request is approved.
   5.5.1. FDOs will document disclosure guidance for each visit and provide it to the US point
   of contact in advance of the visit. The FDO will provide information copies of the approval,
   as necessary.
   5.5.2. FDOs will provide the requester any information necessary for the visitor to complete
   arrangements for the visit, for example, name of US point of contact, contact’s phone
   number, uniform requirements, etc.
   5.5.3. FDOs will not sponsor foreign visits to US contractor facilities unless approval under
   paragraph 7.5 of this instruction has been obtained. Air Force sponsorship of foreign visits
   to US contractor facilities may constitute an exemption to the licensing requirements of the
   ITAR and Export Administration Act.
5.6. Denying Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. FDOs will notify the requester
when a visit has been denied. FDOs will provide the requester with justification for the denial.
Organizations may deny visits for reasons such as operational, mission or programmatic impacts,

may use administrative reasons when visit length or type is inappropriate for the visit purpose,
submission of a duplicate requests occurs, the US contact officer is unavailable, etc.
5.7. Visits Hosted By Foreign Tenants on Air Force Installations. Air Force hosts various
foreign organizations on Air Force bases within the United States. These foreign-tenant
organizations may host visits by US or other foreign representatives. Foreign representative
visits to foreign-tenant organizations may be conducted without submitting a request through the
IVP. However, foreign tenant organizations must coordinate with and obtain approval for base
access from the US host organization consistent with local procedures prior to such visits. US
organizations developing arrangements for long-term foreign tenants must ensure visit approval
procedures, developed in concert with local Air Force authorities, are included in the applicable
LOA or international agreement or implementing arrangement. The Air Force host organization
maintains final approval authority for base access during such visits.
5.8. Air Force Personnel Visiting Foreign Government or International Organization
Establishments Overseas. Air Force personnel will obtain approval to visit foreign
establishments overseas in accordance with DoD 4500.54-G, the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
Prior to commencing foreign travel, Air Force personnel will obtain disclosure approval from
their servicing FDO for CMI and CUMI that will be discussed during their visit. Travelers will
record the designated FDO, by office symbol that approved disclosure of the information to be
discussed during their visits in the personnel clearance request.
5.8. (AFMC)The following requirements apply to all AFMC civilian and military
personnel -traveling overseas on TDY when AFMC business requires contact with

                                            Chapter 6

           ASSIGNMENTS AND PLACEMENTS OF FOREIGN NATIONALS

6.1. Introduction. Foreign representatives may be assigned to or placed in Air Force
organizations only in accordance with the terms of a written agreement or foreign military sales
(FMS) LOA concluded in accordance with applicable law and regulations. These terms identify
administrative support, liability, obligations and responsibilities of all parties. The LOA or
agreement also establishes the extended visit position. Sample terms that apply to placement and
assignment of foreign representatives are at Attachment 8. The exact language may differ as a
result of the negotiation of an agreement or LOA, but all requirements of these terms will be
addressed. An extended visit request identifies the individual who will be assigned to the
position. Extended visit requests are not required for personnel participating in the International
Personnel Exchange Program (PEP). This chapter outlines six extended visit categories, five of
which are currently defined by DoD policy. The sixth category refers to foreign nationals under
contract to the Air Force. Do not make any commitments to assign visitors to Air Force
organizations under extended visits unless the requirements of this chapter have been met.
Proponents for extended visits other than one of the six defined types will forward proposals
with sufficient justification, a description of duties to be assigned and proposed disclosure
guidelines through command channels to SAF/IAPD for a policy evaluation.
6.2. Types of Extended Visit Programs. Visitors are assigned subject to the requirements of
the International Personnel Exchange Program (PEP), the Engineer and Scientist Exchange
Program (ESEP), the Administrative and Professional Personnel Exchange Program (APEP), the
Cooperative Program Personnel (CPP) program, or the Foreign Liaison Officer (FLO) program.
Although not a specific program, foreign nationals employed by or under contract to the US
Government and performing duty on a Air Force installation are also considered to be on
extended visits.
6.3. Bases for Extended Visit Positions. PEP, APEP and ESEP exchanges all require an
international agreement that provides for the exchange of personnel between governments. The
authority for CPP is a cooperative RDT&E or production agreement that establishes a specific
cooperative program between parties and includes provisions for placing CPP. The establishment
of a FLO is by an FMS LOA that provides for the placement of FLO personnel and defines the
specific support or services to be provided to the FLO by the DoD. A FLO may also be
established by international agreement; however, an LOA is also required for reimbursement to
the DoD when support or services are provided.
   6.3.1. International Airman Division (SAF/IAPA), Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under
   Secretary for International Affairs provides policy guidance regarding establishment and
   management of PEP positions. See AFI 16-107, International Personnel Exchange Program
   (PEP). Designated MAJCOM offices of primary responsibility provide MAJCOM level
   oversight and support for foreign exchange personnel. See para 10.6, AFI 16-107.
   6.3.2. Armaments Cooperation Division, Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under Secretary for
   International Affairs (SAF/IAPQ) provides policy guidance regarding establishment and
   management of APEP, ESEP and CPP positions. See AFI 16-110, US Air Force
   Participation in International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs. International focal
 34                                                     AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


   points may be designated at MAJCOM or subordinate activities to provide advice and
   assistance regarding implementation of international armaments cooperation policies.
   6.3.3. Security Assistance Policy Division, Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under Secretary
   for International Affairs (SAF/IAPX) provides policy guidance regarding establishment and
   management of LOAs for FLO support. See AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and
   Security Assistance Management. The Air Force Security Assistance Center and Air Force
   Security Assistance Training Center provide advice and assistance regarding implementation
   of security assistance policies.
   6.3.4. Local contracting activities will coordinate contracts to hire foreign nationals with the
   FDO prior to advertising the contract.
6.4. Establishing Extended Visit Positions.
   6.4.1. Air Force proponents seeking to establish an extended visitor position will coordinate
   with the appropriate OPR within their command to verify that an appropriate agreement
   exists to establish the basis for the assignment. Where no agreement exists, the extended visit
   position may not be established until such time as the appropriate agreement/LOA is in place.
   Proponents will advise the servicing FDO of initiatives to create extended visit positions and
   include the FDO in planning for such assignments.
       6.4.1.1. For activities outside Headquarters Air Force, FDOs advise SAF/IAPD of
       approved extended visit positions. At a minimum, FDOs identify the type of position
       (i.e., PEP, ESEP, APEP, CPP, FLO or contractor), the basis under which the position
       would be approved and the location of the extended visit position.
       6.4.1.1. (AFMC) AFLCMC/WFNJ maintains the Long Term Foreign National Data
       Base (LTFNDB). When establishing new positions, or processing newly assigned
       extended visitors to established positions, the servicing field FDO unit will report these
       changes through the AFLCMC/WFNJ Organizational Mailbox. AFLCMC/WFNJ will
       notify SAF/IAPD of all new positions.
       6.4.1.2. (Added-AFMC) ESEP positions will only be pursued for establishment
       following review, support and coordination with the Air Force Office of Scientific
       Research (AFOSR) and AFLCMC/WFNJ. Contact AFLCMC/WFNJ for appropriate
       AFOSR representative contact information.
          6.4.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) ESEP positions within AFMC will only be assigned to
          Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) units.
   6.4.2. An important aspect of planning for an extended visitor is the identification of the
   visitor’s assigned responsibilities and duties. All programs under which an extended visit is
   made require the development of a position description. These position descriptions are
   necessary to ensure assigned duties are consistent with the authorizing agreement under
   which visitors are assigned and that there is no misunderstanding between parties regarding
   the responsibilities that will be assigned to the visitor. A sample position description for PEP
   is found in AFI 16-107. A sample position description for other extended visit positions is
   found at Attachment 9.
       6.4.2.1. Generally, position descriptions will be included in the staff packages requesting
       extended visit positions under the ESEP, CPP and PEP programs.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                35


       6.4.2.2. ESEP, CPP and PEP participants will not perform liaison functions between the
       United States Air Force and the parent service. FLOs will not act in an official capacity
       for the Air Force.
6.5. Dual Assignments as CPPs and FLOs. In some cases and in accordance with the terms of
the authorizing agreement, an extended visitor may perform duties part time as a FLO and part
time as a CPP. SAF/IA must approve the arrangements for management of such visitors.
Requests for such approvals must be forwarded to SAF/IAPD through disclosure channels.
   6.5.1. Proposed arrangements must ensure that such “dual assignments” would not be
   detrimental to the cooperative program involved and that responsibility and funding for the
   FLO functions are separately maintained. This requirement exists since FLO and CPP
   positions rely on different US legal authorities.
   6.5.2. Dual assignments are not permitted for ESEP, PEP, and APEP positions.
6.6. Coordinating Extended Visit Requests. FDOs will be notified of proposed assignments
to extended visit positions either via SPAN or by the Air Force supervisor for a foreign exchange
officer. FDOs will establish processes so that all functional offices with an interest in the
proposed assignment have an opportunity to review and make recommendations regarding the
request.
   6.6.1. The FDO, Air Force contact officer and other subject matter experts as necessary, will
   develop a security plan that documents access controls to information and facilities within
   the organization and installation. See Attachment 10 for a sample security plan.
   6.6.2. The FDO and Air Force contact officer will initially determine any other locations the
   assigned visitor may be required to visit during the term of his assignment to carry out
   responsibilities and duties under the approved position description. The FDO and Air Force
   contact officer will periodically review the initial determination.
       6.6.2.1. Recurring visits for APEP, ESEP, PEP, and CPP may be directly arranged
       between Air Force organizations. SAF/IAPD also supports directly arranged visits with
       other Services and Defense Agencies for PEP and CPP. However, Air Force contact
       officers must comply with the policies and regulations of the Service or Agency to be
       visited. Air Force contact officers will coordinate visits with their servicing FDOs to
       ensure disclosure guidance is in place prior to the commencement of the visit. FDOs
       should use SPAN to coordinate these visits.
       6.6.2.2. Recurring visits to various locations for FLOs are requested by their
       governments via SPAN.
       6.6.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Foreign disclosure offices will annually screen expiration
       dates on approved visit authorizations for foreign nationals assigned on extended visit
       authorizations. Requests for extentions to currently assigned foreign nationals must be
       submitted by the foreign national’s government through FVS. The field FDO will
       contact the foreign national’s supervisor to determine whether the host unit supports
       extending the visiting foreign national’s assignment before approving the extention.
       Assignment extensions should be submitted by the foreign national’s embassy with
       sufficient lead time (typically, NLT 30 days from current approved extended visit
       request) for the field FDO to process the request prior to the current visit’s expiration
 36                                                      AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


       date. Once the visit authorization has expired, the foreign national is no longer
       authorized access to US Government installations or facilities.
6.7. Approving Extended Visit Requests. FDOs shall not approve extended visit requests until
verifying that an appropriate agreement or LOA authorizing the extended position exists.
   6.7.1. FDOs will approve the release of CMI and CUMI in accordance with delegated
   disclosure authority to support the assignment.
   6.7.2. FDOs will document disclosure guidance for each visit. This guidance will be
   provided to the US contact officer for the visit and to information addressees, as necessary.
   6.7.3. FDOs will brief Air Force contact officers on their responsibilities related to visitors
   assigned on an extended basis.
   6.7.4. FDOs will maintain a file for each extended visit made to organizations that they
   support. At a minimum, files will include a copy of the extended visit request (if the FDO is
   not an on-line SPAN user), verification of the legal basis for the visit, the security plan, and
   coordination and approval records for PEP and CPP visits to other locations. FDOs shall
   notify the requester when a visit has been approved. The FDO will also provide the requester
   the name and telephone number of the visit point of contact and the terms of the visit
   approval.
6.8. Security Requirements.
   6.8.1. Access to CMI and CUMI depends on the security clearance granted by the visitor’s
   government, need-to-know, and disclosure guidance issued by the contact officer’s servicing
   FDO.
   6.8.2. Exchange personnel shall not have personal custody of classified or controlled
   unclassified information.
   6.8.3. FLOs may have custody of classified information as stipulated in the authorizing
   agreement that establishes their position and subject to the following conditions:
       6.8.3.1. FLOs may assume custody of documentary information when authorized in
       writing by their government, provided US security personnel exercise oversight over the
       storage container. This oversight is similar to that executed by US security personnel over
       US storage containers.
       6.8.3.2. FLOs may act as couriers only when they are authorized in writing by their
       government to assume responsibility as an agent of their government. The FLO’s
       government is required to provide all necessary courier credentials.
6.9. Access to Air Force Facilities and Installations.
   6.9.1. Air Force personnel will not approve unescorted access for foreign representatives to
   Air Force restricted or controlled areas or other facilities where access to CMI or CUMI will
   or may occur, unless all of the following conditions have been met:
       6.9.1.1. The foreign national’s government extends commensurate reciprocal privileges
       to DoD personnel.
       6.9.1.2. The foreign national is sponsored by his or her government or international
       organization through a formal visit request, and the need for frequent access is justified.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                                    37


       6.9.1.3. Security measures are in place to limit access to only CMI and CUMI authorized
       for disclosure.
       6.9.1.4. A badge or pass is issued that clearly identifies the bearer as a foreign
       representative. Such ID will be valid only for a specific facility during normal duty hours.
       Air Force contact officers will make specific arrangements for access during non-duty
       hours on a case-by-case basis with the FDO and all offices having a functional interest in
       the extended duty hours.
       6.9.1.5. The badge or pass will be displayed on the outer clothing so that it is clearly
       visible.
6.10. Air Force Contact Officer Responsibilities. Air Force officials designated as contact
officers for extended visits will:
   6.10.1. Maintain a file for each extended visit for which they are the contact officer. At a
   minimum, the file will include a copy of the extended visit authorization, verification of the
   basis for the visit, the security plan, certification form signed by the foreign national, and any
   coordination or approval records for visits to other locations;
   6.10.2. Ensure the visitor understands his or her duties, the terms and conditions of physical
   access to the organization, and obligations, rights and responsibilities;
   6.10.3. Ensure the visitor signs the certification form (See sample certifications at
   Attachment 9);
   6.10.4. Ensure the visitor is provided access only to that CMI and CUMI that has been
   authorized by the FDO in order to perform assigned duties;
   6.10.5. Ensure the visitor’s coworkers are informed of the limitations on visitors’ access to
   information; and
   6.10.6. Advise the servicing FDO of any changes regarding the position or visitor.
6.11. Termination of Visit Approvals. FDOs will monitor visit approvals and will terminate
all approvals at the conclusion of the visit period or when the visit purpose is concluded. FDOs
will ensure all offices having a functional interest in the visit are notified of the termination.

                                            Chapter 7

                                 TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

7.1. Introduction. Controls are necessary to ensure exports are consistent with US national
security interests. By law, export controls are placed on defense articles and services or
commercially available items that have a military utility. The Department of State controls
exports of defense articles, services, technical data, etc. under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR). The Department of Commerce controls exports of dual use commodities
with military utility under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). SAF/IAPD is the Air
Force office of primary responsibility for developing the Air Force position on commercial
exports of defense articles and services, dual use technology, and technical data.
7.2. ITAR Licensing Requirements. By law, the U.S. Government and contractors must
comply with the provisions of the ITAR before exporting defense articles, technical data or
defense services controlled by the ITAR.
   7.2.1. Exports by Air Force Organizations. Air Force organizations are not authorized to
   export CMI or CUMI without an export license. Exceptions are described in paragraph
   7.4.1 below.
   7.2.2. Exports by US Industry. A license or other approval issued by the Department of State
   (DoS) is required in order for US industry to export defense articles, services, or technical
   data. DoS issues licenses or other approvals to registered persons who apply for authority to
   export defense articles or furnish defense services. DoS may approve the application based
   on its own evaluation, or may request recommendations from the Defense Technology
   Security Administration (DTSA). If necessary, DTSA may request Service or DoD Agency
   recommendations regarding proposed exports of defense articles, services, and technical
   data. SAF/IAPD is the Air Force organization responsible for making such recommendations
   to DTSA.
   7.2.2. (AFMC) US contractors invited to attend and participate in international worldwide
   reviews must satisfy the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) by having an
   export license prior to making a presentation at the meeting.
       7.2.2.1. SAF/IAPD evaluates political and military, operational, technical and security
       factors for proposed industry exports on a case-by-case basis.
       7.2.2.2. SAF/IAPD coordinates industry export requests with subject matter experts as
       needed.
   7.2.3. Exports by US Industry in Support of Air Force Organizations. Consistent with the
   ITAR, SAF/IAPD may certify use of license exemptions to approve contractor support for
   government-to-government programs when the contractor does not have an approved export
   license. SAF/IAPD will consider and may certify exemptions to licensing requirements for
   contractors on a case-by-case basis only, subject to paragraph 7.4.2 below.
7.3. Air Force Requests for Export Licenses. Air Force disclosures and technology transfers
are approved by designated FDOs pursuant to the conditions in paragraph 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2
below. Therefore, licenses issued by DoS are usually not required. However, circumstances may
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                               39


exist when Air Force organizations will require a license. The following provides guidance to
determine when Air Force must obtain an export license from DoS.
   7.3.1. Licenses are required to employ foreign nationals either as civil servants or under
   contract. Air Force organizations must obtain DoS approval through SAF/IAPD prior to
   employing foreign nationals in positions requiring access to CUMI. Personnel in the rank of
   Colonel or higher (military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian) must sign the request. The written
   request identifies the following:
       7.3.1.1. The foreign national’s name, citizenship and identification number,
       7.3.1.2. Justification why the foreign national employment is essential to the national
       security of the United States,
       7.3.1.3. Skills, knowledge or abilities the foreign national possesses that are otherwise
       not available from US domestic sources,
       7.3.1.4. Proposed disclosure guidance to support the foreign national’s access to CUMI.
   7.3.2. This requirement will not apply to foreign nationals who only require access to CUMI
   and have been granted permanent legal resident status in the United States.
   7.3.3. SAF/IAPD will not favorably consider submitting a license application to support
   foreign national access to CMI.
7.4. Exemptions to Licensing Requirements. License exemptions are designed to ease the
regulatory burden on government and industry without compromising essential trade controls.
   7.4.1. Air Force organizations are not required to obtain an export license issued by the
   Department of State when exporting defense articles including technical data or to perform
   defense services in the following cases.
       7.4.1.1. Exports pursuant to a grant, sale, lease, loan or cooperative project under the
       Arms Export Control Act, or a sale, lease or loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of
       1961, as amended. Formal approval of foreign military sales programs or international
       cooperation agreements provides the basis for Air Force exports of CMI or CUMI to
       foreign governments or international organizations.
       7.4.1.2. Exports of CMI or CUMI to foreign representatives assigned to Air Force
       organizations under PEP, ESEP, APEP, or CPP agreements or as a FLO under an FMS
       case.
       7.4.1.3. Combined military operations and training.
       7.4.1.4. Unilateral US military operations abroad.
   7.4.2. SAF/IAPD may certify the use of exemptions, consistent with DoD Guidelines for
   Certifying Exemptions, for defense contractors on a case-by-case basis in the following
   cases:
       7.4.2.1. The services of private US persons or companies are required pursuant to
       activities enumerated in paragraphs 7.4.1.1 through 7.4.1.4.
40                                                    AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


     7.4.2.2. Air Force requires the participation of private US persons or companies in initial
     planning discussions/negotiations with foreign governments and international
     organizations pursuant to the activities enumerated in paragraph 7.4.1.1 through 7.4.1.4.
     7.4.2.3. It is in the Air Force’s interest to authorize private US persons or companies to
     solicit subcontract proposals from foreign firms for the purpose of developing responses
     to Service acquisition authority requests for quote or bid proposals.
     7.4.2.4. Exports of classified and unclassified technical data in conjunction with
     classified and unclassified plant visits.
  7.4.3. In order to request an exemption certification for a US private person or company, the
  sponsoring Air Force office forwards an official written request through disclosure channels
  to SAF/IAPD. The request must be signed by a senior management official, at least a Colonel
  or higher (military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian). The written request identifies the
  following:
     7.4.3.1. Name of the US person or company for which the exemption certification is
     requested;
     7.4.3.2. Reason for requesting the exemption certification (e.g., cite LOA number, MOU
     title or contract number if applicable), benefit to the United States, urgency of request
     (critical program milestones or decision process) in lieu of normal ITAR processes, and
     status or relationship of US person or company export license or agreement;
     7.4.3.3. An explanation of the details regarding the defense articles, services or technical
     data to be provided by the company in support of the activities listed in paragraph 7.4.2;
     7.4.3.4. A copy of all briefings, documents or information to be disclosed by the
     individual or company. If it is impractical to attach the actual information, a detailed
     description of the subject matter (including NDP category and highest classification of
     the information) may be forwarded. Alternatively, a statement by the servicing FDO
     certifying the material proposed for release is authorized for disclosure under an existing
     DDL will suffice.
     7.4.3.5. (Added-AFMC) When submitting an exemption request through
     AFLCMC/WFNJ, field FDO units must attach a completed copy of SAF/IAPD’s “USAF
     ITAR EXEMPTION CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST” (Attachment 18). This checklist
     will help ensure all pertinent questions are addressed for granting an exemption. The
     checklist is in addition to the letter request addressed in paragraph 7.4.3. of AFI 16-201.
  7.4.4. Exemption certification requests will be approved in writing by SAF/IAPD and
  include the following elements:
     7.4.4.1. ITAR exemption number,
     7.4.4.2. Name of the private US individual or company for which the exemption
     certification is granted,
     7.4.4.3. The reason or purpose for granting the exemption certification (cite LOA
     number, MOU title, or contract number if applicable), benefit to the United States, status
     of US individual or company’s export license or agreement application,
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                               41


      7.4.4.4. Description of the specific defense article, service, or technical data exempted
      from license requirement;
      7.4.4.5. Conditions and limitations necessary to establish a clearly defined scope for
      defense articles, services and technical data authorized for export; and
      7.4.4.6. An expiration date (no more than 1 year from date of issue).
   7.4.5. Upon receipt of the approved exemption, the servicing FDO will:
      7.4.5.1. Record the decision to sponsor the visit in SPAN when a foreign visit is involved
      and identify the SAF/IAPD approved exemption as authority to sponsor the visit;
      7.4.5.2. Review all briefings, documents and other information proposed for release by
      contractors, if the actual briefings, documents, etc have not been provided to SAF/IAPD;
      and
      7.4.5.3. Ensure an Air Force representative familiar with the program (military or
      civilian employee) is present at all activities to ensure contractor compliance with the
      terms and conditions of the exemption.
7.5. Nonsponsored and Sponsored Foreign Visits to US Defense Industry.
   7.5.1. FDOs will generally not sponsor foreign requests to visit US defense facilities. When
   visits are not sponsored, contractors may only disclose CMI or CUMI provided that such
   information is authorized for release pursuant to the Department of State’s ITAR or the
   Department of Commerce’s EAR.
   7.5.2. FDOs will only sponsor foreign visit requests to US defense facilities after obtaining
   SAF/IAPD approval for the required license exemption certification in accordance with
   paragraph 7.4.3.
 42                                                     AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


                                            Chapter 8

      AIR FORCE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES WITH FOREIGN INDUSTRY

8.1. Introduction. US acquisition reform established a hierarchy of potential alternatives that
must be evaluated before commitment to a new start acquisition program. The first alternative is
to assess the use or modification of an existing commercial system, or an already developed US
military or allied nation system that would alleviate the necessity for a weapons development
program. Since US defense procurements may include foreign sources, it is important that
foreign disclosure and technology transfer requirements are addressed prior to contract award.
8.2. Reviewing Planned US Procurements.
   8.2.1. Air Force contracting authorities announce planned Air Force procurements in the
   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO). Contracting authorities will coordinate invitations to
   bid, requests for proposals, presolicitation, prebidders, preproposal and preaward meetings
   etc., with their servicing FDO prior to announcing procurement activities so that restrictions
   can be identified to foreign bidders.
   8.2.1. (AFMC) AFMC Form 191, Foreign Disclosure Procurement Decision Worksheet:
   Air Force activities must obtain advance authorization from a designated disclosure authority
   before releasing any classified or unclassified export controlled information, documents or
   materials to a foreign government, foreign national, international organization or any
   representative thereof. An AFMC Form 191 (electronic) will be used for review of proposed
   procurement activities. Guidance on the use of this form is provided in Attachment 19. This
   guidance is not applicable to the Overseas Workload Program (OWLP) governed by AFMCI
   21-201, The Overseas Workload Program. Refer questions regarding the OWLP to HQ
   AFMC/A4.
       8.2.1.1. FDOs identify necessary restrictions on future participation before the
       procurement is announced in the FBO.
       8.2.1.2. When it is not possible to review all procurements prior to FBO announcement,
       disclosure and contracting officers must ensure announcements include notification that
       restrictions regarding foreign bidders may be placed on the contract. Also, foreign
       bidders will be instructed to indicate interest in the procurement to the contracting officer
       prior to submitting a proposal. Once foreign interest is identified, FDOs must review the
       procurement announcement in a timely manner, so that foreign bidders can submit
       proposals to meet contracting office submission deadlines.
       8.2.1.2. (AFMC) 1 (Added) FDOs will request contracting officers or their buyers to
       forward AF Form 191 to the Foreign Disclosure Office for evaluation when contracts
       involve a potential award to foreign companies or potential employment of a foreign
       national on a new or existing contract. The Form 191 should be completed by the
       government person with technical cognizance of the work to be performed under the
       contract.
       8.2.1.3. Prime contractors are responsible for obtaining authorization to disclose CMI
       and CUMI to foreign sub-contractors pursuant to the Department of State’s ITAR or
       Department of Commerce’s EAR.
AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013                                                               43


       8.2.1.3. (AFMC) 1 (Added) The FDO will recommend to procurement officials that
       appropriate clauses be inserted in the contract to alert contractors of their reporting
       requirements when export controlled information will/may be disclosed to foreign
       nationals, whether in the U.S. or abroad. The award of a government contract does not
       negate the contractor’s responsibility to comply with export control requirements under
       the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration
       Regulations (Department of Commerce).
   8.2.2. The Defense Security Service reviews foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI)
   of US companies that access or store US classified military information under the authority
   of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). This review evaluates a number of risk
   factors in order to determine an appropriate course of action to negate or mitigate FOCI.
   Unless FOCI can be negated or national security risks mitigated, a company may have its
   ability to access or store classified information suspended or cancelled.
       8.2.2.1. There are no contract restrictions from a disclosure perspective on the types of
       contracts that may be awarded to a company who has negated its FOCI using a Voting
       Trust Agreement or Proxy Agreement, or mitigated its FOCI risk through a Board
       Resolution or Security Control Agreement.
       8.2.2.2. Companies who mitigate FOCI using a Special Security Agreement may be
       awarded most types of classified contracts. However, contracts requiring access to
       proscribed information (i.e., Sensitive Compartmented Information, COMSEC,
       Restricted Data, Special Access Programs, Top Secret) are not granted unless there is an
       overriding national interest to support the contract award and the associated risks are
       minimal.
           8.2.2.2.1. Companies who mitigate FOCI using a Limited Facility Clearance will be
           restricted to work on a specific contract or program that originates with or involves
           the government of the country from which the FOCI is derived.
       8.2.2.3. FDOs contact the DSS field representative assigned to a specific company to
       verify whether FOCI exists.
8.3. Appeals Regarding Decisions to Exclude Foreign Contractors. The Administrative
Assistant to the Secretary (SAF/AA) is the deciding authority for appeals to decisions excluding
foreign bidders from procurement activities. FDOs forward foreign requests to appeal denials
through channels to SAF/IAPD.

Visit Authorization—A request approved by an FDO that permits a visit by an authorized
representative. FDOs authorize visits after an evaluation of a request from a foreign government
or international organization that identifies the visitor as its official representative, verifies
personal information, verifies the visitors security clearance, and provides security assurances
that CMI and CUMI provided to the visitor will be protected. There are three types of
authorizations:
One Time—Permits contact by foreign nationals with a United States Air Force organization or
contractor facility for a single, short-term occasion (normally less than 30 days) for a specified
purpose.
Recurring—Permits intermittent visits by a foreign national to a United States Air Force
organization or contractor facility over a specified period of time in accordance with a
government-approved license, contract or agreement, or other program. Recurring visits are
approved when the information to be disclosed has been defined and approved for disclosure in
advance by the US Government.
Extended—Permits a single visit by a foreign national for an extended period of time. Extended
visit authorizations are used when a foreign national is required to be in continuous contact with
a United States Air Force organization or a contractor facility. Extended visits are used to assign
foreign personnel as FLOs, CPPs, and ESEPs.

Country Delegation # (Provided by SAF/IAPD)                          DDL Title
1. (U) Classification: Highest classification level of information to be released during the
program. If more than one category is involved, indicate the highest classification for each
category, if appropriate. NOTE: If multiple nations are involved or for exchange officer DDLs,
the first paragraph will identify participating nations, with this paragraph and subsequent
paragraphs renumbered accordingly.
2. (U) Disclosure Methods: Either "Oral, visual, and documentary" or any combination of the
three methods.
3. (U) Category(ies) Permitted: Specify disclosure category or categories (1 through 8), as
specified in AIR FORCEI-16-201.
4. (U) Scope: Describe the purpose of the disclosure, to which country(ies) disclosure is
authorized, which MAJCOM(s) is/are authorized to disclose the information or materiel, and
the source of the program (i.e., Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU), NDPC Record of Action (RA), etc). The purpose of the disclosure must
define the intent of the program (i.e., end-item sale, cooperative development, co-production,
etc
5. (U) Authorized to Disclose: Describe the information or materiel that can be disclosed to
support the program. This section and the "Not Authorized to Disclose" paragraph cannot
address every possible situation, particularly for major programs. Therefore, it is particularly
important that the previous paragraphs clearly and adequately define the delegated authority so
the FDO can interpret the DDL in situations specifically addressed in this and the following
paragraphs.
6. (U) Not Authorized to Disclose: Describe information or materiel that cannot be disclosed
under the program. This paragraph and the preceding paragraph should clearly define the limits
of delegated authority rather than listing everything that may or may not be disclosed.
7. (U) Additional Guidance/Procedures: Identifies program-unique requirements and additional
offices which need to coordinate, etc. Also, identifies where requests that fall outside the scope
and authority of the DDL should be submitted.
8. (U) Redelegation: "Not authorized" or "(MAJCOM) may redelegate authority to disclose
information to FDOs in subordinate elements as required to insure effective implementation of
this delegation. Authority to disclose classified information may be redelegated only by
designated disclosure officials who have been trained by SAIR FORCE/IAPD. Redelegation of
disclosure authority to other than designated disclosure officials must be approved by
SAF/IAPD. All redelegations will be in writing and copies provided to SAF/IAPD."

   UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FOREIGN DISCLOSURE AND TECHNOLOGY
                  TRANSFER OVERSIGHT PROGRAM


 Program Purpose Statement
 1. PURPOSE: The purpose of the staff assistance oversight program is to evaluate how
 United States Air Force major commands (MAJCOMs) are implementing and managing their
 foreign disclosure and technology transfer programs.
 2. AUTHORITY: The National Disclosure Policy directs that department and agency heads
 shall designate a principal disclosure authority responsible for the direction and
 administration of the department or agency foreign disclosure program. Heads of all
 departments and agencies which have need to disclose classified military information shall
 establish procedures and channels to assure that disclosures are considered, authorized and
 handled in accordance with the National Disclosure Policy. Further, it is in the national
 interest to expedite decisions on disclosure of classified military information. All
 departments and agencies which are responsible for implementation of this policy will issue
 detailed directives and instructions which assure that disclosure decisions are made promptly
 and disclosure activities under their jurisdiction are carried out effectively. SECAF Order
 114.1 designates SAF/IA as the principal disclosure authority for the Air Force. The Foreign
 Disclosure and Technology Transfer Division (SAF/IAPD) implements the Air Force Foreign
 Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program on behalf of SAF/IA.
 3. CRITERIA:
    a. SAF/IAPD evaluators will make assessments based on assistance visits to MAJCOM
    foreign disclosure offices (FDOs). SAF/IAPD evaluators may also choose to visit
    subordinate activities, with or without MAJCOM FDO representation. The purpose of
    visits to subordinate activities will be to verify various aspects of MAJCOM program
    implementation.
    b. The oversight program includes not only the staff assistance visit, but also planning
    activities to prepare the evaluator(s) for the visit. Specific activities are documented in the
    Evaluator Preparation Activities Section (Atch 1).
    c. Evaluators will assess performance based on a standard set of criteria which are
    documented in the Oversight Evaluation Criteria Section (Atch 2). The criteria represent
    program areas for which MAJCOMs may have responsibilities. Therefore, all criteria may
    not apply to all FDOs. How each MAJCOM chooses to implement these program areas
    may be different. Therefore, the evaluator should establish that the MAJCOM activities
    are adequate to meet the objective, and not whether we agree with the methods used.
    d. The criteria used in assessing the FDO’s performance follow
 e. A report of the evaluation visit should be completed within 10 working days of the
 completion of the visit.

Colonel or higher (military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian) is available during the
proposed visit dates for both an in-brief and out-brief.
2. In order to prepare for the visit as much as possible in advance, it will be
necessary to analyze data about the disclosure activity to be visited prior to the
arrival of the staff assistance team. Data necessary for visit preparation will come
from both IAPDX and the office to be visited. In the visit announcement message,
task the FDO to provide the following information. IAPD should receive the
information at least 10 working days prior to the projected visit start date.
 a. The FDO provides:
     A copy of the FDO designation letter
     An organizational diagram of the command structure that they support
   A list of the disclosure officers assigned to the office, whether these officers
have full-time or part-time disclosure responsibilities and a brief description of
each individual’s disclosure responsibilities
  A list of all subordinate disclosure offices within the command to include the
FDO’s names and functional address symbols
   A list of current DDLs--the DDL designation and date of document is
sufficient--that the office has on file
     A list of extended foreign visitors serviced by the office
   The number of unclassified, confidential, secret and top secret information
releases made in the past six months
   A description of any formal disclosure education briefings, presentations or
other education initiatives that have been completed in the past year

 SAF/IAPD training?
 Oversight Evaluation Criteria
 FOREIGN DISCLOSURE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROGRAM
 MANAGEMENT (Continued) This element evaluates how the MAJCOM FDO is organized
 to implement its program management responsibilities within the command. The command
 FDO should be knowledgeable about the command’s effectiveness and efficiency in
 implementing the program. The following are indicators of the command FDO’s management
 emphasis:

 counterintelligence organizations?
   -What is the purpose of these relationships?
   -How does the FDO rate the success of these relationships?
 10. Does the FDO document its release decisions in SPAN?
 Oversight Evaluation Criteria
 DELEGATED DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY This element evaluates how FDOs at any
 command level implement their delegated disclosure authority. The FDO should be able to
 perform two major functions regarding delegated authority: 1) approve releases for which
 authority has been delegated and 2) prepare sufficient justification to the appropriate
 command level when delegated authority has been exceeded. The following are indicators
 whether the FDO understands how to exercise its authority:
 1. Does the command have the current versions of delegations that IAPD has transmitted to
 them?
   -Is the file consistent with IAPD records
 2. Does the command have a process for evaluating requests for release of CMI or CUMI?
    -Are decisions to release/deny or return incomplete requests, coordinate an extension or
 refer requests to another authority made within 10 working days of receiving the request?
 3. Does the FDO have records for the past six months regarding information requests
 processed?
   -How many unclassified, confidential, secret and top secret cases were processed?
   -Does a random sampling show the FDO’s decisions were consistent with its delegated
66                                                       AFI16-201_AFMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2013


     authority?
   -Can any trends be established by a random review of denials? For example, do denials
indicate action should be taken to update delegated authority?
4. Can the FDO explain the command process for working disclosure cases when the
command delegated authority has been exceeded?
     -Can the FDO explain the difference between one-time and continuing authority?
  -Do requests to SAIR FORCE/IAPD contain all the necessary information IAW AIR
FORCEI 16-201 for action to be taken?
     -How are requests for release of non-UNITED STATES AIR FORCE information handled?
5. Does the FDO know the requirements which must be met before release of approved
information can occur?
Oversight Evaluation Criteria
DELEGATED DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY (Continued) This element evaluates how
FDOs at any command level implement their delegated disclosure authority. The FDO should
be able to perform two major functions regarding delegated authority: 1) approve releases for
which authority has been delegated and 2) prepare sufficient justification to the appropriate
command level when delegated authority has been exceeded. The following are indicators
whether the FDO understands how to exercise its authority:
6. Does the FDO provide disclosure guidance to USAF personnel traveling overseas or to
conferences where foreign nationals will be in attendance?
     -How is this accomplished?
7. Has the FDO experienced problems with either higher headquarters or subordinate activities
in responding to release requests?
     -If so, what specific problems need to be addressed?
8. Is the FDO promptly notified IAW DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 when any foreign nation is
suspected of compromising Air Force classified information?
  -Can the FDO explain what actions are taken by his/her office subsequent to any
notifications of suspected compromise.
Oversight Evaluation Criteria
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER This element evaluates how FDO’s at any command level
implement their responsibilities in support of commercial international programs or
commercial aspects of foreign military sales programs. The FDO should be able to advise and
assist supported personnel determine when USAF sponsorship of commercial activities is
appropriate and apply disclosure policies to acquisition related activities. The following are
indicators whether FDO activities understand and comply with International Traffic in Arms
Regulations:
1. Has the FDO sponsored or recommended sponsorship for any visits to contractor facilities?
     -If so, what were the conditions of the approval?

 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING POSITION DESCRIPTIONS FOR EXTENDED
                        VISIT POSITIONS

(PLACEMENT OF ENGINEER AND SCIENTIST EXCHANGE OFFICERS,
FOREIGN LIAISON OFFICERS AND COOPERATIVE PROGRAM PERSONNEL
WITHIN AIR FORCE ORGANIZATIONS*)
(Heading identifying the exchange officer, cooperative program name or foreign military sale
program associated with the foreign representative)
*Position descriptions supporting Defense Personnel Exchange Program positions should be
developed IAW AIR FORCEI 16-107
1. POSITION LOCATION: Identify the organizational address of the organization where the
foreign representative will perform his/her duties.
2. POSITION TITLE: Identify the title that describes the position that the foreign
representative will perform duties as.
3. DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES, SKILLS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: This section
identifies the types of activities that the individual will be expected to perform as well as how
that activity will be used. This development process may require several revisions to ensure the
duties are sufficiently described. This description is important for three reasons. First, it will be
used as the foundation upon which the delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) will be
built or to verify that an existing DDL will support the position. Second, it ensures that both
USAF and the foreign government agree to the duties to be performed by the foreign
representative. Third, it helps the contact officer educate other USAF personnel working with
the foreign representative understand the specific assigned duties of the foreign representative.
4. The following examples are provided to demonstrate the type of detail that the creator of the
position description needs to provide in order to help facilitate the establishment of a long-term
visitor position within the organization. They are grouped into UNSATISFACTORY and
SATISFACTORY examples of descriptions of duties:
       a.      UNSATISFACTORY Records and reports test results.
               SATISFACTORY Knowledge of the terminology used with a variety of
               diagnostic and treatment procedures provided general medical patients to record
               and report medical information such as x-ray and test results.
       b.      UNSATISFACTORY Knowledge of engineering concepts to perform military
               research
               SATISFACTORYKnowledge of materials science to research, develop and apply
               static and dynamic material properties measurement tests to energetic materials
               and simulants.
       c.      UNSATISFACTORY Individual will use standard laboratory techniques.
               SATISFACTORY Individual will adapt and apply standard laboratory techniques
               for the assessment of material properties. Test techniques to be used will include

               Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar Tests, Tensile Tests, and Fracture Toughness Tests
               for both high explosives and simulants.
       d.      UNSATISFACTORY Individual will review and evaluate engineering designs.
               SATISFACTORY Individual will review engineering drawings for the proposed
               demonstrator using knowledge of mechanical engineering principles and
               evaluate the proposed design against XYZ program requirements.
       e.      UNSATISFACTORY -Specific duties will include, but not be limited to, the
               collection of samples, chemical analysis, data reduction and groundwater
               treatment process evaluation. (The phrase but not limited to indicates there are
               other duties, if so they should be identified.)
       f.      SATISFACTORY Develop concept of operations and packaging concept for
               Tactical and Special Mission ground stations. Includes deployability
               requirements, physical and functional layouts, data link requirements and
               procedure development issues.
4. QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR POSITION: Qualifications are training,
education or other accomplishments that prepare an individual to carry out specific work or
responsibilities. For example, the ability to use good English oral and written skills and certain
types of computer software. Unique qualifications may also be desired by the organization. If
so, identify the type of qualification and whether a specific amount of time performing the
activity is required to be considered qualified. For example, 3 years performing duties as a
research engineer.
5. US CONTACT OFFICER: This is the name, organizational address and telephone number
of the USAF official designated in writing to oversee and control all contacts, requests for
information, consultations, access, and other activities of the foreign national who will be
assigned to or placed in the USAF organization. Previously, this US person was referred to as
the "supervisor" for all extended visitors including those assigned under formal exchange
programs. The term "contact officer" is now being used to be consistent with DoD terminology.
In all cases of Defense Personnel Exchange Positions, the US host supervisor may be the
contact officer (within Air Force this has traditionally been the rule).
6. SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL REQUIRED: Unclassified, Confidential, Secret or
Top Secret (identify one). Information will not be released to the participant based on the
required security clearance. Only designated disclosure officers using the appropriate
DDL are authorized to approve releases of classified or controlled unclassified military
information to the participant. This is the level of security clearance required for access to
US classified military information necessary to perform assigned duties and responsibilities.
The decision regarding what US classified military information will be available to the foreign
representative will be documented in the delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL). Once
the position has been established, the foreign government will be required to provide a security
assurance to USAF that it has granted its representative a security clearance commensurate
with the access required. By submitting the extended visit request, the foreign government
provides the security assurance and identifies the level of clearance it has granted its
participant. The bold statement above is a required statement in the position description.

                          SECURITY PLAN SAMPLE FORMAT

Access Controls for Extended Foreign National Visitors to USAF Military Organizations
(The purpose of this sample format is to assist US contact officers in documenting physical
controls necessary to ensure that extended visitors access to information and sensitive work
areas is consistent with the disclosure guidance supporting the visitor’s placement. All US
individuals coming into contact with the foreign national must be made aware of the contents
of this plan as well as the disclosure guidance pertaining to the extended visitor’s placement.
The security plan must be approved by the extended visitor’s US Contact Officer, the Foreign
Disclosure Officer and the local Information Security Program Manager.)
1. EXTENDED VISITOR: Identify the individual’s name, rank and country.
2. ASSIGNED DUTY AREA: Identify the physical location of the individual’s work area to
include physical address, building and room number. Identify the extended visitor’s normal
work hours. Also, identify any other local organizations that the extended visitor will be
required to visit during their placement.
3. US Contact Officer: Identify the name, organizational address and telephone number of the
USAF official designated in writing to oversee and control all contacts, requests for
information, consultations, access and other activities of the extended visitor.
4. ACCESS CONTROLS: A general requirement is that all extended visitors identify
themselves as members of their parent service in all communications. This requirement ensures
that US personnel communicating with the extended visitor are aware that he is an international
officer. Identify that the extended visitor will be informed to identify himself as a member of his
parent service in all written, electronic and telephonic communications. The following items
must be addressed separately. It may be necessary to identify other controls depending upon the
activities taking place at the organization. To identify if other controls are necessary, review
activities of US personnel who have similar responsibilities.
       a. Computer Access: The supporting foreign disclosure office and systems accreditation
       authorities must be included in the approval process. Document the approved computer
       access with any conditions that apply.
       b. Other Equipment Use: Identify the equipment and the location that the extended is
       authorized to use. Are there any requirements which must be met before the equipment
       can be used (i.e., use logs, etc.), if so identify them.
       c. Physical Access: Identify whether the extended individual will have escorted or
       unescorted access to the work area or any other areas. For unescorted access, identify
       that the extended visitor has been issued a badge or pass that clearly identifies him as a
       foreign national, the badge is valid for specific facilities during normal duty hours and
       the organization has received a security assurance from the individual’s government
       verifying that he meets all clearance requirements for unescorted access to the facility
       (ies). Identify for what official purposes unescorted access is required on a frequent basis.
       Identify how the unescorted access will be prevented outside normal duty hours.

      d. Information Access: Identify the actions US personnel will be responsible for taking
      to ensure that classified and controlled unclassified military information in their work
      areas or common work areas will be controlled during the placement of the extended
      visitor. Also ensure that guidance for US personnel conducting classified discussions in
      the office is included.
      e. Organization Visitors: Identify how the organization will ensure that visitors are
      informed about the existence of the extended visitor and the disclosure and security
      requirements that are in place regarding the visitor.
      f. Extended Visitor Visits:
             (1) Identify how the organization will ensure that extended visitor contacts
             outside of the organization are informed of the disclosure and security
             requirements regarding the visitor.
             (2) Identify that the extended visitor will be required to submit a visit request
             through his/
             her Embassy channels for visits outside his/her location of assignment.
      g. Emergency Procedures: Identify the actions that will be taken should the extended
      visitor be found unescorted outside the areas approved for unescorted entry or have
      access to information not approved for release. This information should include the
      name, location and telephone numbers of any individuals who should be contacted.
      h. Points of Contact: Identify all points of contact appropriate for this placement. As a
      minimum, identify the foreign disclosure officer, unit security manager, the installation
      information security program manager, facility entry control points, others as
      appropriate for the organization.

AFMC FORM 191, FOREIGN DISCLOSURE PROCUREMENT DECISION
WORKSHEET

Figure A19.1. AFMC Form 191, Foreign Disclosure Procurement Decision Worksheet

1. Purpose of Form: The AFMC Form 191 (automated) is used to identify sensitivities and
restrictions associated with a planned procurement prior to announcement, and when Air Force
organizations are sponsoring or co-sponsoring a conference where CUI or Classified Information
is discussed/presented. The information gathered via the 191 is essential to the analysis of a
foreign disclosure review.

2. Using the Form: Use of this form is mandatory when reviewing proposed procurement
activities and Air Force sponsorship of non-public domain conferences. Use the form for all
foreign disclosure actions that involve AFMC procurement of goods or services from a Foreign
Owned, Controlled, or Influenced (FOCI) company; that involves an extended visit placement of
a foreign national under an engineer and scientist exchange program when a foreign national was
not previously placed in the organization for the same purpose; when AFMC organizations are
sponsoring or co-sponsoring a conference where CUI or Classified Information is presented (See
AFI 61-205); or at the discretion of the foreign disclosure office when a proposed release
involves other significant or complex disclosure actions that require a detailed analysis.
AFLCMC/WFNJ may require additional uses when necessary.

3. Completing the Form: The foreign disclosure office provides a blank AFMC Form 191 to
the program manager or project engineer. FDO instructs the program manager or engineer to
leave blank the Case Number block on the first page and the Foreign Disclosure Determination
blocks on the second page. FDO will complete those blocks when 191 is returned to them for
review. The individual completes the rest of the form and returns the form to the foreign
disclosure office who assigns a case number, fills in the Case Number block on first page and
completes the Foreign Disclosure Determination blocks.

4. Security Classification: Blank AFMC Form 191s are unclassified. Completed forms may
contain classified information which would require classifying the worksheet at the level of the
classified information. Foreign disclosure offices must be particularly careful when completing
Foreign Disclosure Determination blocks on second page.

5. Filing and Disposition: The foreign disclosure office will return the completed original form
to the requestor for the official contract files if for a procurement. Return to the conference
sponsor if form is for sponsoring a conference not at the public domain level. Return to the
originator when used for other complex release determinations. The FDO files a copy of the
completed form with the relevant foreign disclosure case.
