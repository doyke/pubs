1. Overview.
    1.1. An officer must meet the eligibility criteria for appointment in AFI 36-2005, Appointment in
    Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories -- Reserve of the
    Air Force and United States Air Force , or AFI 36-2610, Appointing Regular Air Force Officers and
    Obtaining Conditional Reserve Status.
    1.2. Transfers require that members be discharged or terminated from their current commissions and
    appointments without interrupting total service. Transferring service people receive credit for accrued
    total service before transfer.
    1.3. Refer to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, for transfer of Air Force officers on
    the active duty list to other Uniformed Services.

2. Authorized Grades.
    2.1. Except as stated in paragraphs 2.1.1., 2.2. and 2.3., an officer's current grade and date of rank
    (DOR) remain the same after transfer as on the day before transfer from the parent service.
       2.1.1. Officers who have spent time in the Inactive Reserve may have their DOR adjusted.
    2.2. Public Health Service officers and officers not on the RASL in the Inactive Reserve will have
    their date of rank adjusted.
    2.3. A commissioned officer with constructive service credit for education, training, or experience
    who transfers to a different (noncomparable) category loses those credits. The officer receives the
    grade, DOR, and service dates appropriate for the credit granted in the new category.

3. Applying for Transfer.
    3.1. Officers from Other Active Duty Uniformed Services Who Want To Join the Active Air Force.
    These officers must request transfers according to the rules and regulations of their parent services.
    Officers must get transfer requests approved by the Secretary of their parent uniformed service before
    sending requests to Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)/DPPAOO.
    3.2. Air Force Agencies Desiring Services of Officers of Other Uniformed Services. The agencies
    submit their request through the major commands (MAJCOM) to HQ AFPC/DPPAOO, which for-
    wards them to the Secretary of the parent uniformed services for approval or disapproval. The appli-
    cations must include statements signed by the officers consenting to the transfers.
    3.3. Line Guard and Reserve Officers From Other Uniformed Services Who Want to Join the Active
    Air Force. Before starting the process, these officers should contact HQ AFPC/DPPAOO at the
    address or phone number indicated in Attachment 1. HQ AFPC/DPPAOO will put them in contact
    with the appropriate assignment officer to determine that the transfer meets the needs of the Air Force.
    DPPAOO will initiate the conditional release. When an approved conditional release is received, the
    officer submits the application at the address in Attachment 1. When the process is complete and the
    officer is selected, HQ AFPC/DPPAOO will send the completed conditional release and the oath of
    office to the losing agency so they may discharge the member.
    3.4. Guard and Reserve Officers From Other Uniformed Services Who Want to Join the Air National
    Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve. Members interested in transferring to the ANG or USAFR should
    contact a recruiter in their local area for information and assistance. Members interested in the ANG

    instruction. The ITCOB considers a request only once during a 12-month period. HQ AFPC/DPPAOO
    returns disapproved requests to the applicant through the parent service.
    5.3. Approved Applications. When the President of the USAF ITCOB approves a request, the two
    services manage the transfer. HQ AFPC/DPPAOO:
       5.3.1. Obtains assignment instructions from the personnel assignments officer.
       5.3.2. Prepares active duty orders on Line of the Air Force (LAF) officers.

   positions they manage. Applications are processed through judge advocate channels to The Judge
   Advocate General (TJAG) for approval. When approved, TJAG forwards the application to HQ
   ARPC/DPABA for further processing IAW paragraph 6.3. of this directive.

                         (INITIAL APPROPRIATE BLOCK AND SIGN)

A2.1. For Regular Officers, Line Guard/Reserve Officers, and Guard/Reserve Judge Advocates
Applying for Active Duty Air Force.
   1. I am a Regular officer whose competitive category is:__Line __Chaplain __Judge Advocate
      __Medical Corps __Dental Corps __Nurse Corps __Biomedical Sciences Corps __Medical Ser-
      vice Corps or I am a Guard/Reserve officer whose competitive category is:__Line __Judge Advo-
      cate.
   2. I understand if my request for transfer is approved, I will be ordered into active military service
      with the Air Force and must serve an initial active duty service commitment (ADSC) of 4 years (3
      years for chaplains) before I will be eligible for separation or release from active duty.
   3. I understand the Secretary of the Air Force will assign my grade and date of rank at the time of my
      appointment.
   4. I understand I may be assigned to a government-sponsored training program or a permanent
      change of station (PCS) to meet Air Force needs. If I must undergo such training or PCS, I under-
      stand I must serve any additional ADSC that is appropriate for the training I received or my PCS
      assignment according to AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).

      tial ADSC unless I receive a Regular Air Force appointment or Conditional Reserve Status
      (CRS). I understand the SAF can release me from EAD before I complete my initial ADSC.
   4. I further understand if I receive and accept a Regular Air Force appointment or CRS, my previous
      release from EAD is nullified and a change in law, instruction, or policy can require my separa-
      tion even if I agree to serve in CRS.

     5. If, after accepting a Regular Air Force appointment, I want to resign my commission and separate
        from active duty, I must resign under appropriate directives.
     6. If I accept CRS and want release from EAD, I must apply under the appropriate directives. I
        understand such release depends on getting the approval of the SAF.
