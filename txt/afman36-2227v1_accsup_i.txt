                            RIFLE/CARBINE TRAINING PROGRAM

1.1. Rifle/Carbine AFQC/TRQC. The AFQC provides Air Force members with the minimum
training; tactics, techniques and procedures, and performance evaluations required for
qualification with M16 series rifles/carbines, (M16, M16A1, M16A2, M4, GAU, GUU-5P, etc).
The TRQC is an advanced/specialized course fired by Group A personnel during recurring
training. Security Forces will normally fire the TRQC unless they meet the requirements in
paragraph 1.2.4 below. However, Commanders with Group A members within their units may
temporarily authorize the AFQC in lieu of the TRQC to meet mission needs. MAJCOM/SF may
implement the preferred full distance firing for SF personnel provided the training meets or
exceeds the objectives of this AFMAN. MAJCOM/SF will forward a copy of the proposed full
distance course of fire to HQ AFSFC for approval prior to implementation.
1.1. (ACC)All ACC Airmen will qualify using the Air Force Security Forces Centers
(AFSFC) Rifle/Carbine training program, dated 1 Aug 11. Course material can be accessed
from the AFSFC Community of Practice (CoP) directly from a military (.mil) location with
Common            Access         Card         (CAC)          authentication           at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AF-ED-00-29.
1.2. Training Overview.
     1.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the rifle/carbine qualification-
     training program. Initial training consists of in-depth classroom instruction, qualification on
     the Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) and passing mechanical evaluations. Objective 5
     and Intermediate Training Objectives 5.1 - 5.7 in Table 1.1 are not required for AFQC
     qualification.
     1.2.2. Recurring Training. This is qualification training after initial qualification. It consists
     of classroom instruction (Group A personnel may be given performance evaluations prior to
     classroom instruction to determine appropriate level of classroom instruction required),
     passing performance evaluations and qualifying on the appropriate course of fire. Frequency
     of this training is outlined in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Programs.
         1.2.2.1. AFQC. Initial training on the AFQC is a prerequisite before proceeding to more
         advanced specialized training courses. Objective 5 and Intermediate Training Objectives
         5.1-5.7 in Table 1.1 are not required for AFQC qualification.
         1.2.2.2. TRQC. If the night fire portions of the TRQC cannot be fired due to range
         design or equipment limitations, MAJCOM functional managers may waive this
         requirement until the range has been updated and necessary equipment received to allow
         the course of fire to be conducted. If the complete course of fire is required, both the day
         and night fire portions should be fired as a complete course during the same training
         session. Designated Marksman (DM) personnel will fire the entire course of fire using the
         Day Optical Scope. Intermediate Training Objective 3.3 in Table 1.1 is not required for
         TRQC qualification.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                            9


   1.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. This training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   1.2.4. Combat Rifle Course (CRC). If logistical support is available to support this type
   training, MAJCOMs should develop combat rifle training programs and identify personnel
   who would most benefit from this course. This course is best administered at MAJCOM
   approved regional training centers and would fulfill the qualification requirement for the
   course of fire (AFQC or TRQC) currently in cycle. All courses of fire must be implemented
   IAW AFI 36-2226, paragraph 2.16.4.
   1.2.4. (ACC) ACC has developed a specialized rifle course of fire for Military Working
   Dog (MWD) teams supporting garrison and predeployment mission requirements, see
   Attachment # 2. This course of fire was approved by the AFSFC on 4 January 2011.
   1.2.5. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units
   to help maintain the individual's proficiency. Units should conduct this training before
   exercises and deployments.
   1.2.6. (Added-ACC) Full-distance live fire training is the preferred method of qualification
   of Designated Marksmen (DM) armed with an M4. However, at locations where full distance
   ranges are not locally available it is permissible to train and qualify DM using 25 meter
   ranges.
       1.2.6.1. (Added-ACC) DM will live-fire qualify annually using the AFQC and between
       the fifth to seventh month after annual qualification as part of their
       proficiency/sustainment training.
   1.2.7. (Added-ACC) DM qualifications will be awarded to personnel who fulfill all of the
   following criteria: (1) qualify annually/semiannually to the expert level on the Air Force
   Qualification Course (AFQC) with an M4 carbine equipped with the Advanced Combat
   Optical Gun sight, and (2) be appointed by the SF unit commander as a DM. DM
   qualifications will be recorded on AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data,
   or Security Forces Management Information System generate form.
1.3. Instructor Guidelines.
   1.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will supervise, assist and evaluate trainees during all ―hands
   on‖ weapons training. All trainees must meet the applicable objectives contained in Table
   1.1. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios and exceptions. Instructors will
   ―connect‖ the various skills taught during training to ―real life‖ scenarios. This ensures
   students understand the tactics, techniques and procedures used to effectively utilize their
   weapons.
   1.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, coach and teach trainees, as needed, during
   grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire. See AFI 36-2226 for
   student to instructor ratios.
   1.3.3. Tower Operator. The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and
   effective range operations during range training sessions. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
1.4. Rifle/Carbine Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is
intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and
 10                                        AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth instruction, concentrating on known problems.
Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives.
Approximate training times for this program are:
   1.4.1. 7 to 9 hours for AFQC and TRQC and as needed for remedial and CRC.
1.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and
maintain the ability to use the rifle effectively against enemy targets.
1.6. Training Objectives (AFQC). The training objectives needed for successful completion of
this course are found in Table 1.1. Objective 5 and Intermediate Training Objectives 5.1 - 5.7 in
Table 1.1 are not required for AFQC qualification.
   1.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. The trainees must be familiar with:
       1.6.1.1. Safety procedures.
       1.6.1.2. Characteristics, nomenclature and general data.
       1.6.1.3. Types, care, handling and preserving ammunition.

1.13. Course Information, Rifle/Carbine AFQC.
   1.13.1. Course Targets:
       1.13.1.1. Target ―Z‖ is the 25-meter zero target National Stock Number (NSN) 6920-01-
       167-1392 for the M16, GAU-5A, GAU-5A/A and NSN 6920-01-253-4005 for the
       M16A2, GUU-5P and M4 or full distance silhouette NSN 6920-00-795-1806 (or suitable
       substitute).
       1.13.1.2. Target SF is the 25-meter scaled silhouette, slow fire target (NSN 6920-01-167-
       1391) or full distance silhouette NSN 6920-00-795-1806 (or suitable substitute).
       1.13.1.3. Target TF is the 25-meter scaled silhouette, timed fire target (NSN 6920-01-
       167-1397) or full distance silhouette NSN 6920-00-795-1806 (or suitable substitute).
   1.13.2. Standards:
       1.13.2.1. Phase I: Should fire one 4cm shot group.
       1.13.2.2. Phase II: Seventy five-meter targets should have 7 hits. 175-meter targets
       should have 5 hits. 300-meter targets should have 3 hits.
       1.13.2.3. Phase III: Group A Qualified: 32-42 hits. Group B Qualified: 25-42 hits. Group
       C Qualified: 19-42 hits.
       1.13.2.4. Expert: All Groups: 43-50 hits.
NOTE:
If gas mask training is temporarily waived by the MAJCOM Functional, practice and evaluation
orders 2 with gas mask will not be fired. Qualification standards will be 25 of 40 hits for Group
A personnel, 20 of 40 hits for Group B personnel, and 15 of 40 hits for Group C personnel.
Expert for all Groups will be 35 of 40 hits. Ensure the AF Form 522 and AF Form 710 reflects
an 80-round AFQC. Also, add the statement ―Gas mask firing not conducted‖ in the remarks
block of each form.
NOTE:
The standards for Phase I and II are desired goals for all trainees. Instructors should use these
standards to determine trainees’ need for additional instruction or practice before firing Phase III.
To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during Phases I and II. The
standards for Phase III are required standards for qualification.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                           23


  1.13.3. Course Notes AFQC.
     1.13.3.1. If firing the standard M16 rifle, GAU-5A or GAU-5A/A, the trainee will use
     the long range "L" aperture on the rear sight for all 25-meter firing. Once the shot group
     is centered at 25-meters using the long range ("L" aperture), the rifle/carbine is battle
     sight zeroed for 250-meters when the unmarked, short-range sight position is used and
     will also be on at 375-meters when the long-range aperture is used. After firing the
     course, rotate the rear sight to the short-range position. If full distance firing is used (50
     to 300-meters), fire with the rear sight set in the short-range position after 25-meter
     zeroing.
     1.13.3.2. Trainees firing the M16A2 rifle or M4 series carbines will be taught battlesight
     zeroing IAW the AF lesson plan. When firing with the M68 Close Combat Optic (CCO)
     and the Back-up Iron Sight (BUIS), students will zero the BUIS first and than move the
     red dot of the M68 so it sits on top of the front sight. Change magazine loads from 5 to 4-
     round magazines. Fire the first three strings using the BUIS, after adjusting the M68, use
     the next two-strings to confirm zero. When firing the AFQC with the M68, trainees will
     fire using the M68 on practice and evaluation orders 1, 3 and 5. When using the M68,
     students should lower the intensity level of the dot to the lowest intensity visible to the
     shooter. This reduces the size of the dot so parts of the target are still visible.
     1.13.3.3. The purpose of using the 25-meter zeroing (Z) target is two fold. First, the
     shooter has a realistic combat distance target (250-meters for M16 and 300-meters for
     M16A2) with a sight adjustment grid printed over the silhouette to aid in accurately
     making sight adjustments. Secondly, it is an excellent training aid for conducting 3-shot
     grouping exercises. The target also provides a good indication of the shooter's ability to
     hit a life-size target at expected engagement distances from a steady firing position.
     However, if ranges are available, full distance firing is highly encouraged.
     1.13.3.4. Ideally, trainees should be able to put all shots of the shot group within the 4cm
     circle on the ―Z‖ target using a prone supported position. However, a 4cm group
     anywhere on the target indicates good application of shooting fundamentals and only
     requires sight adjustments to center the shot group and zero the rifle/carbine.
     1.13.3.5. Trainees may make sight corrections as needed anytime during training.
     Instructors will accompany trainees down range and analyze each of the trainee's shot
     groups fired during battle sight zero (BSZ). It may take one or more groups to evaluate
     how the trainee applies shooting fundamentals. Therefore, students should not make a
     sight correction after the first 4-round BSZ group unless determined by the firing line
     official. During the remaining 4-round BSZ groupings, observe and analyze the trainee's
     grouping performance and solicit input from them before automatically offering sight
     adjustments.
     1.13.3.6. All orders of fire will start with the weapon on safe, bolt forward, magazine
     inserted and magazine pouch(s) fastened. This will require the trainee to charge the first
     round and move the selector to "SEMI" before firing. Trainees must do this on receiving
     the command "FIRE" and should use the non-shooting hand to operate the charging
     handle. However, they may use the shooting hand if they experience difficulty or are
     unable to safely control the direction of the muzzle during the charging operation.
     Trainees must unfasten the magazine pouch when reaching for the first magazine to
24                                          AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


     reload on each order. Conduct charging and reloading exercises using dummy rounds in
     the classroom before live firing.
     1.13.3.7. During Phase I and Phase II, trainees will perform immediate actions on their
     own stoppages, under instructor supervision. Trainees may then complete the order of
     fire. Prorate the time limit if required due to non-shooter caused malfuction or stoppages.
     WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must
     verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after clearing the stoppage.
     1.13.3.8. Trainees will perform immediate actions on their own stoppages during each
     order of fire in Phase III. Prorate the time limit for the order of fire if the trainee has, or is
     in the process of, successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the
     stoppage. The ultimate goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred
     and to have the ability to correct the problem and continue firing. WARNING: If a light
     recoil or difference in report is experienced, trainees must understand the instructor must
     verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after clearing the stoppage.
     1.13.3.9. Use sandbags filled with Styrofoam packing material, sand, gravel, wood chips,
     or crushed bark for the prone supported position.
     1.13.3.10. The primary purpose of the various supported positions is to teach trainees the
     tactical advantage of using cover and concealment in a combat situation. Instructors will
     emphasize the use of cover throughout the course. Trainees will make maximum use of
     cover during firing and reloading.
     1.13.3.11. Phase I and Phase II are instruction orders. Instructors will check and analyze
     targets after each order of Phase I and Phase 2. Instructors will assist trainees in assuming
     a correct position and will teach shooting fundamentals between orders of fire as needed.
     1.13.3.12. Remind trainees to keep the tip of the front sight on the vital area (center of
     the 4cm circle) when engaging the 250 and 300-meter targets. The eye has a natural
     tendency to try to see more "black" or more of the target at those distances, and will
     cause the shooter to unconsciously hold the front sight low on those small targets.
     1.13.3.13. During Phase II , trainees will engage each silhouette on the left side of the
     target for Orders 1, 3 and 5, beginning with the 75-meter target (bottom left, middle left,
     and top left). They will then engage each silhouette on the right side of the target for
     orders 2 and 4, beginning with the 75-meter target (top right, middle right, bottom right).
     1.13.3.14. During Phase III, trainees will first engage the four silhouettes (50, 100, and
     150 meters) on the lower half of the target with one round each. Trainees will then reload
     and engage the three silhouettes (200, 250, and 300 meters) in the target's upper left
     corner with one round each. Trainees will again reload and engage the three remaining
     silhouettes (200, 250, and 300 meters) in the target's upper right corner with one round
     each.
     1.13.3.15. Instructors will not teach during the evaluation orders of fire. However, they
     may assist trainees and teach shooting fundamentals between the orders of fire. They will
     also correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate action
     procedures when applicable.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                         25


     1.13.3.16. During reloading, trainees will keep the shooting hand on the pistol grip and
     do all reloading functions with the non-shooting hand. Trainees must wear a web belt
     with a magazine pouch, SF personnel should use issued web gear combination (web belt,
     pouches, LBE/LBV). Position the magazine pouch for easy access by the non-shooting
     hand. A right-handed shooter will withdraw a loaded magazine from the ammo pouch
     with the left hand and, at the same time, remove the empty magazine by pressing the
     magazine release button with the trigger finger allowing the empty magazine to fall.
     Insert loaded magazine with the left hand and press the bolt release with fingers or heel of
     the left hand. A left-handed shooter will withdraw a loaded magazine from the pouch
     with the right hand, depress the magazine release with the thumb of the right hand, insert
     the loaded magazine and then reach under or over the weapon to press the bolt release
     with fingers of the right hand.
     1.13.3.17. Before each order, place loaded magazines in the pouch with the top end of
     the magazine down and the projectile end or front edge of the magazine pointing away
     from the body. This way the shooter has only to reach back, unfasten the pouch latch and
     remove the magazine during the reload. This is a critical skill requiring practice to
     accomplish quickly and smoothly. It is imperative to practice reloading the rifle/carbine
     from the pouch and retaining empty magazines when moving out of position. Reload
     magazines between orders of fire as necessary.
     1.13.3.18. Eye protection for instructors is mandatory and is highly recommended for
     trainees. Hearing protection is mandatory for all personnel; dual hearing protection is
     required for Combat Arms personnel (unless electronic headsets are being used).
     1.13.3.19. Warning: Inspect all magazine pouches and magazines at the end of
     training to ensure they do not contain live rounds.

  1.14.3. Course notes TRQC:
     1.14.3.1. Trainees will stow protective mask in carrier, unless required for wear. Issued
     web gear combination (web belt, magazine pouches, LBE/LBV, etc) must be worn
     throughout course. Helmet and flak vest will be worn during Phase IX and is optional
     (Commander’s option) in other phases.
     1.14.3.2. To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during
     Phase I and all teaching/practice orders. Identify additional rounds on the AF Form 710.
     1.14.3.3. The purpose of using the 25-meter zeroing (Z) target is two fold. First, the
     shooter has a realistic combat distance target (250-meters for M16 and 300-meters for
     M16A2/M4) with a sight adjustment grid printed over the silhouette to aid in accurately
     making sight adjustments. Secondly, it is an excellent training aid for conducting 3-shot
     grouping exercises. Finally, the target provides a good indication of the shooter's ability
     to hit a life-size target at expected distances from a steady firing position.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                           29


     1.14.3.4. Ideally, trainees should be able to put all shots of the shot group within the 4cm
     circle on the "Z" target using a prone supported position. However, a 4cm group
     anywhere on the target indicates good application of shooting fundamentals and only
     requires sight adjustments to center the shot group and zero the rifle/carbine.
     1.14.3.5. Tracer mix for training is used (if range is capable of firing tracers) in teaching
     3-shot burst techniques and as an aid to trainees in building skill to control automatic fire.
     For operational use, commanders, squad leaders, fire team leaders, etc., may elect to use
     tracers in various combinations for several different mission needs. Tracer ammunition
     can be used to adjust fire on your target, for incendiary purposes and for signaling other
     members of a fire team where to direct their fire.
     1.14.3.6. Use sandbags filled with styrofoam packing material, sand, gravel, wood chips
     or crushed bark for the prone supported position.
     1.14.3.7. The primary purpose of the various supported positions is to teach trainees the
     tactical advantage of the use of cover in a combat situation. Instructors will emphasize
     the use of cover throughout the course. Trainees will make maximum use of cover during
     firing and reloading.
     1.14.3.8. Phase I and all teaching/practice orders are instruction orders. Instructors will
     check and analyze targets after each order of Phase I and must check and analyze targets
     after each teaching/practice order. Instructors will assist trainees in assuming a correct
     position and will teach shooting fundamentals between orders of fire as needed.
     1.14.3.9. Remind trainees to keep the tip of the front sight on the vital area (center of the
     4cm circle) when engaging the 250- and 300-meter targets. The eye has a natural
     tendency to try to see more "black" or more of the target at those distances and will cause
     the shooter to unconsciously hold the front sight low on those small targets.
     1.14.3.10. Instructors will not teach during the evaluation orders of fire. However, they
     may assist trainees and teach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of fire.
     They will also correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate
     action procedures when applicable.
     1.14.3.11. During reloading, trainees will keep the shooting hand on the pistol grip and
     do all reloading functions with the non-shooting hand. Trainees must wear a web belt
     with a magazine pouch and SF personnel should use issued web gear combination (web
     belt, pouches, LBE/LBV). Position the magazine pouch for easy access by the non-
     shooting hand. A right-handed shooter will withdraw a loaded magazine from the ammo
     pouch with the left hand and, at the same time, remove the empty magazine by pressing
     the magazine release button with the trigger finger allowing the empty magazine to fall.
     Insert loaded magazine with the left hand and press the bolt release with fingers or heel of
     the left hand. A left-handed shooter will withdraw a loaded magazine from the pouch
     with the right hand, depress the magazine release with the thumb of the right hand, insert
     the loaded magazine and then reach under or over the weapon to press the bolt release
     with fingers of the right hand.
     1.14.3.12. Before each order, place loaded magazines in the pouch with the top end of
     the magazine down and the projectile end or front edge of the magazine pointing away
     from the body. This way the shooter has only to reach back, unfasten the pouch latch and
30                                          AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


     remove the magazine during the reload. This is a critical skill requiring practice to
     accomplish quickly and smoothly. It is imperative to practice reloading the rifle/carbine
     from the pouch and retaining empty magazines when moving out of position. Reload
     magazines between orders of fire as necessary.
     1.14.3.13. Eye protection for instructors is mandatory and is highly recommended for
     trainees. Hearing protection is mandatory for all personnel; dual hearing protection is
     required for Combat Arms personnel (unless electronic headsets are being used).
     1.14.3.14. Warning: Combat Arms personnel must inspect all weapons, magazines
     and magazine pouch(s) at the end of training to ensure they do not contain live
     rounds. See AFI 36-2226 for additional range operation procedures.
     1.14.3.15. The silhouettes on the SF and TF targets are engaged as targets within the
     shooters" field of fire. For example, if six enemy targets presented themselves at the
     actual distances represented on the SF target (75, 175, and 300 meters), the closest
     (greatest threat) targets would be engaged first, progressing to the farthest (least threat)
     targets. In a real world situation, shooters should engage those targets posing the greatest
     threat to themselves or their gun position.
  1.14.4. PHASE II--Day Burst Notes:
     1.14.4.1. In the teaching order, trainees will fire a 3-round burst at each 75-meter
     silhouette (six rounds total), reload and repeat the same sequence.
     1.14.4.2. Although there is no time limit in the teaching order, encourage trainees to
     deliver accurate fire on target as fast as their ability will permit. The goal is to ensure first
     round hits when firing 3-round bursts.
     1.14.4.3. Before firing the evaluation order, hits on the practice target must be marked or
     the target replaced.
     1.14.4.4. In the evaluation order, trainees will fire a 3-round burst at each 75-meter
     silhouette (six rounds total), reload and repeat the same sequence.
     1.14.4.5. Those locations not capable of conducting automatic/burst fire will fire all
     orders rapid fire (MAJCOM/SF must be informed prior to implementation of this
     provision).
  1.14.5. PHASE III--CWDE Notes:
     1.14.5.1. The trainees will fire the complete phase while wearing the protective mask and
     CWDE gloves.
     1.14.5.2. In the teaching order, the trainees will engage the silhouettes on the SF target in
     the following order: one shot at each 75-meter target, one shot at each 175-meter target
     and one shot at each 300-meter target.
     1.14.5.3. In the evaluation order, the trainees will engage the silhouettes on the SF target
     as follows: one shot at each 75-meter target, one shot at each 175-meter target and one
     shot at each 300-meter target.
  1.14.6. Phase IV--Weak Hand Firing Notes:
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          31


     1.14.6.1. The trainees will fire the complete phase while gripping the weapon with the
     weak hand and using the strong hand for support.
     1.14.6.2. In the teaching order, the trainees will engage the silhouettes on the SF target in
     the following order: one shot at each 75-meter target, one shot at each 175-meter target
     and one shot at each 300-meter target.
     1.14.6.3. In the evaluation order, the trainees will engage the silhouettes on the SF target
     as follows: one shot at each 75-meter target, one shot at each 175-meter target and one
     shot at each 300-meter target.
  1.14.7. Phase V, Day Rapid Fire Notes (Iron Sights Only): Trainees will first engage the
  four silhouettes (50, 100, and 150 meters) on the lower half of the target with one round each.
  Trainees will then reload and engage the three silhouettes (200, 250, and 300 meters) in the
  target's upper left corner with one round each. Trainees will again reload and engage the
  three remaining silhouettes (200, 250, and 300 meters) in the target's upper right corner with
  one round each.
  1.14.8. PHASE VI – Quick Reaction Drills with or without the M68 Optic:
     1.14.8.1. All orders in this phase will begin with the weapon shouldered, round
     chambered, weapon on semi and the muzzle pointing down at a ―ready‖ position. The
     intent is to have the weapon’s sighting systems out of the shooter’s immediate view
     (simulating the weapon’s position while clearing an area).
     1.14.8.2. Shooters will be given a 3 second time limit for the first and second string, and
     4 seconds for the final string. Shooters may fire as many rounds as they wish in each
     string (semi only) to ensure all 10 rounds are fired within time limits.
     1.14.8.3. Prior to firing Phase V, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle on the target using
     chalk or white grease pencil. The circle must be visible to the shooter during the teaching
     phase. Once the teaching phase has been completed, replace these targets with a target
     where the 10-inch circle is drawn with pen or pencil to ensure the circle is not visible at
     25-meters. Locate the 10 inch circle on the "E" target as shown in Figure 2.7 Center the
     circle on the target with the top edge of the circle 13 1/4 inches from the top of the head
     of the target. Make the template using plywood, acrylic plastic or other material. Holes in
     the target may be pasted or marked with a pen rather than replacing targets after every
     shooter.
  1.14.9. PHASE VII—Night Semiautomatic Fire
     1.14.9.1. The goal is for each trainee to have 4 of 6 hits during the teaching phase.
     1.14.9.2. During all phases, trainees will fire one 6-round magazine.


  1.14.10. PHASE VIII--Night Burst Fire Notes:
     1.14.10.1. Shooters must be able to identify their sights and downrange targets.
     Instructors must be able to observe the actions of the shooters on the firing line.
     Consideration must be given to allow dimmable lights on the range to produce the desired
     results.
32                                       AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


     1.14.10.2. When possible, firing will be accomplished using 2 to 1 ball/tracer mix. Load
     magazines: 2 ball--1 tracer, 2 ball--1 tracer, etc. If loaded properly top round on the
     magazine should be a tracer.
     1.14.10.3. During all phases, trainees will fire one 6-round magazine at the target using
     3- round bursts.
     1.14.10.4. Block officers will proceed down range and inspect/mark targets to preserve
     trainee’s night vision.
  1.14.11. PHASE IX--Night Vision Devices:
     1.14.11.1. Trainees will wear the helmet and flak vest during the entire phase.
     1.14.11.2. The M68 and AN/PVS-14 combination or the AN/PAQ-4 and AN/PVS-7D
     combination are the preferred equipment for this phase. However, units may use any
     combination of night vision devices for this course of fire if authorized for use.
     1.14.11.3. Although this is a qualification phase, it is used to give each shooter the
     experience of firing with available Night Vision Devices.
     1.14.11.4. Load magazines: 2 ball-1 tracer, 2 ball-1 tracer, etc. (if available). If loaded
     properly, the top round on the magazine should be a tracer. Trainees will fire one 10-
     round magazine.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                       33

Figure 1.4. Supported Fighting Position.




Supported fighting position. This position provides the most stable platform for engaging
targets. Upon entering the position, the shooter adds or removes dirt, sandbags or other supports
to adjust for his/her height. The shooter then faces the target, executes a half-face to the firing
side and leans forward until the chest is against the firing-hand corner of the position. The
shooter places the rifle/carbine handguard in the V formed by the thumb and fingers of the
nonfiring hand and rests the nonfiring hand on the material (sandbags or berm) to the front of the
position. The shooter places the stock butt in the pocket of the firing shoulder and rests the firing
elbow on the ground outside the position. (When prepared positions are not available, the prone
supported position can be substituted). Once the supported fighting position has been mastered,
the shooter should practice various unsupported positions to obtain the smallest possible wobble
area during final aiming and hammer fall. The coach/trainer can check the steadiness of the
position by observing movement at the forward part of the rifle, by looking through the M16
sighting device or by checking to see support is being used.
NOTE:
The objective is to establish a steady position under various conditions. The ultimate
performance of this task is in a combat environment. Although the shooter must be positioned
high enough to observe all targets, the shooter must remain as low as possible to provide added
protection from enemy fire.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          35


Figure 1.5. Prone Unsupported Position.




Prone unsupported position. This firing position offers another stable firing platform for
engaging targets. To assume this position, the shooter faces the target, spreads the feet a
comfortable distance apart and drops to the knees. Using the butt of the rifle/carbine as a pivot,
the shooter rolls onto the nonfiring side placing the nonfiring elbow close to the side of the
magazine. The shooter places the rifle/carbine butt in the pocket formed by the firing shoulder,
grasps the pistol grip with the firing hand and lowers the firing elbow to the ground. The
rifle/carbine rests in the V formed by the thumb and fingers of the nonfiring hand. The shooter
adjusts the position of the firing elbow until the shoulders are about level and pulls back firmly
on the rifle/carbine with both hands. To complete the position, the shooter obtains a stock weld
and relaxes, keeping the heels close to the ground.
Advanced Positions. After mastering the four marksmanship fundamentals in the two basic
firing positions, the shooter is taught the advanced positions. The shooter is trained to assume
different positions to adapt to the combat situation.
 36                                       AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


Figure 1.6. Alternate Prone Position.




Alternate prone position. This position is an alternative to both prone supported and
unsupported fighting positions, allowing the shooter to cock their firing leg. The shooter can
assume a comfortable position while maintaining the same relationship between the body and the
axis of the rifle/carbine. This position relaxes the stomach muscles and allows the shooter to
breathe naturally.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                         37


Figure 1.7. Kneeling Supported Position.




Kneeling supported position. This position allows the shooter to obtain the height necessary to
better observe many target areas, taking advantage of available cover. Solid cover can support
any part of the body or rifle/carbine assists in firing accuracy. The shooter may adjust this
position (for example, both knees down on the ground, upright kneeling, etc) based on terrain,
support used, body armor, personal preference, physical abilities etc.
Kneeling unsupported position. This position is assumed quickly, places the shooter high enough
to see over small brush and provides for a stable firing position. The nonfiring elbow should be
pushed forward of the knee so the upper arm is resting on a flat portion of the knee to provide
stability. The trailing foot can be placed in a comfortable position. The shooter may adjust this
position (for example, both knees down on the ground, upright kneeling, etc) based on terrain,
support used, body armor, personal preference, physical abilities etc.
 38                                          AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


Figure 1.8. Standing Position.




Standing position. To assume the standing position, the shooter faces their target, executes a
facing movement to the firing side and spreads the feet a comfortable distance apart. With the
firing hand on the pistol grip and the nonfiring hand on either the upper handguard or the bottom
of the magazine, the shooter places the butt of the rifle/carbine in the pocket formed by the firing
shoulder so the sights are level with his eyes. The weight of the rifle/carbine is supported by the
firing shoulder pocket and nonfiring hand. The shooter shifts their feet until aiming naturally at
the target and the weight is evenly distributed on both feet. The standing position provides the
least stability but could be needed for observing the target area since it can be assumed quickly
while moving. Support for any portion of the body or rifle/carbine improves stability. More
stability can be obtained by adjusting the ammunition pouch to support the nonfiring elbow,
allowing the rifle/carbine magazine to rest in the nonfiring hand.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                        39


Figure 1.9. Modified Firing Positions.




Modified Firing Positions. Once the basic firing skills have been mastered during initial
training, the shooter should be encouraged to modify positions, to take advantage of available
cover, to use anything to steady the rifle/carbine or to make any change allowing more combat
targets. The position shown above uses sandbags to support the handguard and frees the
nonfiring hand (hand should be wrapped around magazine, not underneath it as this could be a
safety issue should the bottom of the magazine be blown out during a malfunction) to be used on
any part of the rifle/carbine to hold it steady. NOTE: Modified positions can result in small
zero changes due to shifting pressure and grip on the rifle/carbine.

Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Firing Positions. Although the same
principles of rifle/carbine marksmanship apply, the selection and use of firing positions during

MOUT requires some special considerations. Firing from around corners could require the
shooter to fire from the opposite shoulder to avoid exposing themselves to enemy fire.

Figure 1.11. MOUT Continued.




The requirement for long-range observation can dictate what positions can be used high above
ground. Figure 1.10 shows a shooter firing over rooftops, exposing only the parts of the body
necessary to engage a target. Figure 1.11 shows a shooter firing around obstacles. Figure 1.11

also highlights the need to stay in the shadows while firing from windows and the requirements
for cover and rifle/carbine support.

2.1. Handgun AFQC. These courses provide Air Force members with the minimum training,
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures and evaluation required for qualification with a handgun.
Qualification is separate for each weapon model, type or system. Qualification on one type of
handgun does not qualify an individual with other types of handguns.
2.2. Training Overview.
   2.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the handgun training
   program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualifying on the required
   evaluation phase of the AFQC and passing mechanical evaluations. Initial training on AFQC
   is a prerequisite before proceeding to more advanced specialized training courses.
   2.2.2. Recurring Training. This is qualification training after initial qualification. This
   training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required AFQC or Specialized
   Pistol Course (SPC), evaluation phases and passing mechanical evaluations. Frequency of
   this training is outlined in AFI 36-2226. Weapons safety procedures and the training
   objectives in Table 2.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for Group A recurring
   training.
   2.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. This training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   2.2.4. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by
   weapons qualified members of a unit to help maintain the individual's weapon handling
   proficiency. Units should conduct this training before exercises and deployments.
2.3. Instructor Guidelines.
   2.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of the weapons. They will supervise, evaluate and assist trainees during the operator
   maintenance evaluation (care, cleaning and function check). See AFI 36-2226 for student to
   instructor ratios.
   2.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, help, coach and teach trainees, as needed, during
   practice and evaluation orders of fire. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   2.3.3. Tower Operator. The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and
   effective range operations during range training sessions. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
2.4. Handgun Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is
intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and
recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth instruction, concentrating on known problems.
Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives.
Approximate training times for this program are:
   2.4.1. For AFQC -- 5 to 6 hours.
   2.4.2. For specialized courses – 6 to 8 hours

will be used instead of the MAJCOM courses. Courses will require at least 50 rounds and no
more than 100 rounds of ammunition, minimum qualification score, and classroom training
covering weapons/range safety, immediate action drills and exercises in specialized weapons
employment. MAJCOMs must coordinate specialized courses with HQ AFSFC/SFWC as
detailed in AFI 36-2226.
2.10. (ACC)ACC/A7S has developed a SPC of fire, see Attachment #3. ACC SF members
who have the M9 pistol assigned as a primary or secondary duty weapon must fire the SPC as
part of their unit level proficiency/sustainment training between 5 to 7 months after each 12
month qualification.

2.11. Course Information, Handgun AFQC.
     2.11.1. Targets for the course: Use the Military "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874)
     and Military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute. Targets may
     need to be hung lower to avoid shooting overhead baffles and/or target holders.
     2.11.2. Standards:
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                           51


     2.11.2.1. Qualified: 35 hits on target (77.7%)
     2.11.2.2. Expert: 41 hits (91.1%) on target with at least 25 hits within the 10-inch (vital
     area) circle (81.3%) and 6 hits within the 6-inch (head) circle (46%). NOTE: A triple-
     number score is annotated when any score 41 or higher has been achieved (examples:
     ―41/25/8‖,―44/30/10‖, etc.) The first number is the amount of hits on the entire target, the
     second number is the total number of hits inside the 10-inch vital area and the third
     number is the total number of hits within the 6-inch head area of the target. A score of
     ―41/20/3‖ would indicate a qualified score.
  2.11.3. Course Notes:
     2.11.3.1. Common Notes:
         2.11.3.1.1. WARNING: Before starting live fire training, ensure students establish a
         proper grip with the handgun and do not have their thumb blocking the rear of the
         slide. Serious injury can occur if a portion of the shooters hand makes contact with
         the slide during recoil.
         2.11.3.1.2. There is no zeroing order; however, instructors will check bullet impact
         and discuss the adjusted aiming point method if the point of impact is substantially
         off the vital area of the target and is not caused by shooter error, i.e., jerking the
         trigger, flinching, etc.
         2.11.3.1.3. For the M9 or M11, start each order and string of fire with a round in the
         chamber, hammer down and the decocking lever (except M11) in the fire position
         (first round double action). Trainees are to fire the first round in each order and string
         of fire double action. To ensure consistency, the ―Field Interview Stance‖ (placing
         hands on belt buckle area) is only used as a starting point (to ensure consistency) for
         each student prior to drawing the weapon from the holster.
         2.11.3.1.4. Trainees firing with an approved concealed carry MUST wear a jacket
         concealing the holstered weapon. Drawing from a concealed carry is mandatory if the
         intent is to carry the weapon concealed.
         2.11.3.1.5. Individuals authorized to use an approved ―cross-draw‖ shoulder holster
         are not allowed to fire with students using ―normal‖ hip type holsters. When firing
         with shoulder holsters, individuals will be positioned on every other firing point.
         2.11.3.1.6. The over-barricade position is a supported position. Do not allow the
         weapon to touch the support. Trainees can use the barricade for support.
         2.11.3.1.7. Pistol and revolver shooters may fire during the same relay; however,
         position pistol shooters to the right of the revolver shooters on the firing line.
         2.11.3.1.8. Eye protection for instructors is mandatory and is highly recommended
         for trainees. Hearing protection is mandatory for all personnel; dual hearing
         protection is required for all Combat Arms personnel (unless electronic headsets are
         being used).
         2.11.3.1.9. WARNING: Combat Arms personnel must visually inspect all
         weapons, magazines and magazine pouches at the end of live-fire training to
         ensure they do not contain live rounds. Combat Arms personnel will rack clear
52                                    AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


     all weapons prior to removal from the firing line (students may transport
     weapons in their holsters once made rack safe).
     2.11.3.1.10. For all strings except right/left barricade: Unless the weapon is
     empty, once a student has completed a string of fire, the student must remain on
     target and continue to scan until the command ―cease fire‖ has been given or when
     the target is turned on edge. Once the command ―cease fire‖ has been given, or the
     target turns on edge, students will remain on target for two seconds and the tower
     operator will give the command ―finger off trigger and move to the weaver ready
     position.‖ Once at the weaver ready position, students will automatically decock the
     weapon and remain in this position looking at the target for four seconds until the
     command ―recover to holster‖ has been given. This technique ensures students do not
     automatically take their weapons off target and holster without first ensuring the
     threat is eliminated. If the weapon is empty, students will take cover as appropriate,
     clear their weapons and follow the instructions from the tower operator. When
     reloading or performing immediate actions, shooters must bring weapon near eye
     level (weapon may be brought closer to the body as needed to accomplish these
     tasks). This technique ensures the shooter is not taking their eyes away from the
     simulated threat until the simulated threat is eliminated by the cease-fire command or
     the target being turned on edge.
     2.11.3.1.11. For right/left barricade: Unless the weapon is empty, once a student
     has completed a string of fire, the students will immediately return to the weaver
     ready position behind the barricade. Once behind the barricade, shooters will remove
     their fingers from the trigger and decock the weapon. This technique ensures students
     are not placing their weapons on safe while engaging a simulated threat. Instructors
     must stress the importance of not firing the weapon behind the barricade. If the
     weapon is empty, students will take cover as appropriate, clear their weapons and
     follow the instructions from the tower operator. When reloading or performing
     immediate actions, shooters must bring weapon near eye level (weapon may be
     brought closer to the body to as needed to accomplish these tasks). This technique
     ensures the shooter is not taking their eyes away from the simulated threat until the
     simulated threat is eliminated by the cease-fire command or the target being turned on
     edge.
     2.11.3.1.12. Trainees must have the authorized belt, holster, pouch and a minimum of
     three magazines. During the Evaluation, insert the 3rd magazine into the magazine
     pouch after completion of Evaluation Order number 3.
     2.11.3.1.13. Practice Orders 2-5 and Evaluation Orders 1-6 will be fired with 2 shots
     to the body and 1 shot to the head. When firing Practice Order 6 and Evaluation
     Order 7 (all shots will be fired into the body), students will fire 3 rounds Over
     Barricade, move to the Kneeling Barricade position and fire the remaining 3 rounds
     from the Kneeling Barricade position.
     2.11.3.1.14. The 3-shot strings (2 shots to the body and 1 shot to the head) are in
     actuality designed as a failure drill. This technique is used when the two shots to the
     body are stopped by body armor and the third shot (failure drill) is fired into the
     unprotected head of the target. During training, students will momentarily pause after
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                           53


        firing the body shots and then fire the third round into the head of the target. This
        technique is used to so students can determine if the threat has been eliminated.
        Students are responsible for pausing between the second and third shot, Combat Arms
        personnel will not interfere to dictate/imply pause durations during actual strings of
        fire. In a real life scenario, the time it takes for a student to move from the chest/torso
        area to the head should be sufficient to determine if a head shot (failure drill) is
        needed. In reality, but not during this course of fire, shots may also be placed into the
        pelvic girdle to stop an enemy target.
        2.11.3.1.15. Once the range has been cleared and/or the line has been made safe, the
        following range commands will be used for this new course of fire (commands may
        have to be repeated/modified to ensure everyone understands). ―Shooters with a ____
        round magazine load. Your next order of fire will be ____ rounds fired from the
        _____ position within a ______ time limit. Once loaded, holster your weapon or
        move to the weaver ready position‖ (holstering the weapon or moving to weaver
        ready will depend on the firing position used). Once loaded, holstered, or weaver
        ready, and ready to fire, (the block officers will point downrange to ensure the tower
        operator knows the line is ready to fire) the following range commands will be used:
        ―Shooters, this order of fire will be ____ rounds fired from the ____ position. You’re
        on duty, standby‖ and after a non-standard pause, give the command ―fire‖ or whistle
        (students must not know when the command fire or whistle will be given). Once
        firing has been completed (either each string or the course of fire) normal range
        commands IAW AFI 36-2226, paragraph 5.6.6. will be used to ensure range safety.
        To eliminate the need for fire and cease fire commands, the use of turning targets is
        recommended.
     2.11.3.2. Practice Order Notes:
        2.11.3.2.1. Before firing Phase I, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle and a 6-inch
        (head) circle on the target using chalk or white grease pencil. The circle must be
        visible to the shooter at all target distances. The shooter will use the circle as a
        reference point during practice fire to aid in placing rounds in the vital area of the
        target. Locate the 10 inch circle on the "E" target as shown in Figure 2.7. Center the
        circle on the target with the top edge of the circle 13-1/4 inches from the top of the
        head of the target. Place the top of the 6-inch head circle 3 inches below the top of the
        target. Make the template using plywood, acrylic plastic or other material.
        2.11.3.2.2. Practice Orders 1 and 2 will begin from the weaver ready position.
        Practice Orders 3 and 4 will begin from the weaver ready position behind the
        barricade. Practice Orders 5 and 6 will begin from the field interview position with
        the holster and ammunition pouches secured. Practice Order 5 is a repetitious training
        phase to emphasize the failure drill process. On Practice Order 6, trainees will fire 3
        rounds from the over barricade position (3 shots to the body), move to the kneeling
        barricade position and fire the remaining 3 rounds in the weapon (3 shots to the
        body). This reinforces the tactic of not reappearing in the same spot after a reload.
        For example: the overbarricade position simulates firing over the hood of a car and
        the firing from the kneeling barricade simulates firing from in front of the headlights.
54                                        AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


        2.11.3.2.3. Instructors are to teach trainees, as needed, during practice orders.
        Instructors will correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures
        if stoppages occur.
        2.11.3.2.4. Before live firing, Group B and C trainees will practice drawing the
        handgun a minimum of 10 times and dry firing from a combination of the weaver
        stance and the left, right, or overbarricade positions. Allow sufficient time for
        instructors to observe, coach, and evaluate each trainee. Instructors will observe,
        coach and evaluate each trainee prior to live fire to ensure the weapon can be drawn
        from the holster safely.
        2.11.3.2.5. Repair or replace all targets after Phase I.
        2.11.3.2.6. To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds
        during Phase I.
        2.11.3.2.7. During Phase I, trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor
        supervision when the order of fire is completed. WARNING: If a light recoil or
        difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to
        fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     2.11.3.3. Evaluation Order Notes:
        2.11.3.3.1. Before firing Phase II, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle and a 6-inch
        (head area) circle using a pencil or pen so the circle isn't visible to the shooter, at any
        distance, during the evaluation. Use the circles for scoring purposes starting at this
        point (all rounds in the circle or touching the lines of the circle will be scored as hits).
        Give trainees the opportunity to view their targets at the end of the course so they can
        see if their shots are in and around the vital area of the target. Evaluation targets
        having aiming points (accidental or intentional) within the circle must be replaced.
        2.11.3.3.2. Trainees will begin each order of fire on Evaluation Orders 1, 3 and 7
        with the handgun holstered and the flap fastened. Magazine/ammo pouch will be
        fastened on all orders of fire. Trainees will place loaded spare magazine in ammo
        pouch with top of magazine down into the pouch first and rounds pointed forward. As
        a reminder, insert the 3rd magazine into the magazine pouch after completion of
        Evaluation Order number 3.
        2.11.3.3.3. Trainees will start and finish each string of fire in Evaluation Orders 2, 4,
        5, and 6 from the weaver ready position behind the barricade. Once behind the
        barricade, shooters will remove their fingers from the trigger and decock the weapon.
        This technique ensures students are not placing their weapons on safe while engaging
        a simulated threat. Instructors must stress the importance of not firing the
        weapon behind the barricade. See Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5 for additional
        guidance.
        2.11.3.3.4. Trainees will clear their own stoppages during each order of fire in Phase
        II. Ensure students keep weapons near eye level (to ensure target stays in view) while
        clearing all malfunctions, stoppages, or corrective actions (weapons may be brought
        closer to the body as needed to accomplish these tasks). Give pro-rated time to
        complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or is in the process of, successfully
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                       55


       applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage. The ultimate goal is for
       the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to correct
       the problem and continue firing. WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in report is
       experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck
       in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
       2.11.3.3.5. Instructors will not teach during the evaluation orders of fire. However,
       they may assist trainees and teach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of
       fire. They will also correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply
       immediate action procedures when applicable.
       2.11.3.3.6. When students are ready to fire the first string of the evaluation phase,
       they will be given the command to load. This will be the only time the students will
       be told to load for the remainder of the evaluation phase. From this point, students
       will automatically reload when their weapons are empty and the slide locks to the
       rear. Students must be clearly informed of the number of rounds fired during each
       string, as they will most likely have more rounds in the magazine than they will be
       firing. This technique allows the student to automatically reload without being told;
       the exact scenario they will encounter in a ―real world‖ situation.
       2.11.3.3.7. On evaluation order 7, trainees will fire 3 rounds from the over barricade
       position (3 shots to the body), move to the kneeling barricade position and fire the
       remaining 3 rounds in the weapon (3 shots to the body). This simulates a reload as in
       Practice Order number 6. This reinforces the tactic of not reappearing in the same
       spot after a reload. For example: the overbarricade position simulates firing over the
       hood of a car and the reload and firing from the kneeling barricade simulates firing
       from in front of the headlights. Students will not fire any shots to the head at 25-
       meter targets.

Figure 2.2. Weaver Stance.




Weaver Stance. Use the weaver stance when firing from cover isn't possible. The weaver stance
affords the shooter a more stable firing position using less body movement than previous
positions. It allows quicker target acquisition and increases speed and accuracy. To assume the
weaver stance, take a standing position facing the target with the feet shoulder width apart, step
back with the strong side foot about 5 to 8 inches, and pivot on the balls of your feet 45 degrees
to the weak side (very similar to a boxer’s stance). Bring weapon to eye level; do not lower head
to weapon. This position may be modified to make maximum use of body armor. Extend the
shooting arm toward the target, do not lock elbow. Wrap fingers of the support hand around
(overlapping) fingers of the shooting hand (forefinger of support hand may be placed on concave
forward surface of the trigger guard). Keep support arm bent, elbow pointing toward the ground.
Apply forward pressure with the shooting arm and at the same time, apply equal pressure to the
rear with the support arm. This will help steady the handgun. Lift head slightly for better
sighting. Keep both eyes open if possible.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                     57


Figure 2.3. Weaver Ready Position.




           Weaver Ready Position. With the shooter in the weaver stance, the shooter lowers
           the weapon so the entire target is visible. This lowered position may be nothing
           more than a 3 to 4 inch drop as demonstrated in the pictures above. Lower the
           weapon by pivoting at the shoulder, do not bend at the elbows or tuck the weapon
           into the chest to lower the handgun. Shooters must not raise and lower their heads
           to meet the intent of this requirement. Keep the weapon pointed down range and
           maintain eye contact with the target.

Figure 2.4. Handgun Right Barricade Position.




          Right Barricade Position. The primary purpose of using a barricade is to provide
          cover for the shooter. Start from the weaver ready position from behind the
          barricade. With the weapon at the weaver position behind the barricade, roll out
          (lean) to the right and engage the target (ensure the weapon is clear of the barricade
          to prevent rounds from being fired into the barricade). Roll back behind the
          barricade after firing, take finger off trigger, decock and again assume the weaver
          ready position. Reloading is also conducted behind the barricade. If using the
          barricade for support, do not allow any portion of the weapon to touch the barricade.
          The picture on the left shows the position on the firing range; the picture on the right
          shows the position using an actual building. Notice the limited target potential this
          position shows. During classroom and dry-fire training, students should be
          taught the ―cut the pie‖ method of target engagement.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          59


Figure 2.5. Handgun Left Barricade Position.




        Left Barricade Position. The primary purpose of using a barricade is to provide cover
        for the shooter. Start from the weaver ready position from behind the barricade. With
        the weapon at the weaver position behind the barricade, roll out (lean) to the left, and
        engage the target (ensure the weapon is clear of the barricade to prevent rounds from
        being fired into the barricade). Roll back behind the barricade after firing, take finger
        off trigger, decock and again assume the weaver ready position. Reloading is also
        conducted behind the barricade. If using the barricade for support, do not allow any
        portion of the weapon to touch the barricade. The picture on the left shows the position
        on the firing range; the picture on the right shows the position using an actual building.
        Notice the limited target potential this position shows. During classroom and dry-fire
        training, students should be taught the ―cut the pie‖ method of target engagement.

Figure 2.6. Handgun Over Barricade Position.




Over Barricade Position. This is a variation of the standing position with the addition of a
barricade for stability and protection. The barricade simulates a tall fence, wall, or solid object,
giving protection to the shooter. To assume this position, place the weak foot forward towards
the barricade, bend the forward knee, and move the strong foot back until only the head and
weapon are visible above the barricade. Rest the forearms (behind wrists, or heels of the hands)
on the barricade. The height of the over barricade position is no higher than necessary to see and
shoot over your barricade. Don't allow any part of the handgun or magazine to touch the support.
Reloading must be accomplished while kneeling concealed behind the barricade. WARNING:
Resting wrists or heels of hands on barricade could result in painful pinching to the shooter’s

Figure 2.7. Circle Template for Handgun Targets.




Circle Template: This template is used to mark each target for the practice and qualification
courses of fire. Instructors must ensure the circles are visible at all distance during practice by
using white chalk or white grease pencil to make the circles. During the evaluation portion, the
circles must not be visible at any distance. Use a lead pencil to ensure the circles are not visible.
To speed up this process, instructors may choose to draw the circles on all targets using pencil
and allow students to trace the circle in white grease pencil or chalk. The picture on the right
shows the relationship between the template and an actual body. Notice how the 6-inch circle
encompasses the eyes, nose and mouth and the 10-inch circle covers the thoracic cavity (the part
of the human body between the neck and the diaphragm partially encased by the ribs).

                              SHOTGUN TRAINING PROGRAM

3.1. Shotgun AFQC. This course provides Air Force members with the minimum training,
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and evaluation required for qualification with a shotgun.
Qualification is separate for each weapon model, type or system. Qualification on one type of
shotgun does not qualify an individual with other types of shotguns.
3.1. (ACC)SF personnel deploying with the M870 or Modular Combat Shotgun will
receive AFQC and non-lethal training using the material listed in this chapter as well as the
AFSFC Community of Practice (CoP). Course material can be accessed directly from a
military (.mil) location with Common Access Card (CAC) authentication at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=AF-ED-00-29-
17-5-1&Filter=AF-ED-00-29.
3.2. Training Overview.
   3.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the shotgun-training program.
   Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation
   phases of the AFQC and passing mechanical evaluations.
   3.2.2. Recurring Training. This is qualification training after initial qualification. This
   training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the shotgun AFQC and passing
   mechanical evaluations. Qualification length of this program is 12 months for all arming
   Groups. Weapons safety procedures and the training objectives in Table 3.1 are the
   minimum mandatory items required for Group A recurring training.
   3.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. This training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   3.2.4. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by unit to
   help maintain the individual's proficiency. Units should conduct this training before exercises
   and deployments.
3.3. Instructor Guidelines:
   3.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of the weapons. They will supervise, evaluate and assist trainees during the operator
   maintenance evaluation (care, cleaning and function check). See AFI 36-2226 for student to
   instructor ratios.
   3.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach trainees, as needed, during
   practice and evaluation orders of fire. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   3.3.3. Tower Operator. The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and
   effective range operations during range training sessions. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
3.4. Shotgun Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is
intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and
recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth instruction, concentrating on known problems.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                         63


Trainees must meet and pass evaluations to the performance standards of these training
objectives. Approximate training times for this program are:
   3.4.1. For AFQC -- 4 to 5 hours.
   3.4.2. For remedial and unit training -- as required.
3.5. Training Goal. Training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and maintain
the capability to use the shotgun against enemy targets and lightweight materials.
3.6. Training Objectives (AFQC). The training objectives needed for successful completion of
this course are found in Table 3.1.
   3.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       3.6.1.1. Safety procedures.

  3.9.2. Standard: Qualified: 25 hits out of a possible score of 45.
  3.9.3. Course notes:
     3.9.3.1. During training, shotguns may be equipped with removable (slide on) recoil
     pads.
     3.9.3.2. Before live firing, trainees will be given an opportunity to practice assuming
     each position and establishing proper grip/technique. Afford sufficient time for
     instructors to observe, coach and evaluate each trainee. This may be accomplished on the
     firing line prior to firing Phase I or in the classroom during the second period.
     3.9.3.3. Conduct all firing with "00" buckshot or Frangible (9 pellets).
     3.9.3.4. Instructors will teach trainees, as needed, during practice orders. Instructors will
     correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if stoppages occur.
     3.9.3.5. Start standing orders of fire with the shotgun at a low ready position and the
     safety on.
     3.9.3.6. The shotgun must not touch or rest on the barricade.
     3.9.3.7. During Phase I, trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructors
     supervision when the order of fire is completed. Trainees must bring the weapon to eye
     level (or approximate) to ensure the target remains in their field of vision. WARNING: If
     a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon
     is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     3.9.3.8. To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during
     Phase I.
     3.9.3.9. Repair or replace all targets after the practice order.
     3.9.3.10. Instructors will evaluate the trainee's ability to effectively apply marksmanship
     fundamentals during the evaluation phase of fire. Instructors will not teach during the
     evaluation orders of fire. They may assist trainees and teach shooting fundamentals
     between the actual orders of fire. They will also correct safety infractions and supervise
     how trainees apply immediate action procedures when applicable.
     3.9.3.11. Trainees will clear their own stoppages during each order of fire in Phase II.
     Give additional time to complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or is in the process of,
     successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage. The ultimate
     goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to
     correct the problem and continue firing. NOTE: If a light recoil or difference in report is
     experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in
     barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     3.9.3.12. Eye protection for instructors is mandatory and is highly recommended for
     trainees. Hearing protection is mandatory for all personnel; dual hearing protection is
     required for all Combat Arms personnel (unless electronic headsets are being used).

                 40MM GRENADE LAUNCHER TRAINING PROGRAM

4.1. Grenade Launcher AFQC. This course provides Air Force members with the minimum
training, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and evaluation required for qualification with a
grenade launcher. Qualification is separate for each weapon model, type or system. Qualification
on one type of grenade launcher does not qualify an individual with other types of grenade
launchers. SF personnel will zero and qualify with the actual weapon they will be armed with.
4.1. (ACC)SF personnel deploying with the M203 will receive AFQC, night and non-lethal
training using the material listed in this chapter as well as the AFSFC Community of
Practice (CoP). Course material can be accessed directly from a military (.mil) location with
Common            Access           Card          (CAC)           authentication            at

17-5-1&Filter=AF-ED-00-29.
4.2. Training Overview.
   4.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the grenade launcher-training
   program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required
   evaluation phases of the AFQC and passing the mechanical evaluations.
   4.2.2. Recurring Training. This is qualification training after initial qualification. It consists
   of classroom instruction, qualification on the AFQC and passing the mechanical evaluations.
   Qualification length of this program is 12 months for all arming Groups.
   4.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. This training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   4.2.4. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units
   to help maintain the grenadier’s proficiency. Units should conduct this training before
   exercises and deployments.
4.3. Instructor Guidelines.
   4.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of the weapons. They will supervise, evaluate and assist trainees during the operator
   maintenance evaluation (care, cleaning and function check). See AFI 36-2226 for student to
   instructor ratios.
   4.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach trainees, as needed, during
   practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire,
   to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To ensure safe range operations, close
   communication is essential between the range safety instructor, tower operator and all firing
   point instructors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   4.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and
   has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training
   sessions. He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the

   grenade range. NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range
   Safety Instructor is not to serve as a firing point instructor in addition to this duty. See AFI
   36-2226 for exceptions.
4.4. Grenade Launcher Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following
paragraphs is intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for
initial and recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth instruction, concentrating on known
problems. Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training
objectives. Approximate training times for this program are:
   4.4.1. For AFQC -- 5 to 6 hours.
   4.4.2. For remedial and unit training -- as required.
4.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and
maintain the capability to use the grenade launcher against enemy targets.
4.6. Training Objectives (AFQC). The training objectives needed for successful completion of
this course are found in Table 4.1.
   4.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       4.6.1.1. Safety procedures.

4.9. Course Information, Grenade Launcher AFQC.
     4.9.1. Targets for the course (Figure 4.4):
        4.9.1.1. Zero panel should be 2-meters by 2-meters (6 feet x 6 feet). Place this target at a
        distance of 200 meters. If the range is already constructed with 150-meter zero targets,
        these may be used instead of reconfiguring the range.
        4.9.1.2. Point target, 1-meter by 1.5-meters (vertical), one meter off the ground, at 90-
        115 meters from the firing line.
        4.9.1.3. Point target, 1.5-meters by 1.5-meters, .5-meter off the ground, at 135-150
        meters from the firing line.
        4.9.1.4. Area target, vehicle, 55 gallon drums, "E" targets, etc., 250-300 meters from the
        firing line.
     4.9.2. Standard: Qualified: 3 hits. Trainees must hit all three targets with one shot each to
     qualify. The maximum score for the evaluation is three TARGETS. In the evaluation phase,
     if a target has been hit prior to the three rounds per position, the student will move to the next
     qualification target and the extra rounds returned to the range ammo custodian. A HIT is any

  round directly striking a point target or a round striking within 5-meters of the center aiming
  point of the area target.
  4.9.3. Course notes:
     4.9.3.1. Trainees must not touch or rest the grenade launcher on the support.
     WARNING: Ensure the rifle/carbine sling does not hang in front of launcher barrel
     and the muzzle is not behind (blocked) by the sandbags or log wall.
     4.9.3.2. Trainees will wear flak vests, grenade vests and helmets during all live-fire
     training.
     4.9.3.3. When possible, trainees should fire using the peer/coach method. They should
     work together on range determination; sight adjustments, lateral distance measurements
     and adjusted aiming point method of firing.
     4.9.3.4. Instructors are to teach trainees, as needed during Phase I. Instructors will
     correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if stoppages occur.
     Trainees must ensure the weapon is at eye level (or approximate) during these procedures
     to ensure their target remains within view.
     4.9.3.5. Before live firing from a new position, give trainees an opportunity to practice
     assuming the position and dry fire from each position. Afford sufficient time for
     instructors to observe, coach and evaluate each trainee. Instructors will evaluate the
     trainee's ability to effectively apply marksmanship fundamentals during Phase II.
     4.9.3.6. To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during
     Phase I.
     4.9.3.7. During Phase I, trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor
     supervision. Instructors will stop the time and supervise trainee actions. Resume the time
     limit once immediate action has been properly performed. WARNING: If a light recoil or
     difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire
     (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     4.9.3.8. Trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision during each
     order of fire in Phase II. Instructors will stop the time, and supervise trainee actions.
     Resume the time limit once immediate action has been properly performed. Give
     additional time to complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or is in the process of,
     successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage. The ultimate
     goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to
     correct the problem and continue firing. WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in
     report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not
     stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     4.9.3.9. Instructors will not teach during the evaluation orders of fire. However, they
     may assist trainees and teach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of fire.
     They will also correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate
     action procedures when applicable.
     4.9.3.10. Eye protection is mandatory for all personnel. Hearing protection is mandatory
     for all personnel, dual hearing protection is required for all Combat Arms personnel
     (unless electronic headsets are being used).

Figure 4.2. Grenade Launcher Prone Supported Position.




         Prone Supported Position. To assume the prone supported position, the shooter first
         assumes the rifle/carbine prone position, adjusts the position to the available support,
         and places the left hand or forearm against the support. Whether the left elbow is
         directly under the weapon is of less importance in this position because the support,
         rather than the arm, sustains the weight of the weapon. No part of the grenade
         launcher or rifle/carbine should be touching the support as this reduces the shooter's
         control of the weapon. The placement of the rifle/carbine stock in the shooter's
         shoulder depends greatly on the distance of the target being engaged. Generally,
         targets engaged at distances greater than 150-meters require the rifle/carbine stock
         being placed low against the shooter's shoulder or on the ground.

     Kneeling Supported Position. The kneeling supported position is particularly
     effective from level ground or ground sloping upward toward the target. A right
     handed shooter assumes the kneeling barricade position by kneeling on the right knee,
     right buttock resting on right heel, left foot forward, and pointed toward the target. The
     shooter leans forward over the left leg, resting the upper part of the left arm on the left
     knee, adjusts the position to the available support, and places the left hand or forearm
     against the support. Whether the shooter's left elbow is directly under the weapon is of
     less importance in this position because the support, rather than the arm, sustains the
     weight of the weapon. No part of the grenade launcher or rifle/carbine should be
     touching the support as this reduces the shooter's control of the weapon. The
     placement of the rifle/carbine stock in the shooter's shoulder depends greatly on the
     distance of the target being engaged. Generally, targets engaged at distances greater
     than 150-meters require the rifle/carbine stock being placed low against the shooter's
     shoulder. This permits the shooter to obtain correct sight alignment and sight picture.

Figure 5.2. Light Anti-armor Basic Standing Positions.




      Basic Standing Position. Raise the launcher slightly higher than shoulder level. Execute a
      left face, rotate your shoulder under the launcher and spread your feet a comfortable
      distance apart. Move your left foot 15 to 24 inches forward, keeping your hips level and
      your weight balanced on both feet. To obtain a firm, stable position; tuck both elbows
      tightly into your body. LAW. Place your non-firing hand about 4 inches from the front of
      the muzzle, with your firing hand on the rear cover. After placing the weapon on your
      shoulder, release the rear cover and place your firing hand on the trigger. Cup the launcher
      in the palm of your non-firing hand. Position your firing eye as close to the rear sight as
      comfortable. AT4. Grasp the sling near the launcher with your left hand and the shoulder
      stop with your right hand. Raise the launcher above shoulder level. After placing the
      launcher on your shoulder, release the shoulder stop and place your right hand on the
      trigger. Place your firing eye 2 ½ to 3 inches from the rear sight.

Figure 5.3. Light Anti-armor Modified Standing Positions.




Modified Standing Position. Use this position when you occupy a fighting position. Assume the
basic standing position, but instead of stepping forward, leans against the back wall of the
fighting position. Ensure the venturi or rear of the weapons extends beyond the rear of the
fighting position.

Figure 5.4. Light Anti-armor Weapon Kneeling Positions.
The basic kneeling position is the best position for tracking moving targets. The modified
kneeling position is best for engaging stationary targets, since it is a supported position.
However, either can be used for stationary or moving targets.

Basic Kneeling Position. Kneel from the basic standing position onto your right knee, keeping
your left thigh parallel to the ground. Rotate your lower right leg 90° to the left. (This removes
your right foot from exposure to the backblast.) Keep your right thigh and back straight and
perpendicular to the ground. Point your left foot in the direction of fire and tuck your elbows into
your sides. Though this is not a supported position, it should be a firm, stable one.




Modified Kneeling Position. From the basic kneeling position, sit back on your right heel. Place
the back of your upper left arm on your left knee, making sure you do not have bone-to-bone
contact between your left elbow and left knee. Keep your right elbow tucked in close to your
side. Use any protective barriers available.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                               97


Figure 5.5. Light Anti-armor Weapon Sitting Positions.
The sitting position is the most stable firing position. In this position, the arms are placed on the
legs for support. Depending on his/her physique, the firer can use either of two versions of the
sitting position. Either is suitable for engaging stationary targets.




Basic Sitting Position. Sit facing the target and spread your feet a comfortable distance apart.
Lean forward and place the backs of your upper arms on your knees, avoiding bone-to-bone
contact.
 98                                          AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012



Modified Sitting Position. From the basic sitting position, cross your ankles for added support.
Raise or lower your knees to adjust for elevation on the target.

Figure 5.6. Light Anti-armor Weapon Prone Position.




Prone Position. The prone position is the most dangerous position due to its proximity to the
ground. Ideally the ground should slope downward from the rear of the launcher. This reduces
the effects of the backblast. Lie on the stomach with the body at a 90° angle to direction of fire,
and with the body and legs to the left of the direction of fire. Unlike other firing positions, this
one prevents placing the launcher on your right shoulder. Instead, hold the launcher in place
against your upper right arm. For stability, apply extra pressure on the firing mechanism with
your right hand. The prone position is the least stable of all firing positions. Instructors must
ensure the body and legs are not in the backblast area. WARNING: FAILURE TO
MAINTAIN A 90° ANGLE FROM THE DIRECTION OF FIRE COULD CAUSE
INJURY OR DEATH TO THE FIRER.

                       SUBMACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

6.1. Submachine Gun AFQC. This course provides the minimum training, Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures and evaluation required to qualify Air Force members with a
submachine gun (not carbines). Qualification is separate for each weapon model, type or system.
Qualification on one weapon does not qualify an individual with the other.
6.2. Training Overview.
   6.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the Submachine Gun
   Training Program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the
   required evaluation phase of the AFQC and passing the mechanical evaluations.
   6.2.2. Recurring Training. This is qualification training after initial qualification. It consists
   of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation phases of the AFQC and
   passing the mechanical evaluations. Qualification length of this program is 12 months.
   6.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. This training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   6.2.4. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units
   to help maintain the individual's proficiency. Units should conduct this training before
   exercises and deployments.
6.3. Instructor Guidelines and Ratios.
   6.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of the weapons. See AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, for instructor to student
   rations. They will supervise, evaluate and help trainees during the operator maintenance
   (care, cleaning and function check).
   6.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, help, coach and teach trainees as needed during
   practice and evaluation phases of fire. Ratio: One instructor per seven trainees for
   semiautomatic fire and one instructor per three trainees for automatic fire.
6.4. Submachine Gun Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following
paragraphs is intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for
initial and recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth, concentrating on known problems.
Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives.
Approximate training times for this program are:
   6.4.1. AFQC training -- 4 to 5 hours.

6.9. Course Information, Submachine Gun AFQC.
     6.9.1. Course Targets. Use the military "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) and
     military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute.
     6.9.2. Course Standards. Qualified: 40 hits. 30 hits must be within the 10-inch (vital area)
     circle of the target.
     6.9.3. Course Notes: Briefcase, courier bag and shoulder harness are used by OSI only.
        6.9.3.1. Before firing the practice phase, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle on the target
        using chalk. The circle must be visible to the shooter at all target distances. The shooter
        will use the circle as a reference point during the practice fire to aid in placing rounds in
        the vital area of the target. Locate the 10-inch circle on the "E" target as shown in Figure
        2.7. Center the circle on the target with the top edge of the circle 13 1/4 inches from the
106                                         AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


      top of the head of the target (even with side cut notches on "E" backers and facers). A
      template can be made of plywood, acrylic plastic, or other material.
      6.9.3.2. Start all orders of fire with the submachine gun with an empty chamber, bolt
      forward, selector in the semiautomatic position and the trigger pulled.
      6.9.3.3. Instructors are to teach or coach trainees as needed during the practice phase.
      Instructors will correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if
      stoppages occur.
      6.9.3.4. Before live firing from a new position, provide trainees an opportunity to
      practice assuming the position and dry fire from each position. For each order of training
      requiring the weapon to be removed from concealment, provide each trainee at least five
      practice runs with an unloaded weapon. Afford sufficient time for instructors to observe,
      coach and evaluate each trainee. Evaluation of the trainee's ability to effectively apply
      marksmanship fundamentals is accomplished during the evaluation phases.
      6.9.3.5. During the practice phase, trainees will clear their own stoppages under
      instructor supervision when the order of fire is completed. WARNING: If a light recoil or
      difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire
      (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
      6.9.3.6. On Practice Order 1, instructors and trainees will check targets after each five-
      round string. Shooters may make additional sight adjustments at anytime during the
      practice orders, as required.
      6.9.3.7. Practice Order 1, 2, 4, and 5 and Evaluation Order 1, 3, and 4 are fired in the
      semiautomatic (R) mode.
      6.9.3.8. On Practice Order 2 through 5 and all evaluation orders, OSI personnel will use
      a courier bag, shoulder harness or briefcase if available. If the shooters are not using
      concealed carry equipment, deduct 5 seconds from Practice Order 2 through 5 and all
      evaluation orders.
      6.9.3.9. On Practice Order 3 and Evaluation Order 2, the shooter will fire a 15-round
      magazine full automatic (A).
      6.9.3.10. Shooters should fire in bursts of two to three rounds.
      6.9.3.11. The over barricade position is a supported position. Trainees may use the
      barricade for support. Reload from behind cover. Do not allow the weapon to touch the
      support.
      6.9.3.12. To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during the
      practice phase.
      6.9.3.13. Repair or replace targets after the practice phase.
      6.9.3.14. Before firing the evaluation phase, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle on the
      target using a pencil or pen so the circle is not visible to the shooter during the evaluation.
      The circle is used for scoring purposes at this point in the course. Give trainees the
      opportunity to view their targets upon completion of the phase so they can see if their
      shots are in and around the vital area of the target.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          107


      6.9.3.15. Instructors will not teach or coach during the evaluation phase. However, they
      may assist trainees and teach or coach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders
      of fire. They will also correct safety infractions and supervise the application of
      immediate action procedures by trainees when applicable.
      6.9.3.16. Reload magazines between orders of fire, as necessary.
      6.9.3.17. Trainees will clear their own stoppages during each order of fire in the
      evaluation phase. Give additional time to complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or
      is in the process of, successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the
      stoppage. The ultimate goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred
      and have the ability to correct the problem and continue firing. WARNING: Trainees
      must understand if a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must
      verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is
      cleared.
      6.9.3.18. Eye protection for instructors is mandatory and is highly recommended for
      trainees. Hearing protection is mandatory for all personnel, dual hearing protection is
      required for all Combat Arms personnel (unless electronic headsets are being used).
      6.9.3.19. Inspect all magazines at the completion of training to make sure they do not
      contain live rounds.

Figure 6.2. Prone Supported Position.




      Prone Supported Position. To assume the prone supported position, the shooter first
      assumes the prone position. The shooter then adjusts the position to the available support,
      placing the support hand and forearm against the support. Whether the left elbow is
      directly under the submachine gun is of less importance in this position because the
      support, rather than the arm, sustains the weight of the submachine gun. No part of the
 108                                         AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


        submachine gun should be touching the support as this reduces the shooter's control of
        the submachine gun and hinders rapid recovery between shots.

Figure 6.3. Standing Shoulder Point and Ready Positions.




       Standing Position. Assume a standing position. Pull the weapon tightly into the shoulder.
       Keep head erect, looking over the top of the sights, eyes on the target, pointing the weapon
       at the target. Lean body forward slightly.
       Standing Ready Position. Assume a standing position. Pull the weapon tightly into the
       shoulder. From the standing position, the shooter lowers the weapon so the entire target is
       visible. Lower the weapon by pivoting at the shoulder, do not bend at the elbows or tuck
       the weapon into the chest to lower the weapon. Shooters must not raise and lower their
       heads to meet the intent of this requirement. Keep the weapon pointed down range and
       maintain eye contact with the target.

Figure 6.4. Strong Side Barricade Standing Position.




      Strong Side Barricade Standing Position. These pictures demonstrate the position once
      the command fire has been given. The starting point for these positions would be a
      standing position behind the barricade, stock in the shoulder, and keeping the shooting
      elbow tucked in close to the body to maintain maximum cover and concealment. Keep
      the muzzle pointed downrange at an approximate 45-degree angle to the target. When
      given the command fire, bring the muzzle up, roll out around the barricade, look through
      the sights and engage the target. After engaging the target, roll back behind the barricade
      and lower the muzzle to an approximate 45-degree angle to the target. The barricade may
      be used for support. During classroom and dry-fire training, students should be
      taught the ―cut the pie‖ method of target engagement.

Figure 6.5. Over Barricade Position.




Over Barricade Position. When the barricade is used for support, rest the supporting forearm or
hand on the barricade. Lower the body by taking a stance with a visible bend in the front leg. To
maintain maximum cover and concealment, the height of the over barricade position should be
no higher than necessary to see and shoot over the barricade. Do not allow any part of the
weapon or magazine to touch the support.

                    M249 AUTOMATIC RIFLE TRAINING PROGRAM

7.1. M249 Automatic Rifle AFQC. This course provides the minimum training, Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures and evaluation required to qualify Air Force members with the
M249. SF personnel will zero and qualify with the actual weapon they will be armed with.
7.2. Training Overview.
7.2. (ACC)Initial and recurring qualification with the M249 should be conducted using full
distance training. 10 meter qualifications will only be used when filling short notice, 30 days or
less, deployment/contingency requirements or when full distance ranges are more than a two
hour drive away (one way.)
   7.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee’s first participation in the M249 Qualification
   Training Program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the
   required evaluation phases of AFQC, and passing the performance tests. Full distance
   (AFQC/FD) training is desired. When full distance range facilities are not available,
   MAJCOMs may grant individual bases permission to qualify personnel using Figure
   7.2 as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M). 37 TRW/CC may grant permission to
   qualify personnel using Figure 7.2 as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) for
   personnel attending technical training courses at Lackland AFB when full distance
   ranges are not available.Personnel who have not qualified on the automatic rifle within 12
   months must requalify using initial training standards. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-
   month qualification.
   7.2.2. Live-fire Recurring Training -- 12 Month. This is qualification training after initial
   qualification. It consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation
   phases of the AFQC (Full Distance or 10-Meter) and passing the performance evaluations.
   Full distance training is desired. Personnel may qualify on either full distance course,
   Figure 7.1 or the 10-meter course, Figure 7.2 to meet training requirements. This
   evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis.
   7.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation. Training is given to all personnel who fail an
   evaluation.
   7.2.4. Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills
   certification. Evaluation is mandatory for initial and 12-month recurring training.
   7.2.5. Unit Training. Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units
   to help maintain the operator’s proficiency. Units should conduct this training before
   exercises and deployments.
7.3. Instructor Guidelines and Ratios.
   7.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of weapons. They will supervise and evaluate trainees during performance
   evaluations. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and assist
 112                                            AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


   trainees during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226 for student to
   instructor ratios.
   7.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach trainees as needed during
   practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire,
   to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To ensure safe range operations, close
   communication is essential between the range safety instructor, tower operator and all point
   instructors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   7.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and
   has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training
   sessions. He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the
   range. NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range Safety
   Instructor is not to serve as a firing point instructor in addition to this duty. See AFI 36-2226
   for exceptions.
7.4. M249 Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs intends to
provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for the initial qualification course
and recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth instruction, concentrating on known
problems. Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training
objectives. Approximate training times for this program are:
   7.4.1. Initial training -- 12 to 14 hours.
   7.4.2. Recurring training (12 month) -- 8 to 10 hours.
   7.4.3. Remedial and unit training -- as needed.
7.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and
maintain the capability to use the M249 against enemy targets. With the exception of operator
maintenance, trainees must perform all evaluated tasks without assistance.
7.6. Training Objectives (AFQC). The training objectives needed for successful completion of
this course are found in Table 7.1.
   7.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       7.6.1.1. Safety rules and procedures.
       7.6.1.2. Characteristics, nomenclature and types of ammunition.
       7.6.1.3. Stoppages and malfunctions.

7.9. Course Information, M249 AFQC (Full Distance).
    7.9.1. Course Targets:
        7.9.1.1. Double "E" silhouette targets (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or empty 55-gallon
        drums may be used to represent personnel for 300 to 800-meter firing. Mounds of earth
        or salvaged vehicles may also be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.
        7.9.1.2. When using silhouettes or 55-gallon drums as area targets, position at least three
        targets within a 5-meter diameter. Leave at least 50-meters between each area target.
    7.9.2. Course Standards: NOTE: If the beaten zone covers the target, score it as a hit.
        7.9.2.1. Order 1 -- Must successfully engage all six targets.
        7.9.2.2. Order 2 -- Must successfully engage all 13 targets.
    7.9.3. Course Notes:
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          119


     7.9.3.1. There are no time limits during the practice phase. Instructors will analyze
     targets, render help to trainees as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise the
     application of immediate action.
     7.9.3.2. Do not use assistant rifleman. Peer coach method is permissible.
     7.9.3.3. Trainees will wear flak vests and helmets during the entire course.
     7.9.3.4. The operator must stow the protective mask in the carrier when not required for
     wear and have the CWDE gloves on their person during the entire course.
     7.9.3.5. Trainees may make sight corrections at any time during the course.
     7.9.3.6. Trainees will do all firing in the bipod mode.
     7.9.3.7. On Practice Order 3, the trainee will engage a minimum of five targets in a deep
     target formation with the 76-round belt, don the protective mask and engage a minimum
     of eight targets in a linear with depth formation with the 100-round belt.
     7.9.3.8. After engaging all point targets on Evaluation Order 1, the operator will
     immediately put the gun on safe, don the protective mask and gloves and engage all area
     targets.
     7.9.3.9. When engaging deep targets and linear with depth targets, the operator will
     engage targets as a single gun covering the entire target. For example, initial lay on the
     linear target with depth is midpoint. The operator then traverses and searches to the near
     flank (left), back to the far flank (right) and then back to midpoint. Initial lay on the deep
     target is also midpoint. The operator then searches down to the near end, up to the far end
     and then back to the midpoint.
     7.9.3.10. Eye and ear protection is mandatory for all personnel.
     7.9.3.11. During Phase I, trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor
     supervision. Resume firing once immediate action has been properly performed.
     WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must
     verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is
     cleared.
     7.9.3.12. Conduct a barrel change before starting Phase II.
     7.9.3.13. Trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision during
     each order of fire in Phase II. Instructors will stop the time and supervise trainee actions.
     Resume the time limit once immediate action has been properly performed. Give
     additional time to complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or is in the process of,
     successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage. The ultimate
     goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to
     correct the problem and continue firing. WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in
     report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not
     stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
     7.9.3.14. Ammunition belts should be divided up to match the required rounds for each
     order of fire. After firing the required number of bursts, trainees may go back (time
     permitting) and reengage targets still posing a threat (i.e., no hits). Rounds may not be
     fired after the cease fire command is given during phase II.

        7.9.3.15. AF Form 522 should only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the
        entire course. If trainees fail to qualify on Evaluation Order 1 or Evaluation Order 2,
        trainees are unqualified. They need only to refire and meet qualification criteria for the
        order they failed to achieve qualified status.

7.10. Course Information, M249 AFQC (10-Meter).
   7.10.1. Course Targets. Use the 10-meter machine gun target (NSN 6920-00-078-5123).
   7.10.2. Course Standards for Phase II Evaluation:
      7.10.2.1. Order 1--All 13 targets must have a minimum of 2 hits per target.
      7.10.2.2. Order 2--All 10 targets must have a minimum of 2 hits per target.
   7.10.3. Course Notes:
      7.10.3.1. There are no time limits during the practice phase. Instructors will analyze
      targets, render help to trainees as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise the
      application of immediate action. The entire course of fire is based on the student’s ability
      to fire a 3 to 5-round burst during training and is used to teach firing discipline and the
      tactical employment of the automatic rifle. In an actual real-world scenario, the shooter
      would continue to fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated
      7.10.3.2. Do not use assistant rifleman. Peer/coach method is permissible.
      7.10.3.3. Trainees will wear flak vests and helmets during the entire course.
      7.10.3.4. The operator must stow the protective mask in the carrier when not required for
      wear and have the CWDE gloves on their person during the entire course.
      7.10.3.5. Trainees may make sight corrections at any time during the course.
      7.10.3.6. Trainees will do all firing in the bipod mode.
      7.10.3.7. Ammunition belts should be divided up to match the required rounds for each
      order of fire. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of
      targets, any remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back
      into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct
      number of rounds fired by the student.
      7.10.3.8. During Phase I, Order 3, the trainee is to practice controlled burst firing while
      applying the basic fundamentals of M249 marksmanship. This exercise gives the
      instructor an opportunity to detect common errors by analyzing each of the four pasters.
      7.10.3.9. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move
      to the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the
      gunner and finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough
      to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.
      Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap while firing. This tactic/technique is used for
      training and simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically
      engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun
      position.
      7.10.3.10. Phase I, Order 5. After engaging both point targets (B5 and B6), the operator
      will immediately put the gun on safe, don the protective mask and gloves and engage the
      linear target with depth (B7 thru B8).
      7.10.3.11. Conduct a barrel change before starting Phase II.
122                                        AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


      7.10.3.12. After completing Phase I, Order 4 and Phase II, Order 1, the firing point
      instructor will give the command ―Gas, Gas, Gas‖ and the gunner will immediately put
      the gun on safe and don the protective mask and gloves. Gunner will then engage targets
      D5 and D6.
      7.10.3.13. During Phase I, trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor
      supervision. Resume firing once immediate action has been properly performed.
      WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must
      verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is
      cleared.
      7.10.3.14. Trainees will clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision during
      each order of fire in Phase II. Instructors will stop the time and supervise trainee actions.
      Resume the time limit once immediate action has been properly performed. Give
      additional time to complete the order of fire if the trainee has, or is in the process of,
      successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage. The ultimate
      goal is for the trainee to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to
      correct the problem and continue firing. WARNING: If a light recoil or difference in
      report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not
      stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.
      7.10.3.15. Eye protection is mandatory for all personnel. Hearing protection is
      mandatory for all personnel. Dual hearing protection is required for Combat Arms
      personnel (unless electronic headsets are being used).
      7.10.3.16. AF Form 522 should only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the
      entire course. If the trainees fail to qualify on Evaluation Order 1 or 2, trainees are
      unqualified. They need only to refire and meet qualification criteria for the order failed to
      achieve qualified status.

      ACC SECURITY FORCES MILITARY WORKING DOG COURSE OF FIRE

A2.1. (ACC) PURPOSE. The primary purpose of this course of fire is to acclimate the
Military Working Dog (MWD) to gun live fire from their handler while employing their assigned
M4 and M9. The secondary purpose of this course of fire is to familiarize the handler with skills
needed to control their MWD while employing their assigned M4 and M9 from different firing
positions. The AFSFC M4 Carbine Instructor Guide and AFSFC Handgun Air Force
Qualification Course Instructor Guide will be used when instructing positions to be used and
transitioning between positions and weapons.
A2.2. (ACC) TRAINING GOAL. Ensure all MWDs are trained to properly react to gun fire
from their handler and for the handler to effectively control their MWD while engaging targets
from varying firing positions with the M4 and M9.
A2.3. (ACC) TRAINING PLAN.
   A2.3.1. (ACC) Instructor Certification: The Combat Arms NCOIC will certify MWD
   instructors as Range Safety Officials (RSO) IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
   This training will encompass safety procedures, MAJCOM/local guidance, proper weapons
   handling,      communication,        movement      techniques, and   safety    officer
   procedures/responsibilities as outlined in AFI 36-2226.
   A2.3.2. (ACC) This course of fire will be conducted as part of the MWD team’s unit level
   proficiency/sustainment training between 5 to 7 months after each 12 month live fire M4
   qualification. This training does not take the place of the AFSFC mandated Shoot, Move and
   Communicate training. This is an additional course the MWD team must conduct during this
   time frame.
   A2.3.3. (ACC) MWD Range Safety requirements.
       A2.3.3.1. (ACC) Instructor ratios. During all live fire a 2:1 instructor to student ratio
       will be used. Specifically, one Combat Arms instructor and one wrap certified MWD
       instructor to one MWD team at all times while on the fixed firing line. The Combat
       Arms instructor’s main focus is weapons safety and observing the handler while firing.
       The MWD instructor’s main focus will be MWD team safety and to take control of the
       MWD in the event it should become aggressive. The MWD Instructor will control the
       MWD within 1 meter of the handler, on the correct side and in the heel or down position.
       As a minimum, one range safety officer must be present on the range at all times while
       firing is being performed. The range safety officer must be able to monitor all firing that
       is being conducted on the range.
       A2.3.3.2. (ACC) MWD Instructors will provide handlers training on how to dual tether
       their MWD. The MWD Instructor will be tethered to the choke chain and the handler
       will be tethered to the collar. If the MWD becomes unmanageable the handler will
       release the MWD and the Instructor will take control of the MWD.
       A2.3.3.3. (ACC) If a MWD gets loose or bites, the CEASE FIRE command will be
       given. All weapons firing will stop and weapons will be made safe. The MWD
       instructor will take control the MWD while the handler makes their weapon safe and then
 138                                       AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


       secures their MWD before firing continues. The assistance of additional MWD handlers
       and/or MWD instructors will be based on the behavior of the MWD.
       A2.3.3.4. (ACC) If a MWD becomes highly aggressive during firing, the handler will
       release their leash and the MWD Instructor will walk the MWD off the line to an area
       where the MWD is stress free, a minimum of 50 meters from the firing line. The handler
       will complete firing the phase of fire and then take control of their MWD.
       A2.3.3.5. (ACC) All MWDs identified by handlers or instructors as highly aggressive
       will be muzzled during firing for safety of all personnel on the firing line. The final
       decision to muzzle the MWD will be made by the senior MWD instructor present.
       A2.3.3.6. (ACC) If a MWD is uncontrollable, the handler will be instructed to walk the
       MWD off the firing line to an area where the MWD is stress free, a minimum of 50
       meters. Another MWD from the next relay will then be moved up into this position. If
       the removed MWD can be calmed down and returned to training, it will be placed into
       the last relay of firing, based on the decision of the senior MWD instructor present.
       A2.3.3.7. (ACC) MWD instructors determine what level of distraction techniques to
       employ during the course of fire with all handlers.
       A2.3.3.8. (ACC) MWD Instructors will determine when and if the MWD team is
       allowed to move forward from one phase to the next phase of fire.
   A2.3.4. (ACC) Document initial RSO certification training on AF Form 797, Job
   Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, in AFTR.
   A2.3.5. (ACC) RSO certification will be valid for the period of 12 months. Certification
   will expire the last calendar day of the month. Document all annual RSO recertification on
   AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, utilizing AFTR.
A2.4. (ACC) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. Students receiving training must be currently
qualified on the M9 Pistol and M4 Carbine. Additionally:
   A2.4.1. (ACC) Students will receive classroom instruction and demonstration of individual
   and MWD team movement tactics and communications required for the course.
   A2.4.2. (ACC) Students will be provided a safety briefing prior to live firing on the range.
   A2.4.3. (ACC) Students will conduct dry fire drills practicing all the skills presented during
   this course of fire to include loose dog/bite procedures prior to live firing.
   A2.4.4. (ACC) Combat Arms and MWD instructors will demonstrate the entire MWD
   course of fire to the students.
   A2.4.5. (ACC) MWD teams will be required to have the following equipment prior to being
   allowed to participate in this course of fire.
       A2.4.5.1. (ACC) Two 6 foot leashes.

A2.5. (ACC) Order of Movement. To ensure the MWD is properly acclimated to live fire,
they will be staged behind the firing line at the specified distances while the course of fire is
demonstrated by Combat Arms and MWD instructors. Once the demonstration is completed, the
first MWD team(s) will move up to the firing line and subsequent relays will be staged.
   A2.5.1. (ACC) MWD Teams will be staged as follows:
       A2.5.1.1. (ACC) Phase I of firing: MWD teams will be 35 meters behind the firing
       line.
       A2.5.1.2. (ACC) Phase II of firing: MWD teams will be 25 meters behind the firing
       line.
       A2.5.1.3. (ACC) Phase III of firing: MWD teams will be 15 meters behind the fixed
       firing line.
   A2.5.2. (ACC) Upon completion of Phase III of the demonstration, the first relay will move
   to the firing line and prepare to fire the course. The MWD instructors will dual tether to the
   MWD allowing the handler to fire using their assigned weapons.
   A2.5.3. (ACC) The second relay MWD team will stage for Phase I firing at 35 meters and
   advance toward the firing line as shown in paragraph A2.5.1. for each phase of fire.
   Subsequent relays will stage and advance in the same manner.
   A2.5.4. (ACC) Upon completion of the course of fire, the MWD instructor will un-tether
   and the MWD team will exit the firing range to a stress free area.
A2.6. (ACC) Course Notes.
   A2.6.1. (ACC) All training will be demonstrated by Combat Arms and MWD instructors
   and practiced through dry-fire by the MWD team prior to conducting practical evaluations.
   A2.6.2. (ACC) Performance evaluations will be conducted prior to live-fire training. MWD
   teams must pass performance evaluations by moving from the M9 standing to kneeling, M9
   kneeling to prone, M4 standing to kneeling, M4 kneeling to prone and transition from the M4
   to their M9 a minimum of three times for each task. MWD teams will not advance to live
   fire until they have successfully passed all performance evaluations.
   A2.6.3. (ACC) Throughout this training, safety is paramount and must be the primary
   concern of all personnel. This course of fire involves MWDs and special safety
   considerations will need to be observed while on the firing line. Therefore, all personnel
   whether it’s a student or an instructor, will utilize all weapons and MWD safety precautions
   during this course of fire.
   A2.6.4. (ACC) Targets for course: The Military "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874)
   and Military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute. At a
   minimum, targets should have a 10-inch chalk circle drawn in the vital area (thoracic cavity)
   and a 6-inch chalk circle drawn in the head, following the guidance for Handgun AFQC
   targets outlined Chapter 2. If the range being used does not accommodate firing at both 7
   and 15 meters, one military E target with two 10-inch circles drawn side by side on the target
   may be used at 7 meters.
   A2.6.5. (ACC) All M9 orders of fire will start with the weapon secured in the holster.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                       141


  A2.6.6. (ACC) All M4 orders of fire will start from the low ready position.
  A2.6.7. (ACC) The MWD will always be located on the correct side of the handler.
     A2.6.7.1. (ACC) When the handler is firing from the standing position the MWD will
     be in the standing position parallel to the handlers on the correct side.
     A2.6.7.2. (ACC) When the handler is in the kneeling or prone position the MWD will
     be in the down position parallel to the handlers on the correct side.
  A2.6.8. (ACC) Phase I: Initial Acclimation. The purpose of this phase of fire is to allow
  the MWD instructor and handler to observe the MWD for adverse reactions to life fire while
  engaging enemy threats. During and after each order of fire the MWD instructor will assess
  the MWD and give the Combat Arms tower official the OK to proceed to the next order of
  fire.
     A2.6.8.1. (ACC) Order 1 - M9 Pistol: This order of fire will allow the MWD to slowly
     acclimate to pistol fire. From the standing position the handler will engage a 15 meter
     target with 4 rounds fired in 1 shot strings. The handler will pause slightly between shots
     to observe the reactions of the MWD.
     A2.6.8.2. (ACC) Order 2 - M9 Pistol: This order of fire is used to acclimate the MWD
     to multiple pistol rounds being fired by the handler. From the standing position the
     handler will engage a 15 meter target with 6 rounds fired in 2 shot strings. The handler
     will pause slightly between strings to observe the reactions of the MWD.
     A2.6.8.3. (ACC) Order 3 - M4 Carbine: This order of fire will allow the MWD to
     slowly acclimate to carbine fire. From the standing position the handler will engage a 15
     meter target with 5 rounds fired in 1 shot strings. The handler will pause slightly
     between shots to observe the reactions of the MWD.
     A2.6.8.4. (ACC) Order 4 - M4 Carbine: This order of fire is used to acclimate the
     MWD to multiple carbine rounds being fired by the handler. From the standing position
     the handler will engage a 15 meter target with 9 rounds fired in 3 round bursts. The
     handler will pause slightly between bursts to observe the reactions of the MWD.
     A2.6.8.5. (ACC) If the MWD performs satisfactorily during Phase I, they will be
     advanced to Phase II.
  A2.6.9. (ACC) Phase II: Practice - Position Acclimation: The purpose of this phase of fire
  is to allow the MWD instructor and handler to observe the MWD for adverse reactions to the
  handler moving into various positions while engaging enemy threats with live fire. During
  and after each order of fire the MWD instructor will assess the MWD and give the Combat
  Arms tower official the OK to proceed to the next order of fire. During Phase II, orders 1
  through 5, the handler and MWD will start in the required position and fire the order. During
  and after each order of fire the reaction of the MWD will be continually assessed.
  A2.6.9.1. (ACC) Order 1 - M9 Pistol: Starting from the interview stance with a secured
  pistol, the handler will upon command fire two rounds at the 7 meter target and then assume
  a high kneeling position and fire two rounds at the 15 meter target within a 10 second time

        ACC SECURITY FORCES SPECILIAZED PISTOL COURSE OF FIRE

A3.1. (ACC) PURPOSE. The purpose of this course of fire is to provide ACC SF Airmen
with advanced pistol handling and movement skills while employing their assigned weapon from
varying firing positions. The AFSFC Handgun Air Force Qualification Course Instructor Guide
will be used when instructing positions to be used.
A3.2. (ACC) TRAINING GOAL. Ensure SF Airmen are capable of employing their weapon
from varying firing positions and during periods of limited visibility.
A3.3. (ACC) TRAINING PLAN.
   A3.3.1. (ACC) Instructor Certification: The Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure all assistant
   instructors and range block officials are certified IAW AFI 36-2226. This training will
   encompass safety procedures, local guidance, proper weapons handling, communication,
   movement techniques, safety officer procedures/responsibilities, and being qualified on the
   course of fire.
   A3.3.2. (ACC) ACC SF Airmen who have the M9 pistol assigned as a prior or secondary
   duty weapon will fire this course as part of their unit level sustainment training program
   required by AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.
   A3.3.3. (ACC) Throughout this course of fire the skills presented in the AFSFC handgun
   instructor guide must be reinforced. As an example, instructors must stress that after the
   student engages their target they must ―scan and sweep‖ the area before they holster their
   weapon. This allows the student to assess the situation for any further threats prior to
   securing their weapon. When conducting failure to stop exercises, instructors must stress that
   after the student ―double taps‖ the target they must pause to assess the situation before
   deciding to take a lethal head shot.
   A3.3.4. (ACC) During all orders of fire where the student will be required to move or turn
   with a loaded weapon, they will dry fire it until block officials are confident their students
   can safely conduct the order.
   A3.3.5. (ACC) During contact right and left orders, the student will start with a loaded and
   secured weapon. Once all weapons are secured in the holster, the students will be given a
   command to turn in the appropriate direction. For contact right the students will be facing the
   low numbered end of the firing line. For contact left the students will be facing the high
   numbered end of the firing line. On the command of ―CONTACT‖ the student will pivot in
   the appropriate direction, draw their weapon and engage the correct target. Once they have
   completed the order they will remain facing their target until directed to move into the next
   position.
   A3.3.6. (ACC) Prior to conducting contact front training, the students will be taught how to
   properly move forward and to the rear in accordance with the AFSFC handgun instructor
   guide. During contact front orders, the student will start with a loaded and secured weapon.
   Once all weapons are secured in the holster, the students will be given a command to move
   back to the ready line using proper movement. The student will start from the interview
   stance. On the command of ―CONTACT‖, the student while moving forward to the firing
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                            145


      line, will draw their weapon, assume the correct firing position for the order and engage their
      target. Instructors must stress that the student must not put their finger on the trigger until
      they are in position and ready to engage their target. Once they have completed the order
      they will remain facing their target until directed to move into the next position.
A3.4. (ACC) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. Personnel firing this course must be currently
qualified on the M9 Pistol. Additionally:
      A3.4.1. (ACC) As an Academic Bypass option, Combat Arms may forego classroom
      training on the skills required for this course for personnel who successfully complete
      performance evaluations shown in Table A3.1.

A3.5. (ACC) Course Notes.
   A3.5.1. (ACC) All orders of fire will be dry fire demonstrated by Combat Arms prior to
   students live firing of the order. Students will be given the opportunity to dry-fire the order
   prior to live firing.
   A3.5.2. (ACC) Targets for course: The Military "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874)
   and Military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute. At a
   minimum, targets should have a 10-inch chalk circle drawn in the vital area (thoracic cavity)
   and a 6-inch chalk circle drawn in the head, following the guidance for Handgun AFQC
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                         149


  targets shown in Chapter 2. If the range being used does not accommodate firing at both 7
  and 15 meters, one military E target with two 10-inch circles drawn side by side on the target
  may be used at 7 meters.
  A3.5.3. (ACC) Phase I - Practice. The purpose of this phase of fire is to acclimate the
  student to live fire.
     A3.5.3.1. (ACC) Order 1 - Slow Fire: This order of fire will allow the student to
     become familiarized with the sighting and trigger squeeze needed for their pistol. From
     the standing position, depressed ready, on command the student will engage a 7 meter
     target with 1 round. Upon firing the round the student will scan the area, decock their
     pistol, and holster. This should be done instinctively by the student. This order will be
     repeated four more times for a total of five rounds being fired.
     A3.5.3.2. (ACC) Order 2 - Slow Fire: This order of fire will allow the student to
     become familiarized with the sighting and trigger squeeze needed to fire multiple rounds
     from their pistol. From the standing position, depressed ready, on command the student
     will engage a 7 meter target with all 5 rounds. Upon firing the last round the student will
     scan the area, decock their pistol, and holster. This should be done instinctively by the
     student.
  A3.5.4. (ACC) Phase II - Practice - Threat Engagement Techniques. The purpose of this
  phase of fire is to teach the student how to apply immediate action, remedial action, how to
  fire pairs, how to fire with their strong and weak hands, engage multiple threats and how to
  discriminate between targets.
     A3.5.4.1. (ACC) Order 1 - Ready - Immediate Action. This order of fire will require
     the use of two dummy and six live rounds randomly loaded in the student’s magazine.
     The dummy rounds should not be loaded as the first round or loaded successive. Students
     or instructors should load the magazines for this order and then pass them to the student
     next to them, so the student receiving the magazine will not know where the dummy
     rounds are in the load. The order of fire will start with the student with a loaded weapon
     in the ready position. On the command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖ the student will fire two
     rounds at the lethal area of the target at 7 meters. If the weapon fails to fire, due to a
     stoppage or dummy round, the student must apply immediate or remedial action and
     continue to fire until they have fired their two rounds. Both rounds must be fired within
     the six second time limit. Students may be granted pro-rated time if the stoppage was
     beyond their capability to correct within the time limit. After firing their second round,
     the student will scan the area, decock their pistol, and resume the ready position. This
     order will be repeated two more times for a total of six rounds being fired.
     A3.5.4.2. (ACC) Order 2 - Pairs. This order of fire will require the student to fire
     controlled pairs starting from the ready position. On the command of ―CONTACT
     FRONT‖, using a flash sight picture, the student will fire two rounds at the lethal area of
     the target at 7 meters within four seconds. After firing their second round, the student will
     scan the area, decock their pistol, and resume the ready position. This order will be
     repeated two more time for a total of six rounds being fired.
     A3.5.4.3. (ACC) Order 3 - Pairs. This order of fire will require the student to fire
     controlled pairs starting from the interview stance with a secured holster. On the
150                                         AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012


      command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the student will draw their weapon and using a flash
      sight picture, fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 7 meters within six
      seconds. After firing their second round, the student will scan the area, decock their
      pistol, holster and secure it. This order will be repeated two more times for a total of six
      rounds being fired.
      A3.5.4.4. (ACC) Order 4 - Strong Hand. This order of fire will require the student to
      fire controlled pairs starting from the interview stance with a secured holster using only
      their strong hand. On the command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the student will draw their
      weapon and using a flash sight picture, fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 7
      meters within six seconds. After firing their second round, the student will scan the area,
      decock their pistol, holster and secure it. This order will be repeated one more time for a
      total of four rounds being fired. After firing the second string, the student will accomplish
      a strong hand reload prior to holstering their weapon.
      A3.5.4.5. (ACC) Order 5 - Weak Hand. This order of fire will require the student to fire
      controlled pairs starting with a secured holster using only their weak hand. On the
      command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the student will draw their weapon and using a flash
      sight picture, fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 7 meters within eight
      seconds. After firing their second round, the student will scan the area, decock their
      pistol, holster and secure it. This order will be repeated one more time for a total of four
      rounds being fired. After firing the second string, the student will accomplish a weak
      hand reload prior to holstering their weapon.
      A3.5.4.6. (ACC) Order 6 - Multiple Threats. This order of fire will require the student
      to engage multiple targets at 7 meters and 15 meters. Prior to conducting this order of
      fire, students will be directed to position themselves within their firing position so they
      can see both their 7 meter and 15 meter targets. Block officials will verify the student is
      standing properly within their firing position to ensure fired rounds will not strike other
      targets or objects on the range that could produce a hazard. The order of fire will start
      with the student in the interview stance with a secured holster. On the command of
      ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the student will draw their weapon and fire two rounds at the
      lethal area of the target at 7 meters, immediately transition to the 15 meter target and fire
      two rounds at the lethal area of the target, then fire a failure to stop round at the six inch
      head area of the target at 7 meters all within six seconds. After firing the failure to stop
      round, the student will scan the area, decock their pistol, holster and secure it. This order
      will be repeated one more time for a total of ten rounds being fired.
      A3.5.4.7. (ACC) Order 7 - Threat Discrimination. This order of fire will require the
      student to identify a ―hostile‖ target to their right or left before firing. This order of fire
      will require the student to turn 90 degrees to engage the correct target. Prior to
      conducting these orders of fire, students will be directed to position themselves within
      their firing position so they can see both their 7 meter and 15 meter targets. Block
      officials will verify the student is standing properly within their firing position to ensure
      fired rounds will not strike other targets or objects on the range that could produce a
      hazard. As this order will require movement with loaded weapons, range officials will
      ensure the students dry fire this order prior to live fire.
AFMAN36-2227V1_ACCSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2012                                                          151


         A3.5.4.7.1. (ACC) The first three strings of fire will require the student to turn to
         their RIGHT to engage targets. Once weapons have been loaded, they will be
         holstered and secured. The student will then be directed to turn to their left facing the
         low numbered end of the range. Starting from the interview stance with a secured
         holster, the command ―CONTACT RIGHT‖ and then the target number to engage
         will be given. The student will turn and engage their target with two rounds. After
         firing the second round, the student will scan the area, decock their pistol, holster and
         secure it. Once all weapons are secured, students will be directed to turn to their left,
         facing the low numbered end of the range. This portion of the order of fire will be
         repeated two more time for a total of six rounds being fired.
         A3.5.4.7.2. (ACC) The second three strings of fire will require the student to turn to
         their LEFT to engage targets. Once weapons have been loaded, they will be holstered
         and secured. The student will then be directed to turn to their right facing the high
         numbered end of the range. Starting from the interview stance with a secured holster,
         the command ―CONTACT LEFT‖ and then the target number to engage will be
         given. The student will turn and engage their target with two rounds. After firing the
         second round, the student will scan the area, decock their pistol, holster and secure it.
         Once all weapons are secured, students will be directed to turn to their right, facing
         the high numbered end of the range. This portion of the order of fire will be repeated
         two more time for a total of six rounds being fired.
     A3.5.4.8. (ACC) If multiple relays will be firing this order of fire, it is recommended
     the order in which the targets are called be alternated, so the student cannot know which
     target will be called. As an example, if the first relay fired at target #1 at 7 meters target
     and then at target #2 at 15 meters target, the second relay should fire first at target #2 at
     15 meters and then at target #1 at 7 meters. For this order the student will be firing a total
     of six rounds at 7 meters and six rounds at 15 meters.
     A3.5.4.9. (ACC) To conserve targets, it is recommended all hits on the 15 meter target
     be marked or patched and the target be reused during Phase IV evaluation.
  A3.5.5. (ACC) Phase III - Practice - Tactical Movement Techniques. The purpose of this
  phase of fire is to teach the student how to move to cover while drawing their weapon and
  engaging targets. The range should be configured to allow the maximum amount of
  movement safely able to be performed. As a minimum, the students will be positioned at the
  ready line and on command move forward to the appropriate firing position. The students
  will walk through and dry fire each order prior to live fire.
     A3.5.5.1. (ACC) Order 1 - Kneeling. This order will start from the interview stance,
     with a loaded and secured weapon. Upon the command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the
     student will quickly move forward to their barricade and assume a kneeling position and
     the student will fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 25 meters within six
     seconds. After firing their second round, the student will scan the area, decock their
     pistol, and holster their weapon. This order will be repeated one more time for a total of
     four rounds being fired. Students will not move back to ready line until directed by the
     tower official.
     A3.5.5.2. (ACC) Order 2 - Standing to Kneeling. This order will start from the
     interview stance, with a loaded and secured weapon. Upon the command of ―CONTACT

      FRONT‖, the student will quickly move forward to their barricade and from the standing
      position fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 25 meters. After firing their
      second round, the student will immediately assume a kneeling position and fire two more
      rounds at the lethal area of the 25 meter target, all within an eight second time limit. After
      firing their second round from the kneeling position, the student will scan the area,
      decock their pistol, and holster their weapon. This order will be repeated one more time
      for a total of eight rounds being fired. Students will not move back to the ready line until
      directed by the tower official.
      A3.5.5.3. (ACC) Order 3 - Over Barricade. This order will start from the interview
      stance, with a loaded and secured weapon. Upon the command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖,
      the student will quickly move forward to their barricade and assume an over barricade
      position and fire two rounds at the lethal area of the target at 25 meters within six
      seconds. After firing their second round, the student will scan the area, decock their
      pistol, and holster their weapon. This order will be repeated one more time for a total of
      four rounds being fired. Students will not move back to the ready line until directed by
      the tower official.
      A3.5.5.4. (ACC) Order 4 - Prone. This order will start from the interview stance, with a
      loaded and secured weapon. Upon the command of ―CONTACT FRONT‖, the student
      will quickly move forward, assume a prone position and fire two rounds at the lethal area
      of the target at 25 meters within eight seconds. After firing their second round, the

         officials will verify the student is standing properly within their firing position to
         ensure fired rounds will not strike other targets or objects on the range that could
         produce a hazard. The student will then be directed to turn to their left facing the low
         numbered end of the range. Starting from the interview stance with a secured holster,
         the command ―CONTACT RIGHT‖ and then the target number to engage will be

         cannot know which target will be called. As an example, if the first relay fired at
         target #1 at 7 meters target and then at target #2 at 15 meters target, the second relay
         should fire first at target #2 at 15 meters and then at target #1 at 7 meters. For this
