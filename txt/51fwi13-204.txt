This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic, Airfield,
Airspace and Range Management. This instruction directs procedures to be used for airfield
operations activities at Osan AB and defines requirements and responsibilities of support
agencies for services required and provided. This instruction combines various directives, which
affect the entire Air Traffic Control (ATC) system at Osan AB, into one document common to
all users and service agencies. The procedures and instructions are directive for all assigned base
and partner units and aircrews, but are not intended to supplant good judgment in the interest of
flight safety. Deviations are authorized only when directed by ATC, Airfield Management
(AM), or in emergency situations where adherence would jeopardize safe aircraft operations. It
applies to all personnel assigned to the 51st Fighter Wing (51 FW), at Osan Air Base (AB).

       2.5.5.3. Command Post will notify the Theater Air Control Center (TACC), 51 OG/CC,
       and 51 FW/CC of the lighting failure.
       2.5.5.4. RAPCON will notify adjacent facilities and affected aircraft of the lighting
       failure.
2.6. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of Airfield. The West end of runway (EOR) pad
is closed to all aircraft for daily operations. It may is authorized for use only during surge
operations in support of wartime/contingencies and exercises with PACAF/CV temporary waiver
approval. The current temporary waiver approval letter is maintained in the Airfield Manager’s
office.
   2.6.1. The following procedures will be applied during operations at the West EOR:
 16                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


      2.6.1.1. This area can be used A-10s or F-16s (depending upon a pavement evaluation by
      the Airfield Manager and with concurrence of the 51 OG/CC) while supporting wartime,
      contingency, or exercise operations. Due to the possibility of overflight, this area will not
      be utilized during TWY F Alternate Landing Site (ALS) operations.
      2.6.1.2. This area will only be used when the field is visual meteorological conditions
      (VMC).
      2.6.1.3. The primary use for this area is a holding area for aircraft recovery during surge
      operations. This will alleviate numerous aircraft in TWY A arm/dearm area, TWY B,
      and TWY B1.
      2.6.1.4. If it appears that a lengthy delay will occur prior to hot pit refueling or takeoff,
      pilots wanting to use this area will request it through Ground Control. The tower
      supervisor and the SOF will agree to use before allowing aircraft into the area.
      2.6.1.5. If any aircraft are parked on the West EOR pad, the two spots farthest from the
      runway in TWY A arm/dearm area can only be used for parking. If an aircraft with
      forward firing ordnance is pointing at another aircraft, it will not be armed or dearmed.
      2.6.1.6. Operations flow for takeoff. Aircraft will arm in their spots prior to taxiing. For
      runway 09, if there is a large build up of aircraft at the EOR, West EOR pad can be
      requested for holding. Enter and take the western-most spot and face north. Taxi out via
      the western-most taxi lines for takeoff.
      2.6.1.7. Operations flow for landing. Aircraft will land and proceed to normal
      arm/dearm areas. If aircraft can go directly to cursory, they will request via ground
      control. If they must hold prior to cursory, marshalling areas are as follows: F-16 normal
      arm/dearm area, Door Stop. A-10s normal arm/dearm area, West EOR pad. TWY B1
      and B can be used if other areas are full.
   2.6.2. Due to deteriorating pavement, towlane Golf is closed to all taxing/towing operations
   except U-2 towing operations.
2.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS).
   2.7.1. Configuration.
      2.7.1.1. RWY 09 and 27 are both equipped with unidirectional E-5 cables located 50ft
      into each overrun. Each RWY is also equipped with bidirectional Barrier Arresting Kit
      (BAK)-12 arresting cables located 1,350ft and 2,700ft from RWY threshold ends.
      2.7.1.2. All BAK-12 barriers will have eight-point tie downs when in the raised position.
      Barriers and cables are numbered, west to east, from one to six. Refer to attachment 2.
      2.7.1.3. The minimum time to configure the barriers for an approach-end engagement is
      10 minutes.
      2.7.1.4. When practical, pilots must advise ATC of all intended barrier engagements to
      include the specific barrier desired.
   2.7.2. Normal AAS Configuration for RWY in Use. The departure end E-5 and both
   departure end BAK-12s will be raised and the approach end cables will be down/removed.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                17


  The SOF may direct a temporary change in barrier configuration when required for safety of
  flight or operational contingency.
  2.7.3. U-2 Operations. Aircraft operations may be conducted before and after a U-2
  ―Priority‖ departure or arrival with only one departure end BAK-12. Barrier configuration
  will be returned to normal as soon as traffic permits. Additionally, Tower will advise
  departing aircraft of any nonstandard cable configuration (i.e., only one departure end BAK-
  12 available). The SOF will ensure a departure end BAK-12 is operational prior to resuming
  aircraft operations with AAS requirements. Operations may continue without the departure
  end BAK-12 with 51 OG/CC approval.
     2.7.3.1. AAS Procedures During U-2 ―Priority‖ Operations:
         2.7.3.1.1. RWY 27 operations shall have cable 3 removed. RWY 09 operations shall
         have cable 4 removed. The 5 RS will advise Tower when the cables need to be
         configured differently.
     2.7.3.2. When AAS configuration is other than described in para 2.7.2, Tower will
     advise all landing aircraft and AMOPS. This requirement is met for landing aircraft
     when this information is included in the ATIS broadcast, and the pilot states the current
     ATIS code.
  2.7.4. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). BAK-12 equivalent MAAS can be
  installed on TWY F approximately within four hours of request. Concrete cruciform
  foundations have been installed at the 6,000ft marker located at the TWY F/B intersection.
  2.7.5. AMOPS      will   temporarily     suspend     RWY      operations    during     AAS
  maintenance/configuration changes.
     2.7.5.1. Tower will notify AMOPS prior to any AAS maintenance/configuration change
     and confer with AMOPS on suspension of RWY operations. Once operations are
     suspended, Tower will provide AMOPS immediate access to the RWY during/after AAS
     maintenance/configuration change.
     2.7.5.2. When AMOPS suspends RWY operations, a suspension announcement will be
     accompanied with the time RWY operations are expected to resume. AMOPS will
     complete an airfield check and report the airfield status/RWY condition prior to resuming
     operations. AMOPS will notify Tower when RWY operations resume.
  2.7.6. AAS Maintenance.
     2.7.6.1. 51 CES BM section maintains AAS from 0700-1700L, Monday thru Friday.
     The AAS will be checked at least once daily and repeated during periods of heavy traffic.
     After landings on the approach end cable by C-130 or heavier aircraft, BM will perform a
     check of the AAS cables. BM will use the following phraseology when reporting the
     barrier status: ―operational‖ or ―not operational.‖ BM will provide indoctrination
     training on location, capabilities, and procedures to ATC and AMOPS personnel.
     2.7.6.2. The Fire Department assumes responsibility for raising and lowering the barriers
     after normal duty hours, on weekends, and on holidays. The SOF/Tower WS (Watch
     Supervisor) will ensure Barrier Maintenance was contacted to recertify AAS after the
     runway reconfiguration changes.
 18                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


       2.7.6.3. BM will notify AMOPS whenever a maintenance condition exists that could
       render an AAS unusable and when any of the following conditions exist:
          2.7.6.3.1. No spare tapes or cables are on hand for the BAK-12 or E-5 systems.
          2.7.6.3.2. Four or fewer engagements remain prior to tape and/or cable replacement
          for the BAK-12 or E-5 systems.
       2.7.6.4. When an AAS is determined to be unusable, AMOPS will NOTAM the system
       out of service and notify all appropriate agencies (i.e., Tower, SOF, flying units, etc.).
2.8. Parking Plan/Restrictions.
   2.8.1. Parking Apron Responsibility.

      West EOR, aircraft shall broadcast on Ground Control frequency, ―(call sign), GOLF
      EAST.‖
   2.17.2. Arrivals.
      2.17.2.1. After exiting the RWY and clearing/dearming (if required), aircraft shall
      request taxi clearance to parking.
      2.17.2.2. When returning to parking in the Draggins Lair or A Diamond, aircraft shall
      broadcast on Ground Control frequency, ―(call sign), ALPHA SOUTH.‖
   2.17.3. Alternate Taxi Procedures. If TWY A is not available, 51 FW fighter aircraft may
   use alternate taxi procedures through B Diamond (and A Diamond depending on the reason
   TWY A is unavailable) during exercises and contingency operations upon request to Ground
   Control. Pilots will state call sign, entry point, direction of taxi, and exit point.
Example: ―HOG 01, TAXIWAY FOXTROT TO THE BRAVO DIAMOND NORTHEAST
LEG, CLOCKWISE TO THE DRAGGINS LAIR‖.
   2.17.4. Hover Maneuvers. Helicopters shall contact Ground Control for hovers and taxi
   below 10ft. Helicopters shall remain over hard-surfaced TWYs when they hover taxi to and
   from parking, landing, or takeoff areas.
      2.17.4.1. Contact Tower for clearance prior to conducting hover maneuvers above 10ft.
      High hover maneuvers will be conducted on the RWY, hot cargo area, or along TWY F
      (when approved by Tower).
      2.17.4.2. Tower may approve high hovering at TWY C helipad or TWYs A, B, D if they
      do not conflict with arriving or departing aircraft using the RWY.
2.18. Airfield Maintenance.
   2.18.1. Osan RWY is closed every 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month from 2300Z (0800L)
   to 0800Z (1700L) for preventive maintenance, repair, rubber removal, and painting. Local
   flying organizations (e.g., Aero Club and 5 RS) requiring use of the RWY during the
   scheduled closures will coordinate with airfield management for use.
   2.18.2. Sweeper Operations. 51 CES/CEO will provide a dedicated airfield sweeper to
   immediately respond to the airfield during wing flying and accomplish airfield sweeping in
   accordance with procedures listed in the Airfield Sweeper Memorandum of Agreement
   maintained in the Airfield Managers office.
   2.18.3. Mowing Operations. The normal mowing season is between March and October.
   Mowing operations are conducted by 51 CES/CEO. Airfield grass height will be maintained
   between 7 and 14 inches. Mower operators must check in with AMOPS prior to starting
   airfield mowing operations each day. AMOPS will notify the appropriate agencies where
 22                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   mowing operations will be accomplished. All mower operators will then call Tower prior to
   mowing within the CMA.
2.19. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and Runway Condition Reading (RCR)
Values. AMOPS will conduct RSC and RCR checks based on current meteorological conditions
and when breaking reports require, or at SOF/pilot request. The RSC can be reported as wet,
dry, or slush, ice or snow on the runway. The RCR is reported when Osan has snow or ice
conditions. Results of these checks will be reported to appropriate wing agencies for
dissemination to aircrews. AMOPS is responsible for determining and reporting RSC/RCR as
required IAW AFI 13-204V3, T.O. 33-1-23, Equipment and Procedures for Obtaining Runway
Condition Readings, and applicable OPLANS.
2.20. Runway Inspection/Check Procedures and Requirements.
   2.20.1. AMOPS will accomplish an airfield inspection daily prior to the start of flying
   activities. Additional airfield inspections will be accomplished as needed IAW AFI 13-
   204V3.
   2.20.2. Airfield Checks. AMOPS will conduct the following specific airfield checks:
       2.20.2.1. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
       Checks. FOD and BASH checks will be accomplished daily before flying activities
       begin and throughout the days as required.
       2.20.2.2. Airfield Lighting Serviceability. This check will be completed between the
       hours of official sunset and sunrise. Deficient lighting systems will be immediately
       published as a NOTAM and appropriate agencies will be notified.
       2.20.2.3. In-flight and Ground Emergency Checks. Procedures for these checks are
       outlined in paragraph 6.2.5.
2.21. Engine Test/Run-Up Procedures. Maintenance personnel requesting engine starts for
maintenance shall contact Ground Control and maintain radio surveillance until engine run is
complete (see Table 2.2 for engine run areas). Additionally, MOCC will notify AMOPS and
security forces as required.
   2.21.1. TA will brief aircrews, flight engineers, and/or maintenance crews on local run
   requirements and assist in coordinating run spot clearances.
       2.21.1.1. Aircraft aircrews, flight engineers, and/or maintenance teams will post safety
       observers to prevent ground vehicles from entering the engine blast area.
       2.21.1.2. On-speed engine runs (no higher than idle power) may be accomplished on
       AMC parking spots after coordination between AMOPS, TA, and 731 AMS/AMCC.
2.22. Noise Abatement Procedures. Quiet hours are 1300Z to 2100Z (2200L to 0600L) daily.
During quiet hours, nonessential aircraft operations are prohibited. Essential aircraft operations
are restricted per the following guidelines:
   2.22.1. A-10 engine runs greater than 85% RPM within the 3d generation hardened aircraft
   shelters (HASs,), FLOWs, revetments, or Trim Pad require 51 OG/CC approval. Engine runs
   within the Hush House do not require 51 OG approval.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                        23


       2.22.1.1. F-16 engine runs greater than idle power within the HAS, FLOWs, revetments,
       or Trim Pad require 51 OG approval. Engine runs within the Hush House do not require
       51 OG approval.
       2.22.1.2. U-2 engine runs up to 87% RPM can be conducted on the 5 RS ramp with
       thrust deflectors and do not require 51 OG approval. Engine runs above 87% will be
       conducted on the trim pad and require 51 OG approval.
2.23. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas. The Precision Approach Critical Areas
shall be protected IAW Federal Aviation Administration requirements (see Attachment 2).
Tower will broadcast on the ATIS when approach critical area (localizer and/or glide slope)
procedures are in effect.
   2.23.1. Localizer Critical Area.
       2.23.1.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800ft and/or visibility is less than 2
       miles, all aircraft and vehicle operations will be restricted from the localizer critical area.
       Vehicles or aircraft will not be permitted to transit the localizer critical area when an
       aircraft on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach is inside the final approach fix
       (FAF). Exception: A preceding aircraft, approaching the same RWY or another RWY,
       may pass through the area while landing, departing, or exiting the RWY; do not allow
       aircraft to stop within the critical area.
       2.23.1.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 200ft and/or Runway Visual Range
       (RVR) 2,000ft or less (1/2 mile if no RVR), aircraft or vehicle operations will not be
       authorized in the area when an arriving aircraft is inside 1 Nautical Mile (NM) from
       touchdown.
   2.23.2. Glide Slope Critical Area.
       2.23.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800ft and/or visibility is less than 2
       miles, but at or above 200ft and/or visibility at or above ½ mile (RVR 2,400), all aircraft
       larger than fighter type size will be prohibited from taxiing beyond the instrument hold
       line (on Hot Cargo Pad) when an aircraft is executing an ILS approach and inside the
       FAF.
       2.23.2.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 800ft and/or visibility less than 2 miles,
       restrict all vehicles. Vehicles escorting (i.e., launch essential vehicle, mission support
       vehicle and EOR vehicle) the fighter type size aircraft under the conditions of 2.23.2.1
       are authorized to proceed into the glideslope critical area with the aircraft (aircraft tows
       are not authorized). Do not permit vehicles to proceed beyond the instrument hold line
       when an aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside the FAF, unless the arriving aircraft
       has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land on another runway.
       2.23.2.3. When the reported ceiling is less than 200ft and/or visibility is less than ½ mile
       (RVR 2,400), all aircraft and vehicles will be prohibited from taxiing beyond the
       instrument hold line (on Hot Cargo Pad) when an aircraft is executing an ILS approach
       and is inside the FAF.
       2.23.2.4. The southern half of the Hot Cargo Pad encroaches on the RWY 09 glide slope
       critical area. Tower will notify AMOPS and RAPCON when aircraft are parked in the
 24                                                        51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


       southern half of the Hot Cargo Pad. RAPCON shall turn off the RWY 09 glide slope.
       AMOPS shall initiate a NOTAM.
Note: Aircraft parked on the northern half of the Hot Cargo Pad do not interfere with the RWY
09 glide slope if their total wingspan is 144ft or less when parked on designated taxi line.
   2.23.3. Precision Obstruction Free Zone (POFZ) and Obstacle Clearance Surfaces (OCS)
   (See Attachment 2)
       2.23.3.1. The POFZ shall be protected when the reported ceiling is less than 300 ft
       and/or visibility is less than 3/4 miles (or RVR less than 400 ft/1200 meters).
       2.23.3.2. The OCS shall be protected when the reported ceiling is less than 800 ft, the
       visibility is less than 2 miles, and an aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside of 2
       miles from runway threshold.
       2.23.3.3. When conditions in para 2.23.3.1. and/or 2.23.3.2 are present, Tower shall
       advise taxiing aircraft to not utilize the 3 eastern most spots at East EOR (RWY 27 in
       use) or the 2 most northern spots at West EOR (RWY 09 in use. Tower will also notify
       AMOPS and make a blanket broadcast over the ramp net for men/equipment to exit the
       closed EOR spots. AMOPS will initiate the NOTAM closing the spots.
2.24. Restricted Areas on the Airfield. Osan AB has the following restricted areas: 5 RS, A
and B Diamonds to include Draggins Lair, the Flows, and the Service Apron between A and B
Diamonds. Additionally, the following areas are designated restricted areas when they are
occupied by protection level 3 (PL 3) aircraft: Hot Cargo Pad, AMC , Door Stop, and AMOPS
ramps. Restricted areas are marked by red lines with white borders and warning boxes every
100ft. Note: The AMOPS Ramp does not have restricted area markings; PL3 aircraft parked
here will be roped off by security forces.
2.25. Runway Suspension Procedures. AMOPS will temporarily suspend RWY operations
and send appropriate NOTAMs anytime an unsafe condition affects the airfield (i.e., dropped
objects, liquid spills, etc.). AMOPS will complete a runway check and report status of the RWY
to Tower prior to resuming operations.
2.26. Airfield Opening and Closure Procedures.
   2.26.1. Airfield closures less than 96 hours are at the discretion of the 51 FW/CC. Closures
   exceeding 96 hours require MAJCOM/A3 approval IAW AFI 13-204V3.
   2.26.2. During approved airfield closure periods, ATC, AMOPS, and Weather facilities will
   remain staffed and responsible for their respective obligations (unless otherwise approved by
   51 OG/CC). Additionally, the following procedures will occur:
       2.26.2.1. Tower will notify AMOPS upon completion of wing flying operations and/or
       last aircraft engine termination.
       2.26.2.2. AMOPS will notify Tower that the airfield is closed and Tower will make an
       announcement of closure on all frequencies.
       2.26.2.3. AMOPS will notify CP of airfield closure and other base organizations as
       required.
   2.26.3. Opening Procedures.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     25


       2.26.3.1. Prior to re-opening the airfield following an approved closure, AMOPS will
       conduct an airfield inspection and inform Tower the airfield is open when it is deemed
       the airfield is suitable for aircraft operations.
       2.26.3.2. Tower will announce over all frequencies that the airfield is open.
2.27. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Parking Plan. IAW UFC 3-260-01, when AGE
equipment is not in use, it must be removed from the aircraft parking area and stored in areas that
do not violate aircraft clearance requirements or other imaginary surfaces. However, AGE can
be pre-positioned 3 hours prior and left 3 hours after use, but then must be relocated to
appropriate storage locations. This criterion applies to parking aprons only. AGE cannot be left
or stored on TWY edges.
2.28. Alternate Landing Site (ALS) Operations.
   2.28.1. If Runway 09/27 is rendered unusable, the 51 OG/CC, designated representative, or
   higher authority may authorize Taxiway Foxtrot’s use as an ALS to recover and launch Osan
   AB assigned fighter aircraft only. This option is to be used only during exercises,
   contingencies and emergency situations and should be maintained in a manner similar to an
   Alternate Contingency Runway.
Note: The ACR requirements pertained in AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, are not levied
upon the ALS.
       2.28.1.1. All intersections to Taxiway Foxtrot, will be blocked by Security Forces. Once
       activated, Taxiway Foxtrot and its driving lanes become a controlled movement area.
Note: “Activation” occurs the moment the 51 OG/CC, designated representative, or higher
directs the set-up of Taxiway Foxtrot as an ALS. The ALS will be considered “secured” by
AMOPS once it is ready to safely conduct takeoffs and landings.
       2.28.1.2. Securing the ALS should take approximately thirty minutes without installing
       the Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS) or Mobile Aircraft Arresting System
       (MAAS).
   2.28.2. Procedures for ALS:
       2.28.2.1. The 51 OG/CC or designated representative will notify the Tower to activate
       the ALS.
       2.28.2.2. Upon notification, the Tower will advise the SOF and activate the Primary
       Crash Alarm System (PCAS). AMOPS will then notify RAPCON, CP, Weather, Barrier
       Maintenance, Airfield Lighting, MOCC and SFS to implement applicable ALS checklists
       via Secondary Crash Net (SCN). Tower will also notify 51 FW Emergency Ops Center
       (784-9770) and inform them of intent to utilize ALS operations.
           2.28.2.2.1. CP will ensure appropriate ALS notification is placed on the
           Commander’s Access Channel.
           2.28.2.2.2. CP will announce activation of ALS via the Giant Voice system. The CP
           will announce: “Real World, Taxiway Foxtrot is now the primary landing surface,
           Real World.”
 26                                                       51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


      2.28.2.3. SOF will inform all fighter squadrons to brief ALS taxi/in-flight procedures en
      mass and at step briefs.
      2.28.2.4. MOCC will inform all airfield supervisors of ALS activation.
      2.28.2.5. Transient Alert will coordinate removal of all aircraft on Cargo Aprons A and
      B.
      2.28.2.6. During ALS activation, Base Weather notify ATC and provide wind
      information as ―wind data estimated‖ to the ATCT and other appropriate agencies as
      required.
   2.28.3. Set-up.
      2.28.3.1. AMOPS will inspect Taxiway Foxtrot for debris, security emplacement, and
      aircraft arresting system configuration for aircraft operations. They will coordinate for
      the Airfield Sweeper to standby or direct sweeping operations as necessary.
      2.28.3.2. SFS will deploy personnel to assigned blocking positions and upon arrival
      immediately stop all traffic from entering the ALS unless authorized by ATC.
Note: SFS will allow AMOPS and CES personnel associated with ALS set-up, to proceed onto
the ALS.
      2.28.3.3. OG/CC or higher authority may authorize CES to install the MAAS and/or the
      EALS. During exercises, these actions may be simulated and CES will notify the ATCT
      upon completion of install. Taxiway lighting is the only permanent lighting available for
      Taxiway Foxtrot unless an EALS is installed.
      2.28.3.4. AMOPS personnel are the final authority for determining if the ALS is FOD
      free, that all access points are blocked, that the BAK-12/MAAS/EALS are properly
      configured, and that all aircraft are off Cargo Aprons A/B. Once complete, AMOPS will
      notify the ATCT that the ALS is ―secured‖ and ready to conduct aircraft takeoffs and
      landing.
      2.28.3.5. Upon notification from AMOPS that the ALS is ―secured‖, the Air Traffic
      Control Tower (ATCT) will notify the 51 OG/CC or designated representative.
   2.28.4. Operations
      2.28.4.1. Entrance into the ALS will be authorized only by ATC. Access to the driving
      lane will be only in direct support of ALS ops. All other vehicle traffic will use access
      roads between the diamond areas. Aircraft towing on Foxtrot will only occur in direct
      support of current wing flying.
Note: Due to manpower limitations AMOPS cannot support blocking entrances to Foxtrot.
Security Forces must secure the positions during the entire ALS operation.
      2.28.4.2. Emergency Response Vehicles: Fire Trucks, Ambulance, Security Forces,
      Airfield Management Operations, and EOD will follow normal active runway access
      procedures when responding to an actual emergency, and may access the ALS at any
      point with prior approval from the ATCT.
   2.28.5. Air Traffic Control Procedures:
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                  27


     2.28.5.1. VFR approaches utilize normal VFR entry procedures (pattern altitude is
     1,700’ MSL).
     2.28.5.2. Pilots will fly to initial to the runway in use, then break in the appropriate
     direction and report right/left base to the ALS.
     2.28.5.3. Pilots conducting IFR approaches to runway 27/09 shall execute local climbout
     procedures (para 5.7.) if they don’t have the airfield environment in sight by the missed
     approach point.
     2.28.5.4. Aircraft conducting a low approach or landing on ALS will not receive a
     clearance. ATCT will use the following phraseology: “(aircraft call sign), low
     approach/landing will be at your own risk.”
     2.28.5.5. Taxiway F is only 75’ wide. Landing area is east of the intersection of
     Taxiway Alpha west of Taxiway Echo. There are no landing thresholds.
     2.28.5.6. A MAAS cable arresting system is east of taxiway B1, but may be set up in
     various locations depending on the situation.
     2.28.5.7. After aircraft rollout and depending on landing direction, aircraft can expect to
     exit towards the flows or Alpha diamond (back taxing if necessary).
 28                                                        51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


                                          Chapter 3

                                  LOCAL FLYING AREAS

3.1. General Description of Local Terrain and Obstructions. The Minimum Safe Altitude
(MSA) within 25 nautical miles (NM) of Osan is 3,400ft MSL and the Emergency Safe Altitude
(ESA) within 100 NM is 6,600ft MSL. Within 3 NM of Osan AB, hills rise to 650ft above the
field elevation of 40ft MSL. Terrain elevations rise to 4,800ft within 100 NM to the east and up
to 5,200ft within 100 NM to the south-southeast.
3.2. Local Flying Area.
   3.2.1. Airspace within the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) is designated as
   the local flying area.
   3.2.2. Osan Flight Training Center (FTC). A 50 NM radius (25 NM for student pilots)
   centered on Osan extending south of Osan’s extended runway centerline and a quarter circle
   northwest of extended runway centerline (Attachment 12).
3.3. Designation of Airspace.
   3.3.1. Osan Approach Control airspace is delegated by Incheon Air Traffic Control Center
   (ACC) and is depicted in Attachment 6. For specific lateral/vertical parameters, see letter of
   agreement between Korean Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime (KMLTM) and 51
   OG entitled, Air Traffic Control Coordination Procedures.
Note: Osan Approach cannot provide approach control service to aircraft outside its delegated
airspace.
   3.3.2. Osan Tower is designated Class D airspace from the surface to 2,200ft MSL within a
   5 NM radius of the airport, excluding that portion overlapped by Suwon’s Class D airspace
   (see Attachment 5.
3.4. Areas of Potential Conflict. Airspace surrounding Osan is very congested with the
following areas noted specifically:
   3.4.1. Suwon Air Base. The base conducts high-density fighter aircraft (ROKAF F-4 and F-
   5) operations.
       3.4.1.1. IFR arrivals to Suwon are on a track that crosses RWY 27’s final approach
       course 5 NM east of Osan at 3,200ft MSL. Aircraft on the Hi-TACAN approach to
       Suwon RWY 33L cross the Osan final approach course at 3,400ft MSL.
       3.4.1.2. Aircraft recovering to or departing from Osan VFR shall avoid Suwon’s Class D
       airspace, which is a 5 NM radius of the SWN TACAN with altitudes from the surface up
       to and including 4,000ft AGL (4,100ft MSL).
   3.4.2. Desiderio Army Airfield (AAF)/A511 (Camp Humphreys). Aircraft recovering to or
   departing from Osan VFR shall avoid the Desiderio AAF/A511 Class D airspace, which is a
   5 NM radius off the Osan Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio Range Tactical Air
   Navigation Aid (VORTAC/VOR) (minus that portion overlapped by the Osan Class D
   airspace) with altitudes from the surface up to 3,000ft AGL (3,100ft MSL).
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                29


   3.4.3. Gimpo/Incheon International Airports. Class B airspace surrounds Gimpo/Incheon
   Airports. Additionally, aircraft recovering to Osan VFR from the northeast through the
   southeast, outside of 20 NM, should use extreme caution for numerous civilian air carrier
   aircraft being sequenced into Gimpo/Incheon Airports. These aircraft will be located in the
   vicinity of G585, altitudes ranging from 3,400ft MSL to Flight Level (FL) 240.
   3.4.4. Airway Traffic. Aircraft operating VFR, south of Osan’s extended RWY centerline
   above 9,000ft MSL should use caution for civilian air carrier aircraft departing from or
   arriving into Gimpo/Incheon Airports. These aircraft are usually in the vicinity of SOT R-
   193 (B576), SOT R-143 (A582) at altitudes FL 150 to FL 300.
   3.4.5. Helicopters. The Seoul-Busan Expressway is used by VFR helicopters operating at or
   below 500ft AGL. They pass 5 NM east of Osan at or below 500ft AGL and may conflict
   with aircraft on final approach to RWY 27.
   3.4.6. Area Lights. There is a lit bridge 3/4 NM final and lit road 1.5 NM east and 1/4 NM
   south of the approach end of RWY 27. These lights may be mistaken at night and during
   conditions of inclement weather for RWY approach lights.
   3.4.7. Seosan Air Base (Haemi Approach). Haemi Approach controls altitudes from 700ft
   AGL to FL 140, 35 NM southwest of Osan. Haemi controls high-density military and
   civilian aircraft operations. Aircraft departing or recovering from the south through
   southwest should use caution for numerous aircraft recovering to Seosan.
   3.4.8. I-Chon (I-Chon GCA/Solar Tower). I-Chon GCA controls altitudes up to 3,500ft
   MSL, 15 NM east, northeast of Osan. Aircraft recovering at low altitudes from the east,
   northeast should use caution for numerous helicopter operations in the VFR/IFR GCA

4.2. VFR Arrivals and Traffic Patterns (Attachments 5-7).
   4.2.1. General Procedures.
        4.2.1.1. Initial Contact Information. Aircraft will contact Osan Approach with the
        following information: call sign, type and number of aircraft, position, altitude, ATIS
        code, and intentions (i.e., MUSTANG 1, FLIGHT OF 4 F-16s, 20 MILES EAST,
        INFORMATION ALPHA, VIPER FOR INITIAL).
        4.2.1.2. Sequencing. 51 FW aircraft shall establish communications with Osan
        Approach not later than 20 NM from Osan AB and can expect flight following, traffic
        information, and (if required) vectors for sequencing in order to establish an efficient
        flow into the airfield. Sequencing may also be accomplished visually by aircrews.
        Aircrews can expect a frequency change to Tower after calling traffic to follow in sight,
        or when traffic to follow is no factor.
        4.2.1.3. Airspeeds. VFR aircraft inbound to Osan should not exceed 300 knots (with the
        exception of Tactical Recovery Plans (TRP)) within 20 miles of the airfield. When
        aircraft are clear of traffic or inside the VFR entry point, they may accelerate to
        appropriate tactical speed.
   4.2.2. VFR Reporting Points (see Attachment 7).
        4.2.2.1. VFR Entry Points. The primary entry points for VFR arrivals shall be HAWG
        (069/12.54) and VIPER (121/11.94) for RWY 27 and BRIDGE (235/12.58) and
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    31


     RACETRACK (297/10.73) for RWY 09. Aircraft will remain on RAPCON’s frequency
     (Channel 15) until the VFR entry point. Aircraft will arrive over the VFR entry point at
     2,500ft MSL, unless assigned a different altitude by ATC, and auto-push to Channel 3
     and contact Tower. Upon initial contact with Tower, state call sign, type and number of
     aircraft, position and intentions. Phraseology: ―OSAN TOWER, VADER1, 2 F-16s,
     HAWG, INITIAL, FULL STOP‖.
     4.2.2.2. Re-Entry Points. ROAD (R-132/6.23) and WAREHOUSE (R-232/6.06) shall be
     used as the primary re-entry points for the pattern. These points are for aircraft already
     operating in Tower’s airspace. Aircraft that are instructed/requesting to re-enter from an
     option approach will maintain at or below 1,200ft MSL until the departure end of the
     runway, then execute a south turn to the re-entry ground track via POWER PLANT to
     ROAD/WAREHOUSE, climbing to 1,700ft MSL. (Phraseology: ―VIPER1, ON THE
     GO, RE-ENTER, INITIAL/STRAIGHT-IN‖. Tower’s response of ―VIPER1, REPORT
     ROAD/WAREHOUSE‖ is clearance for the aircrew to execute the re-entry pattern.
     Within 1 NM of reaching ROAD/WAREHOUSE, aircraft will notify Tower of their
     location, state type approach and landing requested. Phraseology: ―VIPER1, ROAD,
     INITIAL/STRAIGHT-IN, FULL STOP‖.
  4.2.3. VFR Holding Procedures. Aircraft shall hold at the VFR holding points (HAWG R-
  069/12.54, VIPER R-121/11.94, BRIDGE R235/12.58, RACETRACK 297/10.73) when
  instructed by Tower/Approach or when requested by pilot and approved by Tower/Approach.
  When instructed to hold at a holding point, aircraft shall:
     4.2.3.1. Hold north of HAWG and RACETRACK, and south of BRIDGE and VIPER,
     right turns, 5-mile legs.
     4.2.3.2. Maintain altitude as assigned by Tower/Approach. (Note: Tower will normally
     instruct aircraft to maintain an ―at or below/above‖ altitude to allow the aircraft
     maneuverability to maintain VFR conditions. Example: ―HOLD OVER VIPER,
     MAINTAIN AT OR BELOW TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED‖.
  4.2.4. Overhead Patterns. Weather Minimums: 3,000ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility
  (2,200ft/3 for restricted overhead). Pattern altitude is 1,700ft MSL. Breaks are to the north
  for both RWYs (RWY 27-right break, RWY 09-left break). Unless instructed to ―BREAK
  MIDFIELD/DEPARTURE END/ONE MILE PAST DEPARTURE END/etc,‖ aircraft shall
  break at approach end (first 3,000ft).
     4.2.4.1. Entering via HAWG, VIPER, BRIDGE or RACETRACK.                        Aircraft will
     maintain 2,500’ MSL until 6 DME, then descend to 1,700ft MSL.
     4.2.4.2. Re-entering via ROAD/WAREHOUSE. Aircraft will report 1 NM prior to
     ROAD/WAREHOUSE at 1,700ft MSL with intentions, then execute a 90 degree turn to
     initial. After clearing final, aircraft will then execute a 45 degree turn and proceed to a 3
     NM initial.
         4.2.4.2.1. Tower will not allow an aircraft to depart the re-entry point once an SFO
         aircraft has called high key and approved for the procedure. Tower may ask the re-
         entry aircraft to extend downwind and report 6 NM initial (traffic permitting) or hand
         the aircraft off to RAPCON for sequencing through the VFR entry point.
32                                                          51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


     4.2.4.3. Restricted Overhead. Weather Minimums: 2,200ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility.
     Aircraft may recover to the pattern via a VFR straight-in from the VFR entry points or an
     instrument approach. Aircraft may request the closed or re-entry pattern; straight-in
     approaches from re-entry pattern will not be approved. A maximum of 4 aircraft are
     allowed in the restricted overhead pattern. If the pattern becomes saturated, Tower will
     ask the aircraft to land or coordinate for local climb out back to radar.
  4.2.5. Rectangular Patterns (see Attachment 6):
     4.2.5.1. Non-fighter type aircraft may be directed to a left or right-hand traffic pattern for
     either RWY, maintaining a pattern altitude of 1,200ft MSL.
     4.2.5.2. Closed Traffic Pattern. Tower approval is required before initiating a closed
     traffic pattern. Closed traffic pattern for non-fighter type fixed wing aircraft is 1,200ft
     MSL and 1,700ft MSL for fighter type aircraft. Aircraft will maintain at or below 1,200ft
     MSL until crossing the departure end of the RWY to protect the overhead pattern.
     Aircraft may request present-position closed traffic, and if approved by Tower, the
     1,200ft MSL altitude restriction is deleted. Tower may also initiate present-position
     closed traffic. Fighter aircraft will begin descent on turn to base and intercept final at or
     below 1,200ft MSL to ensure separation from aircraft enroute to initial. When on the go,
     aircraft shall request closed with the Tower and state the type landing (Phraseology:
     ―VADER1, ON THE GO, REQUEST CLOSED, FULL STOP‖). Tower will either
     approve or disapprove the request based on traffic. If disapproved, aircraft can either
     expect to re-enter or be handed off to Osan Approach for re-sequencing (Phraseology:
     ―VADER1,         LEFT/RIGHT         CLOSED       TRAFFIC        APPROVED,         REPORT
     DOWNWIND/BASE‖               or     ―VADER1         UNABLE         CLOSED,         REPORT
     WAREHOUSE/ROAD or (direction of flight), CONTACT APPROACH CH15 FOR
     RESEQUENCING.‖
  4.2.6. VFR Straight-In. Weather minimums are 1,700ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility. Aircraft
  requesting a VFR straight-in can expect to be sequenced in front of or behind aircraft on
  instrument approaches, sequenced in front of or behind additional VFR straight-in traffic, or
  be overtaken by aircraft enroute to initial.
     4.2.6.1. Entering via HAWG, VIPER, BRIDGE or RACETRACK. Aircraft will cross
     the VFR entry point at 2,500ft MSL and fly a descending, dead reckoning course to be at
     1,200ft MSL at 6 NM straight-in final. Aircraft will configure and report ―Gear Down‖
     on final.
     4.2.6.2. Re-entering from ROAD/WAREHOUSE. Aircraft will report 1 NM prior to
     ROAD/WAREHOUSE at 1,700ft MSL with intentions, then execute a descending turn to
     arrive at 6 NM final at 1,200ft MSL. Aircraft will configure and report ―gear down‖ on
     final.
  4.2.7. Tactical Recovery Procedure (TRP).
     4.2.7.1. Low TRP. Weather Minimums: A-10, 1,500ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility. F-
     16, 3,000ft ceiling and 5 SM visibility. Once approved for the Low TRP, proceed to the
     VFR entry point at 2,500ft MSL. Depart the VFR entry point flying a dead-reckoning
     heading to 6NM straight-in final, descending to 500ft AGL (A-10s may accelerate to
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     33


       350 knots and F-16s to 400 knots after departing the VFR entry point or as approved by
       Osan Approach or Tower). Report ―GEAR DOWN‖ and intentions to Tower at 3 DME.
       4.2.7.2. High TRP. Weather Minimums: A-10, +500ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility. F-
       16, +500ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility. Request ―HIGH TRP‖ on initial contact with
       RAPCON and specify entry altitude (at or below 9,500ft MSL). Once approved, proceed
       directly overhead Osan. Call tower 30 seconds out and expect approval (REPORT
       BASE/CONTINUE) or instructions to hold at altitude with tower. Report ―OVERHEAD
       HIGH TRP‖ and begin a max of one 360 degree turn to arrive at a normal 1,700ft MSL
       base position north of the field and roll out on final at or below 1,200ft MSL to ensure
       separation from the Overhead Pattern. Patterns may be flown south of the field with
       tower approval. Flight members maintain normal pattern spacing and remain within 3
       NM of the airfield. At the perch, report ―LEFT/RIGHT BASE,‖ with gear and intentions.
       Phraseology (pilot): ―APPROACH, VENOM 2, REQUEST HIGH TRP AT 6,500‖.
       Phraseology (approach): ―VENOM 2, APPROVED AS REQUESTED/AT (alt),
       CONTACT TOWER‖.
Note: Simultaneous High TRP, SFO and/or High Tactical Departure Operations will not be
authorized. Exception: High TRP or High Tactical Departures may be approved below SFO
aircraft who are instructed to hold at High Key and traffic information is exchanged and
acknowledged.
          4.2.7.2.1. TRP Holding. Hold south of Osan at the RAPCON assigned altitude.
   4.2.8. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Procedures (see Attachment 9). SFO weather minimums
   are 1,000ft ceiling above high key (IAW FAAO JO 7610.4, Special Operations) and 5 NM
   visibility. F-16 SFO overhead pattern will be limited to four aircraft at a time. When
   subsequent aircraft are requesting SFO approaches, succeeding aircraft shall report preceding
   aircraft enroute to (or established at) High Key in sight.
       4.2.8.1. Tower will not allow an SFO aircraft to depart high key with an aircraft between
       the re-entry point and base. In addition, Tower will not allow an aircraft to depart the re-
       entry point once an SFO aircraft has called high key and is approved for the procedure.
       Tower may instruct the re-entry aircraft to extend downwind and report 6 NM initial
       (traffic permitting) or hand the aircraft off to RAPCON for sequencing through the VFR
       entry point.
       4.2.8.2. Tower will not allow an SFO aircraft to depart high key when another aircraft is
       between 9 and 2 NM final regardless of approach flown. (i.e. overhead, straight-in, or
       instrument approach)
4.3. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures. RSRS shall be applied IAW
AFI 13-204V3 and the Joint Letter of Agreement on RSRS at PACAF bases for Non-USAF
aircraft. See tables 4.2 and 4.3 below for applicable separation standards.

4.4. VFR Go-Around/Carry Through/Break-out Procedures.
   4.4.1. Go-Arounds. Aircraft will climb straight ahead or as directed by the Tower (i.e., GO
   AROUND RIGHT/LEFT SIDE). Aircraft will maintain at/below 1,200ft MSL until the
   departure end of the RWY and follow Tower instructions to execute closed traffic, execute
   re-entry pattern, or depart Class D airspace.
      4.4.1.1. If there is a conflict between an aircraft on the go and an aircraft carrying
      straight through initial, Tower will instruct the aircraft on-the-go to ―MAINTAIN
      RUNWAY HEADING‖, until the traffic is insight and visual deconfliction can be
      maintained.
     Phraseology (tower): VIPER1, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, TRAFFIC IS AN F-
     16 CARRYING STRAIGHT THROUGH FOR RE-ENTRY.
     Phraseology (pilot): VIPER1, VISUAL THE TRAFFIC.
     Phraseology (tower): VIPER 1, MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION FROM THAT
     TRAFFIC, RE-ENTER, REPORT ROAD/WAREHOUSE.
   4.4.2. Carry Through. When instructed to ―CARRY THROUGH‖, aircraft enroute to initial
   for the overhead shall maintain 1,700ft MSL, unless otherwise directed, fly directly over the
   runway without breaking, and, at departure end, execute the re-entry pattern. Note: Flight
   leads are expected to split their formation to execute the re-entry pattern. A 2-ship formation
   is the maximum size formation in the re-entry pattern. Phraseology: ―VIPER1, CARRY
   THROUGH, REPORT ROAD/WAREHOUSE‖.
 36                                                          51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.4.3. Breakout (standard overhead). If a breakout from the perch is initiated by Tower or
   the pilot because of a traffic conflict, pilot will turn away from the runway, climb to 2,500ft
   MSL, and deconfigure the aircraft. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM of the airfield, proceed
   to the departure end of the runway and follow the re-entry pattern ground track at 2,500ft
   MSL. At the re-entry point, aircraft will turn after clearance from Tower and descend to
   1,700ft MSL. Aircraft will maneuver to arrive at a 3 NM initial.
   Phraseology (tower): ―VIPER1, BREAKOUT (traffic)‖.
   Phraseology (pilot): ―VIPER1, BREAKING OUT‖.
   Phraseology (tower): ―VIPER 1, REPORT 3NM INITIAL/ MAINTAIN 2,500 MSL,
   PROCEED DIRECT (re-entry point) AND CONTACT ARRIVAL ON CHANNEL 15‖.
   4.4.4. Breakout (restricted overhead). If a breakout from the perch is initiated by Tower or
   the pilot because of a traffic conflict, pilot will maintain 1,700ft MSL, deconfigure the
   aircraft, and accelerate to pattern speed. Pilot will either be instructed to report 3 NM initial
   or be handed off to RAPCON for sequencing through HAWG or RACETRACK.
       4.4.4.1. If directed to report 3 NM initial, aircraft will continue straight ahead, clear the
       initial ground track, and execute a 180 degree turn to the south in order to arrive at 3 NM
       initial.
       4.4.4.2. If directed to report HAWG or RACETRACK, aircraft will maintain 1,700ft
       MSL, proceed to the VFR entry point and contact Osan Approach (Channel 15) for
       sequencing into the pattern.
4.5. Restricted Low Approach. Tower may clear aircraft for an altitude-restricted low
approach in lieu of the requested type of landing. Tower shall state the reason for the altitude-
restricted low approach and instruct the aircraft to maintain at or above 550ft MSL (or 1,050ft
MSL for heavy type aircraft). Aircraft must maintain at or below 1,200ft MSL until crossing the
departure end of the RWY for protection of the Overhead Pattern.
4.6. VFR Departures. Aircraft requesting a VFR departure will notify Ground Control when
commencing taxi and provide the type service requested, direction of turnout, direction of flight,
and type formation (standard or nonstandard). Note: To the maximum extent possible, aircraft
will contact Osan RAPCON upon departure for basic radar services while flying VFR within
Osan's terminal control area.
   4.6.1. Aircraft will maintain a safe airspeed and altitude (at or below 1,200ft MSL) and fly
   RWY heading until passing the departure end overrun.
   4.6.2. Traffic permitting, Tower will approve requests for turns prior to reaching the airfield
   boundary (i.e., tactical departure procedures). Aircraft will remain at or below 1,200ft MSL
   until crossing the departure end of the RWY and clearing the VFR downwind.
   4.6.3. Helicopters will remain at or below 500ft AGL until clear of Class D airspace.
Note: The last element of a nonstandard formation flight will squawk normal to aid radar
identification.
   4.6.4. Low Tactical Departure. Request LOW TAC DEPARTURE (direction), (type of
   formation) on initial contact with Ground Control. At the departure end overrun, maintain
   500ft AGL and turn to the requested direction while clearing for threats and accelerating.
   Proceed to the nearest VFR entry point while staying low to deconflict from arriving traffic
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                  37


   at 2,500 ft MSL. Notify Tower when exiting the Class Delta airspace.          Contact Osan
   Approach or Cobra as required.
   4.6.5. High Tactical Departure. Request HIGH TAC DEPARTURE (direction), (altitude),
   (type of formation) on initial contact with Ground Control. Expect to be switched to
   Departure Control prior to being cleared for take-off, for traffic advisory service. (Note:
   Ground Control will coordinate with RAPCON for release). At the departure end over-run,
   clear for threats and execute a spiraling climb remaining within 3 NM and south of the
   airfield until reaching the appropriate altitude at or below 6,500ft MSL or as directed by
   ATC. Once at requested altitude, notify RAPCON who will terminate radar service (after
   giving any necessary traffic calls) and approve frequency change to adjacent ATC facility or
   621 ACS (Cobra). If the SFO pattern is active or High Tactical Recoveries are in progress,
   High Tactical Departures may be capped at an altitude below the lowest aircraft in the SFO
   or High TRP pattern.
   4.6.6. VFR Downwind Departure. Request DOWNWIND DEPARTURE on initial contact
   with Ground Control. At departure end, turn to enter a north downwind to exit the area to the
   northeast or northwest.
4.7. Intersection Departures. The tables below depict feet available for intersection departures
performed by fixed wing aircraft and are permitted upon pilot request or may be suggested by the
Tower.

4.8. Helicopter Operations (see Attachment 6). Helicopters will not overfly base housing
areas.
   4.8.1. South Pattern. Helicopters approaching from the south will enter downwind 1 NM
   south of the RWY. Pattern altitude is 700ft MSL until turning onto final approach. During
   high-density traffic operations, helicopters may report HILL 180 (R-164/(2/3) Distance
   Measuring Equipment (DME), and with Tower approval, proceed direct to the AMOPS ramp
   or the helipad.
   4.8.2. North Pattern. Helicopters approaching from the north will enter Osan’s traffic
   pattern via a downwind pattern. Base legs should be flown within 1 NM of the RWY.
   Pattern altitude is 500ft MSL until commencing turn to final approach. When instructed by
   Tower, helicopters shall report and/or hold over PADDY POINT (R009/1 DME).

   4.8.3. Helicopter Auto-Rotation Patterns. Tower clearance is required before conducting
   auto-rotations. The RWY will normally be used for auto-rotation landings. TWY F may be
   used when arriving or departing traffic dictates. Due to the nature of these patterns, Tower
   will not breakout a helicopter that was cleared to conduct the maneuver except to preclude an
   emergency situation. ATC approval for auto-rotations will be secondary to normal
   arrival/departure operations.
   4.8.4. Helicopter Sling Operations. Helicopters will conduct sling operations over the grassy
   area in the northwest corner of the air base.
      4.8.4.1. Helicopter operations will:
          4.8.4.1.1. Notify AMOPS of sling operations at least 30 minutes prior to departure.
          4.8.4.1.2. Not over-fly structures, aircraft, vehicles, or personnel to the maximum
          extent possible.
      4.8.4.2. AMOPS will coordinate sling operations between Tower, CE (contractors or
      grass mowers), and Osan helicopters 30 minutes prior to takeoff and approve the
      operation based on Tower’s recommendation.
      4.8.4.3. Tower will give approved sling operations priority over other traffic in the North
      VFR helicopter pattern.
4.9. Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) Operations. Tower is responsible for controlling
SVFR operations within the control zone. SVFR is permitted for USAF, US Army, US Navy
and ROK helicopters. Operations will be IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and FAAO JO 7110.65.
Osan Flight Training Center aircraft are not authorized to fly SVFR.

                     INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES PROCEDURES

5.1. Basic Radar Service. Basic radar service is available for aircraft arriving, departing, and
transitioning the Osan Terminal Control Area. Departing and arriving VFR aircraft requesting
basic radar service can expect flight following, traffic information, and vectors, as necessary,
(ATC workload permitting).
5.2. Beacon Code Assignment.
   5.2.1. All aircraft will squawk the code assigned by ATC (or IAW special instructions) on
   departure and prior to initial contact with RAPCON when Return To Base (RTB).
   5.2.2. The last element of a nonstandard formation flight will squawk normal to aid radar
   identification.
5.3. Radar Traffic Patterns. Surveillance and instrument approach patterns are shown in
Attachment 8. An operational ASR is required to execute this pattern.
   5.3.1. Upon reaching the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), aircraft can expect vectors to
   intercept an ILS, TACAN, VOR, or surveillance approach.
   5.3.2. For emergency fuel or minimum fuel, aircraft will use the standard radar pattern,
   except to be vectored to intercept an ILS, TACAN, VOR, or surveillance approach at the
   FAF. Use of the term EMERGENCY FUEL or MINIMUM FUEL by the pilot constitutes a
   request to use the shorter pattern. Emergency fuel or minimum fuel aircraft on a missed
   approach will fly standard climb-out as described in paragraph 5.5.4.
5.4. Surveillance Approaches (ASR)/Monitoring and Availability. ASR surveillance
approaches and instrument approach flight following is available upon request.
   5.4.1. Instrument Approach Flight Following. Single piloted turbojet aircraft shall be flight
   followed when the ASR is operational and when the weather is less than 1,500ft ceiling or 5
   SM visibility or when the TACAN is out of service. Additionally, all aircraft landing RWY
   27 will be flight followed when simultaneous operations are in progress into Suwon.
5.5. Local Departure Procedures.
   5.5.1. Kunsan Round Robin. 51 FW aircraft can file for a Kunsan Round Robin: Osan 7
   Departure, Direct PATRO Transition, Direct WOLF, Maintain 12,000ft MSL. Delay XX
   minutes, then Direct PATRO, Direct CROWN, Maintain 11,000ft MSL. (Reference:
   Osan/Kunsan Letter of Agreement (LOA).
   5.5.2. Kunsan One-Way. 51 FW aircraft can file for a Kunsan One-Way: Osan 7 Departure,
   Direct PATRO Transition, Maintain 12,000ft MSL, Direct WOLF, RKJK. (Reference:
   Osan/Kunsan LOA).
   5.5.3. Stereo Flight Plans. Current Osan stereo routes are listed in the 51 OG/KMLTM
   LOA. When Osan Clearance Delivery issues ―cleared Mustang/Draggin ###‖, the aircrew is
   cleared as filed per Mustang/Draggin route listed in the LOA, and the departure frequency
   will be Channel 4. Altitude and squawk will be assigned by ATC based on route of flight.
 40                                                        51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   5.5.4. Standard Climb-Out Instructions: When multiple approaches are desired and ATC
   instructs ―EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT,‖ the following procedures apply for Osan
   aircraft:
Note: When weather is reported as VMC, all IFR departures will cross the departure end of the
RWY at or below 1,200ft MSL, unless Tower has advised overhead pattern is closed.
       5.5.4.1. RWY 09: After completing low approach, climb on track of 091 degrees until 3
       DME, then turn right heading 150, climb and maintain 4,000ft MSL. Climb gradient is
       290ft per nautical mile until leaving 2000ft.
       5.5.4.2. RWY 27: After completing low approach, cross departure end at or above 20ft
       AGL. Climb on track of 271 degrees until 3 DME, then turn left heading 220, climb and
       maintain 4,000ft. Climb gradient is 220ft per nautical mile until leaving 700ft.
       5.5.4.3. If the pilot is not familiar with the procedure, Tower and RAPCON controllers
       must be prepared to issue the ground track, climb gradient, and altitudes specified in the
       departure procedure.
5.6. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. Pilots of aircraft under radar control may request
vectors to initial. Vectors will be provided to intercept initial at 3-5 NM from the runway end.
IFR service is automatically cancelled once the aircraft reaches initial.
5.7. Breakout/Go-Around Procedures. Standard breakout procedures for aircraft outside 6
NM from the RWY are as follows:
   5.7.1. RWY 27: ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT RECEIVED, CLIMB AND
   MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND, UPON REACHING THREE THOUSAND, TURN
   LEFT HEADING 180.‖
   5.7.2. RWY 09: ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT RECEIVED, CLIMB AND
   MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND, UPON REACHING THREE THOUSAND, TURN
   RIGHT HEADING 180.‖
   5.7.3. Go-around procedures for aircraft at 6 NM or less from the RWY are as follows:
       5.7.3.1. RWY 27:     ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT RECEIVED,
       EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT‖ or ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT
       RECEIVED GO-AROUND NORTH/SOUTH SIDE (if additional instructions are
       provided by Tower) EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT (or as directed by ATC).‖
       5.7.3.2. RWY 09:     ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT RECEIVED,
       EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT‖ or ―TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT
       RECEIVED GO-AROUND NORTH/SOUTH SIDE (if additional instructions are
       provided by Tower) EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT (or as directed by ATC).‖
5.8. Radar/In-Trail Recoveries. Radar/In-Trail Recoveries are authorized at Osan and will be
accomplished IAW procedures listed in 8 OG and 51 OG Radar In-Trail Recoveries Letter of
Agreement.

      to allowing access.
      6.1.3.3. All agencies on the SCN must use a noise reduction feature that filters out back-
      ground noise.
6.2. Emergency Response Procedures. See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management
Program Planning and Operations, Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (CEMP) 10-2,
and applicable OPLANs which addresses both on and off base incident response procedures.
The Incident Commander is the senior fire official during an emergency response. The IC may
be relieved by the Emergency Operations Center Director if the appointment of a recovery
operations chief is required.
   6.2.1. Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarms.
      6.2.1.1. Emergency warning and evacuation alarms will be installed and activated as
      directed in AFI 13-204V3.

      distance as required.
      6.2.2.2. All aircraft and vehicles shall give way to responding emergency vehicles
      regardless of position on the airfield and respond to Tower instructions. Aircraft
      movement within the vicinity of the emergency will be approved by the Fire Chief or
      Senior Fire Officer.
   6.2.3. Aircraft Chase Response.
      6.2.3.1. The SOF shall determine if such a response is required. The Fire Chief will
      coordinate with Tower to conduct a chase response. Once Tower approves the
      procedures (―CHASE RESPONSE APPROVED‖), the Fire Chief and responding
      vehicles then have approval for immediate entry onto the RWY once the emergency
      aircraft passes each vehicle’s respective position on the TWY.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   43


   6.2.3.2. The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer shall position vehicles to respond to the
   emergency. Tower will advise the Fire Chief when the emergency aircraft is next to land.
   6.2.3.3. The Fire Chief/Senior Fire Official vehicles will position on the west end of the
   AMOPS Ramp or Door Stop for most emergencies. Recovery vehicle (tow) shall be
   positioned with the Fire Chief/Senior Fire Official, and the AMOPS vehicle shall be
   positioned either on TWY Alpha or Echo, depending on the RWY in use.
   6.2.3.4. The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Official shall report to Ground Control when all Fire
   Department response vehicles are off the RWY.
       6.2.3.5. The Fire Department will pass termination times for emergencies to Tower and
       AMOPS in a timely manner.
   6.2.4. Chase Aircraft. Only designated chase aircraft may accompany the emergency
   aircraft on final approach. The chase aircraft should remain north of the emergency aircraft.
   Any aircraft desiring to chase to the south must advise Tower or RAPCON as appropriate.
   6.2.5. RWY Checks after an Emergency.
       6.2.5.1. RWY operations shall be suspended after an In-flight Emergency (IFE) or GE if
       directed by 51 FW SOF, 5 RS SOF, AMOPS, or Tower Watch Supervisor in order for
       AMOPS to examine the RWY or taxi surfaces. If the IFE or GE does not produce FOD
       and there is no damage to the aircraft or RWY, the 51 FW SOF or 5 RS SOF can make
       the determination that a RWY check is not required. The SOF or Tower (when directed
       by the SOF) will then call AMOPS to advise ―NO RWY CHECK REQUIRED PER
       SOF.‖ AMOPS personnel will document the ―NO RWY CHECK REQUIRED PER
       SOF‖ in the AF Form 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation. Examples of IFEs or
       GEs when a RWY check may be required are gear problems, fuel or hydraulic problems,
       wildlife strikes, or other situations deemed necessary by the SOF, Tower, or AMOPS.
       6.2.5.2. AMOPS is the only agency authorized to perform RWY checks after an
       emergency.
   6.2.6. Emergency Recovery Frequency (ERF).
       6.2.6.1. ATC will assign military single-piloted turbo-jet aircraft with the IFE emergency
       frequency 245.7 (Channel 11) for approach and landing. Note: The Tower or SOF may
       assign the ERF after coordination with Osan Approach.
       6.2.6.2. ATC will notify the SOF that an emergency aircraft is on the ERF. The SOF
       will monitor the ERF until the emergency is terminated.
       6.2.6.3. When the emergency aircraft reaches 10 flying miles from the RWY, Tower will
       make a UHF GUARD/243.0 transmission to inform aircraft flying in the Military
       Operations Areas (MOAs) or Air Combat Maneuvering and Instruction (ACMI) airspace
       of the Osan airfield status. To the maximum extent possible, the following information
       will be passed: type aircraft, ETA, and whether a barrier/cable engagement is
       anticipated. When the emergency lands and clears the RWY, Fire Department personnel
       will assist and, with pilot concurrence, terminate the emergency.
6.3. Drop Tank/External Stores Jettison Area. The primary drop tank and external stores
jettison area is on a scheduled range. The Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) area is
 44                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


SOT R-275/18-20 DME. Radar vectors can be provided by Osan Approach. Osan Approach
can advise the pilot when the aircraft is entering the area, however, ATC shall not tell the pilot
when to jettison stores.
   6.3.1. Inert, Live, or Training Ordnance Jettison Areas. Primary jettison locations should be
   on a scheduled range. If unable to jettison on a scheduled range, jettison VMC on any range
   or the Catfish Jettison Area.
       6.3.1.1. The Catfish Jettison Area is the primary live ordnance jettison area in the ROK.
       The Catfish Jettison Area is located at SOT R-243/79 DME, within 4 NM radius.
       6.3.1.2. Osan Jettison Area – SOT R-275/18-20 DME, heading 270-330 degrees. If
       IMC, Osan Approach will provide separation from known aircraft.
       6.3.1.3. Kunsan Jettison Area – Kunsan R-270 to 290/3-15 DME.
   6.3.2. Procedures.
       6.3.2.1. The pilot will proceed to the selected area and make every attempt to ensure the
       area is clear, if time and conditions permit.
       6.3.2.2. Jettison as far as possible out to sea.
       6.3.2.3. Jettison over any clear area.
6.4. Fuel Dumping. Proceed to a minimum of 5 NM off shore at or above, 5,000ft MSL.
RAPCON will provide vectors if required.
6.5. Aircraft Arresting System Engagements.
   6.5.1. Emergency Engagements.
       6.5.1.1. Should a barrier engagement be made at any time during a landing when the
       pilot has not declared intention to do so, it will be treated as an emergency.
       6.5.1.2. NORDO. The aircraft will engage the arresting system as appropriate. Plan the
       approach as dictated by the emergency. Squawk IFF/SIF 7600. Plan a straight-in
       approach, flashing landing lights on final. Monitor Tower for light signals.
   6.5.2. Practice Engagements. Practice engagements must be coordinated in advance with
   AMOPS, Tower, and Fire Chief. Once approved by the SOF via 51 OG/CC, pilots will
   annotate their flight plans accordingly in remarks. AMOPS will notify the barrier crew and
   Fire Department in advance of all practice engagements. Rescue crew and appropriate crash
   equipment will standby at the scene. The rescue crew will marshal the engaged aircraft.
   6.5.3. RWY Closure and Equipment Recovery Time. Recovery time for BAK-12 barrier
   system resets normally take no longer than 10 minutes.
6.6. Hot Brakes Procedures.
   6.6.1. If able, aircrews will proceed to the primary hot brake area on either the Hot Cargo
   Pad or TWY E. Alternate parking locations are TWY A or as directed by Fire Chief or
   Senior Fire Official.
   6.6.2. Fire Department will be dispatched immediately via the PCAS.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                  45


   6.6.3. If fire suppression is required, responsibility rests with the Senior Fire Officer,
   including shutdown, isolation of aircraft, and standby equipment until wheel assembly is
   cooled.
   6.6.4. Other operations are controlled by the senior aircraft maintenance supervisor who
   coordinates with the fire officer.
6.7. Controlled Bailout Area. The controlled bailout area is SOT R-275/10-12 DME, Heading
275, altitude should be no lower than 2,000ft AGL. Crew safety permitting, plan bailout so the
aircraft will impact in the water. Osan Approach can radar vector and advise the pilot when the
aircraft enters the area, but Osan Approach will not tell the pilot when to bailout.
6.8. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter
(ELT). Upon receipt of a personnel/crash signal, RAPCON will notify Incheon Center and Osan
Tower of the affected frequency. If Tower receives the ELT, they will notify RAPCON. Tower
is also responsible for notifying AMOPS. AMOPS will notify CP, MOCC, and TA/AMC when
transient aircraft are on the ground.
   6.8.1. MOCC will initiate search upon receipt of initial signal.
   6.8.2. The ELT will be rechecked every hour until located or terminated.
6.9. Hung Ordnance Procedures.
   6.9.1. Hung Ordnance Routing.
       6.9.1.1. To help minimize the risk associated with flying with Hung Ordnance, minimum
       risk routes from Pilsung and Chik-do ranges have been established. Pilots will fly the
       depicted routing to the max extent possible, maneuvering as necessary to avoid populated
       areas. The routing for Pilsung is as follows: MOA 11-E (DF 6292 9495 / N3659
       E12834) to MOA 11-S (DF 4010 7582 / N3649 E12819) to 105A (CF 8040 7744 /
       N3650 E12739) to STANN (CG 6182 0974 / N3707 E12726) to RKSO (see Atch 12).
       The routing for Chik-do is as follows: Jik-do (N3553 E12603) to Semi (N3620 E12625)
       to Lake (N3626 E12637) to Yesan (N3641 E12646) to IP Foxtrot (N3653 E12649) (see
       Atch 12).
       6.9.1.2. Pilots will contact Approach Control NLT 10NM prior to STANN to coordinate
       Hung Ordnance procedures. In addition, coordination with the SOF should be
       accomplished as early as possible.
       6.9.1.3. For Runway 27, after STANN fly direct to the runway either via vectors to ILS
       final or visual straight-in, weather permitting.
       6.9.1.4. For Runway 09, after STANN fly Approach Control’s radar vectors for the
       Hung Ordnance RADAR pattern for Runway 09. Once established on final, fly direct to
       the runway either via the ILS or visual straight-in, weather permitting.
   6.9.2. Unless unsecured, TP/WP 2.75‖ rockets, and inert bombs do not necessitate an IFE.
   The SOF will determine with the pilot if an IFE exists.
   6.9.3. Aircraft returning with high explosive hung ordnance will taxi to the primary hung
   ordnance location on the HCP located on the north side of the approach end of RWY 09.
   Aircraft that declare hung ordnance with high explosives will be directed to and safed at the
   HCP.
 46                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   6.9.4. Aircraft experiencing an ―unsafe gun‖ will park on the HCP (primary) with gun
   pointed to the north towards the gun berm or the northernmost dearm spot on TWY A with
   gun pointed west and await dearming. When landing on RWY 09, perform a left 180-degree
   turn on the RWY and back taxi to the unsafe gun area. Only Fire Department personnel,
   arm/dearm crews, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) may enter the parking area until
   the aircraft is declared safe.
6.10. Wind Limitations on the Control Tower. When the wind velocity reaches 55 knots
sustained, gusts in excess of 60 knots, or at the discretion of the Watch Supervisor, Tower will
implement the evacuation checklist and evacuate to the RAPCON. Prior to evacuation, Tower
will activate the PCAS and broadcast on all tower frequencies, to include guard, that the tower is
evacuating and to contact Osan Approach.
Note: 51 CES has determined the Tower is stressed to withstand winds of 80 mph or 71 knots.
6.11. Evacuation of ATC and AMOPS Facilities/Alternate Facilities Procedures.
   6.11.1. Tower Evacuation/Alternate Facility.         The Tower Watch Supervisor (WS)
   determines when a facility evacuation is required. If the Tower WS directs a facility
   evacuation, alternate Tower operations will be conducted from the Highly Mobile Multi-
   purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The HMMWV will generally be established as the
   alternate facility unless severe weather conditions (to include high winds) exist making the
   use of the HMMWV not feasible. See alternate control tower operations OI located in the
   Tower Chief Controller’s office for HMMWV alternate tower procedures.
       6.11.1.1. Aircraft on the ground will be instructed to contact Clearance Delivery on
       127.3 or 343.0 for information and instructions.
       6.11.1.2. Airborne aircraft will be instructed to contact Osan Approach on 306.3 or 127.9
       for information and instructions.
       6.11.1.3. Tower will instruct all vehicles to exit and remain clear of the CMA until radio
       contact with the Alternate Tower is established and normal procedures resume.
       6.11.1.4. Limitations. Only straight-in to full-stop landings will be authorized during
       alternate tower operations.     Aircrews can expect 7-10 mile spacing between
       aircraft/flights.
   6.11.2. RAPCON Evacuation/Alternate Facility. The RAPCON WS determines when a
   facility evacuation is required.
       6.11.2.1. Instruct aircraft to change to Incheon Center’s frequency 346.5 or 122.4.
       6.11.2.2. Limitations. Aircraft should expect radar services to be very slow and limited
       from Incheon Center, who will assume control of RAPCON’s airspace. If alternate
       RAPCON operations are established from the Tower, non-radar services will be provided
       for IFR aircraft arriving/departing Osan.
   6.11.3. AMOPS Evacuation/Alternate Facility.          The AMOPS Supervisor (AMOS)
   determines when a facility evacuation is required. The RAPCON is the alternate facility. No
   limitations to flying operations occur due to an AMOPS evacuation.
   6.11.4. Resumption of Operations. Shift Supervisors shall direct a deployment back to the
   primary facility upon confirmation by a competent authority that the primary facility is safe
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    47


   and usable. Staffing permitting, the preferred method of facility transfer is to continue
   operations in the alternate and dispatch a separate crew to perform a complete equipment
   check then resume control in the primary facility. AMOPS shall activate the SCN when
   relocating.
6.12. Other Emergency Procedures.
   6.12.1. nORDO Procedures. Wing assigned aircraft that are experiencing radio out/lost
   communications and are recovering at Osan.
      6.12.1.1. VFR Aircraft. Squawk 7600, proceed to initial via Hawg/Viper for RWY 27 or
      via Bridge/Race Track for RWY 09 and rock wings on initial, break at departure end and
      watch for light gun signals on final.
      6.12.1.2. IFR Aircraft. If aircraft is NORDO upon departure, squawk 7600 and fly the
      assigned instrument departure procedure or last assigned instructions. Execute one turn
      in holding at the clearance limit fix at the last assigned altitude. Upon completion of the
      turn in holding, proceed to VISEN or STANN (depending on the last runway in use),
      climb/descend to 5,000ft MSL and make one turn in holding, then proceed inbound
      towards the runway on the approach. NORDO aircraft upon recovering to Osan will
      proceed to VISEN or STANN and follow procedures identified in previous sentence.
      6.12.1.3. If able, aircraft will taxi to the dearm area after landing.
   6.12.2. Hung Pogo Procedures. Hung Pogo procedures occur when a 5 RS aircraft declares
   a ―Hung Pogo‖ Emergency. Procedures for this emergency are outlined in paragraph 10.4.
   6.12.3. Helicopter Hot Gun Procedures.
      6.12.3.1. Helicopters experiencing a ―hot gun‖ will declare an IFE and approach Osan
      from the west when able. In all cases, over-flight of people and buildings will be avoided
      to the maximum extent possible. At all times, the malfunctioning gun will be pointed
      away from all people and buildings.
      6.12.3.2. Approach and landings will be made on the Hot Cargo Pad on the northwest
      side of the airfield in such a way that the malfunctioning gun will be pointed to the north
      towards the gun berm. The unit’s weapons personnel will safe the malfunctioning gun
      and remove it from the aircraft.
   6.12.4. Reception Procedures for Contaminated Aircraft.
      6.12.4.1. See AFI 10-2501, CEMP 10-2, and applicable OPLANs.
      6.12.4.2. Tower will direct contaminated aircraft off the active RWY onto the arm/dearm

7.1. General Information/Responsibilities.
   7.1.1. Refer to 51 FWI 13-202, for specific guidance on airfield driving requirements,
   airfield violations/penalties, vehicle traffic procedures, emergency vehicle operations,
   vehicular call signs, authorization of Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs), and pedestrian
   operations within the CMA.
7.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   7.2.1. The CMA is comprised of paved and unpaved areas within 100 ft of the runway edge
   and pavement between the VFR or IFR hold short lines (whichever is further from the
   runway) and the runways. Note: During TWY F ALSoperations, the 51 SFS shall post
   personnel at the throats of TWY F. See Attachment 2 for a general depiction of the CMA.
   7.2.2. All vehicles, aircraft, and personnel operating within the CMA must be in direct radio
   communication with Tower prior to entering and advise tower promptly after exiting. Two-
   way radio communication must be maintained via Ramp Net. Those vehicles that do not
   have Ramp Net will not be allowed to enter the CMA, unless escorted by a vehicle with
   Ramp Net access.
   7.2.3. In the event radio contact is lost or cannot be established with personnel or vehicles in
   the CMA, Tower personnel will use standard FAA tower light gun signals or turn the RWY
   or TWY lights on and off as an emergency signal for personnel to immediately exit the
   CMA.
7.3. Ramp and Crash Net Use. Tower shall continuously monitor the Ramp Net. If Tower is
unable to monitor the Ramp Net, AMOPS shall be notified. Tower shall monitor the Crash Net
as appropriate when emergency response vehicles request access to the CMA. Both nets shall be

                            FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

8.1. Flight Plans. All aircraft departing USAF installations must have a flight plan on file with
AMOPS prior to takeoff IAW AFI 13-204V3, AFI 11-202 V3, and General Planning
instructions.
8.2. Scheduling and Flight Plan Procedures.
   8.2.1. Each flying organization or unit will complete and maintain a separate PACAF
   approved log for each day’s activities. At a minimum, these logs will include call sign,
   type/number of aircraft, Actual Time of Departure (ATD), Estimated Time Enroute (ETE),
   and Actual Time of Arrival (ATA).
   8.2.2. Flying squadrons must file a DD Form 1801, with AMOPS for all cross-country
   flights and are responsible for ensuring AMOPS receives a legible copy to ensure there are
   no issues that would prevent an on-time departure.
       8.2.2.1. Flight plans will be filed with AMOPS at least one hour prior to estimated time
       of departure.
           8.2.2.1.1. Domestic cross-country flights. The aircraft tail number will be recorded
           and retained at the squadron. The squadron will put note ―S/N on file‖ to show the
           tail number will be recorded at the squadron. This allows the squadron the flexibility
           to make last minute aircraft assignments while keeping the tail number available for
           mishap identification purposes. It also allows AMOPS to file the flight plan in a
           timely manner. In the event of power or computer failure, the aircraft tail number
           will be required in order to verbally file the flight plan with Incheon Center.
           8.2.2.1.2. International cross-country flights. The aircraft tail number MUST be
           included on the flight plan before it can be filed with Incheon Center. If proposed tail
           numbers change, report the amended tail number to AMOPS as soon as possible.
   8.2.3. User will maintain the original flight plan (or flight log) for 12 months IAW Air Force
   Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS),
   Table 13-7, rules 3 and 4.
   8.2.4. Flying units assigned to Osan will provide CP with a copy of the next day’s flying
   schedule. The Patriot Excalibur (PEX) System shall be used to the maximum extent possible
   to plan and flight follow 51 FW aircraft. The schedule will contain the aircraft call sign,
   number of aircraft in the flight, scheduled takeoff and landing times, estimated time enroute,
   pilot weather categories, and crew names. Flying schedules will be sent to the RAPCON,
   Tower, and AMOPS by Wing Scheduling. Weather will receive a copy from AMOPS and
   the SOF will receive a copy from the Tower.
   8.2.5. PEX will be the primary means of notifying the SOF and Tower of changes in the
   daily flying schedule or clearance requests to include delays, additions, and cancellations.
   The Tower will notify RAPCON of any schedule changes. 51 FW flying units will notify
   SOF of call-sign, pilot, and weather category changes made the day of flying.
52                                                        51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


  8.2.6. If any element of a flight is canceled or delayed, the flight lead will inform Osan
  Ground Control when requesting clearance. Delayed elements that call for taxi after the rest
  of the flight has taken off will have the appropriate flying squadron scheduler call AMOPS to
  coordinate or fax a new flight plan and advise the SOF.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 53

9.2. Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Procedures.
   9.2.1. The primary method for obtaining NOTAMs is the US NOTAM Office Web Site
   (https://www.notams.jcs.mil). Each flying organization is responsible for gathering
   NOTAMs through this method. The alternate method for AMOPS is to contact another
   military installation to receive and send NOTAMs. AMOPS is the NOTAM disseminating
   facility and the RAPCON is the NOTAM monitoring facility.
   9.2.2. In the event the NOTAM web site is out of service, AMOPS will attempt to access
   NOTAMs through another web site. If that is also unavailable, AMOPS will contact Kunsan
   for NOTAMs. In the event that the said sources are not available, flying units/transient
   aircraft personnel will have to contact each respective base for NOTAMs. AMOPS will
   provide NOTAMs for Korean and divert bases at the start of each day and will fax additional
   NOTAMs as appropriate throughout the day.
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     55


9.3. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Accounts and Procedures for Requesting
Changes. 51 FW FLIP accounts are managed by 51 OSS/OSAM. Send suggested FLIP
changes to 51 OSS/OSAM, Unit 2163, APO AP 96278-2163 (DSN 314-784-4222/1861). 51
FW flying units will update their FLIP requirements letter with 51 OSS/OSAM annually or as
required due to changes in personnel.
9.4. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria. Airfield/Airspace waivers are reviewed IAW
PACAFI 32-1056. The Airfield Waiver Working Group reviews at least 25% of airfield waivers
each quarter and briefs the results at the AOB. 51 CES/CEAO is the OPR for the permanent
Airfield Waiver Program, 51 CES/CEP is the OPR for the temporary Airfield Waiver Program,
and 51 OSS/OSA, in coordination with 7 AF/A3A, is the OPR for airspace criteria.
   9.4.1. Osan AB has 242 waivers, exemptions, and deviations. A copy of the annual waiver
   review package is located in the 51 CES/CEAO office.
9.5. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. PPR procedures will be IAW NOTAM
and IFR supplement guidance for Osan AB. Note: Failure to coordinate with 51 OSS/OSAM
may result in landing clearance denial due to lack of parking space. Project officers, points of
contact, and temporary duty liaisons should make every attempt to coordinate with 51
OSS/OSAM to ensure necessary parking and support is available.
9.6. Arriving Aeromedical Evacuation (Air Evac) Notification and Response Procedures.
   9.6.1. Tower will contact AMOPS whenever an arriving Air Evac aircraft is 15 miles from
   the airport or upon initial contact. AMOPS will initiate rescue protection notifications (i.e.,
   notify TA, Fire Department, and Air Evac personnel).
   9.6.2. DUST OFF (UH-60 EVAC) operations will be conducted on the AMOPS apron. The
   Door Stop will be the alternate location.
9.7. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals. All aircraft inbound to Osan must be on a flight plan (or
given prior notice) which contains Osan as a destination. In the event of a no-notice arrival, the
following actions will occur:
   9.7.1. AMOPS shall follow applicable quick reaction checklists and attempt to verify the
   inbound aircraft’s flight plan. Tower shall only allow the aircraft to land if approved by
   AMOPS.
   9.7.2. If AMOPS cannot verify the aircraft’s flight plan, and the aircraft lands, the tower will
   direct the aircraft to the HCP area. Tower will direct the aircrew to contact AMOPS via
   pilot-to-dispatch radio.
   9.7.3. 51 SFS will cordon off/secure the area and crew/passengers will not be allowed out of
   the area until released by the IC.
9.8. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification Procedures.
   9.8.1. Upon initial notification, AMOPS will pass any DV information for
   arrivals/departures to Tower and RAPCON. For inbound aircraft, ATC will make one call
   concerning inbound DV aircraft, as per AFI 13-204V3. RAPCON will forward call sign,
   type, ETA, and DV code number to AMOPS upon initial contact with the aircraft or upon
   receipt of flight plan (optimum time is 30 minutes prior to arrival). For VFR aircraft, Tower
 56                                                            51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   will forward call sign, type, estimated time of arrival, and DV code number to AMOPS upon
   initial contact.
   9.8.2. After receiving DV notification, AMOPS will notify Air Mobility Control Center
   (AMCC) and update with any changes.
9.9. Wear of Hats. Wear of hats on Osan’s airfield must be IAW AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft
Flight Line-Ground Operations and Activities, and is not authorized unless required for aircraft
maintenance, handling of other official functions, or as needed to protect personnel from weather
elements. Additionally, IAW AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, workers
operating bicycles in industrial airfield areas designated ―no hat‖ areas, due to potential FOD,
will wear a bicycle helmet with the chinstrap fastened about the chin.
9.10. Local Aircraft Priorities.
   9.10.1. For peacetime operations (including exercises), ATC will use the following aircraft
   priorities when sequencing arrivals and departures:
       9.10.1.1. Aircraft in distress/emergencies.
       9.10.1.2. Active air defense scrambles.
       9.10.1.3. Air evacuation aircraft when priority is requested by the pilot.
       9.10.1.4. Search and rescue (SAR) missions.

       9.10.2.9. Strategic Airlift missions.
Note: Situations not specified above will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
9.11. Lost Communication Instructions. Lost communication aircraft (or NORDO) will
follow the procedures published in the Flight Information Handbook or as specifically stated in
paragraph 6.12.
9.12. Opposite Direction Take-offs and Landings.
   9.12.1. Opposite Direction Traffic.
       9.12.1.1. Opposite Direction Departure vs. Arrival. An opposite direction IFR or VFR
       departure must be airborne and clear of the final approach course before an arriving
       aircraft can proceed inbound past a point ten miles from the RWY threshold.
       9.12.1.2. Opposite Direction Arrival vs. Departure. An opposite direction IFR or VFR
       arrival shall not proceed inbound closer than ten flying miles (11 DME) from the RWY
       threshold until the departing aircraft is airborne and clear of the final approach course.
       9.12.1.3. Opposite Direction Arrival vs. Arrival. No two aircraft will be simultaneously
       inbound inside ten miles on opposite final approach courses.
       9.12.1.4. Arrival vs. Practice Approaches. Opposite direction practice approaches are
       not normally authorized when 51 FW operations are ongoing.
       9.12.1.5. VFR criteria. VFR aircraft in the tower pattern will not turn base until the
       opposite direction departure is airborne and clear of the final approach course or an
       opposite direction arrival has landed.
       9.12.1.6. Opposite direction VFR helicopters may land or depart if cleared by Tower.
       When cleared, helicopters shall proceed no further north than TWY F unless otherwise
       instructed.
   9.12.2. Bi-Directional RWY Operations.
       9.12.2.1. The 51 OG/CC is the approval authority to initiate.
       9.12.2.2. Concept of Operations. Normally implemented during readiness exercises, bi-
       directional operations are designed to minimize the amount of time aircraft will be
       exposed prior to departure and after landing. 51 FW aircraft will depart RWY 09 and
       land RWY 27.
       9.12.2.3. Barrier Configuration. Runway configuration is barriers 1, 2, and 5 in the
       raised position, unless otherwise directed by 51 OG/CC.
Note: Unidirectional cables located in the overruns cannot be in the raised position on the
approach end of the runway.
 58                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


       9.12.2.4. Arming. Aircraft will arm and dearm in the HAS area or flows as required. If
       directed by 51 OG/CC, or designated representative, End of RWY (EOR) crews will set
       up on TWY A to arm and dearm aircraft.
       9.12.2.5. Weather Conditions. Daytime/VFR conditions and dry RWY only.
           9.12.2.5.1. A-10 maximum tailwind will be 20 knots.
           9.12.2.5.2. F-16 maximum tailwind will be 10 knots.
           9.12.2.5.3. U-2 maximum tailwind will be 5 knots during touch-and-go operations on
           training sorties. While departures and full stops can technically be accomplished with
           up to 10 knots of tailwind, operational missions at heavy gross weights are already at
           the limit of abort criteria and will therefore require a headwind on departure.
           Recovering mission jets will vectored to the runway with a headwind to the
           maximum extent possible. This may require cables to be lowered in order to
           accommodate headwind departures and recoveries. Coordinate any conflicts with
           other operations with the 5 RS SOF, ―TOPCAT.‖
9.13. Airfield Smoking Policy. Smoking is only permitted in designated smoking areas IAW
51 FWI 36-2901, Commander’s Policies.
9.14. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Traffic permitting, civilian aircraft low approaches at
Osan are authorized. In the event of an emergency, both domestic and foreign government (IAW
AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States Air Force Installations)
civilian aircraft landings are authorized but could be assessed landing fees IAW AFI 10-1001,
Civil Aircraft Landing Permits. Civilian aircraft requesting permission to land at Osan will be
directed to call AMOPS over Pilot-To-Dispatch (PTD). Aircraft will be checked against the
Civil Aircraft Landing Authorization Listing to verify permission to land at Osan. If aircraft
does not have authorization to land and is not declaring an emergency, it will be processed as an
unauthorized intentional landing and landing fees can be assessed by the 51 FW/CC.
9.15. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDs. Civilian aircraft may use Osan ATCALS facilities and
equipment to receive vectors, NAVAID services, and low approaches at Osan (traffic
permitting).
9.16. Osan Flight Training Center (FTC) Operations. Osan FTC operations are located in
the Charlie Diamond. All local flights must be cleared by the authorized clearing authority at the
FTC.
   9.16.1. Flight Plans and Flight Authorization. FTC pilots will use the FTC flight plan for all
   local area flights (see para 3.2.2). FTC pilots will use DD Form 1801 and file at AMOPS
   when they conduct a flight outside the local area and to airfields in the local area where the
   aircraft will be shut down.
   9.16.2. Refer to Osan FTC Standard Operating Procedures and In-flight Guide for more
   details.
9.17. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures – Hazardous/Severe Weather
Notification Procedures and Lightning Response. Severe weather watches, warnings,
advisories will be disseminated to Tower, RAPCON, and AMOPS by 51 OSS/OSW. This
information will be disseminated via ATIS by Tower and Secondary Crash Net (SCN) by
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                      59


AMOPS. To ensure widest dissemination of the weather warning terminology and reporting
procedures the following guidance shall be adhered to.
   9.17.1. Lightning Watch. A term used to predict when lightning warning will be declared.
   It is advisory in nature and has no impact on local operations.
   9.17.2. Lightning Warning. This condition will be declared when lightning is observed
   within 5 miles of the base. The following steps shall be taken:
       9.17.2.1. All refueling, liquid oxygen (LOX), and munitions operations shall cease.
       9.17.2.2. Aircrews will not step to the aircraft.
       9.17.2.3. Aircraft in the midst of start or shutdown may continue. After startup or shut
       down, all maintainers shall take appropriate shelter and/or clear the airfield expeditiously.
       9.17.2.4. Aircraft may taxi to/from the RWY.
       9.17.2.5. Arm/dearm procedures shall cease immediately. SOF will decide whether or
       not there is time to chock the aircraft. Ground crews will take shelter in the last chance
       shelter and will not leave the shelter to chock new arrivals unless approved by the 51
       OG/CC and 51 MXG/CC.
       9.17.2.6. SOF will determine whether or not aircraft may takeoff or land.
       9.17.2.7. All personnel outside must seek shelter (i.e., hangar, vehicle, etc.) as quickly as
       safety allows.
Note: In the event of an emergency, supervisors shall use the minimum number of people
required to safely terminate the emergency.
9.18. Airfield Snow Removal Procedures. Airfield snow removal operations will be
conducted IAW applicable OPLANs.
9.19. Bird/Wildlife Control and Bird Watch Conditions (BWCs). Bird Watch Condition
restrictions and procedures will be conducted IAW 51FWI 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard
Plan.
9.20. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Duties and Responsibilities. Local SOF duties and
responsibilities are outlined in the 51 OG Supplement 1 to AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision.
9.21. Taking of Photographs on the Airfield. Requests to take photographs on the airfield
(inside and outside of restricted areas) must be approved by Airfield Management and
coordinated with 51 SFS/S5SP. Once approved, photographs shall only be taken in areas
individuals are authorized to enter.
9.22. Military Assumes Responsibility For Separation of Aircraft (MARSA)
Operations. MARSA operations are not authorized at Osan AB. Aircraft requesting arrival or
departure with other flights will request ―NON-STANDARD‖ arrival/departure and indicate with
what flight the operation will take place (e.g. ―MUSTANG 1, NON-STANDARD DEPARTURE
WITH BRAG 1 FLIGHT‖).
9.23. Para-drop Area and Procedures.
   9.23.1. Authorized Aircrews. Transient aircrews are authorized to conduct paradrop
   operations on Osan’s airfield with 51 OG/CC approval. Local procedures shall be followed
 60                                                          51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   verbatim. Transient aircrews require a local procedures briefing to include the procedures
   listed in this section and any other areas deemed necessary by AMOPS and ATC
   representatives.
   9.23.2. Designated Area. The grassy area between TWYs B, C, and the RWY, and TWY F
   is designated as the primary para-drop area. This area is known as the ―Kong Drop Zone.‖
   The Golf Course Fairway 2 located 1/2 mile SW of the RWY is designated as the secondary
   para-drop area on base.
   9.23.3. Tower/RAPCON shall ensure:
       9.23.3.1. No engine runs/start-ups are approved until the para-drop operations are
       complete.
       9.23.3.2. Aircraft do not enter the traffic pattern or takeoff after the drop aircraft has
       turned final approach.
       9.23.3.3. All VFR traffic patterns are closed during para-drop activity.
       9.23.3.4. When receiving the five-minute notice from the participating aircraft, direct all
       aircraft to remain clear of Osan’s Class D airspace.
       9.23.3.5. All aircraft will be advised of para-drop operations, to include location and
       inclusive altitudes.
       9.23.3.6. Para-drop activities are terminated in the case of interfering traffic conditions,
       emergencies, or contingencies.
   9.23.4. Wing Scheduling shall advise all flying organizations, Command Post, Security
   Forces and AMOPS of scheduled para-drops.
   9.23.5. AMOPS shall:
       9.23.5.1. Disseminate para-drop information through safety NOTAM.
       9.23.5.2. Notify tower, RAPCON and the Airfield Operations Flight Commander of
       scheduled para-drops.
       9.23.5.3. Perform a RWY and TWY check after para-drop operations to ensure streamers
       and other potential FOD sources are not left on the airfield.
9.24. Drag Chute Procedures. Drag chutes will be released into the grass areas adjacent to the
exit TWY. Host unit or their representative will recover drag chutes. In the event host unit or
representative is unable to recover drag chute, TA and AMOPS will recover the chute.
9.25. 51 FW Communications-Out Launch/Recovery Procedures (F-16s and A-10s). These
procedures are designed for use by the 51 FW during exercises and daily training.
   9.25.1. Responsibilities.
       9.25.1.1. The mission commander will provide strike package information consisting of
       call signs, radio silence time, start taxi and takeoff windows/times, squawks, and
       direction of intended flight by secure phone or at the mass briefing.
       9.25.1.2. 51 OSS/OSA will be notified and will send a representative to the mass
       briefing. The Tower is relieved of anti-theft responsibilities for all F-16 and A-10 aircraft
       for the duration of the launch and will ensure the ATIS is up-to-date before and during
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   61


     the launch. If the ATIS is out of service, Tower will broadcast the active RWY, winds,
     and altimeter setting as each flight taxis onto TWY F.
  9.25.2. Taxi Procedures.
     9.25.2.1. All ground operations will be silent, except for an actual emergency. Taxiing
     aircraft will monitor the appropriate UHF/VHF frequency, as briefed for each phase of
     operations (i.e., Ground Control during taxi and Departure Control on takeoff).
     9.25.2.2. Aircraft will taxi in sequence to the appropriate RWY. Pilots experiencing
     difficulty during taxi will pull into a flow (if available) or over to the side of the TWY,
     turn on the landing or taxi light, and await assistance. Late taxiing aircraft taking off
     after the launch window will use normal Comm-in procedures. If an aircraft is unable to
     launch, the pilot will use normal Comm-in procedures after the package is airborne to
     request taxi back to parking.
  9.25.3. Takeoff Procedures.
     9.25.3.1. Aircraft ready to takeoff will taxi up to and hold short of the active. The flight
     lead will then look at the Tower for takeoff clearance. The Tower will issue a green or
     red light as appropriate. Once a steady green light is received, the flight is cleared for
     takeoff and changes to departure frequency (CH 4). The clearance for takeoff is good
     until the entire package has taken off or a red light has been shown from the Tower (if
     takeoff times are staggered, then each flight will get a steady green light from the Tower).
     Note: A red light can have the following meanings for these operations: 1) Steady red
     light - Continue holding short of the RWY, 2) Flashing red light - Takeoff clearance
     canceled, exit the RWY. Also, a subsequent steady green light reinstates clearance for
     takeoff. If safety or an emergency dictates, pilots and controllers will use normal
     communications.
     9.25.3.2. After takeoff, if the field is VFR, aircraft will depart as briefed.
     9.25.3.3. After takeoff, if the field is IFR, aircraft will fly the Mustang 401 Stereo Route
     until VFR-on-top, then change to Cobra. If VFR-on-top cannot be reached by 9,000ft
     MSL, aircraft will terminate Comm-out procedures and coordinate with Departure
     Control for a handoff to Kunsan.
  9.25.4. Recovery Procedures.       Recovery procedures will use normal communications
  procedures.
  9.25.5. Abnormal Procedures.
     9.25.5.1. Aborts or emergencies on takeoff are transmitted on departure frequency and
     the remaining aircraft will hold their position. Airborne emergencies immediately after
     takeoff are given traffic priority and land as the emergency dictates.
     9.25.5.2. Flights may terminate their Comm-out launch at any time by stating ―(call
     sign), TERMINATING COMM-OUT.‖ If the reason for terminating the Comm-out
     launch was temporary, the flight lead may resume the Comm-out launch by stating, ―(call
     sign), RESUMING COMM-OUT.‖
  9.25.6. Termination of the Comm-out portion of the launch may be done at any level of
  command and control to ensure flight safety.
 62                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


9.26. Anti-Hijack Procedures. Refer to 51 FW OPLAN 31-1, Anti-Hijacking and
Unauthorized Movement of Aircraft. This OPLAN is classified secret , contact 51 SFS for more
guidance.
9.27. Exercises Involving ATC Facilities or the Airfield. Requires 51 OG/CC approval.
Prior to taxiing, flight leads will coordinate with the SOF and include number of aircraft, attack
direction, and time on target window. The SOF shall in turn coordinate all information with
RAPCON and Tower. Note: IAW AFI 13-204V3 wing officials must brief the Airfield
Operations Flight Commander (51 OSS/OSA) at least 48 hours in advance of exercises that
involve any ATC facility or the airfield.
9.28. FOD Checks Following Heavy Aircraft Departures. Upon request by heavy aircraft to
taxi to active runway, Tower will notify AMOPS to conduct a FOD check. AMOPS will contact
Airfield Sweeper to proceed to the appropriate EOR (TWY A EOR for Runway 09 operations
and TWY E EOR for Runway 27 operations) and standby in the event that sweeping operations
are required. AMOPS will respond to the airfield to conduct a FOD sweep of the runway after
heavy aircraft departs. Note: When Airfield Sweeper is on weekend standby, they are required
to respond to the airfield within 30 minutes of notification. Thus, coordination may need to take
place prior to heavy aircraft taxiing.
9.29. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. No requirement exists for ATC personnel to
use NVDs at Osan. However, specific ATC procedures for NVD flying operations do exist
between Osan and Kadena AB and are described in LOA between 51 OG and 353 SOG.
Additionally, 51FWI 13-202, describes specific airfield driving requirements using NVDs.
9.30. Aero Club Operations. Operation of the Osan Aero Club’s aircraft will be IAW AFI 34-
217, Air Force Aero Club Program, AFMAN 34-232, Aero Club Operations.
9.31. Osan AB does not support any Unmanned Aerial System operations (UAS). If Osan’s
future scope of operations include supporting transient or base assigned UAS operations, the
provisions of AFI 13-204V3 and other applicable regulations will be implemented.

                                          Chapter 10

 LAUNCH AND RECOVERY OF 5TH RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON AIRCRAFT

10.1. Priority. 5 RS ―PRIORITY‖ missions are Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directed missions
that require priority handling. Due to the nature of the full pressure suit, aircraft handling
characteristics, extended sortie durations, and physiological impacts on the pilot, ―PRIORITY‖
recoveries shall be handled IAW local aircraft priorities established in paragraph 9.10.2 and will
not be delayed without coordination with the 5 RS Supervisor of Flying (―TOPCAT‖). ATC
priority service will not be given for 5 RS proficiency flights (―OSCAR‖ missions).
Note: Overheating of personnel and equipment is of major concern. A U-2 pilot’s body core
temperature increases one degree for every 10 minutes spent on the ground.
10.2. Communications.
   10.2.1. 5 RS mission aircraft (with tactical callsign other than ―OSCAR‖) are referred to
   herein as ―PRIORITY‖ and will be referred to as such in all radio and landline
   communications. References to the aircraft will be kept to a minimum. Reference
   proficiency flights by call sign ―OSCAR‖ or ―U-2‖, but NOT as ―PRIORITY.‖
   10.2.2. All 5 RS aircraft will use frequency 360.6 for ground and airborne operations. If
   360.6 is unavailable, the alternate frequency will be 264.6. Use of alternate frequency or any
   other frequencies requires prior 5 RS coordination with the Tower. Tower will monitor
   360.6 one hour prior to the ―PRIORITY‖ estimated time of departure.
       10.2.2.1. For OSCAR missions or proficiency flights, 360.6 is the primary frequency;
       however, aircrews should monitor UHF Tower frequency 308.8 for situational awareness.
   10.2.3. During launch and recovery, 5 RS ―MOBILE‖ or ―TOPCAT‖ are authorized to
   transmit safety of flight messages to the U-2 aircraft on single frequency approach.
   10.2.4. 5 RS vehicles are authorized runway use when the U-2 aircraft is on the runway for
   departure and arrival. ―MOBILE‖ is responsible for all vehicles on the runway and for
   informing the Tower when all 5 RS vehicles are off the runway.
       10.2.4.1. ―Two to Chase‖: ―MOBILE‖ will advise tower when additional chase vehicles
       will accompany the Recovery Crew on the runway. Recovery Crew equals one MOBILE
       and one Pogo vehicle.
10.3. Procedures.
   10.3.1. Uniform Departure ―PRIORITY‖ launch and Uniform Arrival ―PRIORITY‖
   recovery procedures will be conducted as outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement
   between Incheon Area Control Center, Seoul Approach Control, 5th Reconnaissance
   Squadron, and Osan Radar Approach Control.
   10.3.2. 5 RS will coordinate with tower to input call sign and estimated time of departure
   every Monday for the following week. 5 RS will confirm Tower has this information one
   hour prior to estimated time of departure. If necessary, 5 RS will pass the information on a
   secure telephone. If staging from another airfield within Osan’s terminal control area (e.g.,
 64                                                         51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   Suwon AB) and data is not loaded in TASAMS, 5 RS personnel will notify Osan Approach
   Control of call sign and departure time.
Note: 5 RS will advise Tower, on a secure line, if “PRIORITY” will not meet its ETD and
provide a revised ETD as soon as possible. On-time departures or arrivals will be referred to
“As Fragged.”
   10.3.3. Tower will:
       10.3.3.1. Relay departure/inbound information and revisions to RAPCON, and 51 FW
       Supervisor of Flying (MUSTANG 10) as soon as possible. All coordination concerning a
       ―PRIORITY‖ departure time must be conducted on a secure line.
CAUTION: ONCE A U-2 IS ROLLING, DO NOT CANCEL TAKE-OFF CLEARANCE AS
SEVERE DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT AND INJURY TO PILOT MAY OCCUR. PROVIDE
SAFETY ADVISORIES AS NECESSARY.
       10.3.3.2. Not simulcast on ―PRIORITY‖ assigned frequencies.
       10.3.3.3. Advise RAPCON when ―PRIORITY‖ starts to taxi.
       10.3.3.4. Deconflict use of the overhead and simulated flameout (SFO) traffic pattern
       before clearing a U-2 for takeoff. The 1,200ft MSL departure end restriction does not
       apply to U-2 ―PRIORITY‖ or ―OSCAR‖ aircraft departing on initial takeoff (dropping
       pogos).
   10.3.4. RAPCON will:
       10.3.4.1. Begin monitoring assigned frequency when Tower advises ―PRIORITY‖
       starting to taxi and monitor continuously until ―PRIORITY‖ missions are terminated.
       10.3.4.2. Not simulcast on ―PRIORITY‖ assigned frequencies.
       10.3.4.3. Flight-follow all instrument approaches at night or when the ceiling is less than
       1500ft and/or 5 SM visibility.
       10.3.4.4. According to Uniform Arrival Procedures, perform proper coordination with
       Incheon, to include position of aircraft, before directing ―PRIORITY‖ to contact them.
       This will facilitate a smooth pick-up of the ―PRIORITY‖ aircraft with Incheon.
   10.3.5. ―PRIORITY‖ will:
       10.3.5.1. Comply with the launch and recovery procedures outlined in the Memorandum
       of Agreement between Incheon Area Control Center, Seoul Approach Control, 5th
       Reconnaissance Squadron, and Osan Radar Approach Control.
       10.3.5.2. Contact RAPCON on assigned frequency when ready for landing; squawking
       Mode 3 Code 3075. If two ―PRIORITY‖ aircraft are airborne, the second aircraft will
       squawk 3076.
   10.3.6. 51 FW SOF, if on duty, shall assist in coordinating 51 FW flying operations to
   facilitate U-2 operations.
10.4. Emergencies.
   10.4.1. U-2 Hung Pogo Procedures. Proceed via the Uniform Four Departure and level off
   between 4,000ft MSL to 6,000ft MSL. Remain with Osan Approach; request radar vectors to
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                  65


   the SOT 270R/20 DME. Hold east, left turns, 5 DME legs and perform the 1U-2S-1-CL-1
   procedures. IFR NORDO: Hold east at SOT 270R/20 DME, left turns, 5 DME legs.
   Squawk 7700 and complete procedures in holding. Return via the ILS/TACAN to the last
   known runway.
      10.4.1.1. RAPCON shall provide vectors and coordinate clearance for holding. If unable
      to dislodge the pogo, ―PRIORITY‖ or ―OSCAR‖ will return to Osan avoiding populated
      areas and make a straight-in approach for a full stop landing. Preferred approach and
      landing is to runway 09. U-2 will declare an emergency and will not terminate until
      landing or until pogo dislodges.
   10.4.2. Controlled Bailout. The controlled bailout area is OSN 275/10-12 DME, heading
   275, minimum altitude 2,000ft AGL.
      10.4.2.1. RAPCON shall provide vectors if requested. Bailout should be accomplished
      at or above 2,000ft MSL with the aircraft heading south or west. RAPCON will track
      position of the aircraft to facilitate search and rescue operations.
   10.4.3. Lost communication procedures. Lost communication aircraft (or NORDO) will
   follow the procedures published in the Flight Information Handbook or as specifically stated
   in paragraph 6.12.
10.5. Miscellaneous.
   10.5.1. Ground Operations. ―5 RS MAINTENANCE‖ (UHF-equipped) will accompany the
   aircraft and coordinate with Tower for ground movements requiring use of Taxiway Foxtrot
   or to coordinate for engine runs. These operations do not require advance notification
   through Airfield Management Operations.
   10.5.2. 5 RS SOF. ―TOPCAT‖ (UHF-equipped vehicle) may be present on the airfield and
   will request Tower approval prior to entering the CMA if not shadowing the aircraft.
   10.5.3. 5 RS SOF, ―TOPCAT‖ or ―MOBILE‖ will ensure BAK-12 cables are properly
   configured for the operation.
      10.5.3.1. Standard barrier configuration for U-2 launches and recoveries on Runway 27
      is barriers 3, 4, 5, and 6 lowered. Standard barrier configuration for U-2 launches and
      recoveries on Runway 09 is barriers 1, 2, 3, and 4 lowered.
   10.5.4. ―MOBILE‖ operations in the CMA.
      10.5.4.1. ―MOBILEs‖ operating within the CMA when not physically escorting the
      aircraft (i.e. during transition, pre-launch, or post launch) will adhere to the following
      procedures.
          10.5.4.1.1. During ―OSCAR‖ flights, while the aircraft is under control of the tower
          local controller, ―MOBILE‖ is authorized to proceed onto the runway as a chase
          vehicle once the U-2 has passed his position. When able, ―MOBILE‖ will exit the
          runway on the nearest taxiway and report off on 360.6. When ―MOBILE‖ reports off
          the runway, acknowledgement by Tower of MOBILE’s position constitutes clearance
          for the MOBILE to return to the run-in position via Taxiway Foxtrot. Alternatively,
          ―MOBILE may request a U-turn ―180‖ on the runway to return to the run-in position.
 66                                                       51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012


          ―MOBILEs‖ will give way to all aircraft unless specifically cleared otherwise by
          Tower.
          10.5.4.1.2. At all other times ―MOBILEs‖ will report off the active runway on
          ground frequency (253.7/132.45) or RAMPNET, hold short of taxiway Foxtrot, and
          adhere to tower instructions.
10.6. Silent Launch. CAUTION: ONCE A U-2 IS ROLLING, DO NOT CANCEL TAKE-
OFF CLEARANCE AS SEVERE DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT AND INJURY TO PILOT MAY
OCCUR. PROVIDE SAFETY ADVISORIES AS NECESSARY.
   10.6.1. Silent launch procedures may be terminated at any time in the interest of flying or
   ground safety. The aircraft, tower, ―MOBILE‖, or the RAPCON departure controller may
   terminate silent launch by transmitting on the assigned frequency (360.6). Standard radio
   transmissions will then be used for departure.
      10.6.1.1. Additionally, the reported prevailing visibility must be 1 mile or more to
      conduct silent launch operations to ensure that Tower controllers have visual contact with
      all aircraft on the airfield..
   10.6.2. ―TOPCAT‖ will ensure aircraft call sign, estimated time of departure, and departure
   option are known to tower personnel either via secure phone or in person. ―TOPCAT‖ will
   be in the tower 30 minutes before launch. The ―MOBILE‖ officer will call Tower on a
   secure line with mission delays or changes.
   10.6.3. The ―MOBILE‖ officer will not make communications checks with Tower.
   ―MOBILE‖ is responsible for obtaining the current altimeter setting and runway in use. Both
   ―MOBILE‖ and ―PRIORITY‖ will monitor the assigned frequency.
   10.6.4. Tower must maintain visual contact with ―PRIORITY‖ from taxi to takeoff in order
   to continue silent launch procedures. If unable, silent launch procedures will be terminated
   and normal radio communication resumed.
   10.6.5. ―PRIORITY‖ will taxi for takeoff at approximately 12 minutes prior to estimated
   time of departure.
      10.6.5.1. At 5 minutes prior to estimated time of departure, ―MOBILE‖ will face the
      Tower and flash headlights. The Tower respond with standard light signals to clear the
      aircraft for takeoff.
      10.6.5.2. ―MOBILE‖ will proceed on the runway with the aircraft and proceed to the
      departure end of the runway to visually check the barrier status and conduct a FOD
      check. If other than the active runway is requested for departure, ―TOPCAT‖ shall
      coordinate with the Tower for opposite direction approval.
   10.6.6. The Tower may direct ―PRIORITY‖ to cancel takeoff and exit the runway by
   transmitting on 360.6 frequency. Aircraft cannot stop takeoff roll without risking severe
   damage and or loss of control. Coordinate with ―TOPCAT‖ for recovery actions, if required.
   10.6.7. After aircraft launch, ―MOBILE‖ will notify Tower when all vehicles are off the
   runway and request to cross TWY F.
10.7. Threat Avoidance Procedures. U-2 aircraft are authorized to conduct the following
procedures to improve their ability to operate into and out of high threat areas. ATC
51FWI13-204 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            67


authorization is required and this operation may be disapproved by ATC due to traffic or
weather.
   10.7.1. VFR High TRP Profile. Request TAC ARRIVAL with Osan Approach on initial
   contact. Once approved, proceed directly overhead of Osan descending to 4,000ft MSL.
   Report ―BREAK‖ and begin a spiral descent—attempt to remain within 3 NMs. Configure
   for a north downwind at 1,200ft MSL, unless otherwise instructed. Report downwind and
   base. Weather Minimums: Ceiling 5,000ft and 5 SM visibility.
   10.7.2. VFR Tactical Departure Procedure. Request TAC DEPARTURE with Ground
   Control on initial contact—include requested direction of turns. On departure, maintain
   VFR, climb to 10,000ft MSL, and spiral as instructed. Remain within 5 NM. Resume the
   normal departure routing upon reaching 10,000ft MSL.
      10.7.2.1. Tower shall coordinate TAC DEPARTURE requests with RAPCON and notify
      pilot if approved/disapproved.
      10.7.2.2. Weather Minimums: Ceiling 11,000ft MSL and 5 SM visibility.
