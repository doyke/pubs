This instruction outlines procedures and assigns responsibilities for the handling of crew or
passenger illness on flights arriving at MacDill Air Force Base directly from foreign countries.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises the accessibility and releasability statements. A margin bar (|)
indicates new or revised material since the previous edition.
1. General: The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS), is responsible for ensuring plants, human diseases, pests, or arthropod vectors
are not introduced to the USA. The Flight Medicine and Public Health Sections, 6th Medical
Group, will evaluate passengers/aircrew with illness.
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. Base Operations will immediately notify medical authorities when a flight arriving from
   a foreign country has passengers or crew who have any of the conditions listed below. Flight
   Medicine's phone is 8-2471 during duty hours and the beeper number is 265-7107 after duty
   hours. Public Health's phone is 8-5213 during duty hours and the beeper number is 913-
   4047. Hospital Emergency Services' phone is 8-2333.
       2.1.1. Unexplained illness.

       2.1.2. Person suspected of incubating a communicable disease.
       2.1.3. Person has an internationally quarantinable disease (cholera, plague, yellow fever).
       2.1.4. A death occurs en route.
       2.1.5. A suspected food-borne illness occurs among passengers/aircrew.
    2.2. 6th Security Police Squadron will:
       2.2.1. Ensure Security Police personnel are aware of quarantine requirements (AFR 161-
       4).
       2.2.2. Secure aircraft until released by Public Health/medical representative.
       2.2.3. Ensure aircrew/passengers do not debark aircraft until they are cleared by
       competent authority (APHIS or 6th Medical Group, Flight Medicine/Public Health).
       Security Police personnel will not board aircraft unless directed by APHIS or someone in
       their chain of command. Rationale: The Security Police should not be segregating or
       isolating contaminated individuals unless competent medical personnel are on scene.
       Also, Security Police do not have proper equipment or training to accomplish the task.
    2.3. Public Health will:
       2.3.1. Conduct epidemiological investigations as needed.
       2.3.2. Recommend/conduct follow-up surveillance of exposed personnel or persons who
       are ill.
       2.3.3. Document and report cases and epidemiological findings to appropriate
       authorities.
    2.4. Flight Medicine will:
       2.4.1. Evaluate all passengers/aircrew who are ill or exposed to a communicable disease.
       2.4.2. Determine levels of isolation/quarantine in conjunction with or in consultation
       with
