     assigned quarters and common areas IAW this instruction. Dormitories are shared quarters
     and as such, the responsibility for maintaining order and cleanliness must be shared. Respect
     for fellow residents, displayed by taking responsibility for personal conduct and meeting the

     housing to all members.

      4.1.1. IAW AFI 32-6005, approval authority for Priority 1 and 2 personnel to reside off
      base with OHA is delegated to Mission Support Group Commander. To gain approval
      the resident must first route the 8 FW IMT 2 Request for Permission to Reside Off-base
      through UHM to verify that the minimum utilization rate exceeds 90%. Once UHM
      verifies the utilization rate the member can route their request to the group commander
      for signature.
   4.2. Key Control:
      4.2.1. Room keys will be secured in a key box in the ADL’s or 8 CES/CEAC office. A
      key will not be issued until the resident’s name, rank, SSN, DOR, organization, duty
      phone, date of arrival and DEROS are recorded. A key may be issued to a sponsor with a
      copy of orders, but the resident must complete in-processing with their ADL no later than
      5 days after arrival.
      4.2.2. There must always be an extra key for each room kept in the master key box. If a
      resident loses his/her key, the ADL or 8 CES/CEAC will not issue a replacement until
      he/she ensures there is at least one extra key for the room. Extra keys will be maintained
      by 8 CES/CEAC in case of emergencies, such as fire, medical, etc. Each resident will be
      charged for the loss of keys and when applicable, for the replacement of lock cores.
      4.2.3. Residents who lose their keys or lock their keys in their room during duty hours
      will contact their ADL or 8 CES/CEAC. During non-duty hours, residents will follow
      lockout procedures posted on the bulletin board or call 782-4471.
      4.2.4. Master keys will only be available to ADLs, 8 CES/CEAC and first sergeants.
      The master keys will be strictly controlled. First sergeants will be allowed to have master
      keys; however, each First Sergeant must sign the statement of understanding (attachment
      6) upon arrival to Kunsan and fill out the Master Key Log (attachment 7). This
      procedure must also be repeated for any acting First Sergeant. Coordination with ADLs
      is necessary to ensure this procedure is performed.

                   MASTER KEY STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING

RESPONSIBILITIES: All master key(s) holders are responsible for the accountability and
security of their master key(s). Master key(s) will remain in the possession of the person that
originally signed for them. If it is necessary to loan out the master key(s), then prior to loaning
out the key, both parties must inform their respective Unaccompanied Housing Manager (UHM).
Then the pertinent information and signature of the person taking the master key must be logged
on the Master Key Log along with a signed copy of this document. Upon returning the key back
to the original key holder, the Master Key Log must be updated with the borrower signing the
key back in and the original holder taking the key back. Both documents will be kept in the
Master Key Binder in the UHM’s office.

INITIAL ISSUE: The only personnel authorized to be issued master keys will be UHMs and
First Sergeants. Each First Sergeant will be issued keys for their units rooms. All initial issues
will be done by the UHMs. Upon initial issue, an inventory must be taken and signed for on the
master key log, along with a statement of understanding for each individual taking master key.

TURN OVER: Prior to PCSing, UHMs and First Sergeants will turn in master keys to the
current UHM for their respective dorm. There is to be no transfer of keys from one UHM or
First Sergeant to another. The outgoing member will need to set-up an appointment with his/her
UHM to surrender the master keys and sign it back in on the master key log. The incoming
members will also set-up an appointment with the UHM and sign the master key log and the
statement of understanding. If no replacement is projected or there is an extended period of
absence, all master keys must be returned to the respective UHM.

MID TOUR: If an alternate master key holder has been selected to take responsibility for
master key(s) while the primary is on mid-tour, both primary and alternate master key holder
need to meet with the UHM. The master key(s) will be temporarily assigned to an alternate until
the primary master key holder has returned from mid-tour. Once the primary returns from leave,
he/she must again visit the UHM and sign for the keys.

LOST MASTER KEY: If master keys become lost or otherwise compromised, immediately
notify housing management. If after hours, call the Fire Dept at 782-4471 to contact the standby
UHM. The standby UHM will notify housing management. Housing Management will start a
search and accountability of the master keys for that building. If a master key can’t be accounted
for, Housing Management, CES CC and MSG CC will decide on further actions and solutions.

INVENTORY: Housing Management will perform a key inventory every quarter. This may
require everyone holding a master key to physically bring their keys to Bldg 705 for
accountability.
