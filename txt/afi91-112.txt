10. Personnel Reliability. Personnel that have physical access to nuclear weapons must be
qualified under a personnel reliability program. DoD Directive 5210.42, Nuclear Weapon
Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), and AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
Program, apply to US personnel. Host nations will implement equivalent personnel reliability
programs.
11. Nuclear Identification. Ensure test and training shapes can be distinguished from nuclear
weapons.
12. Weapons Custody. US custodial agents maintain custody of nuclear weapons unless
custody is transferred to user nations as a result of an authenticated execution message.
Reestablish US custody if weapons are not employed.
13. Airspace Restrictions. Implement local procedures within that airspace controlled by the
base to:
     13.1. Prohibit overflight of weapons movements, nuclear loaded aircraft, and aircraft shelters
     with nuclear weapons inside and not secured in a locked weapons storage vault.
     13.2. Prohibit direct overflight of prime nuclear airlift force aircraft operations.
14. Basic Aircraft Configurations. Place aircraft in the following configurations once all
preload functions are complete prior to loading nuclear weapons.

   15.3. Load nuclear weapons only on aircraft certified mission capable for the mission to be
   performed.
   15.4. Allow only US personnel to maintain nuclear weapons.
   15.5. Perform nuclear weapon maintenance only in a protective aircraft shelter (PAS).
   15.6. Major nuclear weapon maintenance in a PAS must be performed using a lightning
   protection system (LPS) modified weapons maintenance truck (WMT). (Major maintenance
   is defined as any activity in which any of the four major sub-assemblies are separated.)
      15.6.1. Prior to initiating unlock procedures to raise the weapons storage vault (WSV) or
      otherwise introducing a nuclear weapon to the PAS for major maintenance, remove all
      conventional munitions and aircraft from the PAS.
      15.6.2. For operations in an LPS modified WMT, use the guidelines in T.O. 11N-50-
      1007. Due to the Faraday shielding provided by the WMT, maintenance operations may
      be conducted irrespective of lightning occurrence or probability of occurrence.
16. Movement of Nuclear Weapons. Movement(s) will be kept to a minimum consistent with
operational requirements.
   16.1. AFI 91-115, Safety Rules for Nuclear Logistics Transport by the Prime Nuclear Airlift
   Force applies. Additionally, the following safety guidance applies:
      16.1.1. The aircrew performs or controls all loading, tie down, and unloading operations.
      16.1.2. The aircrew performs or controls all maintenance activities on a nuclear cargo-
      loaded aircraft and en route maintenance on a nuclear logistics mission aircraft.
17. Operations in a PAS with a Weapon Storage Vault. Maximize the use of the WSV surety
features by keeping the nuclear weapon-loaded WSV down and locked unless the specific
operation being performed requires vault access.
   17.1. Simultaneous presence of conventional munitions and nuclear weapons (exposed or
   with the vault NOT fully down) is prohibited except during nuclear generations, subsequent
   alert operations, command disablement operations, or CJCS-directed Stockpile Emergency
   Verifications (SEV).
   17.2. Simultaneous presence of conventional munitions and nuclear weapons (exposed or
   with vault NOT fully down) during practice generations, practice alerts, exercises, or
   evaluations is prohibited. Self-defense munitions loaded on aircraft and one additional load
   of air-to-air missiles, chaff, and flares, and an aircraft gun loading system, which may contain
   multiple loads, are permitted.
   17.3. Authorized operations involving both nuclear weapons and conventional munitions in
   a PAS with WSV (i.e., nuclear generation, subsequent alert operations, command
   disablement operations, and CJCS-directed SEV) always require MAJCOM-approved plans.
8                                                             AFI91-112 9 SEPTEMBER 2009


    The appropriate host/US wing commander must authorize each operation prior to start. Self-
    defense munitions as described above do not require a plan.
    17.4. Only aircraft NOT loaded with live munitions (except for captive air-to-air missiles,
    chaff, flares, and aircraft target practice gun ammunition) and associated ground support
    equipment can remain in the PAS while performing maintenance on the WSV, or minor
    weapons maintenance in the WSV, provided all other activities within the PAS are
    terminated.
    17.5. In a PAS with nuclear weapon-loaded WSV, conventional munitions may NOT exceed
    10,000 pounds net explosive weight (NEW).
    17.6. Conventional munitions (except for air-to-air missiles) must be positioned no closer
    than 15 feet from the WSV (Figure 1). Do NOT position forward firing munitions in storage
    with the nose or exhaust pointed directly at an opened nuclear weapon-loaded WSV. Air-to-
    air missiles, chaff, flares, and aircraft gun ammunition loaded in preparation for strike are
    authorized as long as they are electrically and mechanically safed, as applicable. In addition,
    hazard class 1.4 training munitions, chaff and flares, loaded and safed, on aircraft may be
    stored within 15 feet of a closed and locked WSV to accommodate parking 2 aircraft in a 3 rd
    generation PAS.
AFI91-112 9 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    9


Figure 1. Placement of Munitions 15 Feet from WSV




      17.6.1. If the placement of the WSV, the physical dimensions of the PAS, and the size of
      a single aircraft are such that the single aircraft (for example, PA-200 in 1st generation
      PAS) cannot have bombs loaded and meet the 15-foot restriction from the WSV, then the
      following additional restrictions apply when loading conventional bombs in the PAS
      (Figure 2):

Figure 2. Placement of Munitions When 15-Foot Restriction Cannot Be Met.




         17.6.1.1. Park aircraft as far from the WSV as practical.
         17.6.1.2. No conventional weapon in the PAS (on- or off-aircraft) may exceed 445
         pounds NEW each.
