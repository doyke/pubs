This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,

1.7. Description. Addendum B. Boeing B737 Series.
The B737 Series aircraft is actually comprised of several models of narrow bodies (which are
described in more detail below). All models are twin engine, and are designed for short- to
medium-range use. As of the date of this publication, 6,226 aircraft of the B737 Series have been
delivered, making it the most produced jet airliner to date. There are several thousand older
models still in service. The B737 also has Business Jet and military versions (the C-40A/B/C
"Clippers", P-8A "Poseidon", and T-43's). Furthermore, there are over 2,000 pending orders of
its Next Generation models, indicating that this Series will be around for the foreseeable future.

The B737 Series is best described in three phases: the Originals (-100 and -200 variants), the
Classics (-300, -400, and -500 variants), and the Next Generations (-600, -700, -800, and -900
variants). The Next Generation models are the only ones currently still in production.

Original B737 Models

The B737-100 made its initial flight in April 1967, and was type-certified in December of the
same year. This was the first in the series, and the smallest. There were only 30 manufactured,
with the last delivery to NASA in July of 1973. None are in service today.

The B737-200 model was developed alongside the -100. Its first flight was in August 1967 and
its type certification came a week after the B737-100. It was a stretch version of the -100 and
later offered the B737-200C, a convertible feature for passengers, cargo, or a mix. Although
1,114 were built up to 1988, most B737-200 and B737-200C's are no longer in service, so only
Quick Reference Table data will be presented in this volume.

Classic B737 Models

The B737-300 began the Classic generation when it flew in February 1984, getting type rated in
November 1984. Improvements in aerodynamics and engines, as well as stretching the fuselage
further than the -200's, aided in increased payload and range. By the time the last B737-300 was
delivered in 1999, 1,113 were made.

The B737-400 first flew in February 1988, getting type rated in September 1988. Approximately
10 feet longer than the -300, 486 were produced until February 2000. Although Boeing did not

make a freighter version, after-market modifications produced a few B737-400C/F's ("C" for
Convertible, "F" for Freighter).

The B737-500 first flew in June 1989, getting type rated in February 1990. The B737-500 was a
shortened version of the -300, with 389 produced until July 1999.

Next Generation B737 Models

The B737-600 first flew in January 1998, getting type rated in July 1998. This Next Generation
has the same fuselage as the -500, but better range, due to new wings, stabilizer, and tail sections.
69 manufactured to date.

The B737-700 first flew in February 1997, getting type rated in November 1997. The first of the
737 Next Generation aircraft, it has the same fuselage as the -300, also with better range, due to
new wings, stabilizer, and tail sections. Over 1,000 produced to date.

The B737-700C earned its type rating in August 2000. The "C" means convertible and can carry
passengers, cargo, or a mixture of both. Currently, 12 have been made.

The B737-800 first flew in July 1997, getting type rated in March 1998. This Next Generation
aircraft has new wings, stabilizer, and tail sections, but its fuselage is just slightly longer than the
-400. Over 1,750 manufactured as of this publication.

The B737-900 first flew in August 2000, getting type rated in March 2001. A derivative of the -
800 model, it has a 96 inch longer fuselage and more than 50 have been made currently.

The B737-900ER first flew in2006 and was type rated in April 2007. More than 60 produced so
far, this model has increased, weight, range, and passenger capacities than the -900 basic model.

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
