The purpose of this operating instruction (OI) is to establish and define the composition,
functions, training requirements, and activation procedures of the Air Force Personnel Center
Operations Center (AFPC OC). It implements AFPD 10-2, Readiness, to establish command and
control structures and provides continuity of command and control in the event of hostile action
or natural disaster. This instruction establishes and defines AFPC OC’s responsibility to execute
AEF sourcing and scheduling policy; provide visibility over deployed AF forces; assess
readiness and projected reconstitution requirements; and integrate and execute personnel
operations, Airmen development and meet commanders’ personnel requirements. Adjustments
to procedures contained in this instruction that occur between published revisions or interim
changes thereto will be issued as an AFPC OC Interim Change (AFPC OC IC). The purpose of
an AFPC OCIC is to rapidly disseminate changing guidance throughout the AFPC OC. They are
approved by the AFPC OC Director (DIR). A complete listing of current AFPC OCICs can be

1.1. Introduction. This OI establishes operational functions and procedures for the AFPC
Operations Center (OC), AFPC Personnel Readiness Cell (PRC), and the AFPC Casualty
Reporting Center (CRC). The PRC function is incorporated into the OC in the event of hostile
action or natural disaster or as directed by the AFPC/CC or AFPC OC DIR for the purpose of
total force accountability. Likewise, the CRC function is incorporated under the same conditions
to provide 24-hours/7-days per week worldwide casualty reporting, notification, and assistance.
It coordinates the actions required for total force personnel issues spanning the operational
continuum in the event of hostile action or natural disaster as well as or in support of exercises.

                             OPERATIONS CENTER MISSION

2.1. Mission. The AFPC OC supports the AF Crisis Action Team (AF CAT), Air Force
Operations Group (AFOG), Combatant Commands, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Air Force
Component Commands (AFCCs), Joint Force Provider (JFP) Air Force Components, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), and Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
roles and responsibilities as the Air Force’s managers for the scheduling, sourcing and providing
of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) forces to meet President of the United States (POTUS),
Secretary of Defense (SecDef), and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) taskings.
Additionally, the OC is the Air Force focal point for personnel accountability in the event of
hostile action or natural disaster. The OC provides timely and accurate information to prepare
and execute operational actions on real world requirements.
   2.1.1. The AFPC OC supports AFPC's CSAF-directed responsibility to serve in a supporting
   command role to Air Combat Command (ACC) for sourcing and monitoring execution of all
   SECAF tasked requirements for conventional and CAF forces. The CSAF designated direct
   liaison relationship between AFPC and AF components of the three primary JFPs (ACC,
   AMC, AFSOC) is exercised through communication between the respective Operation
   Centers and Crisis Action Teams.

                           OPERATIONS CENTER OPERATION

3.1. Function. The AFPC/CC, through this OI, identifies the key AFPC personnel necessary to
execute operational, GFM, exercise, and Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) force
providing responsibilities. In this capacity, the AFPC OC provides an enhanced communications
capability between AFPC and other critical force providing organizations and agencies (e.g.,
AFOG, AF CAT, HAF, MAJCOMs, and AFCCs). The AFPC OC is the conduit for all
operational, GFM, exercise, and APEX force providing issues entering and exiting AFPC. This
link is essential to optimize timely information flow and coordination during planning and
execution of AEF operations. The OC is the focal point for all communication in and out of
AFPC for personnel accountability, and AEF operational taskings. The OC is the USAF primary
collection and distribution point for information regarding impacted and threatened personnel.
The Director, AEF and Personnel Operations is the senior Operations Center Director (OC DIR),
the Chief, AEF Operations Division or Deputy, is responsible for the operations of the OC and
the day-to-day supervision of assigned full-time Operation Officers (OPSOs). The Chief, AEF
Operations Division or Deputy, serve as the OC DIR during normal operations and maintain a
schedule of on-call OC Directors during periods of increased activities. For surge/crisis
operations, the AFPC/CC approves designation of OC DIR alternates as warranted, and directs
AFPC directors to provide a roster of all on-call O-6s and civilian equivalents to function as OC
DIR as necessary. The OC maintains daily contact with the AFPC/DPW liaison officer(s)
(LNO) to provide and receive timely, critical information and guidance.

     and crisis manning. The OC continues to be responsible for routine and on-going operations
     conducted during normal duty hours. With the exception of after-hours casualty services,
     normal operations do not require the OC to operate at extended hours.
     3.3.2. All functional areas will be on-call and available via telephone. All work areas will
     transfer phones to on-call devices. The after-hours contact for the 12th Flying Training Wing
     (FTW) will be the OC when activated (the 12FTW/CP and Casualty Services will be notified
     of an OC activation and reminded to send notifications through the OC) and Casualty
     Services when it is not. The Casualty Services Branch will physically man their office 24-
     hours/7-days.

       3.3.2.1. Upon notification from 502 ABW CP, Casualty Services will notify the on-call
       OC DIR of recall notification. AFPC’s Unit Control Center (UCC) is responsible for
       enacting recalls when directed by AFPC/CC, CD, DS, OC DIR or their alternates.

3.4. Increased Operations (Partial Recall) (Figure 3. 3).
   3.4.1. Partial Recall. (Increased Operations Manning) The OC DIR will initiate partial recall
   anytime the operations tempo (OPSTEMPO) warrants increasing OCMs above normal
   operating level. OPSTEMPO influences include hostile action, natural disasters, exercise
   and training, and/or APEX support. OC DIR determines when selected OCMs are recalled
   based on the situation.
   3.4.2. In the event of hostile action or natural disaster, exercise and/or APEX support where
   OPSTEMPO exceeds the normal capability of the AFPC OC, the OC DIR may direct partial
   or full recall resulting in up to 24-hours/7-days operations. Manning will be at the direction
   of the OC DIR. At a minimum, the OC when activated, will be manned by at least one
   OPSO per shift.
3.5. Surge/Crisis Operations (Full Recall).
   3.5.1. Full Recall (Surge/Crisis Operations Manning). All OCMs report as required.
   3.5.2. The OC DIR will determine the battle rhythm and composition of personnel needed to
   sustain surge operations for an indefinite period of time. By utilizing key, trained, AFPC
   DPW personnel, a surge capability is created to handle an event of hostile action, natural
   disasters, exercise, and/or APEX operations. In the event of hostile action or natural disaster
   the AFPC OC consists of an OC DIR, Operations Support Officer (OPSO), Personnel
   Readiness Cell (PRC) representative (DPWO), Casualty Services representative (DPWCS),
   Personnel Systems Operations Control Center (PSOCC) representative, Requirements
   representative (DPWO), Scheduling representative (DPWS), AFPC OCMs, AFPC OC
   Directorate Representatives (OCDRs) and Information Managers (IMs) (Annex 9). The FAC

  will be called in, as required. The total number of personnel required is situation dependent;
  however, there are approximately 40 duty positions needed for full operational capability
  (see Annex 9). The remainder of the AFPC staff may be tasked as reach back support at the
  discretion of the OC DIR. In the event of hostile action or natural disaster the OC is also
  responsible for the following:
  3.5.3. Serve as the AFPC Battle Staff to address manpower and personnel actions in the
  event of hostile action or natural disaster.
  3.5.4. Serve as the focal point at AFPC for personnel actions required in the event of hostile
  action or natural disaster.
  3.5.5. Evaluating and documenting the need for and impact of freezing forces and stop
  movement for forces of an affected area for the duration of the surge. Preparing formal
  recommendation for CSAF, AF CAT/AFOG, AF/3/5, AF/A1, and AFPC/CC as required.
  3.5.6. Initiating actions to implement and rescind stop movement at the direction of the wing
  commander during natural disasters (e.g. hurricane) of the impacted base and coordinating
  this action with HQ AFPC/PA and HQ AFPC Director of Assignments (DPA).
  3.5.7. Providing upon request from the AFCAT, the identifying and deployment information
  of deployed or deploying personnel assigned to the impacted area (e.g. hurricanes, typhoons)
  to include those deployed on verbal orders of the commander (VOCO).
  3.5.8. Coordinating the status of affected MAJCOM(s) to determine if deployed personnel
  impacted by the crisis should return. If necessary, the OC, working with AFCC/CCs, will
  implement notification procedures IAW AFI 10-218, Personnel Accountability in
  Conjunction with National Emergencies or Natural Disasters.

                                     CASUALTY SERVICES

9.1. Casualty Operations and Augmentee Responsibilities. This section will codify the
responsibilities of augmentees during the three types of OC operations.
      9.1.1. Casualty Normal Operations.
         9.1.1.1. Casualty augmentees will not be called for duty during standard daily
         operations; however, they must be available for training to stay current on casualty
         processes and systems.
      9.1.2. Casualty After-Duty hours.
         9.1.2.1. Casualty augmentees will not be called for duty during standard daily operations.
   9.1.3. Casualty Increased Operations (Partial Recall).
         9.1.3.1. Level-one trigger point: When directed by AFPC/DPWC. During a level-one
         crisis, Casualty Services would rearrange the shifts to spread the manning evenly across
         the board.
         9.1.3.2. Minimum of three-people every shift with an OIC or NCOIC on duty around the
         clock. Casualty Services’ IMA and augmentees are placed on telephone recall standby.
         This posture is only intended to last for short periods.
         9.1.3.3. Level-two trigger point: When level-one staffing can no longer sustain number
         of casualties.
         9.1.3.4. Casualty Services would begin activating between nine and twelve augmentees
         in order to support two, 12-hour shifts. Ideally, the shifts will work two-days on and two-
         days off; however this schedule can be adjusted as needed.
      9.1.4. Casualty Surge/Crisis (Full Recall—Level Three Response).
         9.1.4.1. Level-three trigger point: Mass Casualty exceeding 30 new cases per shift. At
         this point, all augmentees will be recalled for a 7-day long, 12-hour shift. IMA is
         activated and the chief of benefits and entitlements will convert to a shift work position.
         9.1.4.2. A level-three response would require activation of the Casualty Services
         Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). At this point, extra phone lines would be
         required and Casualty Services would move all personnel to the Operations Center.
         Again, this is not considered a long-term solution.
