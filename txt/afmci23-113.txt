This instruction implements Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.2 -- Qualifications
Requirements which is implementing 10 U.S.C. 2319 and 41 U.S.C. 253c, DoD 4140.1-R, DoD
Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation and AFPD 23-1, Materiel Management Policy
And Procedures by prescribing policy and procedures to implement the manufacturing Source
Approval Request (SAR) process throughout Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). It is
applicable to any organization which is managing items (both Critical Application/Safety Items –
CAIs/CSIs, and non-CAIs/CSIs) for AFMC. While primarily applicable to the Air Force Global
Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC), and Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), it would apply to any
items managed by weapon system at Product Centers. The Competition In Contracting Act of
1984 (PL 96-369) established requirements to increase competition in defense procurements.
The source approval requirements and process described within this instruction are not intended
to restrict competition, but rather to provide for consistent application of the process through
consistent documentation as required by FAR 9.202. This instruction should be used in
conjunction with the joint service Source Approval and Management handbook, but this
instruction takes precedent if there are conflicts with the handbook. It is to be used by all AFMC
organizations and its contractors to provide war-winning capabilities - on time, on cost. This
instruction is applicable to the repair source approval process, but the appendixes, which provide
checklists and format, are only applicable to new manufacture. This publication applies to the
Air National Guard (ANG). This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Units. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located

1. Objectives:
     1.1. This instruction provides the procedures for qualification of new sources to ensure
     requests are submitted with complete information and are evaluated thoroughly and
     consistently. Procedures are being provided to formalize the activities for ensuring
     appropriate responsible technical oversight of the pre-award source qualification process
     within AFMC.
2. Policy. It is AFMC policy that:
     2.1. The need to identify additional sources to increase competition is a direct outcome of
     the screening process described in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFARS),
     PGI 217.7506 Spare Parts Breakout Program as implemented through AFMCI 23-102,
     Chapter 12, The Technical Screening Process. When the Engineering Support Activity
     (ESA) identifies pre-award qualifications of a new and or additional source as a requirement,
     qualification requirements must be generated. A qualification requirement waiver must be
     generated when it is determined unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which
     a prospective offeror (or its product) must satisfy.

     Policy and Procedures. Qualifications requirements will be documented as described in
     attachment 2, Justification for Qualification Requirements.
         2.2.2.1. Prepare pre-award qualification requirements whenever prequalification of a
         source or its product is required and it has not been determined that it is unreasonable
         to develop or specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its
         product must satisfy.
            2.2.2.1.1. The waiver process is available when prequalification is required and it
            is unreasonable to develop or specify the standards for qualification which a
            potential offeror or its product must satisfy. Prepare waivers in accordance with
            FAR 9.202(b) and documented as described in attachment 4.
         2.2.2.2. The ESA will assign and document item-criticality (Critical Safety Item
         (CSI), Critical Application Item, Non-critical), along with critical characteristics, if
         any, for potential parts being considered. DFARS 209.270-2 defines Aviation CSI.
         In addition, there may be other definitions tailored to a specific type of weapon
         system.
  2.3. Evaluating source approval packages.
     2.3.1. The process depicted in Figure 2 describes the cycle for pre-award qualification
     requirements by prospective sources, and the subsequent evaluation and disposition of the
     resultant technical proposals. SARs received from potential sources for items not in
     active solicitation are processed through the Small Business Office and those received
     against active solicitations are processed through the Procurement Contracting Officer.
     Differences between active and inactive solicitations are depicted in figure 2 by the use of
     italics for active solicitations.
     2.3.2. The ESA will evaluate the qualification requirements for potential sources being
     considered.
     2.3.3. A potential offeror seeking approval as a qualified source must meet the specified
     source qualification statement requirements established by the ESA. The potential source
     must meet the standards established for qualification before the date specified for award
     of the contract. Potential sources, at their own expense, with exceptions noted in FAR
     9.204(a)(2), will be given an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the
     standards specified for qualification.
     2.3.4. Common items used in multiple systems must have the coordination of all users,
     unless that ESA has the documented delegated authority, as required by AFMCI 63-1201,
     Implementing Operational Safety Suitability and Effectiveness, (OSS&E) and Life Cycle
     Systems Engineering of the users, including the other services. If all AF users approve
     SAR but other services do not, then a separate NSN shall be initiated for AF use only, if
     there is a technical or business case for doing so.
  2.4. Source Approval Categories -- there are four categories under which SARs will be
  submitted:
 6                                                       AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


        2.4.1. ACTUAL ITEM (Category I) - These SARs are received from suppliers who have
        manufactured or performed Repair, Overhaul, Maintenance and Modification (ROMM)
        on the exact item, using Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) technical data, for the
        prime contractor, OEM, another service, civil agencies, foreign governments, or for the
        civil sector under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Parts Manufacturer Approval
        (PMA) identicality. The item will be produced and evaluated against the ESA approved
        technical data.
        2.4.2. SIMILAR ITEM (Category II) - These SARs are received from suppliers who
        have not previously manufactured or performed ROMM on the subject item, but have
        manufactured or performed ROMM on items similar in complexity, design, criticality,
        manufacturing and/or ROMM processes, materials, and application for the prime
        contractor, OEM, another service, civil agencies, foreign governments, or for the civil
        sector under FAA PMA identicality. The item will be produced and evaluated against the
        ESA approved technical data.
        2.4.3. NEW MANUFACTURER OF ITEM (Category III) - This category covers
        offerors who do not meet Category I or II criteria but have the OEM’s technical data and
        intend to produce to the ESA approved technical data.
        2.4.4. ALTERNATE ITEM (CATEGORY IV) – These are SARs received from an
        offeror who is proposing an alternate part as the equivalent to the OEM part. These can
        be reverse engineered, but not reengineered components. Reengineering is the creation
        of an alternative design or manufacturing process and should be addressed via
        Engineering Change Process MIL-HDBK-61A, Configuration Management Guidance.
        2.4.5. FAA PMA approved parts must be submitted under the SAR category that
        corresponds to how they were approved by the FAA. PMA items approved through
        identicality with licensing agreement should be submitted under SAR Category I, Actual
        Item. PMA items approved through identicality without licensing agreement should be
        submitted under SAR Category II, Similar Item. FAA PMA items approved under ―     test
        & computation‖ should be submitted under SAR Category IV, Alternate Item as the new
        design must be verified.
3. Responsibilities:
     3.1. HQ AFMC/A4:
        3.1.1. Serves as the AFMC OPR for the Source Approval Request (SAR) process for
        AFMC.
        3.1.2. Prepares, coordinates, and issues SAR policy consistent with AF and DoD efforts;
        ensures processes and procedures are implemented within AFMC.
        3.1.3. Coordinates SAR efforts with other DoD activities, federal agencies, and industry.
     3.2. Single Manager System Responsibilities:
        3.2.1. Responsible for OSS&E implementation, execution, and assurance for their
        system(s)/end-item(s) as assigned/applicable; may delegate OSS&E authority per AFI
        63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering. May serve as an Engineering Support Activity
        (ESA).
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    7


  3.3. Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) and other Supply Chain
  Manager responsibilities: Serves as the ESA for owned/managed items (with the exception
  of some design unstable and other items as determined) as well as a number of DLA items
  (as applicable). ESA for AF items is established through delegated/documented agreements
  with System Program Managers/System Support Managers.
  3.4. Engineering Support Activity (ESA) Responsibilities: The ESA is the Chief
  Engineer (system or item) and Subordinate Lead Engineers/System Engineers delegated with
  OSS&E authority/responsibility from the single manager.
     3.4.1. Determines the need for establishing a qualification requirement per FAR 9.204
     (a) and prepares the source qualification requirements statement using attachment 2 as a
     guideline. Per FAR 9.204 (a)(1), the ESA will ensure that a notice seeking additional
     sources or products for qualification is periodically published in FedBizOpps. The ESA
     will maintain a record of each publication. Only those qualification requirements which
     are least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the qualification requirements shall
     be specified.
     3.4.2. Evaluates the source approval request packages and estimates the costs for testing
     and evaluation which a potential offeror will incur to become qualified using attachment
     3 as a guideline.
     3.4.3. If unreasonable to specify the pre-award qualification requirements, a two year
     request for waiver of this requirement (for the development of the pre-award
     requirements qualification) can be made using attachment 4 as a guideline. Reasons for
     the waiver may include:
         3.4.3.1. Extensive design engineering effort to determine exact requirements.
         3.4.3.2. Limited government technical expertise to determine exact requirements.
         3.4.3.3. Design instability of the article.
     3.4.3.4. 4 The government does not possess either the information or the rights to the
     engineering data required to develop the qualification requirements and it is cost
     prohibitive to obtain those rights.
     3.4.4. In accordance with FAR 9.202(b) on waiver requirements, the determination must
     be submitted first to the Competition Advocate for review and comment and then
     submitted for approval to the designated Head of the Procuring Activity (HPA), or
     delegee. The procuring activity is defined per AFMC Federal Acquisition Regulation
     Supplement (AFMCFARS) 5306.501.
     3.4.5. Forward the qualification requirement or an approved waiver to the ALC Data
     Analysis Section and a copy to the requesting organization.
     3.4.6. Upon receipt of a source approval request, the ESA will evaluate and determine
     approval/disapproval of the potential source. The ESA will perform a comprehensive
     evaluation to determine if the prospective source complies with quantitative and
     qualitative pre-award qualification requirements.
         3.4.6.1. The checklist provided in attachment 5, or tailored as approved by the ESA,
         will be used to ensure consistent and thorough evaluation for Category I-IV.
8                                                      AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


       3.4.6.2. Common use items require coordination and approval by the other weapon
       systems or services prior to source approval. A common use item coordination sheet
       is provided at attachment 7.
    3.4.7. Approval of new sources will be contingent upon the ESAs determination (as
    outlined in paragraph 3.3.6) that the prospective source has satisfied the pre-award
    qualification requirements. In addition to comprehensive Qualification Testing, submittal
    of engineering data and evaluation of samples, typical pre-award qualification
    requirements may include but are not limited to the following elements:
       3.4.7.1. Product verification testing.
       3.4.7.2. Quality assurance measures.
       3.4.7.3. Plant facility reviews and tooling inspection consistent with the new program
       requirements for Manufacturing Readiness Assessments (MRA’s) and Manufacturing
       Readiness Levels (MRL’s).
       3.4.7.4. Form, fit, function and interface verification of a part.
    3.4.8. If the ESA is planning to consider qualification by similarity, a comprehensive
    analysis of the differences and the similarities (as opposed to just the similarities)
    between the item proposed by the prospective source versus the current or original item
    must be accomplished by the prospective source as a key element of the pre-award
    qualification requirements and must be evaluated subsequently by the ESA.
       3.4.8.1. The comprehensive analysis of the SAR must contain a detailed engineering
       evaluation of the two items that is reasonably proportioned to the complexity of the
       current or original item.
       3.4.8.2. Typical elements of such an analysis of the SAR include: design features
       including circuits, components, electrical characteristics, mechanical/physical
       characteristics, select-at-test components, characteristic-matched components,
       engineering design shortcuts, grounding, plating, composites, component reliability,
       sub-assembly integration, manufacturing (comparative capacity assessments, tooling
       analysis for both new and old, shop floor procedures, work instructions, and process
       control characteristics as well as how they’re managed), limited-life parts availability,
       obsolescence, test methodology and tested performance as well as form, fit, and
       function.
       3.4.8.3. If correlating experience (qualification by similarity) is useful in determining
       a potential offeror’s ability to meet the qualification requirements, use the information
       in attachment 2 in the qualification justification to promote the use of Category II
       submissions. If no correlating experience is applicable, the potential offeror must
       meet other source qualification requirements defined in attachment 2 through the use
       of Category I, III, & IV submissions.
    3.4.9. If a decision on the manufacturer's request for approval cannot be provided within
    30 days (60 days for items not on active solicitation), provide a written response to the
    requestor (Small Business Office or procurement contracting officer if there is an active
    solicitation) as to when the evaluation will be complete. When the evaluation is
    complete, provide a written response to the requestor as to the success or failure of the
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   9


     potential offeror in meeting the qualification requirements. The system/product engineer
     will also provide specific reasons for disapproval to the requestor.
     3.4.10. Timely update of engineering drawings, as required shall be accomplished by the
     ESA to add additional source(s) as an outgrowth of approval of SAR proposal packages.
     Copies of signed/approved/released Engineering Orders (EO) for the item and next
     higher assemblies shall be provided to the system Equipment Specialist for updating of
     Technical Orders (TO), as well as cataloging action for new NSN(s). Copies of such EOs
     shall also be submitted for JEDMICs utilization. More than one P/N (OEM and non-
     OEM) may be listed under the same NSN. The owning-service IPT may decide to create
     a new NSN if it is determined to be in the best interests for their program or if upon
     approval of a Category IV SAR it is determined that a new NSN is needed (i.e. common
     item not approved by all services). That NSN must then be linked to the sub master NSN
     to show equivalency, and order of use, and to facilitate competitive procurement of the
     item if applicable, by appropriate source of supply for the use of the approving service.
  3.5. The Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) (who is part of the Single Manager
  organization) Duties:
     3.5.1. The contracting officer shall follow FAR 9.202(c) if a potential offeror (or its
     product) meets the standards established for qualification or can meet them before the
     date specified in the contract. Also, the contracting officer shall follow the FAR 9.202(e)
     procedures to not delay a proposed award in order to provide a potential offeror with an
     opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification. If
     a Program Manager determines that timeliness of the acquisition will not allow a delay
     for SAR proposal package evaluation, the PCO will document the supporting rationale in
     the contract file for that acquisition and provide notification back to the Small Business
     Office for possible future requirements. The ESA shall continue with the engineering
     evaluation of the SAR proposal package and take the appropriate actions upon conclusion
     of the project.
     3.5.2. The PCO will forward any source approval packages received in response to a
     solicitation directly to the ESA for processing. The PCO will also notify the SB Office
     Source Development Specialist (SDS) and make available a copy of the SAR and final
     disposition, if requested.
     3.5.3. If a SAR is received for a DLA managed item, it should be forwarded to the
     appropriate DLA center.
  3.6. Small Business Office Duties:
     3.6.1. In accordance with AFI 64-201, the SDS manages the source development
     program at the ALCs. If a SAR package is received for an item managed by another
     Center, it must be forwarded to that Centers SDS, and the responsibilities identified in
     paragraphs 3.6.1.1 through 3.5.1.6 and 3.5.2 become the responsibility of the Center
     which manages the item. For items managed by a weapon system at a Product Center,
     the responsibilities identified in paragraphs 3.5.1.1 through 3.5.1.6 and paragraph 3.5.2
     would be the responsibility of the weapon system single manager. Weapon system single
     managers may apply the following requirements on prime contractors, but the method of
10                                                       AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


        compliance should not be limited by the examples in this instruction. Any requirements
        applied to prime contractors must be applied through their contract.
           3.6.1.1. The SDS acts as the primary liaison with industry on all SAR proposal
           packages that are not in active solicitation. The receipt of a SAR proposal package
           from industry is the starting point in the process. If a SAR proposal package is
           received against an active current acquisition, the SDS will forward the SAR proposal
           package to the PCO for disposition.
           3.6.1.2. The SDS monitors source approval requests, participates in source
           development surveys and market surveys (not to be confused with a Market Research
           Report which is a joint effort performed by the ESA, Program Manager, Item
           Manager, Equipment Specialist, Buyer/PCO and SBS), to include the initiation of
           sources sought synopses.
           3.6.1.3. Upon request by a prospective source/offeror, the SDS explains the pre-
           award qualification process, provides the pre-award qualification requirements as
           prescribed by the ESA, and disseminates the resultant SAR proposal packages. See
           Attachment 6 for a sample SAR format for prospective sources/offerors.
           3.6.1.4. The SDS reviews the non-technical aspects of any SAR proposal package
           received, to ensure compliance with submittal format, presence of relevant
           documentation and information, then forwards SAR proposal packages to the ESA for
           evaluation.
           3.6.1.5. If the ESA approves a SAR proposal package, SDS will provide the Data
           Analysis Section a copy of the SAR approval notice for updating of the existing
           AFMC Form 761, AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet.
           3.6.1.6. The SDS notifies the potential offeror if approved. If disapproved, notify the
           potential offeror and provide reasons for disapproval.
        3.6.2. Sources that were previously qualified and are now determined not qualified will
        be advised of the reasons in accordance with FAR 9.207. The ESA will provide the
        Small Business Office a valid, documented reason for requesting removal of the source
        consistent with the qualification requirements set forth in the written justification for
        qualification requirements and the specific reason the product no longer meets the
        specification. The Small Business Office will coordinate on the request and notify the
        source so that they may take action to become re-qualified. A copy of the notification
        letter, along with the attachments, will be forwarded to the Competition Advocate, and
        Data Analysis Section for updating the AFMC Form 761.
     3.7. Competition Advocate Duties:
        3.7.1. In accordance with FAR 9.202 (b) The Competition Advocate shall review all
        requests for waiver of the requirement to specify standards for qualification. The
        Competition Advocate review comments will be forwarded to the HPA or delegee for
        consideration in the decision to approve or disapprove the waiver request. The procuring
        activities are defined per AFMC Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
        (AFMCFARS) 5306.501.
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                             11


     3.7.2. At the request of the Small Business Office, the Competition Advocate will also
     review the justification for disapproved source qualification requests.
     3.7.3. Per AFI 63-301, Air Force Competition and Commercial Advocacy Program the
     Competition Advocate tracks competition data to ensure center competition goals,
     including the objectives of this policy, are met and reported to HQ AFMC on an annual
     basis.
  3.8. Data Analysis Section:
     3.8.1. Provides source qualification requirements, as requested and documented by ESA,
     to Small Business Office.
     3.8.2. Maintains current information on source qualification.
     3.8.3. Requests ESA prepare a pre-award qualification requirements or waiver if they do
     not exist and are required.

       FAR 9.202(a) Policy as amended by DFARS 209.270-4(a)(2) Procedures



Section A: Item Identification

1. Stock Number (NSN): _________________________________________

2. Part Number (P/N): ___________________________________________

3. Noun: ______________________________________________________

4. Application: _________________________________________________

Section B: Justification For Establishing a Qualification Requirement and Reason
Why Qualification Requirement Must Be Demonstrated Prior to Any Contract Award.
(Section B may be documented separately, providing the separate document contains
Section A, identification and Section D, signature requirements as identified in this
attachment.)

(Identify in this section criticality of part, defining criticality in terms of failure which
would result in loss of weapon system or life or extensive secondary damage; complexity
of part, special material or manufacturing process; and rationale why requirements must
be met prior to any contract awards. Include the hazardous consequence of not
performing tests as pre-award qualification test and specify why tests can not be
conducted post award. Address only the item circumstances. Do Not Identify the
particular material, processing procedures, testing, etc. These are to be part of Section C:
Qualification Requirements).

For example:

1. Characteristics associated with machining and processing of the components within
this assembly can result in product structural or durability degradation. Close tolerance
matching of components is required. Special care and attention is required for surface
finish, assembly, and sealing of this item to assure compliance with specified acceptance
 18                                                         AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


test requirements.

2. The qualification requirements specified herein are necessary to verify the structural
and/or functional integrity and/or fit and form of the item being procured.

3. Failure to procure these items from a fully qualified source can result in structural or
functional deficiencies that will compromise the mission capability of the respective
weapon system.

4. Completion of the specified pre-contract award qualification requirements will assure
the government that the offeror is capable of producing the item in compliance with the
applicable technical specification/data and within the schedule and economic constraints
of our contracts. There are significant technical and schedule risks which can only be
minimized by a completion of the requirements prior to contract award.

Section C: Qualification Requirements That Must be Satisfied to Become a Qualified
Source and Qualification Waiver Requirements.

Identify specific detailed requirements for the item, material, processing or test
procedures. Limit requirements to least restrictive. Pre-award qualification requirements
shall contain comprehensive requirements for ensuring the preservation of the OSS&E-
approved configuration baseline. The ESA must take into consideration the risk of
performance degradation when new manufacturers attempt to produce replacements for
older technology items which they did not design.

Identify any item security restrictions, site survey requirements, and ability to obtain
contract security of facility clearance. Identify forging requirements, special tooling,
special testing, etc. Identify other means of becoming qualified, such as manufacturing
similar item or part for prime contractor and providing verification documentation of
such.

For example:

1. Prequalification Notice. The offeror shall notify the Small Business Office or, if
responding to a solicitation, the contracting officer in Center PKs, of intent to qualify as a
source for this item.

2. Facilities. The offeror must certify to the government that he has the required
facilities and equipment to manufacture, inspect, test, package, and store the item. The
offeror shall make his facilities, equipment, tooling, and personnel available for
evaluation and inspection by the government.

3. Data Verification. The offeror must verify that he has a complete data package. This
verification must include a complete list of all drawings and specifications, including
change notices, in the offeror’s possession. The offeror may also be required to produce
copies of the drawings or specifications.

4. Manufacture. The offeror must manufacture this item to conform to the government
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     19


requirements as prescribed within the ESA -approved engineering data package. The
offeror must show compliance with Unique Identification (UID) requirements in
accordance with DFARS 211.274 as prescribed within the ESA-approved engineering
data package. The offeror must provide, at their own expense, data showing the results of
all quality, performance, and environmental evaluations conducted by the offeror to show
compliance with the government requirements as prescribed by the ESA. The offeror
shall also identify its sources for materials and its standards for internally used processes.
If the item considered a safety critical item or contains critical characteristics then the
offeror must also provide evidence in the form of a management process in which they
will manage Critical Safety Items (CSI’s) and all of the critical characteristics.

5. Test and Evaluation and/or Verification. The offeror, at his own expense, shall
prepare and submit to the design control authority (________), for their prior approval, a
qualification test plan/procedure detailing how he intends to verify compliance with all
performance, environmental, mechanical and quality assurance requirements identified
by Drawing (________). After completion of the approved qualification testing, the
offeror shall be required to submit a complete test report of the results to the design
control authority (_______) for their review and approval prior to the contract award.
The government retains the right to exercise the option to inspect the testing processes,
including on-site witnessing of any or all documented testing. To allow accomplishing
this, the offeror shall notify the government at least 30 days in advance of the occurrence
of any testing that will be used as a basis for qualification. The offeror’s facilities shall
be made available for government inspection during these tests.

6. Article Verification. The offeror must provide, at his own expense, a pre-contract
award qualification article for evaluation by the government. This article must comply
with all of the requirements of Specification Control Drawing (_________). This article
shall be subjected to a form, fit and function evaluation to demonstrate compatibility with
the weapon system and to evaluate the manufacturing capability of the offeror.
Successful offerors shall be identified as an approved source for this item. However,
successful completion of the qualification testing does not guarantee any contract award.
If the offeror is deemed qualified and awarded the contract, a post-contract award first
article exhibit may be required to verify production capability.

7. Waiver. Sources who meet any of the following Source Qualification Waiver Criteria
(QWC) may apply for a waiver of all or part of the qualification requirements. If a
waiver is granted and the offeror is awarded a contract, the offeror may still be required
to provide a post-contract award first article exhibit to verify production capability:

QWC1: The potential source submits written certification that the articles have been
supplied to the government or original equipment manufacturer (e.g., DD Form 250,
Material Inspection and Receiving Report, Purchase Order invoice, e.g.).

QWC2: The potential source is qualified on the right-hand article and requests to be
qualified on the left-hand article. If the right-and left-hand articles are mirror images of
each other, then approval can generally be given.
 20                                                        AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


QWC3: A source qualified to provide an assembly is usually qualified to provide
subassemblies, major components, and items of that assembly.

QWC4: A source qualified to provide earlier dash numbers of a basic P/N may be
qualified to provide other dash numbers of that same basic P/N, provided there is no
increase in complexity, criticality, or other relevant requirements.

QWC5: A source qualified to provide a similar or like item can be qualified to provide
the required item. However, for approval, the engineering authority must verify that
there is no increase in complexity, criticality, or other requirements over that of the
similar item. At a minimum, the source shall provide a complete set of drawings for the
similar item and written proof, such as purchase orders, shipping documents, etc., to
show that the similar item was provided to the original equipment manufacturer or DoD.

QWC6: A source previously qualified to provide an item, but which has been purchased,
sold, merged, absorbed, reformed, split, etc., may qualify if it can be established that the
qualification is currently with the requester and that the requester has the same or
equivalent facilities, tooling, equipment, personnel, and utilizes the original forging,
castings, etc., in the manufacturing process.

               SOURCE APPROVAL REQUEST CONTENTS CHECKLIST

                     Source Approval Request Contents Checklist

6.1. Purpose

The purpose of this Exhibit is to provide additional guidance for preparing a Source
Approval Request (SAR).

6.2. Definitions

This information pertains to items identified as requiring source approval. These alternate
source approval procedures apply only to new, manufactured items. This exhibit does not
address ROMM or surplus items.

       1. A CSI, as defined in Public Law 108-136 ―  National Defense Authorization
          Act for Fiscal Year 2004‖, Section 802, Quality Control in Procurement of
          Aviation Critical Safety Items and Related Services, is:
               "A part, assembly, installation equipment, launch equipment,
               recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or
               aviation weapon system if the part, assembly, or equipment
               contains a characteristic any failure, malfunction, or absence of
               which could cause:
                   - a catastrophic or critical failure resulting in the loss of or
                     serious damage to the aircraft or weapon system;
                   - an unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life; or
                   - an uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety."

       1.   DoD-STD-2101 defines a critical characteristic as:
              "A characteristic that analysis indicates likely, if defective, to
              create or increase a hazard to human safety, or to result in failure
              of a weapons system or major system to perform a required
              mission."

               A CAI, as defined in the Multi-Service/Defense Agency CSI
               Instruction is: ―
                               An item that is essential to weapon system
               performance or operation, or the preservation of life or safety of
               operating personnel, as determined by the military services.‖
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    49


6.3. Guidance

a. For items not coded full and open competition, only those sources previously
approved by the Government will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new
supplier is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of the new
source.

   If a potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that
   the potential offeror (or its product) meets the standards established for source
   approval or can meet them before the date specified for award of the contract, a
   potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an
   offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror is not currently approved.

   Please note that if evaluation of the source approval request cannot be processed in
   time to meet logistics support requirements, award will be made to a currently
   approved source. The request can still be processed for consideration against future
   requirements.

   The submission of complete documentation as specified in this guide is essential for
   consideration of the source approval request. If the documentation is inadequate or
   incomplete, the submitter will be notified of deficiencies for potential resubmittals.

b. Source Approval Categories -- there are basically four conditions under which Source
Approval Requests (SARs) will be categorized:

       1.  SAR Category I, Actual Item. - These SARs are received from suppliers
          who have manufactured or performed ROMM on the exact item to the OEM
          technical data for the prime contractor, OEM, another service or, a civil sector
          under FAA PMA identicality. The item will be produced and evaluated
          against the ESA approved technical data package.
       2. SAR Category II, Similar Item– These SARs are received from suppliers
          who have not previously manufactured, repaired, or overhauled the subject
          item, but have manufactured or performed ROMM on items similar in
          complexity, design, criticality, manufacturing/repair/overhaul processes,
          materials, and application for the a) Prime Contractor, OEM, or another
          service using OEM data, or b) civil sector under FAA PMA based on
          identicality. The item will be produced and evaluated against the ESA
          approved technical data package.
 50                                                      AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010


       3. SAR Category III, New Manufacturer of Item - This category covers
          offerors who do not meet Category I or II criteria but have the OEM’s
          technical data and intend to produce to the ESA approved technical data
          package.
       4. SAR Category IV, Alternate Item - These are SARs received from an
          offeror who is proposing an alternate part as the equivalent to the OEM part.
          These can be reverse engineered, but not reengineered components.
          Reengineering is the creation of an alternative design or manufacturing
          process and should be addressed via Engineering Change Process MIL-
          HDBK-61A, Configuration Management Guidance. Reverse engineering is
          discussed in more detail in Section 1.9 and in Chapter 4 of the main body of
          this Handbook and may require a new NSN be assigned. Alternate items may
          only be considered when the Sourcing Handbook Section 1.9 criteria are met.

c. If a dealer/distributor (non-manufacturing source) of the item is seeking approval as a
source, the category to which the actual manufacturer belongs will apply for purposes of
approval procedures. This is because the Dealer/Distributor is not approved as an
approved source, but rather as an authorized Dealer/Distributor to an approved source.
The actual manufacturer is defined as that supplier with plant equipment and personnel to
manufacture, on the premises, the item for which approval is requested. Therefore, the
name, address and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code of the supplier
(actual manufacturer) is required and must be provided for consideration of source
approval together with all data supporting the category for which approval applies.
Approval of a dealer/distributor is based upon the traceability to an approved source and
approval of the dealer/distributor will be removed from the approved source list if the
distributor changes their proposed source after approval. The source
evaluation/approval procedures apply only to newly-manufactured items. Surplus
offers are not covered by these procedures.

d. To reduce the time required for processing a SAR, it is important for the potential
supplier to provide ALL of the required information when submitting a SAR.
Submission of a complete SAR is the best method for obtaining timely review.
Additional information, documentation and/or samples may be required for any SAR
category to allow for further evaluation of the submitting company's request; however,
the submission of the requested information does not guarantee approval. In some cases,
qualification parts may be required as determined by the technical evaluation to be used
for testing which may include, but not be limited to, performance and/or endurance
testing. Regardless of the SAR category, a site survey of the facility may be conducted to
further evaluate the requestor's capabilities.

e. A SAR package should be submitted for one (1) part or assembly per request.
However, a supplier may request permission from the ESA to submit one SAR for a
family of parts made to the same drawing or specification.

f. The SAR information and documentation can be submitted in two formats, Compact
Disk (CD) or hard copy. The preferred method for SAR documentation is digitally on
    AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    51


    CD. If the data are submitted via a contractor produced CD, it can only be accepted in

    .PDF format.

           NOTE: Many suppliers consider this information competition sensitive and have
           been reluctant to disclose. DoD personnel will ensure that adequate safeguards
           are taken to prevent this or any other proprietary data from being disclosed to
           third parties.

    g. FAA PMA approved manufacturers must submit their SAR under the appropriate SAR
    category. PMA items approved through identicality where the supplier has manufactured
    the actual item should be submitted under SAR Category I, Actual Item. PMA items
    approved through identicality where the supplier has manufactured a similar item, should
    be submitted under SAR Category II, Similar Item. Suppliers who have PMA approval
    for the subject part by identicality but have never actually manufactured the subject item
    or a similar item should be submitted under SAR Category III. PMA items approved
    under ― test & computation‖ should be submitted under SAR Category IV, Alternate Item
    as the new design must be verified.

PMA part (if different). If you have never provided the part to any customer, identify this
in your package. All documents in this section should be dated, and shipping documents
should account for all items ordered. All financial information should be removed from
these documents. It is important that documented performance is recent in order to
adequately reflect the current manufacturing capabilities of the proposed supplier.
Therefore, contract performance documentation included in SARs must be submitted no
later than three (3) years for CSI and no later than seven (7) years for CAI after the date
of last delivery, as evidenced by latest shipping document. The threshold should apply
on the date the SAR is received by the procuring activity or IMM. If a contract was
terminated, the reason for termination should be included in this section. The data
provided in this section should be for the same contract(s) as those provided in SAR
Elements L and M.

Platform/Subsystem: Aircraft and subsystem(s) on which the part is used.

Issue Description: Self-explanatory; should include any details of a proposed new CAGE for
inclusion.

Recommended Closure: Originating Service’s near-term and long-range recommendations for
completing this coordination.

Assessment: Service POCs will be assigned to provide coordination between all affected
Services and DLA. Help POCs from each Service will be available to assist in the process.
Service POCs will be identified by the Help POCs, and will work non-controversial actions to
their conclusion. When there are differences that cannot be resolved at the Help POC level, the
problem resolution process will take place at the lowest level possible. Lack of resolution will
result in elevation to the head of the engineering activity for each affected ESA.

Intraservice Programs Affected and Assessment: In those instances where an item requiring
AFMCI23-113 14 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     63


Inter-service coordination affects more than one weapon system/program within a given Service,
this section can be used to identify and coordinate intraservice resolution of the item of concern.

Review Comments: Self-explanatory.

A continuation sheet may be used as required for any areas.

PLATFORM/SUBSYSTEM: H-60

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:

       Based on Category I QDR, System Engineer for Army requested addition of item to
       CSI list. Part failure causes damage to Main Rotor Spindle, which could result in loss
       of blade and aircraft.

RECOMMENDED CLOSURE:

       This DLA-managed item should be categorized as CSI due to similar QDR on HH-
       60H part. Chicago Rawhide (CR, CAGE 80201) removed temporarily as source at
       least until CCs Identified. Need other Service coordination on CCs prior to source
       reapproval process for CR. Lord Corporation remains as source.

RECOMMENDED CLOSURE:

       Recommend that Services discuss and come up with a common determination and
       AMC/AMSC code. Part is used in same location and application for each Service, so
       determination should be the same.
