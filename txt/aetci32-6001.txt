1. Availability of Government Quarters:
   1.1. Government-owned quarters are not always available for members of AFRS and AFOATS; they
   must often compete in the private community for adequate quarters. Due to the high cost and limited
   availability of adequate quarters in many areas, members are often required to spend a disproportion-
   ate share of their total pay and allowances and (or) travel excessive distances to secure suitable living
   accommodations.
   1.2. The GLQ program provides adequate quarters for members whose duty location prevents suit-
   able quarters on military installations. Members who meet the eligibility requirements of this instruc-
   tion and are assigned to locations where surveys validate the no availability of adequate quarters at or
   below the leased quarter’s eligibility cost (LQEC) may be considered for GLQ.
   1.3. HQ AFRS, Real Estate and Logistics Branch (HQ AFRS/RSXL), has oversight responsibility for
   AFRS members; the (HQ AFOATS/SDFA) has oversight responsibility for AFOATS members.

2. Eligibility for GLQ. A member is eligible for GLQ if all of the following conditions apply:
   2.1. Member (AFRS or AFOATS) is eligible for basic allowance for housing (BAH). If BAH is at the
   with-dependent rate (except military married to military) the dependents must accompany the mem-
   ber. In cases of joint custody of common dependents, only the military member who receives BAH at
   the “with dependent” rate is eligible.
   2.2. Member's duty station is located 20 miles or more than a 1-hour commute (one way), during nor-
   mal commute traffic, from a military installation with housing or a family housing lease program,
   whichever is longer. The commute time is measured from the entry into the housing area if they have
   housing and from wing headquarters if they have a lease program.
   2.3. The cost of adequate community quarters (including rent and utilities, exclusive of telephone and
   television cable costs) exceeds member’s LQEC.
   2.4. Member has more than 12 months of retention at current duty location at the estimated date of
   lease consummation. This restriction applies only to the initial lease for a member.

3. Furniture and Furnishings. Quarters acquired by government lease for unaccompanied personnel
are furnished with basic items of furniture necessary to make the quarters livable. Attachment 2 lists
authorized and unauthorized furnishings. The occupant with squadron commander’s authorization may
request to lease unfurnished GLQ. Government-owned furniture will not be issued to members for use in
furnished or unfurnished privately leased units.

4. Programs Division (HQ AETC/A7CP) Responsibilities. The program manager will:
   4.1. Program for government quarters lease authorization and requisite funds.
   4.2. Serve as the overall GLQ program coordinator as follows:
       4.2.1. Allocate funding to HQ AFRS and HQ AFOATS.
       4.2.2. Establish and maintain case file for high-cost leases.
       4.2.3. Review for accuracy all high-cost lease reports and forward to the Housing Division (HQ
       USAF/A7CH).
4                                                                       AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


5. HQ AFRS/RSXL and HQ AFOATS/SDFA Responsibilities. (Note: These organizations are the
OPRs for managing the lease programs in AFRS and AFOATS, respectively.) These organizations will:
    5.1. Appoint a program manager and establish organizational guidelines.
    5.2. Determine requirements for their respective programs.
    5.3. Prepare and coordinate budget estimates and financial plans. Submit requirements and budget
    estimates to HQ AETC/A7CP.
    5.4. Budget for operations and maintenance (3400) associated with drayage and storage of household
    goods (HHG).
    5.5. Allocate funds to their units.
    5.6. Establish a priority system for assigning available homes to eligible personnel.
    5.7. Serve as the primary point of contact with appropriate US Army Corps of Engineers (COE) dis-
    tricts for lease acquisition, management, renewal, and cancellation actions.
    5.8. Ensure lease documentation and records keeping are accomplished according to this instruction,
    organizational guidelines, and upward reporting requirements.
    5.9. Monitor lease, utility, and service payments to ensure annual costs remain within statutory limits.
    5.10. Review and verify lease documentation.
    5.11. Approve or disapprove normal leases, and disapprove or recommend approval of high-cost
    leases to HQ AETC/A7CP.
    5.12. Establish and maintain electronic lease files.
    5.13. When leases have not been consummated within 33 days following the requested effective date,
    dispatch formal status requests to the COE.
    5.14. When a pending cancellation of a previously approved lease requires establishing a new lease,
    simultaneously process both actions. The effective date of the new lease will not be more than 10 days
    prior to the effective cancellation date of the existing lease.
    5.15. Forward quarterly high-cost lease reports to HQ AETC/A7CP by the fifth calendar day of Jan-
    uary, April, July, and October.

6. Unit (Squadron or Detachment) Responsibilities. The unit commander:
    6.1. Notifies incoming personnel of availability of housing and GLQ.
    6.2. Ensures that members understand this program is not an entitlement but a privilege.

     6.11.1. Communicates or negotiates terms or prices with the lessor, prospective lessors, or agents.
     6.11.2. Provides other remuneration in the form of money, goods, or services to lessors or agents
     for leases and associated utility and service costs as listed in this instruction.
  6.12. Ensures member does not draw BAH during the period leased quarters are occupied. Also
  ensure each member acknowledges in writing, that:
     6.12.1. He or she is expected to reside in the quarters for at least 1 year.
     6.12.2. Vacating leased quarters without proper written authorization will result in forfeiture of
     BAH, when appropriate, for the remaining term of the lease or until relieved of responsibility by
     both the commander and HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA, as applicable.
  6.13. Ensures utility and service connections are provided and establishes billing procedures when
  the lessor does not furnish authorized utilities as a part of the lease.
  6.14. Acts as mediator for issues that the member and lessor cannot resolve to include maintenance

6                                                                       AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


    cial or otherwise) negotiated between the lessor and the member is a private matter; the government is
    neither involved nor obligated in any capacity.
    6.22. Advises members to seek competent legal assistance before entering into any legally binding
    contract. They should request a clause providing for the prompt refund of security, damage, and clean-
    ing deposits on consummation of a government lease and for rent paid during the same period paid by
    the government. Also provide a statement allowing lease cancellation within a reasonable period of
    time should a government lease not be consummated.

7. Member’s Responsibilities. (Note: See Attachment 5 for a sample checklist.) The member:
    7.1. Fulfills the obligations usually imposed on personnel occupying government quarters, adminis-
    trative requirements established by this instruction and other responsibilities specified in the lease
    document. See specific responsibilities in paragraph 6.12.

       ters which will not accept a government lease.
AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007                                                                               7

   SDFA.
   8.5. Submits a projected annual cost estimate for required utilities to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
   AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) as part of the lease package, when a lease is negotiated without utili-
   ties and services. The projected cost should be based on area utility consumption cost estimates.
   8.6. Submits necessary documentation to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for
   review and verification of leases.
   8.7. Documents actions using a US government lease for real property.

   8.9. Sends HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) the required information for
   establishing the USAF Installation Characteristics Report (RCS: SAF-MII(AR) 7119), using the AF
   IMT 1192, USAF Installations Characteristics Report). (Note: AF IMT 1192 is prescribed in AFI
   32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting; refer to that publication for guidance on filling
   out the form.)

9. Leasing Procedures. See paragraphs 10. through 16. for procedures to help program managers, units,
and the COE determine requirements, select prospective quarters, calculate lease costs, identify special
leasing considerations, enter into a lease agreement, account for real property, and assign or retain quar-
ters, respectively.

10. Determining Requirements:
   10.1. HQ AFRS/RSXL and HQ AFOATS/SDFA will work with their units to determine which loca-
   tions qualify for this program. When a situation dictates that leased quarters are required, a unit will
   submit a request with supporting data, requesting lease approval and funding.
   10.2. HQ AFRS/RSXL and HQ AFOATS/SDFA should contact their servicing COE concerning the
   availability of quarters leased for other agencies.
   10.3. If adequate quarters are already under lease and are vacant or will be vacated within a reason-
   able period of time--up to 90 days pending HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS approval, these quarters
   will be offered to the member rather than requesting a new lease. Refusal of assignment to such quar-
   ters normally eliminates the member from any further consideration for GLQ.
   10.4. Bedroom entitlement for adequate quarters will be determined by grade, family size, and family
   composition. Use AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management, Table 4.2, to determine bedroom
   requirement based on grade; use Table 4.3 to determine bedroom requirement based on family size
   and composition.

11. Selecting Prospective Quarters:
   11.1. Before selection can begin, HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) will for-
   ward a lease request to the COE to begin lease action based on information submitted by the unit.
   Note: A lease request to the COE cannot be issued unless lease points and funding for quarters and
   (or) operations and maintenance (O&M) are available.
8                                                                          AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


    11.2. The COE must identify a representative sample (at least three of leasing prospects that meet the
    member’s entitlements and are within commuting distance). Size limitations are specified in AFI
    32-6002, Family Housing Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction. It is desired, but not
    mandatory, that the interior of the quarters meet the functional requirements outlined in AFI 32-6002.
    Quarters will contain a range and refrigerator and may contain other appliances. Also, other amenities
    such as washer and dryer hookups, heating and air-conditioning appropriate for the location, tele-
    phone outlets, and utility systems will be provided.
    11.3. Quarters will not be considered for lease unless the lessor provides maintenance.

12. Calculating Total Lease Costs (TLC):
    12.1. Include annual rents paid to the lessor for use of facilities:
       12.1.1. Utility deposits. (If required, utility deposits must be included in the annual cost of the
       lease.)
       12.1.2. Annual costs for allowable utilities and services.
    12.2. Do not include administrative and overhead costs attributable to travel, inspection, etc., experi-
    enced by COE districts and Air Force organizations.

13. COE Leasing Considerations:
    13.1. If a military installation with family housing or a family housing lease program is within 20
    miles or a 1-hour commute of the duty location, terminate all further leasing actions and notify HQ
    AFRS/RSSO or HQ AFOATS/SDFA, as appropriate.
    13.2. If TLC of any adequate quarter’s candidate is below the member's LQEC, terminate all further
    leasing actions and notify HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA, as appropriate.
    13.3. A waiver is required if selected quarters exceed the fair market value and no other adequate
    quarters meet the member's requirements. Submit the analysis of the prospective quarters to HQ
    AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) and request a waiver.
    13.4. Leases will not include, as a separate cost item, parking for any vehicle nor will separate leases
    or agreements be entered into for such facilities at government expense.

14. Entering Into a Lease Agreement:
    14.1. After verifying the cost of available adequate quarters, the COE will determine the best candi-
    date for the government to lease. The COE will submit a request package to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
    AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable). As a minimum, the package must contain the member's request for
    leased quarters, COE market survey results depicting the lease candidates and total costs, location of
    the nearest military installation (in miles and commute time), and a rental determination. The package
    must also include certification (on letterhead or COE Leased Government Housing RFMIS-NT Pro-
    gram document) recommended quarters are the least expensive adequate quarters in the commute area
    available within the next 33 days.
    14.2. After the lease is approved, the COE will immediately send the lease to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
    AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for execution. The COE will provide documentation to the unit and
    HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA.
AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007                                                                            9


   14.3. A high-cost lease requires HQ AETC/A7CP coordination and HQ USAF/A7CH approval. HQ
   AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) will review the package, verify the documenta-
   tion is accurate, and based on this information, either disapprove or recommend approval to HQ
   AETC/A7CP.
      14.3.1. If the lease is approved, HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) will for-
      ward the package to HQ AETC/A7CP for review and approval.
      14.3.2. If the lease is disapproved, HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) will
      annotate why, inform the unit and COE, and ensure lease actions are terminated.
      14.3.3. HQ AETC/A7CP will review the lease package and forward to HQ USAF/A7CH within
      48 hours.
      14.3.4. If the lease is approved, HQ AETC/A7CP notifies HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/
      SDFA (as applicable) to proceed with the lease actions. If the lease is disapproved, HQ AETC/
      A7CP directs HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) to discontinue action on
      the lease.
      14.3.5. In turn, HQ AFRS/RSXL or AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) will inform the parties
      involved whether the lease has been approved or disapproved. If approved, the COE provides the
      lease agreement to AFRS or AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for execution. If disapproved, HQ
      AFRS/RSXL or AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) ensures all COE lease actions are terminated.

15. Accounting for Real Property. After a lease agreement is finalized, the COE sends HQ AFRS/
RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) the required information for establishing the USAF Instal-
lation Characteristics Report, AF IMT 1192 (RCS: SAF-MII(AR)7119).

16. Assigning or Retaining Quarters:
   16.1. When the unit receives an executed lease, it will initiate AF Form 594, Application and Autho-
   rization to Start, Stop, or Change Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or Dependency Redetermina-
   tion, providing the date the member (or members) was assigned quarters. (Note: If a military member
   is married to another military member, both forfeit their BAH.) Send completed forms to the financial
   services office (FSO) that maintains the member's pay records.
   16.2. Within 15 days of occupancy, the commander (or designated representative), the lessor (or des-
   ignated representative), and the member jointly inspect the quarters. They should identify and docu-
   ment any discrepancies between COE-prepared forms initiated when identifying the property (ENG
   Form 3143, Joint Survey and Inspection of Condition of Government Leased Property; and ENG
   Form 3143a, Joint Survey and Inspection of Condition Leased Property, Section III–Interior Condi-
   tion of Individual Room). The member and the lessor will each keep one copy of the forms; the squad-
   ron keeps the original forms for use in determining condition of the quarters when the member vacates
   them.
   16.3. The commander or designated representative may allow quarters to remain vacant for periods of
   up to 30 days. If needed, extensions for an additional 60 days may be approved by HQ AFRS/RSXL
   or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable). Note: To allow quarters to remain vacant beyond 90 days
   requires HQ AETC/A7CP approval.
10                                                                        AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


17. Lease Forms and Clauses. Leases are formally documented by the COE. Regardless of the forms
used, the COE district attempts to obtain terms judged to be most favorable to the government and within
statutory thresholds. The commander, HQ AFRS or HQ AFOATS (if necessary), and the member will
review the lease thoroughly to ensure complete understanding of both the landlord's and the government's
responsibilities. Each lease:
     17.1. Requires the lessor to maintain the quarters and lessor-furnished appliances. This includes
     maintenance required due to fair wear and tear.
     17.2. Provides for payment of rents in arrears.
     17.3. Provides for prorating the rental fee for an effective date other than the first day of a month. For
     example, rental payment for a lease with an effective date of 20 August would be prorated for the
     period 20 through 31 August and then continued monthly (1 through 30 September, 1 through 31
     October, etc.).
     17.4. Provides for cancellation by the government with 30 days, but not more than 60 days, of written
     notice to the lessor.
     17.5. Contains the following clause:
     “The lessor hereby agrees that the rental consideration specified herein is the only consideration to be
     received for the demised premises and includes payment for all utilities, maintenance, and services
     specified herein. No other remuneration will be paid by the government member, his or her family, or
     any other person acting on the member's behalf.”

18. Lease Review. Commanders will review leases annually and when a member’s eligibility changes.
During the review, commanders will monitor lease expiration dates and advise HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) at least 90 days before any lease expiration.
     18.1. The commander will verify that the member occupying leased quarters is still eligible for GLQ.
     If a member is no longer eligible, the commander must determine whether it is cost-effective to main-
     tain GLQ for the remainder of the member’s time on station. If the commander believes it is
     cost-effective to allow the member to remain in GLQ, the commander must request approval from HQ
     AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable). If the lease is high cost, HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
     AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) must secure HQ AETC/A7CP approval.
     18.2. Members whose dependents no longer reside with them or members who no longer reside with
     their dependents are not eligible for GLQ. If this occurs to a member living in GLQ, the commander
     must take action to have the occupant vacate the quarters within 30 days unless it has been determined
     cost-effective to maintain the GLQ.

19. Lease Renewal:
     19.1. HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) must approve all GLQ renewals before
     the COE can negotiate a renewal lease agreement.
     19.2. Commanders must validate lease requirements for continuing the existing leases. After valida-
     tion and at least 90 days before the lease expiration, lease requirement will be submitted to HQ AFRS/
     RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for approval.
AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007                                                                               11


   19.3. The applicable office reviews the package and ensures sufficient funds are available. If funds
   are available and the annual total TLC does not exceed the normal cost lease limit of $12,000
   (adjusted annually), approval may be granted. If approved, the applicable office will contact the COE
   to renew the lease.
   19.4. If the TLC exceeds the normal cost lease limit but is less than $14,000 (adjusted annually), HQ
   AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) forwards the lease to HQ AETC/A7CP for
   review. HQ AETC/A7CP will forward to HQ USAF/A7CH for approval.
   19.5. HQ AETC/A7CP will forward the package to HQ USAF/A7CH within 48 hours.
   19.6. If the TLC for lease renewal exceeds the high-cost lease threshold, the applicable office notifies
   the COE to cancel the lease.

20. Payment. The member’s support base Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) pays lease
fees (monthly, in arrears) directly to the lessor according to AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property.
For AFRS, the DFAS also pays all charges for authorized utilities and services not provided by the lessor
directly to suppliers identified in the lease quarters utilities data.
   20.1. Leases. COE lease amendments are required to make rental or payment adjustments, except
   prorating rent according to binding contracts.
   20.2. Utilities. Utility charges are certified for payment in the same manner as lease charges. The
   squadron posts utilities suppliers’ bills to leased quarters using AETC Form 79. The squadron com-
   mander forwards the suppliers’ bills or invoices (segregated by lease number), written confirmation of
   services received, and the fund citation to support base DFAS. The squadron makes every effort to
   take advantage of discounts offered by suppliers for prompt payments. The squadron will forward a
   copy of AETC Form 79 to AFRS/RSXLR or HQ AFOATS/SDFA by the 15th of the following the
   month bills are posted.
   20.3. Lease Certification. By the 25th day of each month, the commander certifies in writing to the
   supporting FSOs all leases in effect that month. Certification indicates the fund citation and lists each
   lease by number, showing the individual to whom payment is due, the address to which the payment
   is to be forwarded, and the amount of payment authorized. Include explanatory remarks for leases
   where the authorized payment period or amount differs from the norm. A COE lease amendment is
   required to make rental or payment adjustments, except for prorating of rents in accordance with the
   lease.
   20.4. Restoration Charges:
       20.4.1. Members will be held liable for loss or damage to quarters, equipment, or furnishings
       caused by abuse or negligence of the members or their guests and for failure to satisfactorily clean
       assigned leased quarters on termination.
       20.4.2. The member may voluntarily correct damage or reimburse the government for charges to
       correct damage (DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, or DD Form 362, Statement of
       Charges/Cash Collection Voucher).
       20.4.3. When a member refuses to correct damages, the commander notifies the member in writ-
       ing of damage and estimated repair or replacement costs and requests a reply by endorsement,
       stating the member’s reasons for refusing to acknowledge liability.
12                                                                     AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


        20.4.4. A member's refusal to acknowledge liability requires a report of survey to be initiated.
        AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, prescribes requirements and proce-
        dures concerning reports of survey.
        20.4.5. Restoration charges are negotiated by the COE district and documented through a supple-
        mental agreement to the original lease. On receipt of a supplemental agreement for restoration
        charges from the COE district, the commander verifies charges, using ENG Form 3143 and ENG
        Form 3143a.
        20.4.6. Authority to make deductions from a military member's pay sufficient to cover the cost of
        necessary repairs, replacements, or cleaning is contained in Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.)
        2775, Liability of Members Assigned to Military Housing.

21. Lease Termination:
     21.1. Members’ Responsibilities. Members terminating assignment to leased quarters for any rea-
     son must advise their commander in writing at least 150 days before the date they plan to vacate. If
     permanent change of station (PCS) orders are received in a shorter timeframe, they will notify the
     commander as soon as possible.
     21.2. Termination for Personal Convenience:
        21.2.1. HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) may approve a member’s request
        for lease termination for personal convenience. Normally, the member must have resided in cur-
        rent leased quarters for at least 1 year to be eligible for lease termination. Members must give
        proper notice and acknowledge in the request that relocation is at their own expense and they are
        ineligible for GLQ for the duration of assignment at that duty location.
        21.2.2. Requests for termination prior to 1 year of occupancy for personal reasons must be fully
        documented, justified, and forwarded through the member’s unit to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ
        AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for consideration. Approval of such requests normally renders the
        member ineligible for further participation in the GLQ program.
     21.3. Prefinal Inspection. Approximately 2 weeks before the termination, the commander or desig-
     nated representative, lessor or designated representative, and member will jointly conduct a prefinal
     inspection of the quarters to view the condition and determine charges for damage (if any) for which
     the member is responsible. Use the ENG Forms 3143 and 3143a completed at the time of initial occu-
     pancy. Where damage other than fair wear and tear is evident, refer to paragraph 20.3.
     21.4. Final Termination Inspection. Conduct a final termination inspection on the date the member
     vacates the quarters to ensure the quarters are clean and no additional damage has occurred since the
     prefinal inspection. The commander or designated representative, lessor or designated representative,
     and member will jointly conduct the final inspection. Use ENG Form 3143 and ENG Form 3143a to
     document findings. Encourage the lessor to accept custody of the quarters on completion of the final
     inspection.
     21.5. Reinstatement of BAH. On satisfactory completion of the final termination inspection, the
     unit initiates AF Form 594 providing the date quarters were terminated. Send the completed form to
     the FSO that maintains the member’s pay records.
AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007                                                                               13


22. Lease Cancellation:
   22.1. Premature or indiscriminate cancellation of a lease is not only detrimental to good community
   relations, but it creates unnecessary overhead costs for the government. Send each request for lease
   cancellation to HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable) for review to ensure the
   action is fully justified and leased quarters can no longer be used. Leases are not canceled based solely
   on an individual member’s desire; for example, a move to more desirable leased quarters.
   22.2. When it becomes necessary to request a lease cancellation (including cases where the lessor has
   failed to meet his or her obligations), the unit informs HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as
   applicable) of the proposed cancellation. Include in the request all data necessary to identify the spe-
   cific lease, a detailed account of circumstances justifying cancellation, and the proposed effective date
   of cancellation.
   22.3. If approved, HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA informs the appropriate COE district to
   take cancellation actions for the lease specified.

23. Reporting Active Leases. Commanders are required to report active leases quarterly to HQ AFRS/
RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable). This report is designated emergency status code D. Imme-
diately discontinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions. Each report must track and
report all active leases.
   23.1. Quarterly reports will cover the fiscal year period 1 October to 31 December, 1 January to 31
   March, 1 April to 30 June, and 1 July to 30 September. HQ AFRS/RSXL and HQ AFOATS/SDFA
   will forward reports to HQ AETC/A7CP by the fifth calendar day of January, April, July, and October.
   23.2. HQ AETC/A7CP will forward report to HQ USAF/A7CH by the 15th of January, April, July,
   and October. Quarterly reports will include high-cost leases and all leases as required by Congress
   acquired during the quarter.

24. Documentation of Case History Files. As a minimum, establish case numbers for each lease. Each
case file will contain:
   24.1. A copy of the lease, member’s statement of understanding (Attachment 4), ENG Form 3143
   and ENG Form 3143a, and AF Form 594.
   24.2. Other pertinent correspondence to include a market survey, rental determination, quarter’s
   description, and utility data.

25. Prescribed Forms:
AETC Form 79, Utility Data Sheet

26. Adopted Forms:
DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher
DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher
AF Form 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change Basic Allowance for Housing
(BAH) or Dependency Redetermination

Terms
Acceptable travel time—20 miles or 1 hour or less commute time during normal commute traffic from
quarters to duty location or duty location to quarters.
Accompanied personnel—Military personnel eligible for BAH at the with-dependents rate and
accompanied by dependents.
Adequate leased quarters—Quarters that meet Air Force guidelines for size and quality and are
commensurate with the member's grade. These quarters contain normal accommodations to satisfy
reasonable living needs of the individual who will reside in it, are located within acceptable travel time,
and are within prescribed monetary leasing limits. This includes apartments, townhouses, condominiums,
modular homes, and single-family homes. Mobile homes are considered inadequate. Note: All
Department of Defense (DoD) housing is considered “adequate” unless it was deemed substandard by the
respective service department in 1973.
Commander—AFRS squadron commander or AFOATS detachment commander.
Designated representative—Person designated to manage and administer the program by the
commander.
Drayage—The movement of household goods.
High-cost leases—TLC is greater than $12,000 (adjusted annually), but less than high-cost lease
threshold. The high-cost lease threshold is based on inflation and will be published annually. Note: HQ
AETC/A7CP is the approval authority for high-cost leases.
High-cost lease threshold—Statutory limit ($14,000) for high-cost leases is determined annually based
on inflation.
Lease point—Authorization from the Air Staff to lease quarters.
Leased quarters eligibility cost (LQEC)—Monthly dollar cost (varying by grade and location) that
determines each member's eligibility for participation in the program. The LQEC is established by
multiplying the member’s BAH by 12. If adequate suitable quarters (including utilities and services) are
not available at or below the LQEC, the member may apply for leased accompanied quarters. If both
members are active duty, the LQEC is based on the highest ranking member’s grade. A TLC higher than
LQEC does not automatically qualify the member for participation in the program since the member is
expected to be able to pay a reasonable cost above the LQEC for housing.

NOTES:
  1. Inflation of BAH Rates. When calculating the LQEC, use current BAH rates. If rates change after
     application but before acquisition, recalculate LQEC before the lease is awarded.
     2. Promotions. If the member has been selected for promotion, the BAH rates for the higher grade
        will be used to determine LQEC.
Member—An AFRS or AFOATS person who meets the qualifications of “accompanied personnel.”
Multiple Occupancy GLQ Unit—Leased facility acquired for occupancy by two or more members.
Normal leases—TLC at or below $12,000 (adjusted annually). HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA
(as applicable) is the approval authority. If HQ USAF/A7CH delegates lease approval and lease points for
AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007                                                                              17


normal leases to HQ AETC, AETC may further delegate the approval authority to HQ AFRS/RSXL or
HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable).
Quarters—A place of residence: apartment, townhouse, condominium, modular home, single-family
home, etc.
Single Occupancy GLQ Unit—Leased facility acquired for occupancy by one member or family.
Total lease cost (TLC)—Calculated by adding lease costs (LC) to allowable utility and services costs
(USC) plus required deposit costs (DC), if needed. The equation would be: TLC = LC + USC + DC. The
TLC determines whether a normal lease allocation or a high-cost lease allocation is required.
Unaccompanied Personnel—Military personnel eligible for BAQ at the without-dependents rate.
Unit—The organization making the request for lease action--squadrons for AFRS and detachments for
AFOATS.
Utilities and services—Allowable utility and service costs include electricity, gas, water, sewage, and
trash collection. In no case will lease provisions provide for parking, cleaning, maid, laundry, telephone,
and television cable services.

A2.1. Authorized Items. The items of furniture and furnishings listed below are the maximum allow-
ance per leased unaccompanied housing unit and (or) per member occupying a leased unaccompanied
housing unit for which costs may be included in the lease rental fee and for which the government will
accept consideration for restoration costs (if applicable). Any of the items listed may be substituted with a
like item which will serve the purpose for which the authorized item is intended. All other items provided
in leased quarters by the lessor will be provided at the risk of the lessor.

                                                Attachment 4

                    SAMPLE MEMBER’S STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING
Note: File the member’s statement of understanding with the application for leased quarters.
1. I understand the final determination for the acquisition of quarters rests with the supporting US Army
Corps of Engineers (COE) district engineer according to DoD policies, the AETC-leased family quarter’s
instruction (AETCI 32-6003), cost criteria, and adequacy standards. A lease consummated by an individ-
ual on his or her own behalf is either binding on, or a commitment by, the government. Only the COE dis-
trict engineer's representative can negotiate and execute a lease between the government and a landlord.
2. I further understand:
a. I have no option to decline assignment to vacant leased quarters currently under lease and located
within the acceptable travel distance or to decline assignment to quarters negotiated by the COE in
response to a request submitted by me.
b. I should anticipate a delay from the time I initiate a request until the COE district engineer is able to
execute a lease and make it available for assignment.
c. I am responsible to notify my commander if my BAH is not terminated when government quarters are
occupied.
d. Once assigned to government quarters, I will be required to remain in those quarters until any of the fol-
lowing occurs:
(1) The lease terminates under its own terms.
(2) I become ineligible for leased quarters.
(3) I am reassigned out of the area.
(4) I am directed to move because of government necessity.
(5) The lease is terminated for the convenience of the government.
(6) I receive approval for retirement or separation.
e. I will be responsible for such routine housekeeping, maintenance, minor repairs and related servicing of
the dwelling unit, equipment and furnishings, and the maintenance of grounds as would be expected of a
tenant in on base quarters.
f. For maintenance and servicing of equipment and furnishings, I will notify the lessor.
g. I will permit responsible supervisor, commander, detachment commander, HQ AFOATS commander,
HQ AFRS/RSXL or HQ AFOATS/SDFA (as applicable), lessor or representative, and or COE district
personnel to inspect leased quarters as required.
h. I will not permit occupancy of quarters assigned to me by anyone except myself and my dependents. I
understand a violation of this principle is sufficient cause for the commander to withdraw the leasing priv-
ilege.
i. I will notify the commander in writing at least 90 days prior to the date desired for vacating the quarters.
If my notification is less than 150 days, I will notify the commander as soon as possible.
22                                                                      AETCI32-6001 25 APRIL 2007


j. I will immediately notify my commander in writing of any change in dependency status that would
result in a change in eligibility for my continued occupancy of the leased quarters.
k. I will accept quarters leased by the COE.
l. When I vacate, I will ensure my quarters are cleaned to meet the conditions of the lease agreement.
m. I may be held pecuniary liable to reimburse the government for damage to leased quarters and to any
government furniture and furnishings resulting from negligence or willful acts according to AFI 23-220.
n. I understand the decision to have pets is a personal decision, but the COE may select quarters that do
not allow pets. I further understand if I refuse quarters selected by the COE, I will be ineligible for the
lease program.
o. I understand the Air Force is not and will not be responsible for any damages caused by pets.
