                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This directive is for EC-130H COMPASS CALL aircrews. Use it in conjunction
with aircraft flight manuals, FLIP and applicable USAF directives. This volume prescribes
procedures for most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment or
common sense. It is written for normal and contingency operations to reduce procedural changes
at the onset of contingencies.
   1.1.1. HQ ACC/A3T has overall responsibility for administration of this volume.
1.2. Terms Explained. The terms "Shall, Will, Should, May, Warning, Caution and Note" are
defined in the appropriate EC-130H-flight manual. Additional terms are defined in Attachment
1.
1.3. Deviations and Waivers. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of
HQ ACC/A3 (or other authority specified in this volume), unless an urgent requirement, safety
or aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. The aircraft commander (AC) will take the appropriate
action to safely recover the aircraft and is responsible for the action taken.
   1.3.1. Unless otherwise stipulated, waiver authority for the contents of this AFI is HQ
   ACC/A3. Forward waiver requests to through NAF channels to HQ ACC/A3T for staffing,
   with informational copies to HQ ACC/A3I as necessary. When chopped to another
   MAJCOM, forward waiver requests through the chain of command to MAJCOM
   standardization/evaluation, JFACC, or COMAFFOR, as appropriate, with informational
   copies to HQ ACC/A3, HQ ACC/A3T, and HQ ACC/A3I. Waivers issued by HQ ACC/A3
   are effective until the next rewrite of this AFI unless stated otherwise in the waiver approval.
   For waivers issued under other authority specified in this AFI, duration of the waiver will be
   included in the approval. HQ ACC/A3 must approve long-term (permanent) waivers.
1.4. Supplements. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or operational theater
may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2 and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management. Stipulate unique MAJCOM procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic
document) and publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
supplement.
   1.4.1. Coordination Process. Units will send one copy of their supplement to this AFI (local
   procedures) to 8 AF/OV for coordination and approval. 8 AF/OV will then forward a copy
   to HQ ACC/A3TV.
1.5. Combined Operations. Use only the basic AFI for planning or operations involving forces
from other commands. Commanders may use approved MAJCOM supplement procedures with
assigned and/or chopped forces provided these forces receive appropriate training on the
procedures and the duration of their use is specified. Commanders should not assume or expect
aircrews from another command to perform MAJCOM-specific procedures in their supplements
unless these provisions are met. Questions by aircrews, planners and staff should be submitted
to OPR via ACC Command Post or ACC Operations Center (see Chapter 4).

                                          Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The ACC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism
which keeps the ACC commander informed of the current status of ACC forces while enabling
the wing or group commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations. The C2 network
consists of theater Air and Space Operations Centers, Contingency Response Groups (CRG),
Special Tactics Teams (STT), unit command posts and the ACC command center.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). ACC is designated as the controlling agency for assigned
Air Force aircraft, while theater commands have OPCON of theater-based assets. In practice,
responsibility for planning and executing ACC missions is routinely delegated to the wing or
group commander. The wing or group commander, in turn, exercises control of routine missions
through the wing command post or squadron operations center (SOC). When assigned forces
undergo a change in operational control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes
from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command/theater. Changeover will be
accomplished IAW the pertinent OPLAN, OPORD or deployment/execution order. For the
purpose of this directive when the term ECG/CC (Electronic Group Commander) or WG/CC
(Wing Commander) is used, but the assigned forces have been CHOPed, it can be assumed that
the terms EOG/CC (Expeditionary Operations Group Commander) and EW/CC (Expeditionary
Wing Commander) apply unless otherwise stated. Note: For certain close-hold activities,
security considerations may compel the wing or group commander to shift mission monitoring
responsibilities from the command post to another wing or squadron agency. The wing or group
commander will ensure procedures are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission
progress and advise the MAJCOM/A3 and COMACC as appropriate.
2.3. Detachment Commander (DETCO). When one or more aircraft are deployed to perform
missions away from home station, the tasked unit will designate a DETCO to assume
responsibility for mission execution, personnel supervision and higher headquarters
coordination.
   2.3.1. The DETCO is the final authority responsible for ensuring aircrews have properly
   coordinated mission details. DETCO duties include, but are not limited to:
       2.3.1.1. Ensuring all collocated aircrews complete required mission briefings, including
       local procedures, Rules of Engagement and Special Instructions (see paragraph 6.10).
       2.3.1.2. Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Teams (CCT),
       STT range control, users and others that may have an impact on the mission.
       2.3.1.3. Ensuring both maintenance and operations personnel have ample and adequate
       billeting, dining and transportation arrangements.
       2.3.1.4. Coordinating aircraft and fuel requirements with maintenance supervision.
       2.3.1.5. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements (see paragraph 2.5).
       2.3.1.6. Other duties as outlined by the squadron commander or operations officer.
14                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


2.4. Aircraft Commander (AC) Responsibility and Authority. Flight authorization
designates a Pilot in Command (PIC) on all flights, in accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management. For purposes of this instruction, aircraft commander refers to an eligible pilot
designated as the PIC. PIC and AC are interchangeable unless otherwise noted.
     2.4.1. PICs are:
        2.4.1.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
        2.4.1.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew.
        2.4.1.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage crew resources in order to safely
        accomplish the mission. The PIC shall only fly events authorized in the mission tasking
        unless in the PIC‘s judgment an emergency condition demands otherwise.
        2.4.1.4. The final authority as to the operation of the aircraft and will make decisions not
        specifically assigned to higher authority.
        2.4.1.5. The final authority for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew,
        aircraft or mission.
        2.4.1.6. Charged with keeping the applicable C2 or executing agencies informed
        concerning mission progress.
        2.4.1.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a
        DETCO (see paragraph 2.5).
     2.4.2. IAW AFI 11-401, eligible pilots may alternate command responsibility. Ensure all
     crewmembers are aware of which pilot has AC responsibility at all times. When an
     instructor or evaluator pilot is performing IP/EP duties on the mission, but not designated as
     the pilot in command on the flight authorization, the IP/EP will assume command when
     safety requirements dictate, or when deviation from this volume is necessary IAW paragraph
     1.3
2.5. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center
monitors all ACC aircraft that move to, from or between OCONUS locations. Key components
of the ACC C2 system are the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the various C2
facilities at theater and wing locations. When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and
exercises, the Command Center may obtain additional information from situation reports
(SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports (DSR). For missions that are not close-hold in nature
and have not been chopped to another command, the respective squadron operations center or
wing command post tracks CONUS movements of their aircraft based on aircrew reports.
Information on OCONUS movements of ACC aircraft is relayed to the ACC Command Center
(DSN: 574-1555; commercial: 757-764-1555) via telephone notification from host wing
command posts. The host wing command post receives data directly from aircrew or via the
enroute facility‘s local command post. Note:: These procedures may be modified to meet
local/contingency requirements.
     2.5.1. Missions at Bases with a C2 Facility. DETCOs or ACs will ensure that at least 30
     minutes prior to landing, the following information is relayed to the applicable C2 facility:
     call signs, mission numbers, ETAs, maintenance status and additional service requirements.
     After landing, the DETCO or AC will contact the C2 facility with ground handling
     requirements and departure information. In addition, CONUS-based crews operating
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              15


   OCONUS must keep their home station Squadron Operations Center (SOC)/command post
   apprised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected takeoff times and other related
   information. Home station agencies relay information to the ACC Command Post. These
   actions keep the ACC commander apprised of the locations and status of OCONUS forces.
   When forces chop to another theater commander, reporting will be through theater C2 centers
   upon arrival in the assigned area of responsibility.
   2.5.2. Missions at Bases without a C2 Facility. DETCOs or ACs will report, as soon as
   possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected takeoff times, and
   other pertinent data to the host wing command post or command/operations center. Possible
   methods of communicating this information include HF phone patch, SATCOM radio, DSN,
   and commercial telephone. Accomplish movement reporting as soon as possible after the
   event, when crew duties and safety permit. If unable to contact host wing command post or
   command/operations center, retain information for submission when contact is re-
   established. Report communication difficulties through the chain of command. Refer to the
   FLIP, Flight Information Handbook, USAF HF/SSB Airways and Command and Control
   Station section for guidance on mission reporting. Restrict HF transmission to operational
   traffic, such as movement reporting, itinerary revisions, maintenance status, flight plan
   information, aircraft emergencies, or other important flight information.
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting. Enroute reports are required only when specified in an
   OPORD/OPLAN or other mission directive.
       2.5.3.1. Contact the destination IAW the Flight Information Handbook/Enroute
       Supplement. Upon initial contact, confirm your arrival message has been received and
       update your ETA. If your arrival message has not been received, transmit information to
       the destination as necessary. When within UHF/VHF range, contact the appropriate
       destination agency (command post, SOC, etc.) with the following information, unless
       previously transmitted:
           2.5.3.1.1. ETA.
           2.5.3.1.2. VIP code and requirements (if applicable).
           2.5.3.1.3. Hazardous cargo and remote parking requirements (if applicable).
           2.5.3.1.4. Maintenance status.
           2.5.3.1.5. Any additional servicing requirements.
   2.5.4. Close-Hold or Sensitive Missions. Command and control procedures for these
   missions will be outlined in the tasking directive.
2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the AC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the AC.
If the AC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another AC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.6.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
   except in an emergency or when required by enroute or terminal weather conditions or
16                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     facilities. In the event of an emergency, weather-related divert or change in routing, the
     DETCO or AC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
        2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the change in routing or diversion is
        responsible for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the
        aircraft.
        2.6.1.2. The AC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations
        that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
     2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 agency will ensure the AC is
     provided existing and forecast weather for the alternate, notices to airmen (NOTAMs), bird
     hazard (BASH), and appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and
     Restrictions Report (ASRR). If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while enroute, the
     AC will coordinate with the C2 agency for other suitable alternates. The C2 agency will
     coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival. The AC is final
     authority on selecting a suitable alternate.

                                    CREW COMPLEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary aircrew members, or those occupying a primary position
during flight, must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position, mission and
aircraft. If non-current or in training for a particular event, the aircrew member must be under
the supervision of an instructor while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical
phases of flight).
   3.1.1. Pilots:
       3.1.1.1. Qualification Requirements.
           3.1.1.1.1. A pilot is trained and qualified to perform left-seat maneuvers, to include
           engine-out and no-flap practice under direct IP supervision. The term ―pilot‖ applies
           to the mobility pilot development (MPD) graduate, previously qualified pilot (PQP),
           or any other left-seat qualified pilot who may or may not be certified as an aircraft
           commander.
           3.1.1.1.2. Any qualified pilot may occupy the copilot seat.
           3.1.1.1.3. An aircraft commander is any pilot trained and qualified to command the
           aircraft. The aircraft commander upgrade program is outlined in AFI 11-2EC-130H,
           Volume 1, EC-130H Aircrew Training.
       3.1.1.2. Passenger Restrictions. Do not perform touch and go landings or simulated
       emergency procedures with passengers on board. Note: Touch and go landings may be
       performed with Additional Crew Members (ACM) or Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)
       on board. Only a pilot that is qualified (current and valid AF Form 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, for the C-130 and occupied position), and current IAW AFI 11-
       2EC-130HV1, will occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers on board the aircraft.
       EXCEPTION: A qualified pilot regaining currency under direct IP supervision (in the
       seat at the controls) may also fly with passengers on board. Guidance for space-
       available, orientation, incentive and familiarization flights will be outlined in the
       supplement to this volume.
   3.1.2. Navigators, Flight Engineers and AMTs. Non-current or unqualified navigators, flight
   engineers or AMTs may perform in their primary crew position on any mission when
   supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner of like specialty (direct supervision for
   critical phases of flight).
   3.1.3. Senior leaders.
       3.1.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF
       Form 8) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary
       crew position when under direct instructor supervision.
       3.1.3.2. Crew members who complete the Senior Staff Qualification Course will log
       ―FP/FN‖ for Flight Authorization Duty code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS
       Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
18                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        3.1.3.3. Crew members who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log
        ―OP/ON‖ for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781.
3.2. Crew Complement.
     3.2.1. Minimum basic crew is defined as one aircraft commander, one pilot, one navigator,
     one flight engineer and one AMT. Squadron commanders, operations officers, or DETCOs
     may authorize flights without a navigator when not required for mission accomplishment.
     Note: A navigator will be required on missions if reported or forecast thunderstorms or other
     inclement weather exists. Units will post procedures regarding the use of navigators on
     proficiency trainers in the supplement to this volume. A navigator is required for training
     missions when the sortie involves a mission orbit or air refueling or for proficiency training
     missions outside the local area as defined in the supplement to this AFI.
     3.2.2. Augmented Crew is defined as basic crew plus an additional AC-qualified pilot,
     navigator, flight engineer and AMT.
     3.2.3. Mission crew is defined as basic crew plus two EWOs, one MCS, one to four ANOs
     and one AO. Minimum mission crew is one EWO, one MCS, one ANO and one AO/ANO.
     The ECG/CC may make adjustments to the minimum mission crew on a case-by-case basis.
     Note: The AC maintains ultimate responsibility of overall conduct of the mission. However,
     qualified aircrew in the seats when the AC is not at the controls maintain responsibility for
     the actions they take. Transfer of duties between qualified ACs will be briefed to the crew.
3.3. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Mission Essential Personnel are personnel who are
required for the execution of the aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. This
includes additional aircrew members required for follow-on missions and personnel not
authorized AOs who are tasked to perform ground support duties at enroute locations or
destination points that are directly related and essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit
mission, e.g. a specialist or technician required to provide aircraft support or a security team
required to guard the aircraft. MEP may include military staff personnel and U.S. Government
employees when those individuals are required for the mission. MEPs travel in passenger status,
but report to the command and control agency through the AC. MEP authority must be on the
individual‘s orders or other written authorization. MEPs will be manifested and anti-hijack
processed by the aircrew at the aircraft. They are authorized flight deck seating with AC
approval. Eligibility and authority for granting MEP status is specified in AFI 11-401.
     3.3.1. MEP travel status will be strictly controlled and approved only for personnel with a
     bona fide mission-essential purpose for a specific flight or period of flights.
     3.3.2. Maintenance discrepancies that restrict ECG aircraft from carrying passengers also
     prohibit the carrying of MEPs.
     3.3.3. MEP status will not be approved to allow non-aircrew members to perform in-flight
     duties as MEPs are a category of passenger while the aircraft is airborne, and performe duties
     on the ground enroute or at point of destination. Members required to perform duties while
     the aircraft is airborne will not be classified as MEP. Maintenance personnel required to
     observe aircraft systems or perform maintenance inflight will be put on non-interferance AOs
     IAW AFI 11-401.
     3.3.4. Simulated emergency procedures may not be performed with MEP on board.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             19


   3.3.5. Touch and go procedures may be performed with MEP on board.
   3.3.6. The ECG/CC is the approval authority for MEP status.
3.4. Scheduling Restrictions. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, for further guidance. Note: Do not
takeoff early (before scheduled departure time) if the early takeoff time would violate the
following restrictions. In addition to restrictions outlined in AFI 11-202V3, aircrew members
will not be scheduled to fly, nor will they perform crew duties:
   3.4.1. When the maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3 will be exceeded.
   3.4.2. Within the 12-hour period prior to assuming standby force duty.
   3.4.3. When taking oral or injected medication unless individual medical waiver has been
   granted by the Flight Surgeon. Aircrew members may not self-medicate except as noted in
   AFI 48-123. The following is a partial list of medications which may be used without
   medical consultation:
       3.4.3.1. Skin antiseptics, topical antifungals, 1 percent Hydrocortisone cream (more
       potent topical steroids require waivers), or benzoyl peroxide for minor wounds and skin
       diseases which do not interfere with the performance of flying duties or wear of personal
       equipment.
       3.4.3.2. Single doses of over-the-counter aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to provide
       analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions.
       3.4.3.3. Antacids for mild isolated episodes of epigastric distress.
       3.4.3.4. Hemorrhoidal suppositories.
       3.4.3.5. Bismuth subsalicylate for mild afebrile cases of diarrhea.
       3.4.3.6. Oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays may be used by aircrew as "get me
       downs" should unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. These should not be
       used to treat symptoms of head congestion existing prior to flight.
       3.4.3.7. Multivitamins.
       3.4.3.8. Dietary, herbal and nutritional supplements can only be used with the approval
       of a flight surgeon. The flight surgeon should consider aeromedical implications of the
       supplement as well as the probability the supplement will actually enhance performance.
   3.4.4. Within 30 minutes of accomplishing ground pressurization checks of less than 10
   minutes (restricted from flying).
3.5. Inter-fly: Squadron operations officers may authorize inter-fly of ACC aircrews and ACC
aircraft in specific operations, exercises or under special circumstances. In all cases, the crew
will be qualified in the aircraft MDS as well as any systems required to fly the mission. HQ
ACC/A3 is the approval authority for command-to-command inter-fly.
3.6. Flight Duty Period (FDP). The terms Crew Duty Day (CDD), Crew Duty Time (CDT),
and FDP are interchangeable for the purposes of this volume. CDT/CDD/FDP begins at
scheduled or established show time. For aircrew members performing other duties prior to
flight-related duties, CDT/CDD/FDP begins when reporting for other duties. For Alpha
Standby, CDT/CDD/FDP begins when the crew is told to launch. For Bravo Standby,
20                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


CDT/CDD/FDP begins when the crew shows for duty. CDT/CDD/FDP ends when all aircrew
members have completed their duties at the aircraft. Waiver authority is IAW AFI 11-202V3
and this paragraph. Note: The following paragraphs supplement AFI 11-202V3, Table 9.1, for
EC-130E/H aircraft.
     3.6.1. Basic CDD is 16 hours, provided no pilot proficiency training (multiple
     approaches/landings at practice airfields), air-to-air refueling training, or Functional Check
     Flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is
     denied for more than 4 hours, CDD is 12 hours (unless the pilot position is augmented).
     Waiver authority for contingencies is JFACC or MAJCOM/A3 of the agency with OPCON.
     Preflight crew duty day is the same as a flight crew and is outlined in AFI 11-202V3.
     3.6.2. Augmented CDD is 20 hours with adequate in-flight crew rest facilities available
     (determined by the AC), provided no pilot proficiency training, air refueling training, or
     FCFs are accomplished after 16 hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied
     for more than 8 hours, CDD is 16 hours. Basic crews will not be augmented after crew duty
     has started. Waiver authority for contingencies is JFACC or MAJCOM/A3 of the agency
     with OPCON.
        3.6.2.1. Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical
        phases of flight. Normally 30 minutes prior to initiating the checklist for an event will
        allow the new crew member time to get acclimated. Note: If the autopilot fails after
        departure, consider mission requirements and determine best course of action to preclude
        further mission impact due to reduced CDD. Contact C2 agencies, coordinate intentions,
        and comply with preceding limitations.
     3.6.3. CDD for flight examiners administering flight evaluations will not exceed augmented
     CDD.
     3.6.4. CDD may be extended IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, para 9.10.1. MAJCOM/A3 or
     equivalent for the agency with OPCON of the aircraft is waiver authority for maximum
     CDD. Coordinate with C2 agencies so that downstream activities are not adversely affected.
     Under no circumstances will missions be scheduled to exceed the maximum CDD above
     without appropriate waiver.
3.7. Crew Rest. Crew rest policy is IAW AFI 11-202V3 and this paragraph. The minimum
crew rest period is 12 hours unless waived by HQ ACC/A3.
     3.7.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. All primary and deadhead aircrew members
     should enter crew rest 24 hours prior to show time for missions scheduled away from home
     station for more than 16 hours. The first 12 hours are not considered crew rest but are
     designed to allow crew members time to resolve personal affairs. During these first 12
     hours, crew members may perform limited non-flying duties, including mission planning.
     The ECG/CC is the waiver authority for the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest.
     Deadhead aircrew members will not be manifested as passengers to reduce or eliminate crew
     rest requirements.
     3.7.2. Enroute Ground Time and Crew Rest. Minimum planned ground time is 16 hours
     between engine shutdown and mission takeoff, unless extended post-flight duties are
     anticipated. Crew rest normally begins 45 minutes after final engine shutdown. The 45-
     minute time period provides crews with time to complete normal post-flight duties. These
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             21


   duties include, but are not limited to, refueling, securing classified, performing maintenance
   or completing mission debriefings. Note: Crew rest does not begin until all crewmembers
   have completed post-flight duties, to include any duty requiring an aircrew member to stay at
   the aircraft past the 45-minute period.
      3.7.2.1. Minimum crew rest period is 12 hours. This period provides the crew a
      minimum of 8 hours of uninterrupted rest plus time for transportation, free time and
      meals. The crew will not be disturbed during this period, except during emergencies.
      Should the 12-hour crew rest period be infringed upon by official duties, the crew will
      enter crew rest for an additional 12 hours on completion of the official duties.
      3.7.2.2. Crews will re-enter crew rest if their aircraft or mission is not capable of
      departure within 4 hours of scheduled takeoff time. Exceptions require the concurrence
      of the AC. Refer to AFI 11-2EC-130HV1 for additional restrictions on training missions.
   3.7.3. Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The crew chief is responsible to the AC. The AC, in
   conjunction with the enroute station chief of maintenance, will determine how long the crew
   chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity
   to sleep 8 hours of each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
3.8. Standby Force Procedures: Note: Contingency operations may require modification of
the following Standby Force Procedures. The squadron commander or operations officer will
approve any modification of these procedures.
   3.8.1. Crew Management. Except as noted below, commanders will not use a standby crew
   to perform any non-mission duties or duties not related to their standby status. Standby
   crews will not preflight any aircraft other than their standby aircraft.
   3.8.2. ALPHA Standby Force. An aircraft and aircrew capable of launching in 1 hour.
   Aircrew members are given 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest before or after aircraft
   preflight. Aircrews must complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time. An
   additional 12 hour pre-standby crew rest is required when preflight time exceeds 6 hours and
   crew rest was given before the preflight. Once an ALPHA force is formed, additional pre-
   flights may be necessary to maintain the ALPHA aircraft. Additional pre-flights done during
   normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. A crew will not stay on ALPHA standby
   duty for more than 48 hours. After 48 hours, the crew must be launched, released or entered
   into pre-departure crew rest. CDT/CDD begins when the crew is told to launch.
      3.8.2.1. Aircraft Security. Each unit will complete a maintenance and aircrew preflight
      inspection when they put an aircraft on ALPHA standby status. The ALPHA Standby
      AC will ensure the aircraft is sealed after preflight. Secure all hatches and doors to show
      unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew entrance door with a controllable device,
      which will prevent entry without damage to the door or lock. The command post,
      squadron commander, or DETCO must grant permission prior to persons, other than the
      ALPHA Standby crew, entering an aircraft once the plane is sealed. Ensure standby
      aircraft is resealed any time the aircraft has been opened. The ALPHA Standby AC or
      designated representative must be present if access to the assigned aircraft is required.
   3.8.3. BRAVO Standby Force. An aircraft or aircrew capable of launching in 3 hours (from
   the time the crew is told to launch, or alerted). Aircrew members are given 12 hours of pre-
22                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     standby crew rest. Crews are legal for alert after pre-standby crew rest. Preflight duties, if
     required, interrupt crew rest. A crew will not stay on BRAVO standby duty for more than 48
     hours. After 48 hours, the crew must be launched, released, or entered into pre-departure
     crew rest. CDT begins when the crew shows for duty. If a BRAVO standby crew is alerted
     for any duty (launch, preflight, mission planning), and the unit is subsequently tasked to
     launch the mission, CDT will be calculated from when the crew first reported for that duty.
     3.8.4. CHARLIE Standby Force. An identified aircrew capable of entering crew rest within
     2 hours (after their controlling unit is notified). This aircrew will become legal for alert 12
     hours after entering crew rest. CHARLIE Standby will not exceed 72 hours. After 72 hours,
     the crew will be released. Afford a minimum of 12 hours before resuming CHARLIE
     Standby duty, entering crew rest for a mission, or entering pre-standby crew rest for ALPHA
     or BRAVO Standby.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
     3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
     ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
     provides guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew
     initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest periods. Fliers
     on augmented aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
     3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
     fatigue management tool.
     3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
     with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), ECG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than
     squadron commander), and with each individual aircrew member. During extended
     deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight
     surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home-unit medical team prior to
     dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
     3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
     medication with ECG/CC and FS oversight.
     3.9.5. Home station or deployed flight surgeon is the point of contact for no-go prescription.
     Upon request, the FS will advise/assist the local ECG/CC to identify missions that may
     impair crew rest caused by duty day length, departure and arrival times and other mission
     timelines.
     3.9.6. The ECG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
     the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go
     medications):
        3.9.6.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
        3.9.6.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, climate
        controlled and darkened).
        3.9.6.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
        flight time duration.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            23


     3.9.6.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.7. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming no-go pills. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline
  after consultation with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short duration
  effect. In no case will crew members consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they would
  be under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission report
  or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
  3.9.8. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
     3.9.8.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
     surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
     3.9.8.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within the DNIF periods for each
     of the no-go pills as specified in paragraph 3.9.7 of this instruction.
     3.9.8.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
     alcohol.
     3.9.8.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
     supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
     potential interactions.
     3.9.8.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no
     more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
     3.9.8.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28
     days in a 60-day period.
24                                                 AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


                                           Chapter 4

                         AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. This chapter applies to accepting an aircraft from maintenance prior to launch.
The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for launch with
all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable, FMC). Manpower limitations, skills, and
spare part availability have a negative and direct impact on mission accomplishment. However,
under specific circumstances, some missions can be safely operated without all equipment being
operational. Using the following policies, the AC is the final authority in determining an overall
status of an aircraft. Use the following maintenance identifiers and Tables 4.1 – 4.15 to
effectively communicate the status of an aircraft and to determine whether an aircraft is
airworthy and able to perform the scheduled mission.
     4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system or subsystem component essential for safe
     aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated Mission Essential (ME) by the
     AC in AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief
     explanation of the reason for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. Any AC
     accepting an aircraft (for one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does
     not commit that AC (or a different AC) to subsequent operations with the same item or
     system inoperative.
     4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). Any discrepancies that are not currently ME, but may
     become ME (if circumstances change), are designated as MC in the AFTO Form 781A
     discrepancy block. Every effort will be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest
     opportunity to the extent that maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability
     permit. If subsequently, in the AC‘s judgment, mission safety would be compromised by the
     lack of any component, he may designate the component as ME. However, do not delay a
     mission to correct an MC discrepancy.
     4.1.3. Open Item. Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission or any
     subsequent mission are not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and are
     normally worked at home station. Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification
     centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and operative.
     4.1.4. Control and Performance Instruments. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical
     velocity indications, altitude, speed, and heading instruments should be operative in both
     pilot positions IAW AFI 11-202V3. For instruments with both analog and digital displays, as
     a minimum the analog must be operational. EXCEPTION: The radar altimeter may have
     either analog or digital operation.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. It would be impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunction and contingent
circumstances. This chapter lists the minimum equipment and systems considered essential for
routine as well as contingency operations. The list does not necessarily include all equipment or
systems essential to airworthiness (e.g., rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires). Those items
which state a minimum requirement and have no listed exceptions ground the aircraft for launch.
     4.2.1. The AC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure no aircraft is
     flown with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              25


   undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. This chapter is
   not intended to allow for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with
   systems/subsystems inoperative. The Minimum Equipment List (MEL) shall not direct
   deviation from the aircraft flight manual limitations, emergency procedures, or USAF/ACC
   directives. ACs should be aware that the MEL is an operational tool, and serves a different
   purpose than the maintenance Minimum Essential Subsystem List (MESL). If an item is
   required to be operational according to the maintenance MESL, the AC may still opt to
   accept the aircraft without waiver. Safety of flight is paramount.
   4.2.2. If, after exploring all options, an AC determines a safe launch is possible with an item
   inoperable (beyond a particular restriction) the AC shall request a waiver. Waivers will be
   requested IAW Chapter 1 of this regulation. Plan a minimum 12-hour response to the waiver
   request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment may be granted on a case-
by-case basis and only in exceptional circumstances. Waiver authority is based on who has
operational control (OPCON) and execution of the aircraft performing a specific mission. The
AC determines the need for a waiver and initiates the request.
   4.3.1. Local Missions (Executed by ECG/CC). Waiver authority for local missions is the
   ECG/CC or designated representative.
   4.3.2. ACC-Directed Missions (Including HQ ACC Operational Readiness Inspections).
   Waiver authority is HQ ACC/A3.
   4.3.3. Other Missions (Contingencies). Waiver authority is listed in the OPORD, DEPORD,
   execution order, tasking order, etc. Aircrew members may request additional assistance or
   confirmation from their home units or ACC.
4.4. Technical Assistance Service. The AC may (at anytime in the decision process) request
technical support and additional assistance from their home unit, ACC staff, and/or maintenance
representatives.
   4.4.1. ACs electing to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems (with appropriate
   waiver, if necessary) must coordinate mission requirements (revised departure times, fuel
   requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the C2 agency before flight.
   4.4.2. If beyond C2 communication capability, the AC may deviate from this chapter or the
   MEL according to paragraph 1.3 Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to HQ
   ACC/A3 within 48 hours. Units must be prepared to collect background information and
   submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.5. Supplements. See Chapter 1.
4.6. Definitions (Specific to this Chapter):
   4.6.1. Home Station. Home bases of assignment for EC-130H aircraft. Aircraft will not
   depart their home stations unless MEL home station requirements are met. EXCEPTION:
   During wartime, enroute criteria will apply to all aircraft departures.
26                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     4.6.2. Enroute. Enroute locations where C-130 maintenance repair capability exists. An
     enroute station has the necessary skilled USAF or USAF-contract maintenance personnel,
     support equipment, and technical data available to accomplish most repairs.
     4.6.3. Local Training. A mission scheduled to originate and terminate at home station,
     generated for training or evaluation and executed at the local level.
     4.6.4. Off-Station Training. A mission that departs home station to perform training, as
     directed by the wing or operations group commander, without returning the same day. These
     missions will be supported by home station logistics. Note: Off-station trainers are
     considered local training for the purposes of this chapter.
     4.6.5. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
     contained in this column. This is not all inclusive. Crew members shall refer to the flight
     manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
            4.6.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: Normally a Red X discrepancy is
            downgraded for a one-time flight. This condition does not preclude carrying cargo
            and passengers. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair-capable facility. ACs
            must coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the
            destination. One-time flights may include enroute stops only when necessary to
            recover the airplane. Example: An airplane departs on a gear-down flight from
            Djibouti IAP and requires an enroute fuel stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest
            repair capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
               4.6.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair-capable facility: Flight is limited to
               the nearest (shortest enroute time) repair-capable base.
               4.6.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair-capable facility: Flight is not restricted to
               the nearest repair capable facility.
            4.6.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
               4.6.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair-capable facility: Mission may
               continue as scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair-capable
               facility. Designate item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance
               action is initiated, and it is determined repairs are not possible, the AC will
               discuss possible courses of action with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
               4.6.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: AC shall consider the entire mission
               profile, not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an enroute
               station with repair capability, after engine start the flight engineer discovers the
               #1 engine anti-ice is inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next
               leg. However, because the mission spans several days and repair capability does
               not exist at the scheduled enroute stops, the AC elects to have the item repaired
               prior to departing.
4.7. Navigation Systems:
     4.7.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the
     North Atlantic Region or the Composite Hawaii/Mainland US Route System, the following
     fully operable navigation systems are considered the minimum necessary to permit
     compliance.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               27


       4.7.1.1. Compass Systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational.
       If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is
       affected.
   4.7.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the AC determines the minimum
   navigational capability required to safely accomplish the mission. Consider the following:
   duration, route of flight, weather, experience and proficiency of the crew.
   4.7.3. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory.
   Loss of any component before track entry requires return to a station with maintenance
   capability or re-filing via specified routes.
4.8. Equipment/Cargo Loading. EC-130H aircraft/crews are not equipped or trained to carry
cargo. Cargo is defined as any item loaded aboard the aircraft except crew baggage, professional
gear, spare mission equipment, crew chief tool boxes, or safety/emergency equipment.
However, items other than those listed above may be carried on board the aircraft to support
operations. All cargo/baggage must be properly restrained IAW T.O. 1EC-130H-5-1, Sample
Basic Weight Checklists and T.O. 1EC-130H-5-2 . The following restrictions apply to all EC-
130H flights unless a waiver is obtained IAW para 4.3: Note: Cargo and baggage will not be
loaded until the flight engineer and AMT have preflighted the cargo compartment. The flight
engineer and AMT will supervise all loading. The flight engineer will calculate weight and
balance and center of gravity.
   4.8.1. No palletized cargo will be carried.
   4.8.2. No hazardous cargo (as defined by AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials
   for Military Air Shipments). This does not apply to items that are required to be carried per

 Notes:
 1. Navigation equipment compatible with the facilities required for the entire route of flight must be
 operational.
 2. Perform a ground check of the IFF before takeoff, using either the self-test or ground radar
 interrogation. If self-test is unacceptable and radar facilities do not permit a ground check, you may
 take off if the IFF was operational on the previous mission. The IFF/SIF must be operational when
 TCAS is required (if equipped).

                                OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items have been accomplished and all applicable crewmembers have called it complete.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists in pencil.
   5.1.1. The pilot flying the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless another procedure is
   established by the flight manual or this volume.
   5.1.2. The only pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist are C-130 series T.O. aircrew
   checklists, AFI MDS Volume 3 or MAJCOM checklists and briefing guides, and NAF or
   ECG/EGV-approved information guides. Unapproved items may not be inserted within
   authorized checklists (ie, items not approved can not be placed inside the ―blue‖ checklist
   page covers). Pencil entries are authorized but must be current. Local in-flight guides and
   inserts not affecting T.O guidance and procedures may be locally developed with ECG-level
   Stan/Eval approval.
   5.1.3. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out. Do not challenge these items during checklist accomplishment.
5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during the
flight. (EXCEPTION: Unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training and Senior Leaders
who have completed required training IAW paragraph 3.1.3 of this volume). Only one pilot may
be absent from their duty station at a time and only if the flight engineer is at his/her duty station.
Both pilots will be in their seats when the flight engineer is not in his/hers. With both pilots in
their seats, ACs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during
non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Notify the AC prior to
departing assigned primary duty station.
   5.2.1. Both pilots, the navigator, and the flight engineer will be at their duty stations during
   all takeoffs, departures, approaches, aerial refuelings, and landings, except when required for
   the performance of normal crew duties. Other crew members may occupy other stations,
   with MCC and AC concurrence, only if doing so will not interfere with normal crew duties.
   5.2.2. During other phases of flight, flight crew members will notify the pilot before leaving
   and after returning to their duty station. For mission crew only the AMT and the MCC need
   to notify the pilot. The AMT and the MCC will be responsible for controlling mission
   aircrew members in the mission crew compartment.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. ACs may authorize passengers, observers, MEP, and any
crewmember access to the flight station during any phase of flight. The total number of persons
permitted is limited to the number of seats with operable seatbelts and a sufficient oxygen
source. In all cases, ensure sufficient oxygen sources are available and used to meet the
requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Passengers and observers will not occupy the pilot, copilot,
navigator or flight engineer positions at any time.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy:
40                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.4.1. An aircraft commander will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and
     landings. EXCEPTION: Instructor or flight examiner pilots may occupy either seat at their
     discretion regardless of who is designated as pilot in command on the flight authorization
     (see paragraph 2.4.2). The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to occupy a primary
     position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
     5.4.2. Aircraft commanders who possess less than 100 hours in command in the C-130 since
     initial upgrade will make all takeoffs and landings from the left seat when a copilot occupies
     the right seat. They may allow ACs or higher to perform takeoffs and landings when
     required for currency.
     5.4.3. MPD Graduates may takeoff or land from either seat if an AC with over 100 hours
     since certification in the C-130 occupies the other seat.
     5.4.4. An instructor, flight examiner or AC-qualified pilot will make all takeoffs and
     landings during:
        5.4.4.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
        5.4.4.2. Missions operating in areas of hostile activity, unless conditions prevent
        compliance.
        5.4.4.3. Arrival/departure at airfields that require higher headquarters approval as
        indicated in the AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR).
        5.4.4.4. Situations when, in the opinion of the AC, marginal conditions exist.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The copilot will operate the landing gear. The
pilot monitoring (PM) the aircraft will operate the flaps. Actuate the landing gear or flaps only
after command of the pilot flying (PF) the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the landing gear or flaps,
the other pilot will acknowledge the command by repeating it. During ground operations when
the aircraft is stopped, the copilot may actuate the flaps without notifying the pilot.
5.6. Use of Outside Observers. Use crew members to assist in outside watch during all taxi
operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures. Crew members designated to perform
these duties are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 5.7 during taxi.
5.7. Seat Belts:
     5.7.1. Crew members occupying their primary positions will have seat belts fastened at all
     times in flight, except when crew duties require otherwise.
     5.7.2. All occupants will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses (if available)
     fastened during taxi, takeoff, air-to-air refueling and landing. EXCEPTIONS: The flight
     engineer is exempt from wearing the shoulder harness for ground operations and air-to-air
     refueling, and mission crew are exempt from wearing shoulder harness during air-to-air
     refueling. Crew members performing flight examiner and instructor duties and not
     occupying a primary position are exempt from seat belt requirements; however, a seat with
     an operable restraint will be available and readily accessible.
     5.7.3. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting IAW Chapter 4 of this volume, AFI 11202V3,
AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               41


   5.8.1. Use anticollision lights or strobe lights from takeoff to landing on all flights, unless
   reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions. Unless otherwise directed,
   aircraft strobe lights will be operated as follows:
       5.8.1.1. ―Before Starting Engines‖ Checklist, ―red‖ position.
       5.8.1.2. ―Lineup‖ Checklist, ―White‖ position.
       5.8.1.3. ―After Landing‖ Checklist, ―Red‖ position.
   5.8.2. Use taxi lights during all taxi operations. Use wingtip taxi lights during night taxi
   operations. Use landing lights at night in unlighted areas. Use landing and taxi lights during
   night takeoffs. Use taxi lights in flight any time the landing gear is extended unless
   reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions. Landing lights may be used
   continuously during local traffic pattern training and during low-altitude maneuvering in
   high-density traffic areas.
   5.8.3. Use leading edge lights in addition to other required aircraft lighting during operations
   below 10,000 feet, unless their use causes a distraction during IMC flight.
   5.8.4. Contingency operations may dictate that external lights be off and internal lights be
   limited to the minimum necessary for aircrew activities.
5.9. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures,
arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The
pilot not flying the aircraft will make mandatory advisory calls except those designated for any
crew member.
   5.9.1. Takeoff. State "GO" at refusal speed or takeoff speed, whichever is lower. Any
   aircrew member noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing "GO" will state
   "REJECT" and a brief description of the malfunction (e.g., "Reject, number two engine
   flameout").
   5.9.2. Altitudes.

  - Approach Lights or Runway Environment ―Go Around‖                           ―Go Around‖
 Not in Sight
 Notes:
 1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
 environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go
 around will be made.
 2. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
 environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The
 pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not
 descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as
 reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and
 identifiable.
 3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond
 intention to ―Land‖ if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout
 touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 4. Both pilots and navigator will state the altimeter setting.
     5.9.4. ― Touch and Gos.‖ If a malfunction is encountered, crew members will only state the
     observed malfunction. The pilot in command will announce his/her intention to stop or
     continue the takeoff.
5.10. Deviations.
     5.10.1. The pilot monitoring the aircraft will tell the pilot flying the aircraft when heading or
     airspeed deviations are observed or altitude is more than 100 feet from desired, and no
     attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              43


   5.10.2. Any aircrew member seeing a variation of 200 feet altitude, a deviation of +/-10
   knots in airspeed, or potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately notify the
   pilot.
5.11. Communications Policy:
   5.11.1. Aircraft Interphone:
       5.11.1.1. Do not discuss classified information over interphone when radio transmissions
       are being made unless absolutely necessary for mission accomplishment.
       5.11.1.2. Flight crew members (including AMT) will monitor interphone/flight crew hot
       mic at all times. All crew members will monitor interphone/flight crew hot mic during
       ground operations and all takeoffs, departures, approaches, aerial refuelings and landings.
       Advise the AC when off interphone. During other phases of flight, mission crew
       members will monitor interphone/flight crew hot microphone as directed by the AC or
       MCC.
       5.11.1.3. The AC may clear the mission crew off interphone and direct them to monitor
       Flight Crew hot microphone (―hot mic‖) upon completion of the After Takeoff checklist.
       5.11.1.4. After engine shutdown, crew members will remain on headset until the AC
       clears the crew off headset. The AMT will remain outside the aircraft on headset while
       the GTC is running.
       5.11.1.5. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
       mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing and any flight below
       10,000 feet MSL.
   5.11.2. Command Radios:
       5.11.2.1. In terminal areas, all aircrew members will monitor the primary command
       radio, if able.
       5.11.2.2. The pilot or copilot operating command radios will tell the crew which radio is
       primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       5.11.2.3. A primary flight deck crew member will monitor UHF emergency frequency
       243.0 MHz regardless of primary radio.
       5.11.2.4. One of the pilots will record and read back all air route traffic control (ARTC)
       clearances. The navigator will record the clearance and monitor the read back. Disregard
       this procedure when ATC instructions require immediate execution, or when such action
       interferes with timely completion of more important duties.
5.12. Crew Resource Management (CRM). The goal of CRM is enhancing mission
effectiveness. The responsibility and authority of the aircraft commander is clearly established
in regulations and mission directives. However, CRM is the responsibility of all crew members.
It encompasses all aspects of the mission, from planning through debriefing.
   5.12.1. ACs are responsible for fostering an atmosphere of open communication and crew
   participation in the decision-making process. They should delegate and acknowledge team
   participation. Communication should be frequent, direct, open and concise.
44                                                     AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.12.2. Crew member responsibility includes respecting the authority of the aircraft
     commander. Participate in the mission and decision-making process, and support the AC.
     Crew members must assert their best judgment and, when in doubt, speak out. The AC is the
     final decision authority.
     5.12.3. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members when
     safety might be jeopardized. It provides a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of
     situational awareness and is used to gain the attention of the pilot flying the aircraft. As soon
     as possible after a "Time Out" call, the pilot will stabilize the aircraft, safety permitting. The
     AC at the controls will then allow the crew to voice concerns. Based on crew inputs, the PIC
     will decide whether to continue the current course of action or pursue another. The PIC is
     final decision authority.
     5.12.4. ―Knock it off‖ is used to terminate the maneuver for safety of flight situations. Upon
     hearing ―knock-it-off‖ the crew should establish a safe attitude, altitude and airspeed and
     return the aircraft power and flight controls to a normal configuration.
     5.12.5. The ―Two Challenge‖ rule is used if the pilot not flying the aircraft is unable to gain
     a response from the pilot flying the aircraft. After two challenges, the pilot not flying will
     take control of the aircraft.
5.13. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) and Runway Surface Condition (RSC)
Limitations:
     5.13.1. When no reported RCR is available, consider the runway surface wet when water on
     the runway causes a reflective glare. The minimum RCR on any portion of the runway for
     takeoff or landing is 05.
     5.13.2. The performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete
     runways. The RCR values for the following runway surfaces depicted in Table 5.5 are
     estimates based on operational experience and should be used only as a guide.

Table 5.5. RCR Values.
         TYPE SURFACE                   RCR (DRY)             RCR (WET)
Asphalt/Concrete                              23                   12
Aluminum Matting                              20                   10
M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP)                     20                    8
M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP)                  13                    3
Clay/Crushed Rock                             16                    5
Coral                                         16                    4
     5.13.3. Limit EC-130H aircraft operations into and out of slush- or water-covered runways
     to a covering of 1 inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is
     equal to 1 inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than 1 inch of slush or water
     is present may not be accurate.
5.14. Runway and Taxiway Requirements:
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                45


   5.14.1. Minimum runway width is 80 feet/25 meters. Minimum taxiway width is 30 feet/9
   meters.
   5.14.2. Runway Length for Landing. Minimum runway for landing is landing distance from
   50 feet over the threshold (unless higher obstacles exist).
   5.14.3. Runway Length for Takeoff. Minimum runway for a normal takeoff is balanced or
   unbalanced critical field length, whichever is greater.
      5.14.3.1. The ECG/CC may authorize use of tactical takeoff criteria when necessary for
      mission accomplishment. Comply with performance manual calculation procedures
      using the non-assault crew criteria. This procedure disregards VMCG in takeoff distance
      calculations. Refer to T.O. 1C-130H-1-1, Flight Manual Performance Data for
      definition of tactical takeoff. EC-130H crews fall under the guidance of non-assault
      crews.
          5.14.3.1.1. Calculate minimum field length for tactical takeoff (MFLTTO) by
          correcting MFLMETO using normal takeoff speed. Do not use runways less than
          3,000 feet long unless approved by MAJCOM/A3.
   5.14.4. Intersection takeoffs are authorized and the decision to make intersection takeoffs
   rests solely with the aircraft commander. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) computations
   are based on the runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
   5.14.5. Rolling Takeoffs. A rolling takeoff is preferred if performance calculations permit.
   If the AC deems takeoff performance to be critical, (ie, any time charted performance is
   desired), takeoff power should be applied before the brakes are released (static takeoff). Do
   not perform static takeoffs if crosswinds exceed 10 knots when 30 degrees or more off the
   nose.
5.15. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria:
   5.15.1. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the pilot, the AMT may
   open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above horizontal in
   preparation for back taxi if needed.
   5.15.2. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers,
   by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: According to AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without
   marshallers/wing walkers at home station along locally established taxi lines which have
   been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction.
   5.15.3. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use wing walker(s). If wing walker(s) are not
   available, deplane aircrew member(s) to maintain obstruction clearance.
   5.15.4. Reverse Taxi:
      5.15.4.1. The pilot in the left seat will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be
      used with the AMT and marshaller (when available).
      5.15.4.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
          5.15.4.2.1. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches
          above horizontal.
46                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


            5.15.4.2.2. The AMT will be on the aircraft ramp in the best position to direct reverse
            taxi, report any hazards, and provide the pilot in the left seat with timely interphone
            instructions on turns, distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and
            stopping point.
        5.15.4.3. During night reverse taxi operation, the pilot in command and AMT will ensure
        that the taxi area is sufficiently lighted.
        5.15.4.4. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
5.16. Operating With Runway Barriers. EC-130H aircraft operations are authorized on
runways where BAK-12 systems are installed with an eight-point cable tie-down system. When
operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown if the BAK-12
system includes eight point tie-downs, plan to takeoff and/or touchdown beyond the barrier.
5.17. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
     5.17.1. Except in the case of an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate
     ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the AC will
     use designated jettison areas, except when safety of flight would be compromised.
     5.17.2. The ECG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of
     fuel jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground
     level, off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply
     sources. Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact
     Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
     5.17.3. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
     immediately after landing. Submit report to ECG/SE. ECG/SE will retain report for six
     months. Document all pertinent information, including the following items:
        5.17.3.1. Scheduled Duration.
        5.17.3.2. Actual Duration.
        5.17.3.3. Landing Gross Weight.
        5.17.3.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
        5.17.3.5. Recovery Field.
        5.17.3.6. Runway Available.
        5.17.3.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
        5.17.3.8. Jettison Amount.
        5.17.3.9. Reason for Jettison.
        5.17.3.10. Approval Authority.
5.18. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
     5.18.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              47


       5.18.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.18.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
       pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.18.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local ECG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3 waiver is required
       to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.18.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs or
   landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.
   Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along
   with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.18.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.18.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the enroute portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized CONUS bird
   migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest
   news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) website is another source for real time
   bird hazard information. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.18.5. Following a known bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or
   as practical, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments. PIC should complete AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife
   Strike Report and fax to nearest Air Force Flight Safety Office.
5.19. FCFs, ACFs, & OCFs. FCFs, ACFs and OCFs will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1-1-300,
Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, T.O. 1C-130E(H)-
6CF-, Acceptance and/or Functional Check Procedures Manual, and AFI 21-101. Crews should
only perform tasks or functions contained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to
perform a non-standard function, ACs should contact ECG/ CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.19.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
       5.19.1.1. The ECG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to
       FCF procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent
       waivers require MAJCOM/A3 approval IAW Chapter 1.
       5.19.1.2. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. ECG/CCs may authorize a flight
       under a combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all
       systems are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR
       on Top‖ for the altitude phase of the flight.
48                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        5.19.1.3. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release
        the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating
        the FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
        5.19.1.4. Perform high speed taxi checks IAW the flight manual, maintenance technical
        orders, and policy letter on file in QA. Prepare the aircraft with minimum fuel necessary
        to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will permit a safe
        return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn on the anti-skid
        system. The flight engineer will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned and
        ensure runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions
        without exceeding normal brake energy limits.
     5.19.2. IAW AFI 21-101 para 10.19.3.1, QA will ensure the FCF, ACF or OCF aircrew is
     briefed on the purpose and extent of the flight, previous maintenance problems, and
     discrepancies recorded on the aircraft or engines related to the FCF.
     5.19.3. OCFs are conducted to validate the correct operation of an aircraft system or
     systems. OCF crews will be briefed by maintenance QA on the nature of the previous
     malfunction(s) and subsequent corrective actions. OCF crews will conduct only normal
     flight procedures to verify proper systems operation. In special circumstances, TO 1EC-
     130H-1 section 3 procedures (i.e., manual gear extension, cruise engine shutdown, etc.) may
     be utilized to provide a more thorough check of aircraft systems, but prior coordination with
     55 ECG/EGV is specifically required in such cases. An FCF is normally required should any
     portion of the -6CL checklists be utilized.
     5.19.4. 55 ECG/EGV is the focal point for FCFs, ACFs and OCFs for the flying squadrons.
     55 ECG/EGV will perform the FCF OIC duties outlined in AFI 21-101 paragraph
     10.19.2.29.1 Change 1.
     5.19.5. Crew Complement. An FCF crew consists of: an FCF certified aircraft commander,
     an FCF certified flight engineer, an experienced pilot, an AMT and a navigator. The AMT
     and navigator should be the most experienced available. An OCF crew consists of an
     Instructor Pilot, an experienced Pilot, an experienced Flight Engineer, an AMT and a
     Navigator. If conditions warrant, OCFs may be flown without a Navigator IAW paragraph
     3.2.3. of this volume.
     5.19.6. FCF crew certification (AC and flight engineer). Squadron commanders certify FCF
     crew members by memorandum indicating the dates of completion for each item in
     paragraph 5.19.6.1 to be kept on file in the crew members‘ permanent training folder.
     Squadron DOVs will update the Letter of Certifications IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, 55
     ECG Sup, AircrewStandardizations/Evaluation Program.
        5.19.6.1. FCF crew members may be certified once they meet the requirements listed
        below:
            5.19.6.1.1. TheAC will be instructor qualified IAW 11-2EC-130HV1. The flight
            engineer will be experienced IAW AFI 11-2EC-130HV1, Table 1.1.
            5.19.6.1.2. Nominated for certification by the squadron DO.
            5.19.6.1.3. Once nominated, complete a thorough review of FCF reference material.
            This review must be conducted with another FCF certified crewmember.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                           49


              5.19.6.1.3.1. ACs complete an FCF with an FCF certified AC.
              5.19.6.1.3.2. Flight engineers complete an FCF with an FCF certified flight
              engineer.
5.20. Terrain Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
5.21. Radar Altimeter.
   5.21.1. Any crew member detecting the illumination of the radar altimeter Low Altitude
   Warning Light will immediately notify the pilot flying the aircraft. Terrain clearance and
   aircraft position must be verified.
   5.21.2. Before departure set the radar altimeter for emergency return.
   5.21.3. The navigator and pilot will use the same radar altimeter setting unless briefed
   otherwise.
   5.21.4. Set the radar altimeter to the Height Above Touchdown/Height Above Airport
   (HAT/HAA) during instrument approaches.
5.22. Reduced Power Operations. Pilots will normally use reduced power for takeoffs
provided refusal speed (VR) is equal to or greater than takeoff speed. Use normal takeoff power
if VR is less than takeoff speed.
5.23. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.

6.11. Briefing Requirements. Units may amplify these briefing requirements in the
supplement to this AFI.
     6.11.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The AC will contact the local C2 agency to onfirm
     mission requirements. The AC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
     special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
     activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
     hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
     manuals, and OPORD procedures.
     6.11.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. The AC designated as PIC will ensure that an aircrew
     briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crew members
     on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s) and the ORM factors for the mission.
     Complete this briefing prior to engine start. Cover all applicable items of the operations
     briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), and ORM. Use
     briefing guides contained in AFTTP 3-1.COMPASS CALL, Tactical Employment--EC-130H
     (U) (Secret).
     6.11.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
     peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
     Specialized briefings review tactics and procedures, and technical instructions for specialized
     equipment operations. All crew members should attend each briefing. Crew members may
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              55


   only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties; however, the AC will back
   brief all appropriate items.
   6.11.4. Weather Briefings. The AC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
   forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The AC will brief primary crew
   members on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
       6.11.4.1. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location.
       6.11.4.2. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight or OWS, obtain weather through any means available prior to mission
       accomplishment.
       6.11.4.3. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
       6.11.4.4. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
       are not required.
   6.11.5. Mission Briefing. Conduct mission briefings prior to all mission sorties. Briefing
   content will vary depending on numerous factors including mission requirements,
   ROE/SPINS, threat assessment, etc. Crews will be provided all applicable information to
   ensure safe and effective mission accomplishment. Mission briefings should include, but are
   not limited, to mission description and purpose, itinerary, aircraft configuration and special
   equipment, fuel load, clothing requirements, MAJCOM/NAF/unit Special Interest Items,
   training and evaluation requirements (if applicable), flying safety, and intelligence.
   6.11.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.11.7. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
   obtain a current intelligence briefing.
6.12. Call Signs.
   6.12.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.12.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If call sign is not assigned, obtain and use ACC-assigned off-station call-sign. If
   an ACC-assigned off-station call sign is unavailable, use the Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL)
   option. As a last resort, use unit static call signs.
6.13. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.13.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including enroute wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
56                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        6.13.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
        compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
        diplomatic clearance compliance.
        6.13.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
        Pass any flight plan discrepancies.
     6.13.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
     following methods:
        6.13.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
        6.13.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude is verified for each
        waypoint.
        6.13.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
     6.13.3. The flight engineer will complete AF Form 4064, and AF Form 4063, as specified in
     Chapter 11. Pilots will use AF Form 4063. A pilot crew member, or additional flight
     engineer, will cross-check the AF Form 4063 for accuracy by using the performance manual
     or approved tabulated data. As a minimum, the person checking the data will:
        6.13.3.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF Form 4063.
        6.13.3.2. Cross-check air minimum control speed (Vmca) (one engine inoperative in
        ground effect), takeoff, and landing speeds.
        6.13.3.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
        (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.
        6.13.3.4. When conducting flaps-up landing data for training, compute and post Vmca
        speeds for both configurations; flaps 50% and flaps up (normal boost).
6.14. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1 Instrument Flight
Procedures and Volume 3 Supplemental Fligh Information, this chapter, and the appropriate
MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR), review the
following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate, NOTAMS,
GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. The AC will provide the obstacle height,
distance, and gradient information necessary for performance computations to the flight
engineer.
     6.14.1. VFR Departures. Note: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
     clearance planning.
        6.14.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
        method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
        methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
        requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
        VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
        high terrain are avoided. Note: ECG/CC or designated representative approval is
        required if departing VFR due to inability to meet IFR climb gradient requirements.
        Conduct an ORM analysis for the VFR departure and provide this analysis to the
        approving official.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            57


     6.14.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
     ensuring all the following conditions are met:
        6.14.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
        departure route.
        6.14.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure and
        emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
        6.14.1.2.3. In all cases, the aircraft must be capable of maintaining a climb rate of at
        least 100 ft/nm to VFR traffic pattern altitude. Note: If unable to comply with all of
        the above conditions, download fuel or delay until conditions that are more favorable
        exist.
     6.14.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
     CONUS.
     6.14.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
     clearance.
     6.14.1.5. Conduct night VFR departures, other than VFR pattern operations, only when
     required for mission accomplishment. WARNING: Without the opportunity to see and
     avoid terrain, pilots must exercise extreme caution when aircraft performance is marginal
     and VFR departure is required at night.
  6.14.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
  in AFI 11-202 V3 and AFMAN 11-217 V1.
     6.14.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
     IAW 6.14.1 An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument
     approach.
     6.14.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217 V1). Note: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
        6.14.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
        6.14.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
        6.14.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
        published.
        6.14.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
        6.14.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
        published.
        6.14.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
58                                               AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        6.14.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.14.2.3. Aircraft must be able to meet the published climb gradient, to an applicable IFR
     altitude, for the departure runway with all engines operating. If no minimum climb
     gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used. For purposes of calculating climb gradient,
     aircrews are authorized to use local MVA, MOCA, MSA and/or OROCA as the
     minimum applicable IFR altitude. Aircrew may also use MVA if two operational radios
     are available to receive radar vectors. In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the
     published ALL ENGINE climb gradient:
        6.14.2.3.1. Calculate TOLD using 100 percent engine efficiency, or using drag index
        for LBT antennae removed. These options are automatically approved for day VMC
        but require squadron CC (or designated representative) approval for night VMC or
        day/night IMC conditions. Prior to takeoff, crews must verify engine efficiency and
        thoroughly brief responsibilities for and timing of LBT antenna jettison.
        6.14.2.3.2. Download fuel.
        6.14.2.3.3. Delay the mission until atmospheric conditions allow for sufficient
        performance to meet the requirements.
        6.14.2.3.4. Depart VFR. Comply with para 6.14.1. above.
     6.14.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route if unable to meet the published climb
     gradient with OEI:
        6.14.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedures (SDPs). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI
        escape procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the
        loss of an engine and, where available, should be used for engine-out departure
        planning. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through
        55 ECG/EGV NLT 48 hours prior to scheduled departure. HQ ACC/A3T authorizes
        the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 30 days after the analysis date. The SDP
        analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet.
        6.14.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
        ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
        available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
        gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
        gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
        Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
        crews may subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-
        out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close-in
        obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
        published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
        must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles by computing the MTOGW for
        the obstacles and comparing it to that calculated for the climb restriction. Note: If the
        requirements of 6.16.2.4.2 cannot be met, download fuel or delay until more
        favorable conditions exist.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               59


       6.14.2.5. Practice Instrument Approaches under VFR. For the purpose of determining
       climb requirements, a practice instrument approach under VFR will be considered a
       departure if a touch and go is performed. ECG/CC approval is required if unable to meet
       IFR departure climb restrictions after performing touch and go landings. Practice
       instrument approaches under VFR to low approaches are not considered departures.
       6.14.2.6. Missed Approach Climb Gradients. As per AFI 11-202 V3, missed approach
       climb gradients must meet the published missed approach requirements on 3 engines
       (minimum 200 ft/nm). This includes flying alternate climb out procedures in lieu of a
       published missed approach. AFI 11-202 V3 eliminates this requirement for initial
       takeoffs only, provided the aircraft can vertically clear all obstacles OEI along the missed
       approach routing/emergency return.
   6.14.3. Critical Field Length (CFL). Takeoff gross weight (GW) must never exceed that
   which would require CFL in excess of the runway available for a normal takeoff. In some
   cases, a minimum altitude is required at the published screen height. For screen height of 50
   feet or less, use DER correction on the balanced critical field length chart to determine if
   runway available and aircraft performance meet departure restrictions. For higher screen
   height (greater than 50 feet), add 50 feet to balanced CFL for every foot of required altitude
   at DER (Example: 55 feet screen height drives a 250 feet increase to balanced CFL).
   6.14.4. Gross Weight (GW). Unless waived by MAJCOM/A3, ensure that the aircraft does
   not exceed the maximum GW, zero fuel weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in
   the aircraft flight manual. GW may be further restricted by operating conditions such as,
   icing, temperature, pressure altitude, runway length and slope, aerodrome weight bearing
   capacity, departure maneuvering, required climb gradients, and obstacles.
6.15. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Minimum RVR for takeoff is 1600.
   6.15.1. For RVR less than 1600 but equal to or greater than 1000, takeoffs are permitted for
   operational missions provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum
   RVR 1000 on both), runway centerline lighting is operational, and both pilots are fully
   qualified in their respective crew position. If any of the above criteria is not met, minimum
   RVR is 1600 on all RVR readouts.
       6.15.1.1. When weather is below landing minimums, a departure alternate is required
       (see paragraph 6.19).
       6.15.1.2. If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be
       reported to be 1/2 mile (800 meters) or better.
6.16. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202 V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.17. Departure Alternates.
60                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     6.17.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for an
     available approach (at departure aerodrome). If planning an ILS approach, Category I
     minimums will be used.
     6.17.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
     aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
     (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
     a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
        6.17.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
        equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until
        one hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or:
        6.17.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
        least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
        600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
        remain so for one hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.18. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202 V3 and the following:
     6.18.1. File two alternates when:
        6.18.1.1. The forecast visibility (TEMPO or prevailing) is less than published for the
        available DOD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
        6.18.1.2. The forecast ceiling or visibility (TEMPO or prevailing) is less than published
        for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (for
        example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
        taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
        as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
        with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
        6.18.1.3. The forecast surface winds (TEMPO or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for
        RCR.
     6.18.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
     aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTIONS: comply with basic AFI 11-202V3 when:
        6.18.2.1. OCONUS intra-theater flight does not exceed a 3-hour duration; or
        6.18.2.2. OCONUS mission orbit is less than 3 hours flight time from arrival or
        departure base.
     6.18.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
     geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
     The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
        6.18.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
        and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
        6.18.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
        minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
        precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              61


      precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
      minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). Note: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
      considerations to a remote or island destination.
   6.18.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes
   greater than 59°N, see Chapter 14 for fuel planning considerations.
6.19. Adverse Weather.
   6.19.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.19.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft to which the forecast turbulence
      applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture
      for their route of flight. The EC-130H is a category III aircraft for turbulence.
      6.19.1.2. The AC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.19.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   Note: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing.
      6.19.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.19.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.19.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
          flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
          associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures.
          6.19.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 (Type I and Type II) and AMS 1424 (Type I) de-icing fluids
          are approved for use on the EC-130. These deicing fluids do not provide any anti-
          icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times.
          6.19.2.2.3. In all cases, ACs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
          completed within 5 minutes of departure.
   6.19.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
   avoid them by at least:
      6.19.3.1. 20 NMs at or above FL 230.
      6.19.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230. WARNING: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or
      more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information
62                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203 Volume 1, Weather for
        Aircrews.
     6.19.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
     used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
     never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
     based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
     instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
        6.19.4.1. Changing routing.
        6.19.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
        6.19.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
     6.19.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
     clouds advected (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
     thunderstorms.
     6.19.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
     departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
        6.19.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
        6.19.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
        6.19.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential (defined in 6.21.11).             Note:
        Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs
        providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong
        winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not
        forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the
        planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
     6.19.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
     or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH,
     and other altitudes inside the FAF. Additional procedures for temperature corrections
     beyond the requirements listed in the FIH are contained in AFI 11-202 V3.
     6.19.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
     turbulence.
     6.19.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
     flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
     weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
     6.19.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
     volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid flying downwind of
     volcanic activity, and in all cases by at least 20 NMs.
     6.19.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
     strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
        6.19.11.1. Within 8°C of freezing level.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              63


       6.19.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
       6.19.11.3. In clouds within plus or minus 5,000 feet of the freezing level.
6.20. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. ACs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.21. AFTO Form 781.
   6.21.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the AC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.21.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. After
   the maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling
   agency. The AC's concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.21.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   Chapter 12.
6.22. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.22.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will
   comply with T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding
   and refueling job guide. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not
   readily available and the mission would be delayed. Crew members may augment
   maintenance refueling teams at enroute stops.
   6.22.2. Aircraft Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
       6.22.2.1. The aircraft dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
          6.22.2.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours provided the aircraft is
          sealed, not flown and documented entry control is maintained).
          6.22.2.1.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
       6.22.2.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick turn, a thorough visual
       inspection will be performed. A thorough visual inspection will include, but is not
       limited to, ensuring all panels are secure, tires and struts are inflated, all hydraulic
       reservoirs are serviced, and there are no visible fluid leaks on the aircraft.
64                                                 AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


            6.22.2.2.1. An aircraft should be sealed if the aircrew preflight has been completed
            and the aircraft will be unattended by aircrew. The time an aircraft remains sealed
            will not exceed the maintenance dash six inspection time limit.
            6.22.2.2.2. Once the aircraft is sealed, the following notes will be entered in the
            aircraft AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document,
            discrepancy block, and the maintenance operations desk and Squadron Operations
            Center (SOC) will be notified of the seal number:
Note: E preflight inspection C.W., Time:______, Fuel:_______, LOX:______, Seal #:_____
Note: AMT preflight inspection C.W., Time:______, Seal #:_____________.
The E/AMT will state what sections of the preflight were not accomplished.
            6.22.2.2.3. An aircraft seal may be broken only by a maintenance officer,
            maintenance superintendent, production superintendent, flight engineer or AMT. The
            corrective actions block in 781A will be annotated anytime the seal is broken. The
            date corrected block will be completed, noting the reason for breaking the seal, and
            the corrected/transferred by block will be signed. In addition, a new discrepancy
            block will be completed as follows:
Note: Aircraft Resealed, Seal #____________, See Page:_____ block:_____ (this will refer to
the discrepancy block where the aircraft was originally sealed).
     6.22.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
        6.22.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
        for fire protection during engine start.
        6.22.3.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC.      A crew
        member or ground controller may act as fireguard.
     6.22.4. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
        6.22.4.1. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish
        engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for
        maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
            6.22.4.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
            preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
            intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
            documentation.
            6.22.4.1.2. Use the pilot, flight engineer and AMT flight manual checklists. Begin
            with the "cockpit checklist," and complete all appropriate checklists through the
            "before leaving the airplane" checklist.
            6.22.4.1.3. Only deviate from the flight crew checklist when maintenance requires
            less than four engines to be started.
            6.22.4.1.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
            required. Note: The above procedures do not preclude an aircrew from allowing
            maintenance personnel onboard to troubleshoot an engine malfunction after engines
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                65


           have been started at the beginning of a mission or prior to engine shutdown at the end
           of a mission. ERCC procedures apply (see TO 1EC-130H-1 procedures).
   6.22.5. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. If
   required to occupy cockpit positions during towing operations conducted by personnel not
   familiar with C-130 towing procedures, the AC will coordinate with the senior maintenance
   officer or superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-
   USAF installations, the AC must have approval from the airfield operations officer or
   manager prior to towing. The AC will ensure the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on
   their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as
   to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to
   tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances
   will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor.
   6.22.6. During servicing and ground operations, personnel will not walk through a prop arc
   unless performing engine/propeller maintenance, inspecting intakes, or performing required
   pilot, flight engineer or AMT preflight duties. Personnel will not enter a prop arc while an
   engine/GTC is running, or external air is connected to the aircraft. After stations time
   maintenance personnel will report to the AMT prior to boarding. The AMT will relay the
   number of maintenance personnel enplaning/deplaning to the PIC.
6.23. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. The PIC is responsible for
ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission tasking. If qualified aircraft
maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet
subsequent mission tasking.
   6.23.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       6.23.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       6.23.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
       6.23.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       6.23.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       6.23.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       6.23.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       6.23.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   6.23.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   6.23.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
6.24. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
66                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     6.24.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
     flight from the equal time point (ETP) should oxygen be required (minimum 5 liters in the
     system with walk-around bottles filled).
        6.24.1.1. Since the EC-130H flight deck can accommodate more crew members than
        there are oxygen regulators, EC-130H aircrew may pre-position emergency escape
        breathing devices (EEBD), emergency passenger oxygen systems (EPOS), or passenger
        oxygen kits (POK) on the aircraft.
        6.24.1.2. When carrying passengers or MEPs, distribute EPOS (if available) to each
        passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. If the POKs are used, the kits need only
        be positioned on the aircraft and distributed to each passenger for scheduled flights above
        FL250. Mixing EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. EPOS/POKs will
        be distributed and their use demonstrated before departure.
        6.24.1.3. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
        Additional crew members above those required to accomplish the mission shall be
        considered passengers for the purpose of determining oxygen requirements.
        6.24.1.4. Crew members occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask with
        communication connected and readily available for use from before engine start until
        engine shutdown.
        6.24.1.5. Crew members who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have
        a POK or EEBD within reach for flights above 10,000 feet.
     6.24.2. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. The AMT will place an
     LPU within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on overwater
     flights (outside gliding distance to land). Crew members will fit and adjust LPUs (if
     applicable) for overwater flights and will wear them on overwater missions below 2,000 feet.
     (EXCEPTION: LPUs need not be worn for takeoffs, landings or approaches).
     6.24.3. Parachutes:
        6.24.3.1. Parachutes will be carried on aircraft IAW AFI 11-301V2, Maintenance and
        Configuration Requirements for Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Aircrew and Aircraft-
        installed Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE) and T.O. 1EC-130H-5-2.
        6.24.3.2. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
        in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness. As a secondary option only, if a safety
        harness is unavailable, personnel will wear a parachute at a minimum.
     6.24.4. Aircrew Flight Equipment Documentation. ACs will ensure all prepositioned AFE
     and survival equipment items are serviceable, inventoried, and certified on the AFTO Form
     46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment (or equivalent), prior to flight. Notify the AFE
     section ofany onboard equipment shortages or unserviceable conditions. Note discrepancies
     in the AFTO Form 781F, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance Document.
     Standard preflight requirements will suffice for inventories at enroute stops when the crew
     does not change. Do not open sealed bags for the sole reason to count equipment. Check
     attached tag on sealed bags for type and quantity of equipment and inspection currency.

Section 6D—Departure
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                67


6.25. On-Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within +/-
30 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.25.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to meet mission requirements. PICs shall
   notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
   6.25.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   air refueling control time, on-station time, ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational
   limitations, to adjust mission flow during a large-scale operation, or if approved through C2
   channels provided the impact on local facilities and crew duty is evaluated.

Section 6E—Enroute

6.26. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor GPS/INS
performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Use the following
procedures for flight progress:
   6.26.1. Before an oceanic flight, plot the oceanic portion on an appropriate chart. Annotate
   the chart with the mission number and date. If practical, chart may be reused.
   6.26.2. The navigator will verify waypoint data inserted into the CANS/INS by checking
   both the coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
       6.26.2.1. Use all available navigational aids to monitor CANS/INS performance.
       Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
       centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Use the
       following procedures for flight progress:
           6.26.2.1.1. When approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates for the next
           waypoint.
           6.26.2.1.2. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight
           on the chart.
       6.26.2.2. Navigators will use the procedures in Chapter 11 for flight following.
   6.26.3. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
   guidance). US military aircraft and DOD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
   government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter
   their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
   officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
       6.26.3.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
       airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial
       seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
       state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,
       inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted
       in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
       6.26.3.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs.
       Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
       operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
68                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
        by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
        beyond 12 NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
        limits, which differ from the standard.
        6.26.3.3. Flight Information Region. An FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
        information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international
        borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
        approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
        6.26.3.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
        into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
        amend entry point(s).
        6.26.3.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
        departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
        clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
        6.26.3.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
        penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
        country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
        6.26.3.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
        to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response
        will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned
        destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international
        airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no
        circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over
        sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic channels before mission
        departure, as being valid authorization.
        6.26.3.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
        will normally be briefed at home station, on-load station, and/or by the last C2 facility
        transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
        6.26.3.9. Aircrews normally are not tasked to and should not fly "due regard" routings
        unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the
        mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option obligates the military AC to be
        their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational
        requirements dictate, ACs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft.
        Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical. Additional
        information on ―due regard‖ is contained in FLIP General Planning, Chapter 7.
6.27. Navigational Aid Capability. Note:: EC-130H GPS systems (either hand-held or
integrated) are mission-enhancement systems only, and are not certified for IFR navigation. EC-
130H crews will not use GPS, either in PPS or SPS mode, as the primary source of navigation
information.
     6.27.1. MNPS standards are established in FLIP.           Note: Airspace and associated
     navigational aid equipment capability are rapidly evolving. Pilots must maintain an in depth
     knowledge of current FLIP requirements/policies.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               69


      6.27.1.1. Aircraft that lose required equipment prior to oceanic airspace will return to the
      nearest maintenance repair facility.
   6.27.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
   is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific
   aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. The EC-130H is not RVSM
   compliant at this time, pending future upgrades. Once integrated, pilots will refer to FLIP
   AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements:
      6.27.2.1. Pilot and copilot altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system,
      and the transponder must be fully operational. The AC will request a new clearance to
      avoid this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
      6.27.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
      the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
      6.27.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.            Record
      readings of both altimeters.
      6.27.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
      6.27.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
      other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
      6.27.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
      RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
      6.27.2.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
      equipment.
   6.27.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. EC-130H aircraft are approved
   for RNP-5 operations only with a qualified navigator at the navigator‘s station. Airspace
   where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace. RNP airspace is being
   incorporated around the world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation
   requirements between routes. Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required
   equipment fails after entry into RNP airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in
   the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. Minimum equipment
   to operate in RNP-5 airspace is one INS capable of updates. Flights entering RNP-5 airspace
   after long over water flight must be especially aware of RNP-5 tolerances and update
   accordingly. Aircrew should refer to FLIP General Planning for specific tolerance
   information.
6.28. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as
indicated in FLIP planning or FLIP Enroute Supplement.
   6.28.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features. The crew should note position, heading, time,
   speed when harassed, and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest
   C2 agency. Also, attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF
   range.
70                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     6.28.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFI 10-206,
     Operational Reporting.
6.29. In-flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time and their meals should
consist of different menu items. Flameless Ration Heaters, included in MREs, will not be
activated or handled inside the aircraft.
6.30. Communications.
     6.30.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF
     radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact
     before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling
     HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
     should return to the nearest suitable support base.
     6.30.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
     unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the global HF stations.
6.31. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The AC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202 V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform the passengers of the situation and intentions.
     6.31.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical, after completing the aircraft
     emergency action checklists and associated actions, the AC shall furnish ATC and
     appropriate C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions
     and any other pertinent information.
     6.31.2. The AC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL when additional expertise is
     necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
        6.31.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
        6.31.2.2. Enroute. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest C2 Center using
        global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc.
        6.31.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
            6.31.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
            6.31.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
            6.31.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
            6.31.2.3.4. Position.
            6.31.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
            6.31.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
            6.31.2.3.7. Qualification of all primary crewmembers.
            6.31.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
6.32. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the AC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and the major
complaint.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              71


Section 6F—Arrival

6.33. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots and navigators will review
appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary
crew members will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach
monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.33.1. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior
   to descent.
       6.33.1.1. Obtain weather from any USAF base weather station via pilot-to-meteorologist
       service (PMSV), Flight Service Station (FSS), ATIS, or a USAF aeronautical station.
       Check on the latest weather prior to descent or landing.
       6.33.1.2. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact
       USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB GE (DSN 314-496-6145). In the SOUTHCOM AOR,
       contact 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ (DSN 228-1977).
       6.33.1.3. The ATC system can provide weather information to enroute aircraft, based on
       controller workload. All CONUS ARTCCs have weather forecasters assigned, but will
       only provide weather information when their workload allows. Do not use ARTCC
       controllers as a primary source of weather information.
       6.33.1.4. SIGMET (significant meteorological information) advisories will be
       transmitted from the servicing ATC unit. Crews will consider all SIGMETs valid for
       their aircraft until verified as not applicable with a military METRO service.
   6.33.2. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions, if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational mission
   requires a non-standard approach.
       6.33.2.1. On training/evaluation flights at familiar fields, pilots may fly non-precision
       approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The
       PM will monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
       6.33.2.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.34. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.34.1. Aircraft category. The C-130 is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   140 knots, the minimums for category "D" will be used.
   6.34.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11202 V3.
   6.34.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an
   enroute descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
       6.34.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
72                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


            6.34.3.1.1. For precision approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
            meters) or 1/ 2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available. DH will
            be based on a HAT of no less than 200 feet.
        6.34.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
            6.34.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
            required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
            rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
            add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
            which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
            feet). When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
            minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 500 feet and 1.5 miles
            visibility (Category C) or 600 feet and 2 miles visibility (Category D) above
            published airport elevation.
        6.34.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½
        statute miles (SM) or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the
        runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. This applies only to the ALS
        itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.
        6.34.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DOD or NACO
        precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
        requirements before initiating enroute descent, penetration or approach.
     6.34.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
        6.34.4.1. If full flight instrumentation is not available and operational, aircraft are limited
        to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300 feet and RVR 40, or ¾ mile visibility (1220
        meters) with no RVR.
            6.34.4.1.1. Category I ILS. Full flight instrumentation consists of: dual flight
            displays (one flight director plus ADI repeat), complete differential pressure
            instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot
            positions.
            6.34.4.1.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR) consists
            of: complete differential pressure instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude
            indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
     6.34.5. Category I ILS Procedures.
        6.34.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
        certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
        procedures:
            6.34.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
            6.34.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
            6.34.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
            ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
            arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            73


          clearance, which did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
          directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
          6.34.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
          disengaged when a breakout is directed.
          6.34.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
          immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
          clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
          comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
          determines safety to be a factor.
   6.34.6. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
   conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS and the ASRR. Back up
   each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the
   FMS or CANS.
   6.34.7. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When cleared for or established on a
   segment of the approach and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach
   minimums, the PF has the option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point
   (MAP)/DH. If the approach is abandoned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required
   for the missed approach procedure). Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
   amended clearance is received.
      6.34.7.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
      is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
      6.34.7.2. If the approach is continued, the AC must have sufficient fuel available to
      complete the approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with
      normal fuel reserve.
      6.34.7.3. The AC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
      designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.34.8. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
      6.34.8.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
      and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
      remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
      6.34.8.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
      will be consumed.

Section 6G— Post-Flight

6.35. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, crew
members debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required.
   6.35.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
74                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


6.36. Border Clearance.
     6.36.1. Normal Operations.
        6.36.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
        clearance of its aircraft.
        6.36.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the AC.
        Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the AMT, but the AC retains ultimate
        responsibility. When an EC-130H aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
        function, the AC is responsible for ensuring the following:
            6.36.1.2.1. Crew membersand passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
            when required.
            6.36.1.2.2. Crew membersand passengers have current certificates of immunization
            (shot record).
            6.36.1.2.3. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
            clearance can be obtained.
            6.36.1.2.4. Obtaining border clearance for passengers, crew and baggage, if required,
            before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.
            6.36.1.2.5. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
     6.36.2. Procedures for US Entry.
        6.36.2.1. Enroute, the AMT will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
        accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers and crew members. The AMT will
        also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile
        necessary border clearance forms for the AC's signature.
        6.36.2.2. Enroute, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
        ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
        6.36.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
        which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
        in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
        cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
        offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
        proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
        completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
        intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
        manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
        center.
        6.36.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
        normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
        passengers, troops, or crew members unless necessary for safety or the preservation of
        life and property (AMT excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
        agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
        initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
        or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                75


  6.36.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.36.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in AFI 24-405
     Depart of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), General Information (Chapter 3).
     In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from searches,
     seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials.
     In addition, ACs must be aware of, and adhere to, any specific FCG provisions for
     individual countries.
     6.36.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.36.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.36.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the AC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The AC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.36.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.36.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the AC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The AC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The AC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.36.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
     Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.36.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.36.4.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
     require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.36.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
     and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
76                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US on-load or off-load
        base, or at the foreign on-load or off-load base.
        6.36.4.3. Customs Procedures.
            6.36.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507 is not required
            unless directed.
            6.36.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
               6.36.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).
        6.36.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
            6.36.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
            all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
            6.36.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
        6.36.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
            6.36.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
            6.36.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
            civilian passengers.
               6.36.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507.
        6.36.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
            6.36.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
            6.36.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult Border Clearance Guide.
     6.36.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crew members will ensure
     compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements. Expect a Customs
     representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations.
6.37. Insect and Pest Control.
     6.37.1. Responsibility. ACs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
     AFJI 48-104,Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
     as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms
     provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
     board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
        6.37.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
        National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
        Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
            6.37.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
            sprayed.
            6.37.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
            loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
            wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               77


           6.37.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
           use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
           minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.37.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. Note: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.37.2. Responsibility of AC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.37.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation.
6.38. Aircrew Debriefing. Review and evaluate overall training and/or mission performance.
Each student or aircrew member should understand thoroughly what training has been
accomplished, or lessons learned from mission employment. Ensure all training is documented.
Debrief maintenance write-ups with applicable personnel.

Section 6H—Miscellaneous

6.39. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.39.1. Notify ATC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of routing,
   altitude, weather, etc.
   6.39.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.40. Cockpit Voice Recorder. If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.41. Aircrew Flight and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The AC or designated
representative will:
   6.41.1. Before departing home station or enroute stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.41.2. Before departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review AF Form
   4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21 equipment has
   been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by maintenance,
   and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.41.3. Before departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review, sign, and
   date the AFTO Form 46 to ensure all required protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment
   and survival equipment have been certified as installed by AFE and that configuration
   documents match mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life
   preservers are aboard for over-water missions.

     6.41.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
     accomplish the following:
        6.41.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
        ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an enroute station is documented in the
        AFTO Form 781A.
        6.41.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
        indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
        entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
        46 on board the aircraft in the event of an enroute crew change.
        6.41.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
        recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
        6.41.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
        6.41.4.5. When possible, advise HQ ACC/A3TV and HQ ACC/A3TO (or MAJCOM
        aircrew flight equipment office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management)
        before mission continuation.
     6.41.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
     annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
     vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
     number of that column.
6.42. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency
for further instructions.
6.43. Loose Objects in the Cockpit.
     6.43.1. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed behind the condition levers or on the
     throttle quadrant during critical phases of flight.
     6.43.2. Place only soft items on the top bunk.
6.44. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the AC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP)
section 5-37 for more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.45. Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of flares or
the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
     6.45.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location.
     6.45.2. The flight engineer or AMT will deplane the aircraft and check all flare dispensers
     for hung ordnance or damage, and will maintain contact with either a safety observer or the
     AC at all times, either visually or over interphone. Note: ALE-47 flare squibs that fail to
     fire are not considered hung ordnance.
     6.45.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
     cartridge, the aircraft will remain in or proceed to a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                79


   Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe
   area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
   6.45.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
6.46. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.46.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock
   and seal the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards
   employed by the host country for flight line/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
   classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
      6.46.1.1. COMPASS CALL aircraft security requirements are defined in AFI 31-
      101,The Air Force Installation Security Program(FOUO) when operating at US Air
      Force installations and in AFJI 31-102 (OPNAVINST 5530.15A, AFR 207–4, MCO
      5500.13A, DLAR 5710.4) when operating on another service‘s installation. Chapter 7 of
      this volume provides additional guidance. Security requirements should be specified in
      the deployment order for deployed operations.
      6.46.1.2. The security requirements for an aircraft processing SCI material are the same
      as a ground SCIF.
   6.46.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during enroute,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC
   will only be transferred to authorized DOD personnel. The PIC and MCC will ensure that all
   material, discussions and display screens are limited to the clearance level of escorted
   personnel.
   6.46.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/ exercise tasking.
   6.46.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode IV, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.46.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode IV on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode IV interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.46.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV will continue to their intended destinations.
   Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
80                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
     aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace
     control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
     6.46.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode IV, when conducted, are a mandatory
     maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
     the Mode IV on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
     6.46.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
     Mode IV on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
     destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
     managers for guidance.
     6.46.9. Emergency Destruction. Destroy/damage classified material/equipment prior to a
     crash landing or bailout if possible. If the situation does not permit securing of classified
     material during ground egress, aircrew will obtain the names and telephone numbers of all
     un-cleared emergency responders and/or maintenance personnel who boarded the aircraft and
     were exposed to classified material. If SCI material was inadvertently disclosed, the SSO
     will be contacted to conduct an inadvertent disclosure briefing to those members exposed to
     SCI.
6.47. Confidence Activities:
     6.47.1. Confidence activities (in-flight opening of paratroop doors or ramp and cargo door)
     are required for AMT and flight engineer training to prepare for emergency procedures.
     Conduct confidence activities IAW the Inflight Guide. Only AMTs and flight engineers are
     permitted to accomplish the confidence activities. All other aircrew members not taking part
     in the confidence activities will be seated with seat belt securely fastened.
     6.47.2. Confidence activities will only be conducted during syllabus training, continuation
     training, or during evaluations.
     6.47.3. A safety observer (flight engineer or AMT) will be present during all confidence
     activities and will have a second restraint harness on and fitted. Note: Do not use the flight
     deck restraint harness for confidence activities.
     6.47.4. Adjust the lifeline of the restraint harness to allow mobility only to the troop door for
     opening and closing. WARNING: Aircraft ramp and door and paratroop doors will not be
     open at the same time. WARNING: Except for an actual contingency or emergency that
     threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint harness will not be
     disconnected or lengthened to a point that would allow the AMT/flight engineer to fall
     outside the aircraft.
     6.47.5. A parachute will not be worn in place of a restraint harness during any confidence
     activity training or evaluation.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security and unlawful seizure of
aircraft. EC-130H aircraft are normally priority C assets, but become priority B assets when
transient or deployed IAW AFJI 31-102 (AR 90-160 . AFI 13207, Preventing and Resisting
Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, and specific MAJCOM security publications contain
additional guidance.
7.2. Security. See AFI 13-207; AFI 10-701, Operations Security; and AFI 31-101, for
requirements for protection of aircraft in transient status at US and foreign bases.
7.3. Security Procedures:
   7.3.1. Forward Operating Location Security. Security arrangements at forward operating
   locations will be made by DETCOs or ADVON personnel, and must comply with the
   minimum requirements referenced in AFI 31-101, which provides protection level status and
   procedures for COMPASS CALL and other aircraft.
   7.3.2. Enroute Security. ACs will receive a threat assessment and security capability
   evaluation briefing at home station and receive updates at enroute C2s. Assess the situation
   and take the following actions, if necessary:
       7.3.2.1. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces. If local authorities
       request payment for this service, use AF Form 15.
       7.3.2.2. Direct armed aircrew members to remain with the aircraft and maintain
       surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft. Acquire a
       means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces, if available.
       7.3.2.3. If the AC determines airfield security is inadequate and the safety of the aircraft
       is in question, (i.e. local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable and the crew is
       not augmented with security police), the AC may waive crew duty time limitations and
       depart as soon as possible for a base where adequate security is available. If departure is
       not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. Crew rest
       requirements are subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe/equipment may be at
       risk. Request security assistance from the nearest DoD installation, US embassy, local
       military or law enforcement, as appropriate.
       7.3.2.4. If, in the AC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and sealed to detect
       unauthorized entry, use the aircraft lock and secure the hatches, windows, and doors in a
       manner that will indicate unauthorized entry. Wipe the immediate area around lock and
       latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced entry. Coordinate with local base
       operations on procedures for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. Report any
       unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special Investigation (OSI), security
       forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to
       flight.
7.4. Arming of Aircrew Members. Due to the nature of the EC-130H mission, crews will not
normally be armed enroute to a forward operating location. However, weapons may be carried
82                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


on the aircraft for use in theater. When the ECG/CC determines the nature of the deployment
warrants the aircrews carry weapons enroute, follow the procedures in paragraph 7.4.1 below.
     7.4.1. Weapons Issue (Enroute). When required by Rules of Engagement (ROE), Air
     Tasking Order (ATO), or Special Instructions (SPINS), obtain weapons and ammunition
     from the weapons storage area. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207,
     Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and MAJCOM directives. Present a
     current AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data, for weapon issue. The same
     weapon will be reissued until the mission terminates. If an armed aircrew member must
     leave the crew enroute, transfer the weapon to another authorized aircrew member using AF
     Form 1297.
        7.4.1.1. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if available. To transfer
        loaded weapons to another aircrew member, place the weapon on a flat surface. Do not
        use hand-to-hand transfer.
        7.4.1.2. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from the armory and other
        facilities associated with aircrew activities (e.g., base operations, fleet service, cargo and
        passenger terminals, flight line cafeteria or snack bar). Weapons will remain under the
        positive control of the crewmember at all times.
        7.4.1.3. Aircrew members will be armed prior to preflight duties. When no passengers
        are aboard and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may be stored in the gun
        box in flight. Aircrew members will rearm before landing. Weapons will not be
        unloaded before placement in the gun box.
        7.4.1.4. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available, normally a
        base or civil law enforcement armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable, secure
        firearms and ammunition in the aircraft. If the aircraft is not equipped with a gun box,
        leave the weapons in the most secure and least visible location on the aircraft. Attempt to
        seal the weapons with a boxcar seal and maintain the seal number. Lock and seal the
        aircraft doors.
     7.4.2. Contingency Missions:
        7.4.2.1. Normally, all crewmembers will be issued weapons prior to combat/combat
        support sorties, as part of their survival equipment, in accordance with theater directives.
        Procedures for weapons issue will be determined by squadron commander/DETCO in
        conjunction with AFE personnel. Additionally, in-garrison weapons issue / arming
        procedures will be developed by deployed leadership commensurate with current force
        protection procedures.
7.5. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. Refer to AFI 13-207 for detailed guidance. Security
operations surrounding EC-130H aircraft at deployed locations are normally sufficient to deter
piracy without any action by aircrew. Aircrew should always remain vigilant to any unusual
circumstances, and report them to security forces.
     7.5.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
     amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
     enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
     in-flight in the United States.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              83


   7.5.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.5.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide the FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI,
   with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD
   before directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.5.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.5.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.5.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.5.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is a stimulus rather than a deterrent, ordinary law enforcement procedures
   may be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of
   the hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.5.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.5.9. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.6. Armed Passengers. EC-130H aircraft normally do not carry passengers; therefore the risk
of hijacking is further reduced. When carried, passengers will normally not carry weapons or
ammunition on their person or in hand carried baggage. Exceptions include special agents and
guards of the Secret Service or State Department and other individuals specifically authorized to
carry weapons. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons.
   7.6.1. Passengers or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
   aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or AC. Excepted passengers (above)
   may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations.
   7.6.2. If guards or couriers must clear their weapons, the AC will ensure the individual:
       7.6.2.1. Moves to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
       7.6.2.2. Clears weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When an EC-130H is operating
away from home station, the AC or DETCO, as appropriate, will ensure compliance with this
chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
7.8. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
84                                                    AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
     7.8.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
     while the aircraft is on the ground:
        7.8.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
        aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
        7.8.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
        vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
        be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
        order:
            7.8.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
            7.8.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose area of responsibility (AOR) the airfield
            lies.
            7.8.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
            7.8.1.2.4. AC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
7.9. In-flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
     7.9.1. Engage the hijackers in conversation to calm him or her and to evaluate what course
     of action might be effective.
     7.9.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
     7.9.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
     7.9.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a hostile,
     country.
     7.9.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
     physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.10. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews will be familiar with
guidance found in AFI 13-207 and the HQ AFFSA website.
7.11. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. These procedures are designed to deter
possible hostile action against the hijacked aircraft that has been forced to penetrate airspace of a
nation unfriendly to the United States.
     7.11.1. If instructions from the unfriendly nation are received, either by radio contact or by
     air intercept before boundary crossing, comply with instructions received.
     7.11.2. If no contact with unfriendly nation is made before approaching a boundary:
        7.11.2.1. Maintain TAS not more than 400 knots.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              85


       7.11.2.2. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 and 25,000 feet if possible.
       7.11.2.3. Fly a direct course toward destination announced by the hijacker, if no course is
       specified.
       7.11.2.4. Follow communications procedures set forth in FLIP.
   7.11.3. Consider the presence of classified documents and equipment aboard the aircraft.
   When a landing in an unfriendly nation is imminent, attempt to dispose of or destroy the
   equipment or material.
7.12. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member’s
Personal Protection Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism
(AT), for force protection measures.

assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing, unit, or local flight safety officer.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report (AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
Program). AF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to alert
supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective action. A
hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may jeopardize the health and
well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or destruction of any weapons
system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The Air Force HATR program
provides a means for personnel to report all near midair collisions (NMAC), TCAS resolution
advisories requiring the aircraft to deviate from assigned course/altitude, alleged hazardous air
traffic conditions, or NAVAIDS, FLIP or published directions/instructions that contributed to a
hazardous situation. Use information in HATR reports only for mishap prevention.
     8.3.1. AFI 91-202, Attch 3, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Program and AFMAN
     91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports list HATR reportable incidents.

        8.3.2.1. Anyone aware of a reportable incident files a HATR, RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602.
        8.3.2.2. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
        available. Submit the completed AF Form 651 to the base safety office. If landing airport
        is not a US Air Force Base, notify the safety office of the Air Force base nearest to
        location where the condition occurred, the AC‘s home base safety office, the safety office
        at the next landing base, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide
        contact sufficient information to prepare AF Form 651. Unit Commanders will ensure
        AF Form 651 is available to aircrew at base operations facilities, flying squadron
        operations offices, in trip kits, and in US Air Force air traffic control facilities.
            8.3.2.2.1. When flying in Europe reference STANAG 3750 NATO Standardization
            Agreement, Reporting and Investigation of Air Traffic Incidents procedures and
            guidelines for filing a HATR.
        8.3.2.3. If you have a NMAC, make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the
        nearest ATC agency (e.g., center, FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and
        give the following information as appropriate:
            8.3.2.3.1. Identification or call sign.
            8.3.2.3.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,
            incident, etc.

          8.3.2.3.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a NMAC upon
          landing and request that th controllers save all available data. Note: ATC agencies
          (e.g., FAA) must know if an official report is being filed.
   8.3.3. Immunity From Disciplinary Action. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted
   immunity from disciplinary action provided:
      8.3.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
      8.3.3.2. They committed no criminal offense.
      8.3.3.3. No mishap occurred.
      8.3.3.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above. Note: HATR
      reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
8.4. AF Form 711, USAF Aircraft Mishap Report Worksheet (AFI 91-204):
   8.4.1. Responsibilities. Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft or
   crew. When notified, appropriate authorities will initiate investigative and reporting actions
   in accordance with AFI 91-204. Note: Do not attempt to classify a mishap.
   8.4.2. Reportable Mishaps:
      8.4.2.1. Report damage to the aircraft, or injury to the crew or passengers; also report
      any damage or injury to another organization‘s equipment or personnel resulting from the
      movements or actions of an aircraft or crew.

8.5. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL)--Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               89


invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference AFI 11-202V3. Use the Multi Service
Corporation (MSC) air card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at
commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for
use by all U.S. government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign
government aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there
will be no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract
locations. The MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. It replaces the
Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.5.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of AIR card could
   create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.5.2. Refuel/de-fuel USAF aircraft at DOD locations when ever possible. If DOD service is

     AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
       NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

9.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-
Yield Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security
threats to the global operations of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRNE threat,
passive defense measures to mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in
a contaminated environment.
9.2. Understanding the CBRNE Threat.
   9.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb
   into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent
   bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of removing
   chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. Note:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   9.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   9.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   9.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   radiation and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear
   detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
   9.2.5. High-Yield Explosives. High-yield explosives are conventional weapons or devices
   that are capable of a high order of destruction or disruption. Passive defense measures
   include hardening of facilities and establishing stand-off distances for personnel and key
   assets.
94                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


9.3. CBRNE Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRNE attack. Passive defense
measures include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRNE threat
through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
     9.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
     defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion,
     survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
     equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
        9.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRNE
        attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
        at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
        controlling OPORD.
        9.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
        reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
        aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
        the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just landed
        or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down engines
        and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches/ramps,
        don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the
        base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack is a missile attack,
        remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow
        host-base guidance.
        9.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
        contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
        and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
        contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
        the senior transportation commander.
     9.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
     protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRNE
     environment. Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection,
     and hardening of facilities.
        9.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
        aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
        includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
        shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
        (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
        canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
        gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
        They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
        The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
        Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
        Control Area (ACCA). Note: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                         95


        9.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue and Medical Pretreatment. Aircrews will be issued sized
        ACDE and GCE at home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are
        available at all times while in a CBRNE threat area. During deployments, the unit
        commander or applicable C2 agency will issue at least one ACDE and one GCDE to
        each aircrew member as directed. AFE technicians will prepare and issue mobility
        ACDE "D" bags for aircrew members. Mobility processing personnel will issue
        GCDE "C" bags. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and
        correct sizes. The local ACC C2 (or applicable C2 agency) will direct aircrews to
        undergo medical pretreatment for chemical exposure.
        9.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
        is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
        aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
        is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
        ground duties from air duties.
        9.3.2.1.3. Equipment Limitations.
           9.3.2.1.3.1. Body Temperature and Fluids Control. Heat stress and dehydration
           are serious hazards while wearing the ACDE. Aircrew members need to control
           perspiration rates and limit activities to essential duties only. The need to
           consciously slow the work pace while performing physical labor, share workloads
           and monitor each other‘s physiological condition is essential.
           9.3.2.1.3.2. Breathing Restrictions. One of the inherent design characteristics of
           the filter assembly is moderate breathing resistance. Normally, this is not
           noticeable except during high flow rates. For example during physical exertion,
           users should be aware of the possibility of hyperventilation. During flying
           operations using the EMERGENCY position on the oxygen regulator can reduce
           resistance. The valsalva maneuver cannot be performed while wearing the MBU-
           13/P mask. Alternate means such as yawning or chewing can be used. If these are
           unsuccessful, attempt to clear ears by holding the oxygen regulator in the TEST
           MASK position and forcefully exhale or yell against the regulator pressure. The
           new AERP mask and hood assembly, which incorporates a blower system,
           presents less-than-moderate breathing resistance. However, in the event of a
           blower system failure, aircrews will experience an increase in breathing
           resistance.
           9.3.2.1.3.3. Limited Dexterity. Wearing three pairs of gloves restrict dexterity;
           therefore, visual confirmation of switch selection and positioning become very
           important.
           9.3.2.1.3.4. Restricted Communications. Normal communications are limited
           while wearing the chemical defense mask. Using the mini-amplifier and speaker
           with the ACDE can enhance communications. Some of the newer ground masks
           may be issued with a built-in amplifier. Otherwise, visual signals, the aircraft‘s
           public address system, and the aircraft‘s interphone system can be used to
           compensate.
           9.3.2.1.3.5. Peripheral Visions Limits. The aircrew chemical defense mask may
96                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


               reduce peripheral vision as much as 15 percent.
               9.3.2.1.3.6. Emergency Procedures. Wearing any of the chemical defense masks
               and filter assemblies impose several limitations:
                   9.3.2.1.3.6.1. The aircrew member will not be able to detect fumes from fuel,
                   hydraulic fluid and oil.
                   9.3.2.1.3.6.2. Filter assembly will not protect the user against ammonia fumes
                   and carbon monoxide gas.
                   9.3.2.1.3.6.3. Filter assembly will not be used without an oxygen source in an
                   oxygen deficient atmosphere.
        9.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
        contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
        such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to
        employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. Crewmembers should avail
        themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
        9.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to strengthen
        buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To reduce the
        potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection, seal windows and
        doors, turn off HVAC systems and use rooms above the first floor whenever possible.
        9.3.2.4. Limitations. Aircrews need to be mentally prepared to face the dangers of
        chemical weapons. Plans should be developed to limit aircrew exposure during enemy
        attacks and liquid agent contamination while engaged in non-flying activities. Flight
        planning must be thorough and ACs should emphasized chemical defensive operations
        during mission planning, hazards and countermeasures, plans for pre-mission operations
        in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the event of a contaminated
        aircraft. Alternate scenario plans should also be considered in the event conditions
        change.
     9.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
     measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
     disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
     Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
     performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
        9.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
        practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
        measures.
        9.3.3.2. Decontamination.
            9.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination.        Air washing is a useful in-flight
            decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
            surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
            characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
            screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 hours are recommended, and lower
            altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
            (gear and flaps extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and around
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 97


          as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep into the
          aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is recommended.
          Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior contamination.
          9.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
          equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
          assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
          government control.
       9.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
       Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
       method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
       limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
       environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
       the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
       flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
       exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
       or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
       through HQ AMC/A35.
9.4. Flight Operations.
   9.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of
   CBRNE weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRNE hazards and countermeasures, in-flight
   diversion, plans for on-load/off-load in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) conditions change.
   9.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue dosimetry for potential radiological
   hazards.
   9.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   9.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   9.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFPAM 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
98                                                     AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     AMCVA 11-303 AERP Donning Checklist Use Buddy System, AMCVA 11-304, ACDE
     Donning Checklist Use Buddy System, and the C-130 T.O., to ensure proper wear. When
     wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper
     left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2
     PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This
     standardized location will enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual be
     overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid
     chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior
     to entering the CBRNE threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared.
     When inbound to a CBRNE threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure
     crew and passengers don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP
     level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRNE threat area. As a minimum, this briefing
     will include:     flight deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system
     requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations and MOPP levels. Aircrew members
     must determine if the wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict
     dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the
     equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead
     of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
     9.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support.          Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
     information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
     used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
     Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
     whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
9.5. Ground Operations.
     9.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
     contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
     flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
     entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
     flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
     assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
     covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
     prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
     will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
     over cape and over boots prior to entering the aircraft.
     9.5.2. On-load and Off-load Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
     contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
     flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
     covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
     bags and properly marked IAW T.O. requirements. Aircrew members entering the aircraft
     will remove plastic over boots and over cape portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure
     flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
     entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
     Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic over boots and over
     cape prior to leaving the aircraft.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             99


   9.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   9.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a
   contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. On-load cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective covers will be removed or replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   9.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. Note: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
   9.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   9.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
   stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-
   flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and
   may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A more extensive
   discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602 Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
   Convential (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

Table 9.1. Work Degradation Matrix.
WORK RATE                        TEMPERATURE
                                 20-49F          50-84F        85-100F
Light                             1.2            1.4           1.5
Moderate                          1.3            1.4           3.0
Heavy                             1.7            2.1           5.0

   9.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
100                                                   AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/ GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   9.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment. Before clearance of a Red X for
   contamination, Bioenvironmental Engineer or higher DOD authority will be consulted.
   9.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
        9.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
        whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
        seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
        chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
        9.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves (i.e.
        leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated equipment.
        Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be
        present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent
        residue is avoided.
        9.5.10.3. Table 9. 2 shows "estimated" times associated with initial and follow-on
        phases of the 10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to
        use the worst case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for
        the initial phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

9.6. Factors Influencing the Chemical Warfare (CW) Agent Hazard:
   9.6.1. General. A crew may be exposed to chemicals through inhalation, absorption through
   the skin, eyes or ingestion. Contaminated drink and food are considered harmful, but
   immediate concerns must be contamination avoidance to the maximum extent, limit exposure
   of the skin and eyes, as well as avoid breathing the contaminates. Factors affecting
   persistence are weather, agent physical characteristics, method of dissemination, droplet size
   and terrain.
   9.6.2. Weather. Factors include temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation and atmospheric
   stability. For example, high winds and heavy rains reduce the contamination hazard.
   Conversely, lack of wind, overcast skies and moderate temperatures favor persistence.
   9.6.3. Agent Dissemination. Disseminated as vapors, aerosols or liquids. Solids seem
   unlikely, but agents may become solids at lower temperature.
   9.6.4. Agent Droplet Size. Persistence factor is determined by droplet size. Agents may be
   mixed with other chemicals (thickeners), and form large drops making removal more
   difficult.
   9.6.5. Surface and Terrain. CW agent clouds tend to follow the terrain, flowing over
   countryside and down valleys. Chemicals persist in hollows, depressions, and other low
   areas. Rough terrain retards cloud movement. Flat countryside allows a uniform, unbroken
   cloud movement. Vegetated areas are more contaminated than barren terrain. Liquid agents
   soak into porous surfaces, making evaporation much slower than for non-porous surfaces.
9.7. Categories of CW Agents. CW agents having military significance may be categorized as
nerve, blister, choking, and blood. Because they are produced biologically, toxins are technically
not chemical agents. However, they are considered a potential CW threat.
   9.7.1. Nerve Agents:
       9.7.1.1. Military Significance. Nerve agents are the most lethal and fastest acting of the
       standard CW agents. These agents affect the nervous system and are highly toxic
       whether inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Persistency ranges from hours
       to many days.
       9.7.1.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Nerve agent exposure is difficult to distinguish.
       Symptoms include runny nose, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, excessive
       sweating, drooling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and convulsions. Nerve agents can also
       cause muscular twitching, dimness of vision and pinpointing of the pupils.
       9.7.1.3. Onset of Symptoms. Inhalation produces symptoms within 1-2 minutes. The
       victim may be incapacitated within 5-10 minutes. Death may occur after several hours or
       days. Ingestion may cause the same symptoms, however, incapacitation may take longer.
       The body retains nerve agents for an extended period; thus intermittent, cumulative
       exposure to low amounts can lead to the same ultimate effect as a single exposure to a
       higher amount.
       9.7.1.4. Protection. The full protective ACDE is effective against nerve agents. When
       properly worn, the various chemical protective masks prevent inhalation of nerve agents
       and all layers of the outer garment must be protected against saturation of liquids,
       chemical agents, water or petroleum.
102                                                AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


      9.7.1.5. Antidotes and Prophylaxis. Antidotes are effective in combating effects of nerve
      agent exposure. These antidotes may be effective if given to a victim having advanced
      symptoms, and as long as the victim is made to continue breathing. People who use the
      antidotes must be seen by medical personnel and may not be combat-ready for several
      days.
   9.7.2. Blister Agents:
      9.7.2.1. Military Significance. Blister agents are dispensed as vapors or liquids and may
      be encountered as solids. These agents primarily affect the eyes, respiratory tract, and the
      skin.
      9.7.2.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Placed on the skin, a drop the size of a pin head can
      produce a blister one inch in diameter. This action is accentuated by moisture; hence, a
      more severe danger is present during periods of sweating. The groin and armpits, which
      tend to be sweaty, are especially susceptible to blister agents. Blister agents that come in
      contact with the eyes lead to redness, watering of the eyes, blurring of vision, sensitivity
      to light, and frequently blindness. Inhalation causes serious damage due to burns and
      blisters to the mouth, nose, throat and lungs. Incapacitation may last for days or weeks;
      aircrews will probably be unable to fly for indefinite periods. After hospitalization,
      complications from blister agent exposure can arise and may be fatal.
      9.7.2.3. Onset of Symptoms. Blister agents are quickly absorbed through the skin.
      However, it usually takes several minutes (up to 5 minutes and as long as several hours)
      for the symptoms to appear. They act most rapidly in liquid form, but are also effective
      in vapor form.
      9.7.2.4. Protection. The full ACDE is effective against blister agents. Exposed areas
      must be cleaned thoroughly immediately after exposure. Blister agents are easily
      transferred from contaminated surfaces; thus, great care must be taken to avoid contact
      with any contamination.
   9.7.3. Choking Agents:
      9.7.3.1. Military Significance. These agents are disseminated as vapors and when
      inhaled affect the respiratory system by damaging the lungs. Persistence is very brief,
      and they dissipate rapidly (within minutes) under most field conditions.
      9.7.3.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Choking agents cause coughing, choking, tightness of
      the chest, nausea, headache and watering of the eyes. Choking agents can be lethal, with
      death normally from the lungs filling with fluids, making breathing difficult or
      impossible.
      9.7.3.3. Onset of Symptoms. Exposure to choking agents has an immediate effect.
      Victims experience slightly delayed effects, such as painful cough, breathing discomfort,
      and fatigue.
      9.7.3.4. Protection. Both the aircrew and ground crew protective mask is extremely
      essential to protect against exposure; the entire protective ACDE should be used as
      directed.
   9.7.4. Blood Agents:
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                       103


     9.7.4.1. Military Significance. Blood agents are usually dispensed as vapor or aerosol
     and inhaled. Under most field conditions they may briefly persist on target (up to 10
     minutes).
     9.7.4.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Exposure to a single breath of blood agent causes
     giddiness, headaches, confusion and nausea. As dose increases, breathing becomes more
     difficult. The victim will have deep, uncontrollable breathing and cramps, then loss of
     consciousness. Death is certain if the victim receives no medical aid.
     9.7.4.3. Protection. Blood agents are breathing hazards. The full ACDE is most
     effective because the mask provides the breathing protection needed.
     9.7.4.4. Additional Threats. Blood agents will damage mask filters. All personnel must
     change mask filters at the earliest possible opportunity after a blood agent attack.
     EXCEPTION: Filters installed in aircrew CWU-80/P filter packs will be removed and
     replaced by AFE personnel.

                                 NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES

10.1. General.
   10.1.1. This chapter contains EC-130H navigation procedures and forms. Publish local
   procedures, in the unit supplement to this AFI.
   10.1.2. General instructions for completion of AF Form 4116, are provided in this chapter.
   MAJCOM-approved computer flight plans may be used as a substitute for AF Form 4116.
       10.1.2.1. The AF Form 4116 was developed to provide a tool for all possible missions of
       the C-130. Most missions will not require all sections of the Form. In the interest of
       conservation, navigators are encouraged to print and use only those sections of the AF
       Form 4116 required for their respective mission.
10.2. Mission Planning Procedures.
   10.2.1. The AC and navigator will jointly verify routing, altitude and fuel load prior to
   departure. Use the chart updating manual or host nation chart updating product to update
   charts within 10-NM of the approach, departure, emergency and divert bases for airfields
   without a DOD or Jeppesen approved approach plate. FalconView generated charts with
   updated ECHUM overlays fulfill this requirement. A copy of the navigator's flight plan will
   be provided to the copilot to verify routing and aid in position reporting.
   10.2.2. When practical, plan the most direct routing possible or utilize wind optimized CFP
   routing to enhance fuel conservation.
   10.2.3. A MAJCOM-approved CFP, AF Form 70, or AF Form 4116 is required for all
   flights.
   10.2.4. A fuel plan is required for all flights.
   10.2.5. The navigator will sign in the indicated block on page 2 of the AF Form 4116 to
   certify accuracy of all entries. Any entries not required for a particular mission on the AF
   Form 4116 may be left blank.
10.3. Flight Planning.
   10.3.1. Most entries on the AF Form 4116 are self-explanatory or explained below.
       10.3.1.1. A/B - Ahead or Behind. Compare ETA based on the original flight plan to
       actual time of arrival (ATA) at each waypoint. Record the difference in this column. If
       the flight plan changes in-flight, non-applicable ATA spaces may be left blank.
   10.3.2. When an alternate destination is required, use a flight planning line to indicate, at a
   minimum, the name of the alternate and the time, course, and distance to the alternate.
   10.3.3. Aircrews may use PFPS or any other MAJCOM approved flight planning program.
   10.3.4. Fuel Planning. Accomplish fuel planning IAW T.O. 1C-130H-1-1 and Chapter 14 of
   this volume. CFP enroute fuel may be used for fuel analysis in lieu of enroute fuel derived
   from T.O. 1C-130H-1-1. AF Form 4116 fuel analysis blocks may be reproduced on the
   computer flight plan printed format.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             105


10.4. Equal Time Point Computations.
   10.4.1. Use the worksheet on the AF Form 4116, page 2, to calculate the time to ETP.
   10.4.2. Recompute ETP in-flight when the actual time of arrival at a reporting point is 15
   minutes or more ahead or behind the planned time if the change was caused by erroneous
   wind information.
   10.4.3. ETP Computations (see Figure 10.1). Computations are required on Category I
   routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield
   (LSAF) and the first suitable airfield (FSAF) is 5-hours or more.
10.5. Flight Charts.
   10.5.1. Show the following items on the chart:
       10.5.1.1. Navigator‘s name and coordinated universal date. Chart number and edition
       will be annotated on a stripped chart.
       10.5.1.2. Flight plan course line and waypoints (if not pre-labeled) will be annotated with
       waypoint number, identifier, radial and DME, or latitude and longitude.
       10.5.1.3. Annotate suitable emergency airfields. Optimum emergency airfields are
       located within 50 NM of the intended route. Refer to the GDSS/GDSS2 (when available)
       /ASRR for suitability.
       10.5.1.4. Portions of Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ)/FIR boundaries (if not
       depicted accurately) pertinent to the route will be annotated.
       10.5.1.5. Annotate the approximate location of the ETP.
   10.5.2. Plot each fix or position along with the time at that position. Use standard symbols
   from AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation.
   10.5.3. In the interest of conservation, flight charts for high level missions may be reused
   whenever such reuse would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.
   10.5.4. FalconView produced Lambert-Conformal charts may be used.
10.6. In-flight Procedures.
   10.6.1. The navigator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed to do
   otherwise. The navigator will record ATC clearances and monitor the read back. This will
   normally include all ATC instructions involving departure, enroute, and approach
   procedures. This procedure is not applicable when ATC instructions require immediate
   execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes with the timely performance of other
   time-sensitive navigator duties.
   10.6.2. On approach or departure, the navigator will monitor the aircraft position using an
   appropriately scaled chart (ONC, TPC, JOG, etc). In IMC or at night the navigator will use
   all available navigational aids (including aircraft radar) to keep the aircraft clear of all
   obstructions.
   10.6.3. The navigator will flight follow on all missions using a suitable plotting chart (JNC,
   JNCA, or GNC).

   10.6.4. Compute a TAS check on all Category I routes of 3 hours or longer. Use the
   procedures in paragraph 10.11
   10.6.5. Maintain a flight log on Category I routes or route segments of 3 hours or longer.
   Time between fix plots will not exceed 1 hour. Note: Malfunctions or loss of navigational
   capability, which degrade course centerline accuracy, will be reported immediately to ATC.
   10.6.6. On Category I routes, when the time between the LSAF and FSAF is 5 hours or
   more, the following procedures are required: wind factors, equal time point (ETP)
   calculations, and in-flight fuel management.
   10.6.7. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II routes. On Category I
   routes or route segments of 3 hours or longer, compute heading deviation for each compass
   system within one hour of reaching initial cruise altitude. Record deviation for all compass
   systems (see paragraph 10.10).
10.7. Laptop/Integrated Computers. Computers running Falcon View moving map software
and connected to a GPS provide invaluable situational awareness. Laptop computers and
handheld GPS must be approved for unrestricted use in flight IAW AFI 11-202 V3.
   10.7.1. Navigators should use a USAF approved computer on all combat and combat support
   missions.
       10.7.1.1. When computers are used, GPS units should be connected and the Falcon View
       Moving Map Display should be operating.
   10.7.2. Computers with GPS Falcon View moving map displays will not be used as the
   primary source of navigation.
10.8. Flight Records. Flight progress will be recorded for Category I routes of 3-hours or
longer. Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission. Units may publish local standards for
log procedures in the unit supplement. See Figure 10.2 for an example of a completed AF Form
4116.
   10.8.1. This form will consist of planning and in-flight progress data. It will be completed in
   sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. Page 1 of the form should be
   completed when a CFP is not available on Category I routes. Page 4, the in-flight section,
   will be used to record present positions and spot readings.
       10.8.1.1. As soon as practical after level-off or coast-out, whichever occurs latest,
       navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          10.8.1.1.1. Record the fix in AF Form 4116 Section VII.
          10.8.1.1.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution in AF Form
          4116 Section V.
          10.8.1.1.3. At the time of the fix record, as a minimum, GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot wind, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF Form 4116
          Section VIII.
       10.8.1.2. After coast out, record current position every 30 minutes on AF Form 4116,
       Page 3 in Section V, Fix/Computer Position.
          10.8.1.2.1. Record the present position for the navigation solution.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                107


      10.8.1.3. Plot the current position every hour or within 10 minutes of crossing an oceanic
      reporting point, whichever occurs first.
          10.8.1.3.1. Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true
          heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude, and ETA to the next point.
      10.8.1.4. Between recorded positions, record spot readings at regular intervals to allow
      for calculating a DR in the event of a navigation system failure.
          10.8.1.4.1. Spot readings will include, as a minimum, time, heading, drift angle,
          ground speed, wind vector, and true airspeed.
      10.8.1.5. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position by
      either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          10.8.1.5.1. Record the fix in AF Form 4116 Section VII.
          10.8.1.5.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution for all other
          navigation solutions in AF Form 4116 Section V.
          10.8.1.5.3. At the time of the fix record, as a minimum, GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot wind, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF Form 4116
          Section VIII.
   10.8.2. In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures will be
   implemented. Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a DR up to the present
   position. Plot a fix at a minimum of once per hour. A DR associated with the fix will be
   plotted on the chart prior to plotting the position. If the navigation system failure is resolved,
   the navigator may resume log procedures as outlined in paragraph 10.8.1
      10.8.2.1. At the time of the fix record the GMT, current position, true heading, spot w/v,
      true air speed, altitude and ETA to the next point.
      10.8.2.2. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position by
      either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
10.9. Deviation Check Procedures.
   10.9.1. Accomplish within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Heading checks should be
   computed in Section IV of AF Form 4116, page 3. Record and compare the CANS true
   heading with all compass systems. The AF Form 4116 deviation checks format solves for
   "deviation" (DEV) for all heading reference systems. Note: Compass deviation is not
   necessarily constant over time or after significant course changes. Navigators should
   reconfirm deviation on CAT I legs every 3 hours or after planned course changes of greater
   than 30 degrees. EXCEPTION: A deviation check is not required on flights transiting
   Category I routes of less than three hours if:
      10.9.1.1. The aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the
      standby compass is not considered a system for this requirement).
      10.9.1.2. The difference between systems does not exceed 2-degrees.
10.10. True Airspeed (TAS) Check Procedures.
108                                                AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


   10.10.1. Accomplish within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Record time of the check and
   altitude from the pressure altimeter. If using free air temperature gauge, record indicated
   outside air temperature (IOAT). Use the heat of compression table on AF Form 4116 to
   convert IOAT to true outside air temperature (TOAT). If using CANS temperature, record
   TOAT.
   10.10.2. Normally, navigators on EC-130H models can use +1 knots for indicated airspeed
   (IAS) to calibrated airspeed (CAS) correction and -2 knots for CAS to equivalent airspeed
   (EAS ) correction for TAS below 270.
   10.10.3. ITAS - Indicated TAS. Record the TAS reading from the TAS meter and the
   CANS. Record the difference between computed TAS and this reading in the CORR block.
10.11. In-flight Fuel Management Procedures.
   10.11.1. Fuel computations are required for Category I route segments of 3 hours or longer,
   all oceanic crossings, and upon reaching initial cruise altitude. Record the fuel readings
   listed below within one hour of level off time and at regular time intervals, not to exceed 1
   hour and 30 minutes. Use the worksheet on page 3 of the AF Form 4116 to complete in-flight
   fuel management computations. For flights not requiring fuel computations, annotate fuel
   status on the flight plan or CFP used for flight following.
      10.11.1.1. ETA DEST. Best known arrival time at destination.
      10.11.1.2. TIME. Time of the fuel reading.
      10.11.1.3. TERMINAL FUEL FLOW.
      10.11.1.4. CURRENT FUEL FLOW.
      10.11.1.5. AVG FUEL FLOW. Calculate by adding terminal fuel flow to current fuel
      flow and dividing the sum by 2.
      10.11.1.6. FUEL REM. Fuel quantity at time of calculation. In the interest of safety, use
      the lower of the calculated or gauge fuels.
      10.11.1.7. O/H FUEL. Required overhead fuel (item 13 of the fuel plan).
      10.11.1.8. DIFF. Subtract O/H Fuel from FUEL REM.
      10.11.1.9. FUEL ETE. Calculate using formula in 11.12.2.3
      10.11.1.10. ETE DEST. Subtract TIME from ETA DEST.
      10.11.1.11. EXT TIME. Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Report this value to the
      pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If they are
      correct, evaluate your destination options.
   10.11.2. Use the following formulas to accomplish in-flight fuel management:
      10.11.2.1. [(Terminal fuel flow + Present fuel flow)] / 2 = Average Fuel Flow
      10.11.2.2. Present fuel - Overhead fuel = Usable Fuel
      10.11.2.3. Usable fuel / Average fuel burn rate = Fuel ETE
      10.11.2.4. Fuel ETE - ETE to destination = Extra Time

                  FLIGHT ENGINEER (E) PROCEDURES AND FORMS

Section 11A—Normal Procedures

11.1. General. In addition to duties in the flight manual and other applicable technical orders,
Flight Engineers will comply with the procedures and duties in this AFI. With the exception of
hostile environment repair, these items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal
procedures. The AC may assign other duties to the flight engineer as necessary.
11.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the AC for all inspections and
procedures required by all applicable technical orders and DoD and Air Force instructions.
11.3. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols. Flight engineers are normally not authorized to
clear a Red X. When the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to clear it, the flight engineer may obtain authorization to clear the Red X in
accordance with TO 00-20-1. At enroute stations, flight engineers are authorized to clear Red X
symbols for: intake and exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels
removed and installed to facilitate other maintenance. Other aircrew members are not authorized
to clear a Red X.
11.4. Aircraft Servicing. Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel or de-fuel
aircraft, however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
maintenance personnel are not available. This policy is designed for support of the aircraft and
its mission while away from home station. The applicable refueling and defueling checklists will
be used during all refueling and defueling operations. If no crew chief is available, the flight
engineer will perform the Refueling Supervisor duties and operate the Single Point Refueling
(SPR) panel. The AC may designate other aircrew members as safety observers/fire guards as
required. Follow procedures in TO 1EC-130H-1 for primary fuel management procedures.
   11.4.1. In order to comply with the intent of primary and spear pod fuel management and to
   provide the greatest flexibility for maintenance and operations, standard ramp fuel loads in
   excess of 28,000 pounds should be loaded as follows:
       11.4.1.1. Without SPEAR pods installed:
           11.4.1.1.1. Outboard main tanks.       8,000 pounds each is the minimum to be
           considered full.
           11.4.1.1.2. Inboard main tanks. 7,200 pounds in each tank is the minimum to be
           considered full.
       11.4.1.2. With SPEAR pods installed:
           11.4.1.2.1. Outboard main tanks.       6,600 pounds each is the minimum to be
           considered full.
           11.4.1.2.2. Inboard main tanks. 7,200 pounds in each tank is the minimum to be
           considered full.
116                                               AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


      11.4.1.3. Any additional fuel required will be put in the auxiliary tanks and then the
      external tanks (if installed).
   11.4.2. Operational commitments, availability of fuel services or planned landing criteria
   will in some cases dictate that these procedures be adjusted. However, every effort should be
   made to comply with these guidelines and the flight manual to maximize airframe life.
11.5. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). Complete an UDI Worksheet IAW TO
1C- 130-101 Implementation of C-130 series Aircraft Usage Report on all flights.
11.6. Aircraft Systems/Forms Management:
   11.6.1. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all flight and ground
   operations. Notify the pilot of all abnormal indications and take action as required.
   11.6.2. In addition to the procedures in TO 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the flight engineer will
   assist the pilot in maintaining the AFTO Form 781.
11.7. TOLD Cards:
   11.7.1. All performance calculations will normally be based on 95 percent engines and with
   nosewheel steering (unless otherwise specified in this volume or the performance manual).
   Initial TOLD cards will be computed using flight manual performance data. Subsquent
   TOLD card computations will be accomplished using flight manual performance data or
   approved tabulated data. All tabulated TOLD data will be approved by the respective
   NAF/OV prior to use. NAF/OV will maintain a copy of all approved tabulated data.
   11.7.2. The engineer will post the torque value corresponding to the required takeoff power
   setting, in addition to both the 3-engine and 4-engine climb performance on the TOLD card.
   11.7.3. Mini TOLD card blocks 1 thru 5 will contain: outside ambient temperature, pressure
   altitude, 3-engine service ceiling, 2-engine service ceiling, and Critical Field Length.
   11.7.4. Following initial takeoff and landing data computation, only affected speeds need be
   re-computed if favorable conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas.
   On local proficiency flights, only the Mini C-130 TOLD Card must be updated.
   11.7.5. When stop-and-go operations are planned, the flight engineer will compute two stop-
   and-go distances, one based on 970 degrees TIT and one based on maximum power. When
   conducting flaps up landing data for training, compute and post VMCA speeds for both
   configurations; flaps 50% and flaps up (normal boost). Example, VMCA, in ground effect,
   one engine inoperative – 110/136.
   11.7.6. Compute cruise data and post a mini C-130 TOLD Card for cruise segments of 1
   hour or more duration and update hourly. Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required
   climb and cruise power. Blocks 1 thru 3 will contain: Maximum Endurance 20% flaps (as
   charted); Stall Speed (Vs1), 0% flaps, 45 degrees bank ;Stall Speed (Vs1), 0% flaps, 60
   degrees bank; and Remarks: Outside Ambient Temperature (OAT) and temperature
   deviation. Note: ACC directs that Dash 1 stall speeds will be used in lieu of the conflicting
   performance manual stall speeds.
   11.7.7. The minimum TOLD airspeeds required for a termination landing are: air minimum
   control speeds, obstacle clearance speed, and 50% and 100 % landing speeds.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            117

specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition. Consideration must also be
given to aircraft limitations and emergency jettisoning. Math, charts contained in TO 1EC-
130H-5-2, and aircraft load adjuster (slipstick) are tools which may be used for planning. When
the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of MAC zero fuel.
11.10. General Instructions. These instructions apply to Forms F using simplified moments.
Entries on the form (Figure 11.1 ) may be either typed, handwritten, or computer entered.
   11.10.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number,

   Fuel weight X .552 = Fuel moment. If this method is used only total fuel needs to be entered
   (not individual tanks). When flight plan fuel weights are not available, use the following
   criteria to compute fuel burn off: Note: PPH = pounds per hour.

Section 11C—Hostile Environment Repair Procedures

11.13. General. Authority to use the Hostile Environment Kit and Repair Procedures is granted
by Operations Group Commanders/Deputy Commanders for Operations when the aircraft is
directed into a hostile or potentially hostile environment or in extreme cases where recovery of
the aircraft or completion of the mission dictate their use. This authority is documented on the
FRAG or Air Tasking Order. The operations group commander/deputy commander for
operations may delegate this authority as necessary in cases where: (1) The unit is geographically
separated from the parent unit, or (2) the unit is deployed or otherwise not co-located with the
operations group commander/deputy commander for operations. All normal avenues of
repair/recovery should be exhausted (when practical) prior to use of the Hostile Environment
Repair Procedures. Procedures identified with an asterisk (*) are not considered Hostile
Environment Repair and may be accomplished with the AC‘s concurrence. When Hostile
Environment Repair Procedures are actually employed, inform Numbered Air Force Stan/Eval
by letter. Include a brief description of the circumstances and conditions leading to the decision
to approve Hostile Environment Procedures.
   11.13.1. Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK). Safe and efficient accomplishment of the
   hostile environment repair procedures is facilitated by the use of a repair kit. Table 11.2

      11.17.3.1. Remove all power from the aircraft.
      11.17.3.2. Disconnect the aircraft battery.
      11.17.3.3. Install a #4 jumper wire between the BATT and GEN terminals (see Figure
      11.3).
      11.17.3.4. Connect the aircraft battery. WARNING: The potential for electrical shock,
      and electrical arcing exists when performing this procedure. This procedure should only
      be performed in-flight as an absolute last resort effort to restore Essential DC bus power.
      WARNING: The Essential DC bus cannot be isolated using bus isolation procedures
      contained in the flight manual. Note: When the #4 jumper wire is used on the RCR, the
      Iso DC on Batt/Batt Disc light will remain ON, even though the Essential DC bus is
      powering the Isolated Bus.

11.18. *GTC Stalls and Fails to Accelerate to "On Speed: "
   11.18.1. Hold fingers over the acceleration limiter holes (see Figure 11.4) while an assistant
   starts the GTC. Place and remove fingers over the holes several times during the start cycle
   until the start cycle sustains itself.
11.19. GTC Fails to Rotate (No Start Light):
   11.19.1. Check the following prior to proceeding with the hostile environment repair
   procedure: GTC control circuit breaker, GTC fire handle, Isolated DC bus powered, and
   check GTC doors to ensure they are fully open.
   11.19.2. For a failed door actuator, (doors open and close but do not fully open) disconnect
   the GTC door actuator at attachment point on inside of upper door. Prop doors open (use
   broom handle, fuel dipstick, etc.). Disconnect door actuator cannon plug and install jumper
   wire from pin "D" to pin "E" and attempt restart.
      11.19.2.1. When finished with the GTC, attach door actuator to upper door, remove
      jumper wire, and install cannon plug back on actuator. Use door switch to close door.
   11.19.3. For failed door actuator (doors not open or not opened enough to allow
   disconnecting of actuator), remove four (4) screws in upper door. This will release the door
   actuator attaching bracket on which the door bypass switch is located. Prop doors open and
   attempt start. Note: Ensure bypass switch is fully extended.
      11.19.3.1. When finished with GTC, close and secure the doors using two of the four
      bypass switch mounting bracket screws.
   11.19.4. If the limit switch is suspected faulty, at upper forward area of the intake,
   disconnect the two wires to the door bypass switch and connect the two input leads together.
   This will bypass the limit switches.
      11.19.4.1. Start GTC.
11.20. GTC Fails to Rotate (Start Light On):
   11.20.1. Remove all electrical power.
   11.20.2. Open pilot‘s side circuit breaker panel.
   11.20.3. Check GTC starter current limiter; (see Figure 11.3) if bad or suspect; replace as
   follows:
      11.20.3.1. Disconnect battery.
      11.20.3.2. Remove and replace current limiter with spare.
      11.20.3.3. If no spares are available, open copilot‘s upper circuit breaker panel cover,
      remove cargo winch current limiter and use as a replacement.
   11.20.4. If current limiter is good, check GTC starter for broken wires and repair as
   necessary (see Figure 11.4).
   11.20.5. Connect battery and attempt to start. If no rotation, rap starter relay and attempt
   another start.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                127


   11.20.6. If GTC still will not rotate, place the GTC control switch to START momentarily to
   energize the relay, then release the switch to RUN. Place a #4 jumper wire between post A1
   and A2 of the GTC relay (see Figure 11.3) until the start light goes out, then remove the
   jumper wire.
11.21. *GTC Fuel Vapor Lock:
   11.21.1. Use petcock drain on bottom of aircraft below GTC to drain fuel while motoring
   GTC, then attempt start (see Figure 11.5).
   11.21.2. If no fuel is present at petcock drain, check GTC fuel shutoff valve opening by
   momentarily positioning GTC control switch to "START" then "OFF".
   11.21.3. If fuel shutoff valve fails to operate, remove cannon plug and open the valve
   manually.
   11.21.4. Remove fuel line at GTC burner can and motor GTC until a steady stream of fuel is
   noted. This procedure may require several attempts to attain desired results.
   11.21.5. Reconnect the line and attempt another start.
11.22. *GTC Rotates - Negative Ignition:
   11.22.1. Check oil quantity.
   11.22.2. Attempt a start while depressing and holding the oil primer button. Release the
   button when the GTC lights off.
11.23. Starting GTC with Failed Oil Pressure Switch:
   11.23.1. A failed oil pressure switch can be detected during the start cycle by observing no
   ignition firing noise during start attempt and that fuel is present at the fuel pressure regulator
   drain and no detectable fuel pressure present in the fuel nozzle hose. (See Figure 11.4)
   11.23.2. Remove oil line to the oil pressure switch and momentarily rotate GTC. (Oil should
   spurt from the line opening.)
   11.23.3. Remove oil pressure switch cannon plug and place jumper wires from pin "A" to
   pin "B" for ignition and from pin "C" to pin "D" for fuel. Secure the jumper wires with tape.
   11.23.4. Attempt to start the GTC. If the oil pressure switch was faulty the start should be
   successful.
11.24. Leaking Brakes:
   11.24.1. Disconnect brake lines from both sides of the brake shuttle valve.
   11.24.2. Use plugs and caps from the HERK kit to seal the brake lines and shuttle valve.
   11.24.3. Secure disconnected hose ends to prevent interference with landing gear movement
   during retraction and extension. Note: Both landing and takeoff performance calculations
   will be affected by a disconnected brake. Recommend using RCR of 5 for all performance
   calculations.
11.25. Moving an Aircraft with Flat Main Landing Gear Tire: WARNING: Use this
procedure only as a last resort to move an aircraft out of a hostile environment. Reduce aircraft
weight as much as possible by unloading cargo, defueling, or burning off fuel. Some fuel may
128                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


be transferred out of the wing corresponding to the flat tire and into the opposite wing. Be aware
of wing tip and propeller ground clearance.
   11.25.1. Install main gear towing/jacking fitting on the strut with the flat tire.
   11.25.2. Install a 10,000-pound chain around the top of the strut above the upper track shoes.
   11.25.3. Connect a tie down device to the towing fitting. Connect the chain to the device
   and tighten.
   11.25.4. Open the Schrader valve at the top end of the MLG strut and bleed all air pressure
   from the strut. WARNING: Do not open Schrader valve more than 3/4 of a turn. It may be
   necessary to use the valve stem to bleed the pressure from the strut. Do not allow the lower
   nut to loosen. If the lower nut becomes loose it may allow the Schrader valve to blow out of
   the strut body.
   11.25.5. Compress the strut by any means possible such as the use of a "J" bar, chocks, milk
   stool or taxiing the aircraft onto shoring in order to elevate the flat tire.
   11.25.6. When the strut has been compressed to the maximum extent possible, tighten the tie
   down device.
   11.25.7. Remove the flat tire if time and situation permits.
   11.25.8. Flight should be made with the landing gear extended and the landing gear control
   circuit breaker pulled. When safely airborne, pull the touchdown relay circuit breaker. Refer
   to the flight manual for airspeed limitations with landing gear extended. After landing, reset
   the touchdown relay circuit breaker.
11.26. Failed Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump:
   11.26.1. Disconnect the failed engine driven hydraulic pump from the gearbox and secure to
   any available structure with safety wire. Do not disconnect hydraulic lines.
   11.26.2. Install a starter pad in place of the failed hydraulic pump.
   11.26.3. If time and resources permit, the pump may be removed from the nacelle as
   follows:
       11.26.3.1. With the ESS DC bus powered, place the corresponding hydraulic pump
       switch to the OFF position. This will close the hydraulic shutoff valve.
       11.26.3.2. Disconnect and plug all hydraulic lines to the pump.
       11.26.3.3. Remove the failed pump and install a starter pad in its place. CAUTION:
       The hydraulic pump switch must remain in the OFF position as long as the hydraulic
       pump is removed.
11.27. Failed Fuel Valve(s):
   11.27.1. Locate the failed valve(s) and remove the cannon plug(s).
   11.27.2. Manually open or close the valve(s) by actuating the manual arm. Note: On some
   aircraft, the dump mast shutoff valves must be manually closed to refuel. Insure these valves
   are reopened prior to flight.
11.28. Failed Speed Sensitive Switch:
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            129

   used as jumpers must be wired as shown in Figure 11.8.
   11.28.5. Secure all engine cowling.
   11.28.6. Begin the start sequence (in normal ground idle) while watching tachometer.
   11.28.7. At 16% engine RPM, reset the Ignition Control Circuit Breaker.
   11.28.8. At 94% RPM, pull the Ignition Control Circuit Breaker. Note: The secondary fuel
   pump pressure light will be illuminated and the pumps will be in parallel operation until the
   Ignition Control Circuit Breaker is pulled.
   11.28.9. After landing, use normal ground idle only and shutdown the affected engine as
   follows:
   11.28.10. Ignition Control Circuit Breaker - RESET.
   11.28.11. Condition lever - GROUND STOP. Note: When the Ignition Control Circuit
   Breaker is reset prior to engine shutdown, approximately two seconds is required for the fuel
   control shutoff valve to close. If the engine continues to run when the condition lever is
   placed in GROUND STOP, place the condition lever to FEATHER.
   11.28.12. When the fuel flow indicator drops to zero and RPM is decreasing, pull the
   Ignition Control Circuit Breaker.
11.29. Failed Ignition Control Relay:
   11.29.1. Pull the Ignition Control circuit breaker.
   11.29.2. Open the lower left engine cowling and locate the ignition control relay (see Figure
   11.6).
   11.29.3. Disconnect the cannon plug from the relay and install the prewired cannon plug
   from the repair kit. CAUTION: Pre-wired cannon plugs used as jumpers must be wired as
   shown in Figure 11.8.
   11.29.4. Close and secure cowling.

130                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


      11.29.6.3. When fuel flow drops to zero and RPM decreases, pull the Ignition Control
      circuit breaker.
11.30. Failed Speed Sensitive Valve: CAUTION: This procedure will render the torquemeter
shroud anti-icing system inoperative. Icing conditions should be avoided.
   11.30.1. Open the lower left side engine cowling on the affected engine.
   11.30.2. Disconnect the air supply line to the speed sensitive valve (see Figure 11.6) at the
   bottom of the filter element installed in the line and install a #6 plug in the open line.
   11.30.3. Disconnect the torquemeter shroud anti-icing line at the left side of the balance line
   fitting and secure it.
   11.30.4. Disconnect the line from the top side of the speed sensitive valve and connect it to
   the balance line fitting where the torquemeter shroud anti-icing line was connected.
   11.30.5. Secure any loose hardware then close and secure engine cowling. Note: Do not
   start the affected engine first. Select another engine for the first engine to be started in order
   to supply bleed air to the affected engine.
   11.30.6. Place the Engine Inlet Duct Anti-icing switch for the affected engine to ON.
   11.30.7. Start the affected engine while watching RPM and standing by to activate the Prop
   and Engine Anti-icing Master switch.
   11.30.8. At 94% engine RPM, place the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master switch to
   MANUAL. The acceleration bleed valves should close at this time. WARNING: When the
   "Prop and Engine Anti-ice Master Switch" is selected to the MANUAL position, the engine
   anti-ice and prop anti-ice/de-ice systems will be actuated if their respective switches are
   turned on. These switches are normally turned on during the Before Takeoff Checklist but
   should be delayed using this procedure unless absolutely necessary for safe operation.
   Turning these switches to the on position with the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master Switch
   selected to MANUAL will activate the systems and rob the engines of torque. Overheating
   of the blade/spinner anti-ice/de-ice systems will occur if the aircraft remains on the ground
   for longer than the two cycle operating limit. Note: In this configuration the affected
   engine will have continuous anti-icing and an associated reduction in torque will be noted.
   11.30.9. After landing, shutdown the engine in normal ground idle. CAUTION: Do not use
   "Low Speed Ground Idle" during ground operations. To do so may cause the engine to
   stall/over temp.
11.31. Failed Fuel Shutoff Valve on Fuel Control:
   11.31.1. Open lower left side cowling on affected engine.
   11.31.2. Remove the defective fuel control shutoff actuator (Geneva lock) from the fuel
   control (see Figure 11.6).
   11.31.3. Insert a small common (flat) screwdriver into the spline end of the fuel control and
   rotate in a counterclockwise direction until the fuel control opens. There will be no fuel
   leakage from where the actuator was removed.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              131


   11.31.4. Close the engine cowling and secure all fasteners. Note: During engine start,
   abnormal situations such as excessive fuel coming from drain mast, tailpipe torching and a
   higher than normal start TIT can be expected.
   11.31.5. For engine shutdown, place the condition lever to FEATHER rather than GROUND
   STOP for the affected engine.
11.32. Failed Engine Fuel Drip Valve:
   11.32.1. Use enrichment on next engine start. The sudden surge of pressure should close the
   drip valve.
   11.32.2. If enrichment fails to close the drip valve, shutdown the engine and plug or crimp
   the drip valve drain valve closed.
11.33. Prop Fails To Rotate (No Light In Button). CAUTION: Insure the oil shutoff valve
circuit breaker is set (in).
   11.33.1. If it is determined or suspected that no power is available to the starter button,
   proceed as follows:
      11.33.1.1. Select another engine which is not operating and close its bleed air valve.
      (This bleed valve must remain closed throughout the start cycle.)
      11.33.1.2. Start the defective engine normally while simultaneously holding in the starter
      button for the selected non-operating engine. Both buttons must be held in until 60
      percent RPM.
11.34. Alternate Fuel Management with Inboard Main Tanks Empty (External Tanks
Containing Fuel):
   11.34.1. The external tanks may be filled to maximum capacity provided the outboard main
   tanks and both auxiliary tanks are full.
   11.34.2. Takeoff configuration will be engines 1 and 4 on tank to engine from their
   respective tanks. Engines 2 and 3 will be on cross-feed from the auxiliary tanks with the
   cross-feed separation valve open. WARNING: Do not place the auxiliary or external tank
   dump pump switches to the dump position while those tanks are supplying fuel to the
   engines.
   11.34.3. As soon as practical after takeoff, close the cross-feed separation valve and place all
   engines on cross-feed from the auxiliary tanks.
   11.34.4. When auxiliary tank fuel is reduced to 4,000 - 4,500 pounds per side, terminate
   cross-feed operation from the auxiliary tanks and place all engines on cross-feed from the
   external tanks. CAUTION: Do not reduce internal fuel (main and auxiliary) to less than
   25,000 pounds if external tank fuel exceeds 4,700 pounds per side.
   11.34.5. When the external tanks are empty, place engines 2 and 3 on cross-feed from the
   auxiliary tanks and place engines 1 and 4 on tank to engine from their respective outboard
   main tanks. Close the external tank cross-feed valves and place the external tank fuel boost
   pump switches to OFF.
   11.34.6. When the auxiliary tank fuel is 1,000 pounds per side, open the outboard cross-feed
   valves to place all engines on cross-feed.
132                                                 AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


   11.34.7. When the auxiliary tanks are empty, close the auxiliary tank cross-feed valves and
   place the auxiliary tank fuel boost pump switches to OFF.
   11.34.8. Observe flight manual touch down rate of sink and outboard tank fuel quantity
   landing limitations.
   11.34.9. Following completion of landing ground roll, leave the main tank cross-feed valves
   open and maintain at least two engines in normal ground idle until the airplane is parked.
11.35. Failed Bleed Air Valve (Engine Fails To Rotate):
   11.35.1. Place the bleed air valve switch to "OPEN." Open horse collar and "tap" the motor
   mechanism on the bleed air valve.
   11.35.2. If the valve still fails to open, remove the motor from the valve. Manually open the
   valve and secure the lever to one of the mount holes with safety wire. WARNING: Once
   bleed air valve has been secured in the open position, it will not be possible to close the valve
   for wing isolation procedure. Engine shut down will be required to isolate wing.
   11.35.3. Close the horse collar and attempt engine start.
11.36. Severe Fuel Leaks:
   11.36.1. Fuel leaks caused from punctures or small arms fire can be plugged by using the
   wooden plugs and Pig Putty from the kit. If a high number of plugs are used, it may be
   necessary (as time permits) to break or cut them off near the wing surface to reduce drag.

          AIRBORNE MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN (AMT) PROCEDURES

12.1. General. The AMT is responsible to the AC for management of the mission crew/cargo
compartment and Compass Call mission equipment. The AMT is responsible for aircrew
members stationed in the mission crew/cargo compartment, and any passengers. The AMT will:
   12.1.1. Perform and supervise scanner duties.
   12.1.2. Coordinate mission equipment requirements and any special procedures necessary to
   ensure optimum mission accomplishment.
   12.1.3. Initialize, maintain, and troubleshoot mission systems during flight as required.
   12.1.4. Document all write-ups in aircraft forms and thoroughly debrief appropriate ground
   personnel.
   12.1.5. Ensure MEPs and passengers have appropriate AFE equipment, are briefed on
   emergency procedures, and seated prior to stations time.
   12.1.6. At the AC‘s direction, complete anti-hijacking procedures for all passengers.
   12.1.7. Ensure the GTC is shutdown prior to en-planning or de-planning passengers unless
   proper hearing protection is used.
12.2. Weight and Balance. The flight engineer will calculate all weight and balance data.
12.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles: At least one unobstructed emergency exit is
available for each 20 passengers (This does not restrict over water flights if the overhead escape
hatches are available for egress). Seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as
an obstruction.
12.4. Passenger Handling:
   12.4.1. The AMT is the key figure for good passenger relations. There are certain rules that
   should be observed:
       12.4.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       12.4.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       criticism of other personnel or organizations.
   12.4.2. In-flight Procedures:
       12.4.2.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
       judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
       one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
       concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
       baggage.
       12.4.2.2. Make frequent checks on the cabin temperature.
       12.4.2.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will
       not be permitted access to checked baggage.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                           139


     12.4.2.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
     make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
     12.4.2.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the AC. Use good
     judgment when requesting this authority.
     12.4.2.6. When passengers are carried, an AMT will be in the cargo compartment for all
     takeoffs and landings.
     12.4.2.7. The AMT will insure sufficient fresh water is available for the crew and
     passengers. Establish crew drinking water requirements in the unit supplement to this
     volume.

                                      FUEL PLANNING

13.1. General. This chapter provides general fuel planning considerations and procedures.
Publish local procedures in the supplement to this volume.
13.2. Fuel Conservation:
   13.2.1. Conservation of fuel requires everyone‘s active participation. Do not carry extra fuel
   for convenience. Unidentified extra fuel should not exceed required ramp fuel load (RRFL)
   by more than 2,200 pounds.
   13.2.2. Extra fuel (identified extra) may be added to RRFL:
      13.2.2.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at enroute stops.
      13.2.2.2. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
      13.2.2.3. For anticipated off course weather avoidance.
   13.2.3. To maximize fuel, consider the following:
      13.2.3.1. Use optimized CFPs when possible.
      13.2.3.2. Long-range cruise (LRC) and/or optimum altitude should be flown (when
      possible).
      13.2.3.3. Limit the use of the GTC when possible.
      13.2.3.4. Delay engine start.
      13.2.3.5. Cruise CG should be aft if practical.
      13.2.3.6. Fly enroute descents when possible.
   13.2.4. Fuel Loads:
      13.2.4.1. Use appropriate flight planning software or TO 1C-130H-1-1 for fuel planning.
      Use 100 percent engine and constant altitude performance. Apply an appropriate drag
      index to software or TO 1C-130H-1-1 computations. Items for fuel analysis are
      explained in Table 13.1
13.3. Fuel Planning:
   13.3.1. Entering Arguments:
      13.3.1.1. Weight. Add OPERATING WT, CARGO/ PAX WT, and RAMP FUEL to
      obtain RAMP WT. Subtract TAXI fuel to obtain TAKEOFF WT.
      13.3.1.2. TEMP DEV - Temperature Deviation. Compare the forecast temperature at
      cruise altitude to the standard temperature for that altitude. The algebraic difference is
      TEMP DEV.
   13.3.2. Fuel Computations. Refer to Fuel Planning guidance in Table 13.1 and the local
   supplement for fuel computations.

                                         Chapter 14

                             AIR-TO-AIR REFUELING (AAR)

14.1. General. Air to air refueling (AAR) operations will be performed according to ATP-56B,
Air-To-Air Refueling and TO 1EC-130H-1. Mission planning should include consideration of
tanker range limitations, abort base availability, and enemy threats at refueling altitudes.
Mission requirements will dictate the type of fuel management used (primary or secondary). The
following procedures are in addition to the normal procedures in the refueling manuals and
applicable directives.
14.2. Crew Policy:
   14.2.1. Non-aircraft commander-certified pilots will only perform contacts with an IP in the
   seat from pre-contact to contact. If training an unqualified or noncurrent pilot, the IP will
   occupy a pilot seat before initiation of the AAR checklists.
   14.2.2. Instructor pilots and pilots in instructor upgrade (under direct IP supervision) may
   perform boom limit demonstrations.
14.3. Flight Planning. Planners should coordinate with tanker unit planners, AMC Tanker
Airlift Control Center (TACC), or Air Operations Center (AOC) tanker planners to the maximum
extent possible.
   14.3.1. Airspace. AAR may be conducted on established tracks published in FLIP, tracks
   published in an ATO, or random tracks coordinated between tanker and receiver.
       14.3.1.1. Using an established AAR track simplifies mission planning. Scheduling
       published tracks is normally the tanker crew‘s responsibility, but receivers will
       coordinate the use of the track/ anchor with the tanker, and ensure both receiver and
       tanker are coordinated for the proper rendezvous.
       14.3.1.2. When using tracks/anchors defined by an ATO, OPT/DPT planners will
       coordinate with tanker planners and thoroughly brief aircrews on all aspects of the
       refueling.
       14.3.1.3. Not using a previously identified track will usually require coordination of an
       Altitude Reservation (ALTRV). Plan and coordinate the ALTRV IAW FAA 7610.4J
       Special Military Operations Chapter 3 and FLIP requirements. Tanker planners and
       TACC can provide assistance with ALTRV coordination.
       14.3.1.4. In all cases, the route to and from the AAR track/anchor should allow divert to
       a suitable abort airfield that meets the requirements of Chapter 6 of this volume and AFI
       11-202 V3.
       14.3.1.5. Fuel planning may be completed using either an approved computer planning
       program or manually using procedures in Chapter 10. A standard fuel flow of 6,000
       PPH may be used from the ARIP to EAR.
   14.3.2. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA):
       14.3.2.1. Acceptance of MARSA normally is the tanker‘s responsibility. Normally
       MARSA begins prior to the receiver reaching the AAR/RVIP. When a rendezvous is
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                           143


      conducted in an area that does not use normal track or anchor procedures, MARSA
      begins when participating aircraft enter the refueling airspace.
      14.3.2.2. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established and ATC
      accepts control at the end of refueling.
14.4. Procedures/Restrictions:
   14.4.1. Performing AAR Maneuvers. AAR-qualified aircrews may perform normal
   maneuvers at any time, and are encouraged to do so to enhance continuation training
   opportunities. Toboggan, contact, and practice emergency separation maneuvers do not
   require instructor supervision, except as mentioned in para 14.2 However, when any member
   of either the tanker or receiver crew is in training, close coordination with the tanker is
   required to ensure compliance with training restrictions.
   14.4.2. In-flight Fuel Management. Track in-flight fuel management from departure to AAR
   abort base until EAR. When the EAR point is reached, track in-flight fuel management to
   either DEST or the next AAR abort base. Compute wind factors and ETPs IAW Chapter 10
   procedures.
   14.4.3. Inoperative Fuel Quantity Indicators. Refer to Table 4.4 for allowable combinations
   of inoperative fuel quantity indicators. After refueling any tank(s) with inoperative fuel
   quantity indicators, the flight engineer and navigator will closely monitor fuel burn rates.
   Immediately bring any discrepancies between actual and expected fuel burn to the AC‘s
   attention.
      14.4.3.1. If the inoperative indicator is on a main tank, the first indication of a
      discrepancy between actual and expected fuel quantity may be a need for excessive
      aileron trim. If this condition arises, pilots should assume they have less than expected
      fuel, and adjust the mission accordingly. Consider any fuel left in that tank(s) to be
      reserve fuel.
      14.4.3.2. During normal operations, all fuel quantity indicators will be operational for
      those tanks to be refueled. During contingency or emergency operations, tanks with
      inoperative quantity indicators may be refueled with a known quantity of fuel from tanks
      with operative indicators. Both primary and secondary shutoff mechanisms must be
      working properly for the tanks with the inoperative indicators. Transfer the fuel in 1,000
      lb increments and closely monitor fuel distribution and aircraft trim. Comply with flight
      manual fuel balance limits.
   14.4.4. Gross Weight Limitations. When mission requirements dictate air to air refueling to
   gross weights above 155,000 pounds, a MAJCOM waiver is required IAW the aircraft flight
   manual. Gross weights above 155,000 pounds are restricted to that amount needed to arrive
   at destination or next refueling point with required fuel reserves. Refer to aircraft Weight
   Limitations Chart for load factor limits and max recommended airspeeds. Consider refueling
   performance, and 3- and 4-engine cruise ceiling when operating at heavy gross weights.
   14.4.5. Manual Boom Latching. Manual boom latching procedures will be used only during
   fuel emergencies, actual contingency operations, or when refueling with a KC-10 with an
   operable IDS system (with tanker concurrence).
14.5. Communication:
144                                               AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


   14.5.1. The AC will ensure the receiver and the tanker are on the same frequency.
   Secondary refueling frequencies need not be monitored unless instructed by the tanker.
   Pilots will monitor only the primary AAR frequency, interphone, and flight crew hot mic.
   However, at least one flight deck crewmember will monitor UHF guard throughout the
   refueling.
   14.5.2. During all AARs, the AC will designate one aircrew member as primary monitor for
   the controlling agency radio frequency. This aircrew member will write down any clearance
   issued by ATC to the tanker for the receiver aircraft, and compare it to the end AAR
   clearance issued by the tanker. If there is a discrepancy, query the ATC controller prior to
   accepting post-AAR clearance.

15.2. Responsibilities.
   15.2.1. The AC and MCC jointly share responsibility for mission planning.
   15.2.2. Deployment Planning Team (DPT). When a deployment order is received, the 755
   OSS will stand up a DPT to support squadron deployments. The DPT will plan the
   movement of aircraft to the deployed location and subsequent employment until a Mission
   Planning Cell (MPC) is established. ACC Air Operations Squadron assistance may be
   utilized if applicable.
   15.2.3. Mission Planning Cell (MPC). The MPC conducts mission planning for Compass
   Call employment. Wartime MPC concepts provide an integrated team of aircrew,
   intelligence, and computer support personnel. The deployed commander activates the MPC
   and assigns a team chief. The deployed operations officer determines MPC augmentation
   requirements. The team chief will assign responsibilities to individual team members IAW
   operational needs.
   15.2.4. Intelligence Support. Intelligence briefings will be presented IAW AFI 14-105, Unit
   Intelligence Mission and Responsibilities, as supplemented, and intelligence Operating
   Instructions.
       15.2.4.1. Intelligence personnel will support DPT with an initial situation/threat briefing
       upon activation and any update briefings, as necessary. They shall also provide an
       intelligence pre-deployment briefing to aircrews.
       15.2.4.2. Intelligence personnel will support MPC with an initial situation/threat briefing,
       extract pertinent ATO information, analyze threats to mission aircraft, build/maintain
       target database and establish targeting priorities IAW mission directives. They will
       provide continuous, in-depth analysis of the situation and update MPC. Intelligence
       personnel will conduct the intelligence portions of mission brief and debrief.
       15.2.4.3. Intelligence personnel will serve as liaison between COMPASS CALL, the
       Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) community and mission package
       planners.
       15.2.4.4. Intelligence personnel will provide CCMCS support for scenario development,
       scenario briefing and scenario debriefing.

                                          Chapter 16

                   TACTICAL/THREAT AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES

16.1. General. Use these procedures and the flight manual when operating into airfields where
an identified or suspected ground threat exists. In a threat situation, aircrew members must
understand their limitations and those of their equipment. The procedures contained herein are
not all encompassing. Therefore, aircrews should use good judgment and sound airmanship to
successfully accomplish the mission.
   16.1.1. This chapter deals primarily with the takeoff/departure and approach/landing phase
   of flight. AFTTP 3-1.COMPASS CALL contains a more detailed discussion of threat
   avoidance in takeoff/departure, approach/landing, enroute operations and in the orbit area.
   16.1.2. Carefully consider performance data and energy management, particularly in
   mountainous terrain at heavy gross weights or with less than full engine capability. Failure
   to manage energy levels may cause a stall or require a go-around. Consideration should be
   given to planning increased airspeeds. Another accepted technique is to calculate, and have
   visible to both pilots, stall speeds for 0, 30 and 60 degrees of bank and 3-engine service
   ceiling. WARNING: Uncoordinated flight reduces stall margins and can cause an abrupt
   departure from controlled flight. CAUTION: Uncoordinated flight increases airframe
   structural loading and should be avoided unless an actual threat exists.
   16.1.3. Threats and emission control requirements permitting, use all available aids (e.g.,
   map reading, CANS, and tactical air navigation) to remain position oriented. Aircrew
   members share responsibility for enroute navigation, terrain avoidance and threat lookout.
   Attention should be focused outside the aircraft, emphasizing threat detection and situational
   awareness. Limit duties which distract attention from outside the aircraft to mission essential
   items only.
16.2. Tactical Arrivals:
   16.2.1. High Altitude Approaches (Figure 16.2.). See AFTTP 3-1.COMPASS CALL for
   discussion of advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival. These
   maneuvers may be flown on continuation training and operational missions. In all cases plan
   to roll out on final at approach speed no lower than 300 ft AGL.17.2.1.1. Overhead. Initiate
   overhead recoveries at 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and 1,500 feet AGL or traffic
   pattern altitude, whichever is higher, unless local procedures or tactical situation dictate
   otherwise. Break as the tactical situation permits with approximately a 45 degree angle of
   bank and retard the power to flight idle after the bank is established. Make a level turn to
   downwind with power reapplied as necessary to maintain 150 KIAS. Maintain 140 KIAS (or
   approach speed if higher) until wings level on final.
       16.2.1.1. Downwind. Enter a downwind leg for the active landing runway, normally
       maintaining 200 KIAS and 1,000 feet AGL or traffic pattern altitude, whichever is
       higher. Displace downwind to make one continuous turn to final. Initiate turn to final ½
       NM past the approach end of the runway with a 45-degree angle of bank. Retard power
       to flight idle after bank is established. Make a level turn until reaching 140 KIAS or
       approach airspeed, whichever is higher. Configure flaps and gear as speed decelerates
       through airspeed limits. Slow to final approach speed on final.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                147


   16.2.2. Selection of Maneuver. The desired outcome of the random approach is to place the
   aircraft on final (never less that 300 feet and 0.25 miles from the runway) wings level, above
   threshold speed so that a safe landing may be executed.
16.3. Tactical Departures. See AFTTP 3-1.COMPASS                    CALL      for   discussion    of
advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival.
16.4. Ground Operations. This section outlines procedures to follow when conducting specific
ground operations. Preparation and a thorough briefing enhance the ability to operate quickly
and safely. Brief appropriate ground personnel and subsequent aircrews on unexpected hazards
encountered during takeoff or landing (e.g., dust, winds and hostile activity). If possible, park in
a spot that allows exit via two or more taxi routes.
16.5. Compass Call Hand-Off Guide. This checklist is intended to streamline coordination
between two Compass Call crews when one aircraft is replacing the other aircraft on a
designated orbit. Refer to the local supplement for specific procedures and checklist.

                                  SEARCH AND RESCUE

17.1. General. In most cases EC-130H aircraft will continue to perform their mission, while
other assets conduct CSAR. However, the crew must be prepared to act as on-scene commander
until CSAR forces arrive. Crews will then assist CSAR forces in any way necessary.
   17.1.1. The following general instructions apply to all search missions:
      17.1.1.1. Brief crew members who did not attend the operations briefing on the purpose
      of the mission.
      17.1.1.2. Scanners who are not aircrew members will receive a briefing on the search
      objective.
      17.1.1.3. The AC will supervise and coordinate activities of crew members during
      preparation for search, as follows:
          17.1.1.3.1. Plan the search with the navigator.
          17.1.1.3.2. Discuss scanning procedures with all crew members.
          17.1.1.3.3. Discuss procedures for making search pattern turns with the navigator and
          copilot.
          17.1.1.3.4. Discuss the radio communication procedures with the crew.
          17.1.1.3.5. Discuss preparation of flares, sea dyes and smoke signals for deployment
          with the AMT.
      17.1.1.4. The AC will coordinate crew member activities during prosecution of the
      search by:
          17.1.1.4.1. Ensuring completion of the Search and Rescue Checklist (in local In-
          Flight Guide) prior to commencing any search.
          17.1.1.4.2. Alerting the scanners to begin scanning when approaching the search
          area.
          17.1.1.4.3. Directing crew member to put on their LPUs prior to descending below
          2,000 feet over water.
          17.1.1.4.4. Checking with crew members to ensure all equipment and personnel are
          ready for action in the event of a sighting.
          17.1.1.4.5. Making periodic checks of fuel remaining to ensure sufficient fuel
          remains for return to home station.
   17.1.2. Report all deviations from assigned search procedures to the on-scene commander or
   mission commander.
   17.1.3. Thoroughly investigate sightings and report findings immediately. Initiate recovery
   action or assistance when the survivors are located and inform appropriate agencies of the
   progress.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 149


   17.1.4. The navigator will:
       17.1.4.1. Maintain an accurate record of area searched.
       17.1.4.2. Direct the aircraft to ensure proper coverage of the search area.
       17.1.4.3. Continually cross check headings, drift, time, airspeed and altitude to maintain
       the best possible search coverage.
       17.1.4.4. Use a large scale chart when searching over land to ensure terrain and obstacle
       clearance. Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching over water.
       17.1.4.5. Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart.
       17.1.4.6. Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches.
       17.1.4.7. Debrief controlling agency with an accurate depiction of any areas searched.
       17.1.4.8. When other aircraft are involved, with the assistance of the ACS, track and
       assign search areas for other aircraft.
   17.1.5. The copilot will maintain radio communications with other search aircraft and the
   controlling agency as directed by the PIC.
   17.1.6. The AMT will assume supervision of the scanners and will schedule rotation and rest
   periods.
   17.1.7. All crew members will assist with the scanning duties when possible.
17.2. Search. When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area
again. Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45 degrees to the previous search
legs. This procedure results in smaller track spacing.
   17.2.1. In the search area:
       17.2.1.1. Descend to search altitude (Table 17.1) if possible.

      17.2.1.2. Have navigator obtain the wind at search altitude. To visually cover the area
      thoroughly, slow the airspeed during search patterns (refer to the Aircraft Performance
      Manual).
      17.2.1.3. Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance.
      17.2.1.4. Vector other aircraft to the scene.
      17.2.1.5. Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors).
      17.2.1.6. Assume on-scene command until relieved by another duly appointed SAR
      aircraft. As other aircraft arrive, do the following:
          17.2.1.6.1. Establish contact on channels other than Guard.
          17.2.1.6.2. Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance and rescue capability.
          17.2.1.6.3. Assign altimeter setting, frequencies, search areas, patterns and altitude
          separation.
      17.2.1.7. If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-
      scene commander.
   17.2.2. Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search by CANS, INS,
   Doppler, or plotting winds. To determine wind direction and velocity by plotting winds, the
   following apply:
      17.2.2.1. Crest lines of waves on the surface of the water are perpendicular to the
      direction of the wind. Ripples and bow waves break away from the wind (downwind).
      The foam of whitecaps formed by breaking waves always appears to slide into the wind
      (upwind).
      17.2.2.2. There may be streaks in the water parallel to the wind direction. These streaks
      are called wind lanes.
      17.2.2.3. Turn aircraft so its longitudinal axis is aligned with the direction of movement
      of ripples, whitecaps, waves, or wind streaks.
      17.2.2.4. Read compass to determine magnetic direction of wind or its reciprocal
      (convert to true values, if necessary).
      17.2.2.5. Determine the direction in which ripples, waves, or whitecaps are moving to
      obtain actual direction of wind.

                                                 foam in great patches blown in dense white
                                                 streaks. Whole surface of sea takes on a white
                                                 appearance. Visibility affected.
   17.2.3. When flying search patterns, turns must be accurate and uniform as possible. The
   following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns:
        17.2.3.1. Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible.
        17.2.3.2. Prior to starting the pattern, the navigator will brief the crew on the direction
        and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used.
        17.2.3.3. Normally, all turns are standard rate (3 degrees per second) unless track
        spacing is less in distance than the diameter of a standard turn at a given speed. In this
        situation, continue turn to 180 degrees and adjust turn rate as required to remain within
        the pattern.
152                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


      17.2.3.4. On any search pattern employing a succession of 90-degree standard rate turns
      separated by cross legs, use the following procedure for computing time to begin each
      turn:
          17.2.3.4.1. Compute time required to fly entire first leg using ground speed for that
          leg.
          17.2.3.4.2. Subtract 19 seconds from the time computed in paragraph 17.2.4.4.1.
          17.2.3.4.3. Add the difference obtained in paragraph 17.2.4.4.2. to start search time.
          Resultant will be the time to begin the first 90-degree turn.
          17.2.3.4.4. Compute time required to fly the entire second leg using ground speed for
          that leg.
          17.2.3.4.5. Subtract 8 seconds from time computed in paragraph 17.4.4.4.4.
          17.2.3.4.6. Add the difference obtained in paragraph 17.2.4.4.5. to start search time.
          Resultant will be the time to begin the first 90-degree turn.
          17.2.3.4.7. To compute ensuing turn times, continue to subtract 8 seconds from
          successive full leg time and add the resultant to previous turn time.
17.3. Sighting Procedures:
   17.3.1. When a sighting is made, the appropriate crewmember will notify the rest of the crew
   over interphone and indicate the position of the sighting by using the clock system; e.g.,
   "Pilot, right scanner, target sighted at 4 o‘clock, 500 yards."
   17.3.2. Immediately upon making a sighting, drop a smoke signal or sea dye marker to mark
   the approximate location of the sighting. During search missions, have marking devices
   readily available to jettison. The crewmember who launches the smoke will announce
   "SMOKE AWAY" over the interphone. Note: During the pre-search briefing, the AC
   should designate who will launch smokes to mark a sighting. This will ensure a smoke is
   launched and preclude inadvertent multiple launches.
   17.3.3. Following the launching of a smoke signal and other marker, make a procedure turn
   to bring the aircraft back over the target, or if the observer can keep the target in sight, the
   pilot flying should immediately turn in the direction of the target. The observer will continue
   to call out the target position and distance to orient the pilot. As the turn progresses, the pilot
   or copilot should be able to acquire the target.
   17.3.4. The following procedures are for confirmed sightings:
      17.3.4.1. Keep the target in sight at all times. Mark with dye marker or smoke floats.
      17.3.4.2. Turn on IFF.
      17.3.4.3. Report the sighting to the rescue center, OSC, air or ground station, or
      operating agency, as appropriate. This report should include:
          17.3.4.3.1. Position.
          17.3.4.3.2. Number of survivors.
          17.3.4.3.3. Condition of survivors.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                           153


        17.3.4.3.4. Type of emergency equipment used or needed by survivors.
        17.3.4.3.5. Action already taken or assistance needed.
        17.3.4.3.6. Condition of weather and sea.
        17.3.4.3.7. Fuel remaining in hours.
     17.3.4.4. Orbit the scene. When two planes are available, one should climb to an altitude
     that ensures radar detection by other craft or land bases, and the other should remain low,
     keeping the target in sight. Both aircraft should remain on station until relieved by other
     aircraft, rescue or recovery has been affected, or forced to return to base because of low
     fuel. In the latter event, mark the position with the best means available before departing
     the search area.
     17.3.4.5. Drop available emergency equipment and/or personnel, if required. If
     survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life
     rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices.
     17.3.4.6. Direct potential rescue or recovery vessels and other aircraft to the scene by
     radio or visual signals. Radio and visual signals you may use to direct a vessel to the
     scene to include:
        17.3.4.6.1. Radio message to the vessel (If unsure of frequency guarded by the
        vessel, use 2182 KHz voice or 156.8 MHz VHF or FM).
        17.3.4.6.2. ADF to take bearings on a vessel‘s LF or MF transmissions.
        17.3.4.6.3. VHF or UHF direction finder to take bearings of VHF or UHF
        transmissions.
        17.3.4.6.4. Radar and IFF.
        17.3.4.6.5. Signal light.
        17.3.4.6.6. Dropping message containers.
        17.3.4.6.7. Pyrotechnic flares.
        17.3.4.6.8. When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification,
        and then indicate location of the target by:
            17.3.4.6.8.1. Circling the vessel at least once at low altitude.
            17.3.4.6.8.2. Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings
            at the same time.
            17.3.4.6.8.3. Sending a message by signal light or dropping a message, if
            possible.
            17.3.4.6.8.4. Heading in the direction of the target. Repeat this procedure until
            the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to
            comply by hoisting the International Flag, November (the International Flag,
            November, is a blue and white checkerboard). Crossing the wake of the vessel
            close astern at a low altitude means that the service of the vessel to which the
            signal is directed is no longer required.
154                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


       17.3.4.7. In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been
       sighted:
           17.3.4.7.1. Fly low over survivors with landing lights on.
           17.3.4.7.2. Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors.
           17.3.4.7.3. Drop two smoke signals a few seconds apart.
       17.3.4.8. Aircrews sighting survivors at night should:
           17.3.4.8.1. Mark the position by dropping smoke floats or float lights.
           17.3.4.8.2. Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships.
              17.3.4.8.2.1. If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving
              the target position in relation to the float light. Drop parachute flares to assist the
              rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target.
              17.3.4.8.2.2. If the objective has not been located, but its position is fairly well
              established, drop two float lights to outline the limits of the search area, the most
              probable position of target being halfway between the lights. Start the search
              from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for illumination.
              17.3.4.8.2.3. If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have
              one aircraft fly over the area at 3,000 feet dropping flares at 2- or 3-mile intervals.
              Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind
              at 500 feet to search.
17.4. Scanning Techniques. Precise scanning is one of the most important aspects of a search.
During a search, all crewmembers will make a cursory examination of the area. For maximum
effectiveness, assign personnel primary duties as scanners. If available, assign personnel other
than the basic crew to these duties. Thoroughly brief scanners on techniques prior to beginning a
search.
17.5. Communications with a Distressed Aircraft:
   17.5.1. Establish direct communications with the distressed aircraft as soon as possible.
   Accomplish this on the distressed aircraft‘s HF enroute frequency, emergency VHF or UHF
   frequency, or any other frequency used by the distressed aircraft to alert air or ground
   facilities. The primary method of communications will be VHF or UHF when positive
   contact is made, see Table 17.3

Table 17.3. Communications Frequencies.

Note: These are suggested radio setups. Actual frequencies used will be determined by the
search objective, crew and availability of radio equipment.
  17.5.2. Communications procedures should instill confidence in the distressed crew so they
  will know professional assistance is at hand. The crew will achieve this goal by employing
  the following:
      17.5.2.1. Coordinate immediate action items first and supplemental items as the mission
      progresses. Communications may be lost or the distressed crew may be forced to bail
      out, crash land or ditch.
      17.5.2.2. Avoid long transmissions and provide pertinent data at periodic intervals to
      assure the distressed crew that contact is being maintained.
      17.5.2.3. Make all messages clear and concise. Know what to say and use a tone of
      confidence.
      17.5.2.4. If direct communications are delayed or fail completely, relay pertinent data
      and instructions through any air or ground station in contact with both aircraft.
      17.5.2.5. If all efforts to contact the distressed aircraft fail, transmit pertinent information
      and instructions in the blind, assuming the distressed aircraft is receiving but unable to
      acknowledge.
  17.5.3. Use the following frequencies and procedures during an intercept:
      17.5.3.1. Primary Frequency. The HF, VHF or UHF enroute frequency used by the
      distressed aircraft to alert air or ground stations and to request intercept.
      17.5.3.2. Secondary Frequency. Designate a secondary HF frequency shortly after initial
      contact. Instruct the distressed aircraft to change to this frequency if contact on the
      primary frequency is lost for a 10-minute period. When VHF or UHF contact is
      established, designate a secondary frequency. Prior to changing VHF or UHF
      frequencies, instruct the distressed aircraft to return to primary if contact cannot be
      established within 30 seconds.
  17.5.4. Initial Communications Procedures:
      17.5.4.1. Attempt initial contact with distressed aircraft before takeoff or as soon as
      practical on HF, VHF or UHF. If initial contact is on HF, designate a VHF or UHF
156                                                 AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010


       frequency to monitor. If initial contact is on VHF or UHF, instruct distressed aircraft to
       monitor enroute HF frequency.
       17.5.4.2. Identify yourself and advise that you are enroute to intercept.
       17.5.4.3. Instruct the distressed crew to use the present frequency as primary and not to
       break contact. Designate a secondary frequency.
       17.5.4.4. Instruct the distressed crew to transmit "emergency" on the IFF.
       17.5.4.5. Obtain and evaluate the latest position, time, magnetic heading, indicated
       airspeed (IAS), ground speed (GS), altitude, fuel remaining, personnel on board and
       flight conditions of the distressed aircraft.
       17.5.4.6. Verify the nature of emergency and intentions of the distressed aircraft.
       17.5.4.7. If required, instruct the distressed aircraft to home on the signal transmitted by
       the rescue aircraft.
       17.5.4.8. Transmit supplemental data as appropriate to the situation such as altimeter
       setting, weather, estimated time to intercept (ETI), minimum safe altitude, etc.
17.6. Lost Aircraft Procedures. Fixing, intercepting and escorting a lost aircraft is an
extremely difficult problem. Establish communications with the lost aircraft in order to initiate
orientation procedures. Use all possible aids to locate the approximate position of the lost
aircraft. In many cases, radar or direction finding stations will establish a bearing from the
station to the lost aircraft and indicate the general direction to fly to accomplish an intercept.
   17.6.1. Attempt contact with the lost aircraft as soon as possible. Climb to the highest
   practical altitude to increase communications range.
   17.6.2. If the lost aircraft is in contact with an air or ground station within reasonable range
   from the base, the rescue aircraft should orbit at altitude over the appropriate station until
   some clue is received which indicates the general direction or position of the lost aircraft.
   17.6.3. If all communication attempts prove unsuccessful, it is advisable to proceed in the
   most logical direction toward the lost aircraft.
   17.6.4. Instruct the distressed aircraft to maintain radio contact at all costs and orbit at its
   present position to keep within communications range, maintaining the highest practical
   altitude to improve communications.
   17.6.5. Ascertain amount of fuel remaining and the number of personnel aboard.
   17.6.6. Maintain communications with air or ground stations capable of providing bearings,
   fixes or other assistance.
   17.6.7. Use every possible intercept method and electronic aid to ensure a successful
   mission.
       17.6.7.1. Employ the electronic aid that can provide the quickest and most reliable
       bearing or fix on the lost aircraft.
       17.6.7.2. Obtain a reliable bearing or fix and instruct the lost aircraft to leave orbit and
       head toward the rescue aircraft or the nearest suitable landing area.
AFI11-2EC-130HV3 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               157


      17.6.7.3. If in voice contact with the lost aircraft and unable to establish a bearing or fix,
      determine its approximate position from any surface objects, landmarks or peculiar cloud
      formation. Landing lights and pyrotechnic flares improve detection capabilities at night.
17.7. Departing Search Area:
   17.7.1. Notify ATC and the appropriate SAR agency on-scene SAR aircraft, Rescue
   Coordination Center, etc.
   17.7.2. If other search aircraft have not arrived, reconfirm position, and advise survivors
   when further assistance will arrive, if known.

access to controls (for pilots, the instructor must occupy either the pilot or copilot seat).
Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as military contingencies, classified missions, SAR
missions, politically sensitive missions, or training activities. Flight under "Due Regard"
obligates the military PIC to be his or her own ATC agency and to separate his or her aircraft
from all other air traffic (see FLIP General Planning, section 7.)
Equal Time Point (ETP)—Point along a route at which an aircraft may either proceed to
destination or first suitable airport or return to departure base or last suitable airport in the same
amount of time based on all engines operating.
Execution Authority—Command-level approval for initiation of a mission or portion thereof
after due consideration of all pertinent factors. Execution authority is restricted to designated
command authority.
Familiar Field—An airport in the local flying area at which unit assigned aircraft routinely
perform transition training. Each operations group commander will designate familiar fields
within their local flying area.
First Suitable Airfield (FSAF)—The first suitable airfield available after completing the
category I route segment.
Fix—A position determined from terrestrial, electronic or astronomical data.
Hazardous Cargo or Materials (HAZMAT)—Articles or substances that are capable of posing
significant risk to health, safety, or property when transported by air.
Instructor Supervision—Supervision by an instructor of like specialty (see also Direct
InstructorSupervision).
Joint Force Air Component Commander— The commander within a unified command,
subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the establishing commander for
making recommendations on the proper employment of assigned, attached, and/or made
available for tasking air forces; planning and coordinating air operations; or accomplishing such

operational missions as may be assigned. The joint force air component commander is given the
authority necessary to accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the establishing commander.
Also called JFACC. See also joint force commander. (JP 3-0).
Knock—it-Off—A term any aircrew member may use to terminate a training maneuver. Upon
hearing "Knock-it-Off" the crew should establish a safe attitude, altitude, and airspeed and return
the aircraft power and controls to a normal configuration.
Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF)—The last suitable airfield available before beginning the
category I route segment.
Local Training Mission—A mission scheduled to originate and terminate at home station,
generated for training or evaluation and executed at the local level.
Maintenance Status—A-1. No maintenance required.
A-2 (Plus Noun).—Minor maintenance required, but not serious enough to cause delay. Add
nouns that identify the affected units or systems, i.e., hydraulic, ultra high frequency (UHF)
radio, radar, engine, fuel control, generator, etc. Attempt to describe the nature of the system
malfunction to the extent that appropriate maintenance personnel will be available to meet the
aircraft. Use system codes in appropriate AFTO Forms 781 whenever possible to enhance
OPSEC. When possible, identify system as mission essential (ME) or mission contributing
(MC).
A-3 (Plus Noun).—Major maintenance. Delay is anticipated. Affected units or systems are to
be identified as in A-2 status above.
A-4.—Aircraft or system has suspected or known biological, chemical, or radiological
contamination.
Mission Contributing (MC)—Any degraded component, system, or subsystem which is
desired, but not essential to mission accomplishment.
Mission Essential (ME)—Any degraded component, system, or subsystem which is essential
for safe aircraft operations or mission completion.
Off Station—The portion of the flight when the aircraft is departing from the orbit airspace and
not engaged in the mission.
On Station—Ready to employ the weapon system.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated
and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish

assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also
called OPCON (Ref: Joint Publication 1-02).
Operational Missions—Missions such as deployment, re-deployment, and operational readiness
inspections (ORI) are considered operational missions.
Orbit—The airspace where EC-130H aircraft conduct the mission.
Overwater Flight—Any flight that exceeds power off gliding distance from land.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport, on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing (e.g. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared). ACs are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs
inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be imposed
on the AC for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)
Pilot in Command—Aircraft commander-qualified pilot who is in command of the aircraft and
the overall mission, regardless of whether he or she is in the seat.
Prior Qualified Pilot—Pilot converted from another MDS. PQPs have no prior C-130 pilot
qualification.
Show Time—The time a crew member is required to report for duty.
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
Special Tactics Team (STT)—A task-organized element of special tactics that may include
combat control, pararescue, and combat weather personnel. Functions include austere airfield
and assault zone reconnaissance, surveillance, establishment, and terminal control; terminal
attack control; combat search and rescue; combat casualty care and evacuation staging; and
tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Stations Time—A specified time that aircrew, passengers, and material are to be in the aircraft
and prepared for flight. Passengers will be seated and loads tied down. The crew will have
completed aircraft preflight inspections prior to stations time.
Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF)—The fuel flow rate expected during the last hour at cruise altitude.
It is the difference between the fuel required for enroute time plus one hour and fuel required for
enroute time. TFF may also be computed using TO 1C-130H-1-1 fuel flow table and the
estimated aircraft weight at destination. Estimated gross weight is determined by subtracting
fuel burn off from takeoff gross weight.
Time Out—Common assertive statement used to voice aircrew member concern when safety
may be jeopardized.
