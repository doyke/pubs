                                                Chapter 1

                                                GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. The Wing Operations Center (WOC) is the 16th Special Operations Wing (SOW)
consolidated Command and Control (C2) center for all local, CONUS, and OCONUS operations. As the
C2 node for the wing, it is configurable, scaleable, and provides the template for a deployed headquarters.
It contains all the command, control, information, and combat support elements necessary to effectively
direct the following tasks: generate missions, support deployed forces, monitor installation activities,
respond to emergencies, and react to contingency requirements. The Battlestaff serves as an integrated
staff activity to coordinate activities or provide support and information to internal agencies (16 SOW/
Hurlburt Field units), external agencies (such as HQ AFSOC and local community agencies), and
deployed LNOs, C2 nodes, Mission Commanders, or ADVON teams.

1.2. Assumptions. The following assumptions influence the organization, duties and responsibilities of
the WOC.
    1.2.1. The 16 SOW will have aircraft deployed for Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and Opera-
    tion IRAQI FREEDOM for the foreseeable future.
    1.2.2. Support for CENTCOM theater operations is considered normal wing activity, not a contin-
    gency action.

1.3. Mission. The purpose of the WOC is to provide the 16 SOW/CC with a conduit for command deci-
sion-making and a staff to carry out those decisions. During a contingency/emergency response, the
WOC will be the centralized activity center. After the initial response, the WOC at Hurlburt reverts to an
active support element. Forward deployed commanders will normally execute missions from forward
ISB/FSBs, with authority and responsibility. OPCON will not be exercised from Hurlburt, but consulta-
tion, feedback and clear, reliable information sharing will be essential. The WOC will focus on internal
and external communication during deployment or execution, regardless of physical location of the
WOC.

1.4. Function. The 16 SOW WOC supports Battlestaff activity in both the primary and alternate loca-
tions as directed by the WOC Director. When formed, the Battlestaff represents the 16 SOW/CC. The
WOC Director will publish directives for all 16 SOW assigned and attached forces (including tenant
units) through “Battlestaff Directives” (BSDs).

1.5. Manning. The 16 SOW WOC is comprised of a Director, A-1 through A-6 positions forming a Bat-
tlestaff, Command Post (CP), Radio Room (RR) and Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). Individual
squadrons are integrated through Unit Control Centers (UCC), and the DCC (Deployment Control Cen-
ter) is integrated through the A-4L. The WOC Director will determine the appropriate manning in the
WOC based on level of activity and mission requirements. Additionally, the WOC Director will develop
an alert schedule for the Battlestaff and maintain an ADVON roster created by 16 SOW XP which will be
updated as required. All staffs will anticipate 24-hour operations. All Battlestaff representatives will pos-
sess a minimum of a SECRET clearance and be briefed into appropriate compartments.
    1.5.1. The following defines the manning requirements for daily operations for a normal battle
    rhythm.
HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006                                                                          5


       1.5.1.1. Day. From 0700-1700 on weekdays (unless otherwise directed), the WOC Director, A-1,
       A-2, A-4L, A-4M, A5 and radio room will man the WOC. The A-6 will be present for all brief-
       ings and as mission necessity dictates.
       1.5.1.2. Evening. Weekdays from 1700 until the end of local flying, the radio room will be
       manned.
       1.5.1.3. 24 Hours/7 days (unless otherwise directed). A-3/SOF, CP, and MOC will be on duty.
       1.5.1.4. Weekends and Holiday. The WOC Director will task organize to meet the situation and
       establish on-call duties.

1.6. Responsibilities. The WOC Director is responsible for all activities inside the WOC to include:
establishing Battlestaff procedures, training A-staff personnel, developing Battlestaff duty rosters, devel-
oping contingency “templates,” operating the WOC facility, running Battlestaff meetings, and obtaining
support material. The OG through the OSS/CC will develop training programs for deployed mission
commanders. Normally, the LRS/CC will assume A-4L duties in the Battlestaff, the CS/CC will assume
A-6 duties, the OSS/CC will assume A-3 duties, and the MSS/CC will assume A-1 duties. All other
A-Staff and Special Staff principles remain as designated during normal in-garrison duty.
   1.6.1. Subordinate units will provide personnel as required by the commanders of their respective
   groups (deployed staff, LNO, planner, PDSS (pre-deployment site survey)/ADVON, rear-echelon
   support, etc.). Group/CCs will provide a qualified replacement before releasing assigned personnel
   unless otherwise approved by the 16 SOW/CC or designated alternate. Individuals assigned to Battle-
   staff duty will not be given other responsibilities without clearance from the WOC Director.

1.7. Operating Hours and Locations. The WOC maintains 24-hour operations in the Command Post
building (90208). When necessary to evacuate that site due to events such as fire, bomb threat or natural
disaster, an alternative command post will be established in the building 90802 (Deployment Control
Center). The WOC Director will ensure that the relocation checklist is completed if relocation is required.

1.8. Disaster Period. During a disaster situation, or during mobilization and deployment of the majority
of the Wing’s assets, the 16 SOW/CC may direct the entire Battlestaff to move forward. In this case, the
16 SOW/CV will assemble a smaller stay-behind Battlestaff to provide continuity and support the
deployed force.

                                                Chapter 2

                                CONCEPT, POLICY AND SECURITY

2.1. Concept. The WOC provides the means to effectively and efficiently employ the wing during a vari-
ety of wartime, contingency, and disaster related situations (installation threat, disaster response, mobili-
zation & deployment, support for off-station mission, major accident/incident, etc). The WOC also
passes JCS-declared Alert Conditions (LERTCON), 16 SOW-determined Hurricane Condition (HUR-
CON) and headquarters or locally directed Force Protection Condition (FPCON) postures for all Hurlburt
Field units (including tenants).

2.2. Policy. The Battlestaff assumes sole responsibility for managing all 16 SOW activity and resources.
This wide authority is necessary since Battlestaff decisions will cross functional areas and impact
on-going and pre-coordinated missions as operates during a crisis. Diversion of assets projected to sup-
port other requirements, or dynamic re-tasking of missions in progress will be approved by the Battlestaff
leadership, coordinated by the A-Staff, and directed by the WOC. Battlestaff authority may be assigned
to a “supported Group Commander” or other Mission Commander for certain situations where the 16
SOW/CC determines that the level of effort does not warrant standing up a full Battlestaff:
    2.2.1. The WOC Director is responsible to the 16 SOW Commander for operation of the Wing Oper-
    ations Center. The WOC Director provides oversight of the WOC to ensure proper response to all
    requirements. He/she carries the authority of the 16 SOW/CC to make decisions necessary to carry
    out the commander’s intent during operations. The WOC Director is responsible to the Wing Com-
    mander and coordinates activities with the Group Commanders and Wing Staff Agencies (WSA).
    The Battlestaff will be commanded by the 16 SOW/CC. When the 16 SOW/CC is not available, the
    16 SOW/CV will assume command. If the 16 SOW/CV is unavailable, he/she will designate an alter-
    nate (minimum O-5, or O-5 Select, certified by 16 SOW/CC through JSOACC level). Normally, the
    16 SOW/CC will deploy forward with a headquarters element or with the light contingency package
    for HUREVAC. In these cases the 16 SOW/CV assumes command of a rear-echelon “reachback”
    battlestaff or “rideout team.”
    2.2.2. All Wing Battlestaff members (see figure 3.3), unit commanders, “Rampco,” and UCC points
    of contact will have a beeper/cell phone so that they can be immediately recalled through the WOC/
    SRC. The 16 SOW goal for Wing Battlestaff contact is 30 minutes or less and 1-hour or less for Base
    Battlestaff contact. The 16 SOW goal for reporting for duty is NLT 1-hour after initial contact. This
    is a total of 1-hour and 30-minutes to show from a cold start. The 16 SOW goal for a full unit recall
    is two hours to run the recall (from first call in to the WOC from the 16 SOW/CC) and get alibis to the
    respective group. 16 SOW goal is one additional hour for all personnel to report to duty section. This
    is a total of three hours to recall the 16 SOW from a cold start.
    2.2.3. All 16 SOW Group Commanders, in addition to being members of the Executive Battlestaff,
    will maintain a pool of trained qualified personnel available for Hurlburt A-Staff augmentation,
    deployed staff duty, pallet build, and other mobility functions in accordance with the installation
    deployment plan. Group and squadron commanders will ensure personnel are trained and proficient
    in their Battlestaff or UCC duties before being assigned to that duty.
    2.2.4. Attachment 1 through Attachment 19 of this HFI outline specific duties for Battlestaff per-
    sonnel.
HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006                                                                           7


   2.2.5. Each A-Staff functional leader will maintain a hard and soft copy continuity book (softcopy
   will be updated on LAN in the information center share folders). The continuity books will contain all
   information required to function effectively in that A-Staff position and require bi-annual review and
   update by the functional leader. The book should also include specific instructions to access relevant
   data and programs. Additionally, A-Staff continuity books must have specific sections for Hurlburt
   Field Base Deployment Plan 10-403 and Hurlburt Field Emergency Management 10-2, including
   appropriate checklists. These agency-specific checklists should parallel and expand upon those found
   in the two plans. Guidebooks and A-Staff “start-up kits” are kept in the WOC.
   2.2.6. The Battlestaff A-3 will manage the briefing schedule associated with Battlestaff activities and
   keep boards updated. Additional personnel, as determined by the WOC Director, may be required
   each shift to perform this duty.

2.3. Security.
   2.3.1. A banner will be displayed at the front of the Battlestaff briefing area indicating the highest
   level of discussion that may be conducted (UNCLASS, SECRET, or SECRET-SPECAT). During ops
   out of secondary locations (e.g., relocation of the Battlestaff to an alternate unsecured facility) guards
   must be posted outside the facility or room where the Battlestaff is assembled if it is not a secure area.
   All electronic equipment except for “receive only” pagers will be left in storage units outside of the
   Battlestaff area. Pagers will be placed in “silent” mode. Phones will be set to “autosecure”. Use of
   non-secure lines will be limited to minimum necessary and conducted ONLY on instruments
   equipped with a “push to talk” handset. Conversations over non-secured lines will be announced by
   the words “open line”.
   2.3.2. The WOC Director or designated representative will control access to the Battlestaff. Primary
   members of each organization listed in paragraph 3-1 will have Area 2 open on their Restricted Area
   Badges. All Battlestaff members will be issued a 16th SOW “DOS badge” indicating SECRET/SCI
   clearance level and compartmented program in brief. These badges will be worn at all times in the
   Battlestaff area. If simulating a deployment and operating from the Permanent Exercise Facility
   (PEF), all personnel must wear the “DOS badge” issued by the 16th SOW. WOC door guards will
   check badges or ID cards prior to Battlestaff meetings and notify the Director of highest level of dis-
   cussion that may take place for the assembly and the names of those who are determining that level if
   below “SECRET/SPECAT.”
   2.3.3. Security considerations for deployment activity are intended to reduce the visibility of 16 SOW
   movement and the specifics of that movement. Units will establish a baseline OPSEC signature
   through regular use of secure phones, frequent recall exercises, and occasional broad pager activation
   if that technique is used to recall a significant portion of the unit. All details of the DSOE (deployed
   schedule of events), pax manifests, or aircraft generation timeline will be protected (not classified but
   not placed over any an unencrypted electronic media or mentioned via clear text on an open line).
   Pager “email” is not a secure method of communication and is easily monitored by eavesdroppers.
   SOP for deploying forces is to consider all details of location, length of TDY, supported forces, nature
   of mission, and size of force package classified information. Unit commanders will stress to their
   troops to ensure that families do not discuss Wing deployments over cellular telephones, commercial
   phone lines or in public during our contingency operations. Deploying forces will assume that all
   non-secure communications (phone, email, and letters) are unauthorized while deployed unless spe-
   cifically briefed otherwise by the deployed mission commander. All contact with local media will be
8                                                             HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006


    conducted via 16 SOW/PA. All media releases will be approved by the 16 SOW/CC or designated
    individual and be consistent with PA guidance published by supported agencies and HQ AFSOC.
    2.3.4. Per AFI 10-201, classify instructions and checklists that refer to combat readiness data to
    include their remarks and limiting factors (LIMFACS) for a single unit, a minimum CONFIDEN-
    TIAL. Products that contain the aggregation or combining of data from two or more units is classified
    SECRET.
    2.3.5. The Battlestaff functions as a staff office and is responsible for control of classified materials.
    All WOC personnel are responsible for safeguarding classified material. All classified documents,
    except TOP SECRET (TS), are received and dispatched through the WOC Director. A Top Secret
    Control Officer (TSCO) or alternate must receive, enter in the TS register, control, and dispatch all TS
    documents. For message release authority, see paragraph 3.12.1. All Battlestaff members are individ-
    ually and collectively responsible for security of classified material used in the Battlestaff. Be partic-
    ularly careful to keep compartmented information in its proper compartment, and use the right LAN
    terminal (unclassified, SIPR, or DNET-6) for the right purpose.
    2.3.6. OPSEC and COMSEC. The A-Staff “Information Operations” division is the focal point for
    OPSEC and operational concepts for C2. Additionally, COMSEC control is the responsibility of 16
    CS, 16 SFS maintains control of physical security and classification guidance, and 16SOW/XP is the
    focal point for tactical deception. Battlestaff members must restrict their voice communications on
    non-secure circuits to non-critical information. What is considered to be critical information is listed
    in the 16 SOW Critical Information List (CIL) and is reviewed annually. A CIL is to be placed next
    to all telecommunication devices (e-mail, fax machine, phones, etc.). If information is considered
    critical, it must be discussed via secure means, even though it may not be classified. Do not attempt
    to “talk around” classified information. Use red phones and secure phones to the maximum extent
    possible. Observe the highest degree of OPSEC and COMSEC awareness and discipline during clas-
    sified activities, briefings, and discussions.
       2.3.6.1. DO NOT use non-secure telephones when classified briefings are being conducted or
       when classified discussions are taking place. If unavoidable, terminate the classified discussion or
       briefing until the phone conversation is completed. Do not discuss classified information while
       phones are in the process of going secure.
       2.3.6.2. Turn off all intrabase two-way radios (land mobile radio or “brick”), pagers, cellular
       phones, and other such communications devices before entering the WOC. Leave all devices
       except “receive only” pagers in the entrapment area of the WOC.
       2.3.6.3. Always check the physical security of the Wing Operations Center and determine the
       appropriate clearance level prior to conducting classified briefings.

                           CONTINGENCY OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Contingency Response - Initial Battlestaff Activity. Normally, crisis action planning is preceded
by a period of “heightened awareness”. The key to success in a 16 SOW contingency deployment is to
anticipate tasks and get out in front of the timeline. Upon indications that a “spin up” is coming, the 16
SOW/CC may direct one or more of the following (not all inclusive): MXG aircraft status and prepara-
tions for Dash One preflight; OG may be asked to form crews (max per unit), place some or all crews in
crew rest with a LFA time, “lock and cock” with preflight crews if time permits, place two “slick” crews
in crew rest, direct the 19 SOS to begin database prep, list/alert 6 SOS regional experts, and identify addi-
tional planners. The WOC Director may begin calling in additional staff and prepare briefings to include
decision points and tracking documents of execution of leadership decisions. Additionally, all units may
be contacted through their commanders with direction to stand up UCCs. Any of these preemptive activ-
ities may be directed by phone or via a BSD after an Executive Battlestaff meeting. Upon a more substan-
tial order (Planning, Alert, Warning, Deployment, or Execution) the 16 SOW/CC will either convene a
Wing or a Base Battlestaff (See Figure 3.1.).

3.2. Authority to Assemble or Activate the 16 SOW Battlestaff. Stand-up of the Battlestaff may be
directed at any time by the 16 SOW/CC, CV, or designated alternate.

3.3. Executive, Wing, and Base Battlestaff Composition. Only the required personnel listed below
will attend each Battlestaff meetings. Personnel not on this list must receive permission to be present
from the Wing/CC, Wing/CV, or Director. Executive Battlestaff, Wing Battlestaff, and Base Battlestaff
members are:

3.7. Battlestaff Activation Procedures. Any time the decision is made to activate the Battlestaff, follow
the procedures specified in this HFI and the WOC Quick Response Checklist (QRC). Guidelines for Bat-
HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006                                                                        13


tlestaff activation or assembly during a disaster response situation are in the Hurlburt Field Emergency
Management 10-2.
   3.7.1. In most cases, the WOC will make initial contact with the 16 SOW/CC or CV. If the decision
   is made to activate the Battlestaff, the WOC will run its QRC and execute the appropriate Battlestaff
   recall (Executive, Wing, or Base) IAW Figure 3.1. The first contact on any recall will be the WOC
   Director followed immediately by the Group Commanders. WOC personnel will immediately begin
   standing up the Battlestaff area. If a Wing Battlestaff member cannot be contacted, his/her deputy
   will be called. All Wing Battlestaff members will carry LMRs/beepers/cell phones at all times when
   away from their primary duty stations.
   3.7.2. Recalled Battlestaff members will assemble in the Battlestaff area as soon as possible after
   notification, or at a time specified by 16 SOW/CC. Activation (first meeting) is normally accom-
   plished within one hour of the time recall is initiated.
   3.7.3. The WOC will advise the AFSOC Command Center that the 16 SOW Battlestaff has formed
   and is postured for 24-hour operations (if applicable).
   3.7.4. The WOC Director will be the senior staff officer on the Battlestaff when present.
   3.7.5. Executive, Wing, and Base Battlestaff members will attend meetings and then depart as
   required to execute other duties. When the Battlestaff is directed by the 16 SOW/CC to begin 24-hour
   operations, the WOC Director and A-Staff positions will remain manned.
   3.7.6. When the Battlestaff assumes 24-hour operations, all Commander and staff positions will have
   personnel identified to work 12-hour shifts. Commanders may designate an officer or Senior NCO to
   fill their position at the Battlestaff or they may remain on “CC net” radio or cell with approval of the
   16 SOW CC/CV. There will be a primary contact for all group/wing commanders physically on Hurl-
   burt Field at all times. A-staff substitutions will be coordinated with/approved by the WOC Director.
   The WOC Director will schedule and conduct shift changeover briefings. Changeover will allow a
   30-minute overlap to allow time for the changeover briefing and other continuity activities.
   3.7.7. Battlestaff SOP:
       3.7.7.1. The Battlestaff consists of a command element and supporting staff. The command ele-
       ment consists of the 16 SOW/CC, 16 SOW/CV, 16 OG/CC, 16 MXG/CC, 16 MSG/CC, and 16
       MG/CC. The supporting staff consists of an A-Staff. The A-1 is the 16 MSS/CC, the A-2 is the
       Chief of OSS/DOI, the A-3 is the OSS/CC, the A-4M is the MOS/CC, the A-4L is the LRS/CC,
       the A-5 is Chief of XP, and the A-6 is the CS/CC:
           3.7.7.1.1. Group commanders will have a copy of this HFI, wing deployment flow schemat-
           ics, and supporting material of their choice available at their Battlestaff position. The WOC
           Director will ensure continuity books are available for each A-Staff element, and that appro-
           priate OPLAN material and message traffic is distributed to Commanders.
   3.7.8. Unit Control Centers (UCCs). The UCC is the primary C2 node for all units at Hurlburt Field
   (as well as 16SOW units at Eglin and Duke) during contingency response. Executive level guidance
   may be given to stand up the UCCs for 24-hour operations. Unclassified information (HUREVAC
   operations for example) will be communicated via unclassified e-mail and phone. For other situa-
   tions, information will flow via SIPRNET, secure telephone, or by a runner. All decisions and impor-
   tant information addressed in Battlestaff meetings will be passed to the UCCs via “Battlestaff
   Directives” (BSDs). When directed, additional direction and information may be sent to the UCC
14                                                            HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006


     from the Deployment Control Center (DCC) or SRC. When installed on SIPRNET, collaborative
     software will permit unit personnel (as directed by their commander) to monitor Battlestaff meetings
     from their own UCC:
        3.7.8.1. Units that do not have operational secure communications (both STE and SIPR) must
        provide a runner to ensure current information is relayed between the WOC and the unit UCC.

3.8. Primary Operating Locations. The Battlestaff will normally convene inside the 16 SOW WOC.

3.9. Initial Briefing and Actions.
     3.9.1. Initial Battlestaff briefings will (preparation time permitting) include a review of enemy/
     friendly order of battle, anticipated operating locations, anticipated C2 concept, specified tasks,
     implied tasks, known LIMFACs, weather, and concurrent planning activity. Discussion will focus on
     the current situation, proposed timeline of events, and identifying requirements for the upcoming
     deployment and decisions necessary for paring and tailoring the force package and prioritizing/load
     planning the air flow. Initial data will include status of aircraft and crew, status of DCC, SRC, and
     UCCs, and discussion of anticipated “battle rhythm”. At the end of the first Battlestaff meeting the
     WOC Director will prepare and submit a template BSD that covers commander’s intent and key deci-
     sions/guidance.
     3.9.2. Prior to arrival of the WOC Director, the Battlestaff A-3 and Senior Controller will activate the
     Battlestaff area and supervise recall activities as well as all required QRC action. The Battlestaff
     relies on a comprehensive set of template briefings in order to react quickly to a crisis or contingency
     response. The appropriate briefing for the situation will be determined by the WOC Director. An ini-
     tial Battlestaff meeting will contain the following as a baseline:
        3.9.2.1. Security review, time hack, and roll call (accomplish prior to meeting start time if possi-
        ble).
        3.9.2.2. Situation review, to include required missions, Quick Concept of Operations, applicable
        OPLANS, Combat Forces Tasked and time line (A-5). Keep all remarks focused on the specific
        problem, and implications on other ongoing mission activity.
        3.9.2.3. Intelligence (A-2) and weather summaries. Keep all remarks focused on the specific
        problem. Keep discussion at a tactical level except for C2 issues.
        3.9.2.4. Key Decisions/LIMFAC review.
        3.9.2.5. Aircraft & Crew Status (A-4M/A-3).
        3.9.2.6. Immediate Force Protection concerns.
        3.9.2.7. Time, composition, and location for the follow-on briefings.
     3.9.3. 16 SOW/CC will release Battlestaff members as soon as possible to accomplish required initial
     actions, communicate with their troops, and to prepare for the Frag break session. Immediately fol-
     lowing the initial meeting, the WOC Director will confer with the 16 SOW/CC for a second review of
     the situation to ensure that all necessary decisions have been made. The WOC Director will then
     ensure all guidance is issued via BSD.
     3.9.4. An aircraft deployment tracker will be used to plot the progression of wing resources through-
     out the deployment process. This tracker will be populated by the A-3, A-4L, and A-4M. The Battle-
HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006                                                                          15


   staff Administrator will conduct quality control. Within one hour of activation, the A-3 will begin
   providing copies of these spreadsheets to the senior leadership prior to each Battlestaff meeting. The
   data will display during Battlestaff meetings at the 16 SOW/CC’s discretion.
       3.9.4.1. The deployment tracker will contain: chalk #, MDS, tail #, LFA, cargo assembly, cargo
       processing, cargo load, passenger assembly, passenger processing, passenger loading, crew alert,
       crew ready, ETD, ETA, ATD, ATA, and any other information deemed necessary by the WOC
       director.

3.10. Follow-On Briefings and Actions. The time interval between the initial and follow-on meetings
depends on the situation and will be determined by the 16 SOW/CC. The WOC Director will have a
default recommendation for meetings that support responses and will change this template as directed.
Briefing slides for initial and follow-on meetings will be kept on file in the Battlestaff area. The OPR will
deliver information for the briefings to the Battlestaff area through their A-Staff functional or via their
UCC. Inputs should be submitted 30 minutes prior to briefing time.

3.11. Daily Summary and Changeover Briefings. After the initial response when time permits, the
WOC Director will provide more detailed summary briefings and Battlestaff changeover briefings. These
briefings will include initial roll call and security screening followed by (this is not all inclusive):
   3.11.1. General situation. Changes since last update and priority issues.
   3.11.2. Weather. Quick recap with emphasis on changes since last update.
   3.11.3. A-2. Intel update with emphasis on developments since last update.
   3.11.4. A-3. Status of crews/missions in progress/planning efforts, reports from deployed LNOs,
   other components, and ISB/FSB staff elements, LIMFAC changes, issues, and concerns over timeline.
   3.11.5. A-4L. Status of deployment processing, airflow, issues, concerns over timeline, and status of
   support downstream.
   3.11.6. A-4M. Status of aircraft availability and generation; shortfalls/limfacs of aircraft, mainte-
   nance equipment or personnel.
   3.11.7. FP. Summary of Force Protection concerns, plans, and issues. Once briefed, this item will
   only be briefed as conditions change.
   3.11.8. A-6. Status of communications with emphasis on changes since last update.
   3.11.9. SRC Representative. Status of Hurlburt Field infrastructure and base as directed by 16 SOW/
   CC.
   3.11.10. WOC Director Summary. Review significant problem areas. Identify priority tasks for the
   next shift. Review questions and publish BSD recap of current status and new tasks/decisions. Con-
   firm time for next meeting.

3.12. Information Dissemination.
   3.12.1. The WOC Director will send a the Battlestaff Directive (BSD) format via hardcopy or e-mail
   to the UCCs as the primary means of communicating with subordinate units. Classified information
   will be transmitted via the SIPRNET/runner. The WOC will maintain a current list of the status of
   unit UCCs (capability as well as posture). Classified information will only be discussed via STUIII/
16                                                            HURLBURTFIELDI10-201 1 JUNE 2006


     STE, SIPRNET, or dispatched via courier with appropriate safeguards. Compartmented information
     will not be placed on the SIPRNET. All unit UCCs are required to notify Battlestaff when they are
     operational and each time they receive a BSD.
     3.12.2. The Battlestaff will disseminate all required information and tasking to Hurlburt units, the 8
     SOS, 9 SOS, 16 MXS, and 716 MXS, and 919th units if required via the UCCs. By exception, this
     flow of information may be offset to another C2 node, such as the DCC (for deployment related
     schedules of events (SOE), cargo movements, etc.) or MOC (for aircraft issues). The UCCs will be
     responsible for forwarding information received from the Battlestaff, DCC, or Survival Recovery
     Center to their unit leadership. The WOC will ensure that all appropriate information is relayed to
     both the Duke and Eglin command post or CAT as directed by 16 SOW/CC or WOC Director.
     3.12.3. In situations where the Survival Recovery Center (SRC) is activated and an on-scene com-
     mander has been designated, the WOC may broadcast the Disaster Control Group net in the Battle-
     staff area for situational awareness and to coordinate needed support.
     3.12.4. In the event of a LAN failure, telephone, or radio; a runner will be the alternate means of com-
     munication.

3.13. LERTCON Change Notification Procedures.
     3.13.1. In almost all situations, SOCOM will transmit a change in command LERTCON status,
     through HQ AFSOC, to the 16 SOW via Emergency Action Message (EAM). The WOC will imme-
     diately notify the WOC Director, 16 SOW/CC or CV of the receipt of an actual or exercise EAM.
     Exception: WOC-only exercises will be kept solely within the WOC. If secure voice is available,
     specific information contained in the EAM may be passed directly to the 16 SOW commander. The
     fact that a change in a LERTCON has occurred is classified and cannot be passed via non-secure
     means. If secure voice is not available, use the following voice format: “This is (name), Hurlburt
     WOC. We have received an urgent message that requires your immediate attention.” Additionally,
     the WOC controller will specifically advise the WOC Director that the Battlestaff recall is being initi-
     ated. The WOC Director will pass the LERTCON change to the Battlestaff members who will run
     their respective checklists, if applicable, and instruct agency work centers, via secure means, to com-
     plete their corresponding checklists. The WOC will not release the EAM in its original format. The
     controllers must convert the EAM to an emergency action summary (EAS) prior to release to the Bat-
     tlestaff Administrator and other personnel.
     3.13.2. When it becomes necessary to advise all other 16 SOW personnel of the LERTCON change,
     the following applies:
        3.13.2.1. Use the 16 SOW Battlestaff Recall Diagram (Figure 3.1.) to disseminate changes in
        LERTCON status. The WOC will notify Battlestaff members and instruct them to notify agency
        work centers via secure voice or in person, and to run checklists. The 16 SOW/CCE is responsible
        for ensuring 16 SOW staff agencies not listed in Figure 3.1. are notified. CAUTION: ANY
        CHANGE IN LERTCON (EXERCISE OR ACTUAL) IS CLASSIFIED, AND MAY ONLY BE
        PASSED BY SECURE MEANS. Each squadron/staff agency will in turn notify personnel of the
        LERTCON change.
        3.13.2.2. When the readiness action steps are completed, each UCC will report attainment or
        attainment progress via secure means to the Battlestaff. Use the following voice format: “Refer-
        ence (DTG from notification message). All actions for (UCC) completed at (DTG).” Report

       problems and delays (current or projected) in the same way. (The attainment progress report is
       classified and cannot be passed over a non-secure telephone). The WOC will prepare and forward
       attainment and attainment progress reports, when directed by the 16 SOW/CC or CV.
   3.13.3. Battlestaff functional managers will develop and maintain checklists, which reflect and sup-
   port 16 SOW readiness actions. Managers may include a set of instructions to assist staff agency per-
   sonnel in the completion of internal actions.
       3.13.3.1. The 16 SOW/WOC will review 16 SOW checklists annually to ensure checklists reflect
       all applicable headquarters readiness actions. Battlestaff functional managers will coordinate
       their list of applicable readiness actions and instructions with 16 SOW/WOC prior to publication.
       Review the lists and instructions semi-annually during the Battlestaff functional manager review
       of this HFI.
       3.13.3.2. Maintain one copy of each A-Staff functional area checklist in their respective continu-
       ity book.
       3.13.3.3. AFSOCI 10-202 Vol II (S) contains the basic guidance for preparation of checklists.

3.14. Message Preparation and Routing. Prepare all outgoing messages IAW AFP 102-2, United
States Message Text Format (USMTF).
   3.14.1. The 16 SOW/CC/CV or designate is the releasing authority for all outgoing messages gener-
   ated by the Battlestaff. Any agency taking actions will brief the WOC Director on the actions taken,
   and provide the WOC Director at least one copy of all correspondence generated (incoming and out-
   going).

3.15. Message Files. Incoming and outgoing messages must be carefully managed. For simplicity and to
assure continuity, the WOC Director will ensure that all hard-copy messages are tracked in a file.
Soft-copy traffic, both inbound and outbound, will be organized in a central file available to all Battlestaff
members through LAN in the information center share folders within the Battlestaff area and through a
SIPRNET web page available to deployed staff elements.

3.16. Battlestaff Release. The 16 SOW/CC may stand down the full A-Staff from 24-hour operations as
required. When the full A-staff is not required for 24-hour operations it will revert back to normal opera-
tions IAW Sec 1.5.

3.17. Spot Critique. Battlestaff procedures are refined through regular evaluation and practice. Battle-
staff training sessions will be scheduled once each month to review SOP and collect suggestions for
improvement. Wing “Focused Effort” exercises will be held to identify areas needing additional atten-
tion. During all of these events, the WOC Director will ensure that a soft copy of this HFI is available for
real-time update. All A-Staff primaries will ensure guidebooks and Battlestaff kits (home station or
deployed) are current and available on the LAN in the information center share folders.

                                     COMPUTER EQUIPMENT

A20.1. General. The WOC USES A adpe COMPUTER EQUIPMENT IN GARRISON. Deployed, (e.g.
HURCON or OPLAN) the USSOCOM provided TACLAN suite provides computer equipment (clients,
email, servers, storage etc) necessary for operations.

A20.2. All Files. Templates, forms, documents etc, necessary for operations must be placed on a portable
USB drive and deployed along with the TACLAN suite. The mission Information Manager (or CSA) will
assist in transferring the shared folder structure to the USB drive when a contingency/deployment is
imminent. Normally, the MIM maintains a USB drive populated with current folder structure for contin-
gencies and emergency evacuations. Additionally, the MIM will regularily review this information to
ensure accurate and updated files and documents.

A20.3. WOC Operating Locations and Equipment.
     A20.3.1. Primary Location. The primary location is in the WOC and communications equipment is
     comprised of ADP computer, audio, video, and network equipment. This equipment is setup and
     maintained by the Battlestaff Computer System Administrators (CSA) and supported by 16 CS.
     A20.3.2. Secondary Location. The secondary location is in the DCC facility. The WOC staff will
     need to carry WOC equipment to the secondary site and 16 CS will ensure enough infrastructure
     exists at the alternate site to operated for an extended period of time.
     A20.3.3. Deployed location. Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) is a mobile communications
     package supporting NIPR/SIPR/JWICS providing pre-built servers (Domain, Mail, File, Print, Data-
     base, and Web) and 50 client laptops for use at a deployed location. Presently, TACLAN does not
     have its own communication. The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) is a suite of servers, lap-
     tops, software and network gear. Hardware and software is funded and supported by USSOCOM. Its
     purpose is to provide one standardized SOF mission planning platform throughout USSOCOM (used
     primarily on SIPRNET and JWICS but, also has NIPRNET). The servers and laptops are pre-built
     with software needed to mission plan for SOF Air (PFPS, Falcon View, MIRC, etc.). Presently,
     TACLAN does not have its own communication pipe (long haul communications). While deployed
     this can be satisfied by using communication lines provided by a already existing host base or with
     Satellite Communications (SATCOM) provided in an S1 or S4 communications package. TACLAN
     is programmed to become part of the S4 package, and will have long haul communications capability.
     Coordination of the TACLAN deployable suite is through the A6.
     A20.3.4. For deployed operations, a Geospatial Product Library (GPL) is required to support mission
     planning. The GPL provides charts and imagery for detailed mission planning. The A2 is the respon-
     sible agency to provide a GPL for operations.
     A20.3.5. Deployed Manpower Requirements. The TACLAN suite requires Systems Administration
     support, a CSA, and a Mission Information Manager (MIM). The 16th Communications Squadron
     TDC Branch personnel (16CS/SCTT) will provide support. The MIM that deploys with the UTC will
     be responsible for information processes and setup/configuration of supporting C2 applications. The
     MIM will assist the CSA as necessary and will coordinate additional requirements through the A6.

Terms
Alert Order (CJCS)—A formal directive issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that follows
SecDef decision that a U.S. military response may be required; it gives essential guidance for planning in
the prevailing situation, and marks the beginning of Crisis Action Planning Phase V, execution planning.
Commander's Estimate of entire Situation—A logical process of reasoning by which a commander
considers the circumstances affecting the military situation and arrives at a decision as to a COA to be
taken to accomplish the mission. A Commander's Estimate that considers a military situation so far in the
future as to require major assumptions is called a Commander's Long Range Estimate of the Situation.
Deployment Preparation Order—An order issued by competent authority to prepare forces for
movement or to move forces (e.g. increase readiness posture of units).
Execution Order (CJCS)—An order issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the
authority and at the direction of the Secretary of Defense, to implement a SecDef decision to initiate
military operations.

Fragmentary Order—All abbreviated form of an operation order, usually issued on a day-to-day basis
that eliminates the need for restating information contained in a basic operation order.
LIMFAC—Any deficiency severely impacting mission accomplishment.
Planning Order (CJCS)—An order issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to initiate
execution planning. The order will normally follow a Commander's Estimate and will precede the (CJCS)
Alert Order. SecDef approval of a selected course of action is not required before a (CJCS) Planning
Order can be issued. Signals the start of Phase V in crisis action planning.
N-Hour—Established time for "official" notification of tasking. Contingency Response may begin prior
to N Hour establishment. Used during both contingency and exercise responses.
Shortfall—Any deficiency (personnel or equipment) inhibiting mission accomplishment.
Warning Order—A crisis action planning directive issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
that initiates the development and evaluation of COAs by a supported commander and requests that a
Commander's Estimate be submitted. Issued by authority of the Secretary of Defense when the order
involves movement of forces.
