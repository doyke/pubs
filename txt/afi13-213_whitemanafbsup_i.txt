                                             Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
     provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
     operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
     Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
     airfield.
     1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
     the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
     For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
     1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
     pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
     personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
     with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
     enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
     without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
     potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
     involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
     follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
     Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
     vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
     1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
     (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
     to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
     1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
     (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
     AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
        1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
        should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
        consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
        been in place and available resources.
        1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
        deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
        1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
        approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
        and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or

          3.2.7.5.3.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) Runway Lighting. Whiteman Air Force
          Base (AFB) runway lighting consists of runway edge lights, runway end lights,
          and runway threshold lights, which are used to outline the lateral and longitudinal
          limits of the usable surface of the runway. Runway edge lights, as depicted in
          Whiteman Attachment 10, Figure A10.9, are white in color and define the edge
          of the runway until the last 2,000 feet of the runway before the runway end, at
          which point they are white and yellow in color; the white lights always face the
          approach direction. Runway end lights are red in color define the end of the
          operational runway. Runway threshold lights are green in color to provide
          positive identification of the beginning of the operational runway surface. Refer
          to AFI 11-218, paragraphs 3.9.1 – 3.9.3, for additional information on these

     traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or
     ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a
     radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely
     as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to
     advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway,
     should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait
     for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know
     and comply with the following signals:
     3.2.7.10. (WHITEMAN) Vehicle operators will be trained on and comply with control
     tower light gun signals IAW AFI 13-213, paragraph 3.2.7.10, and have AFVA 11-240
     affixed in all vehicles that operate on the airfield.

   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the “microphone
   button”, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   “stuck mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your

intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT
                                      (point/intersection).
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway)

                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

ATCT:                                  “AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

   4.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the ATCT.

4.5. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P, the
international aviation industry uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example,
Taxiway B would be referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle operators must know

Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in

1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
