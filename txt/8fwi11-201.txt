1. Quiet Hour Requests. Coordinate through the 8 OG/CC NLT two weeks in advance.
     1.1. Two types of quiet hours:
        1.1.1. Full Quiet Hours: Takeoffs, landings, low approaches, touch and goes, stop and
        goes, engine runs, turbine powered AGE runs and taxiing anywhere on the airfield are
        prohibited.
        1.1.2. Partial Quiet Hours: Same as paragraph 1.1.1. above, except full stop landings via
        straight-in approach, taxiing of aircraft, engine starts, and AGE runs are permitted.
     1.2. Quiet hours are normally limited to 30 minutes commencing with the scheduled start
     time of the event. Whenever possible, events requiring full quiet hours will be scheduled
     early in the morning, late in the afternoon, or on non-flying days to minimize the impact on
     flying operations. Variations on the quiet hours policy are approved on a case-by-case basis
     by the 8 OG/CC.
     1.3. Units will exercise discretion when requesting quiet hours. Full quiet hours are only for
     change of command ceremonies of colonels and higher or special events which involve the
     whole 8 FW. Partial quiet hours are limited to squadron change of command ceremonies or
     smaller special events.
     1.4. Due to the 8 FW flying training requirements, units should be flexible with the dates and
     times of their requests. This will allow the 8 FW to accommodate the unit’s needs.
     1.5. Korean Air and Eastar are exempt from all quiet hours.
2. Quiet Hour Scheduling.
     2.1. NLT two weeks prior to the event, 8 FW agencies will submit Quiet Hour Requests
     electronically to 8 OSS/OSOS, 782-5202. 8 OSS/OSOS will coordinate requests with the 8
     OG/CC through electronic coordination (See Attachment 2).
        2.1.1. 8 OSS/OSOS will de-conflict quiet hours with local flying and coordinate with 8
        OSS/OSA. 8 OSS/OSA will de-conflict requests with transient and civil aircraft
        operations. 8 OSS/OSA will coordinate Quiet Hour Requests with the Republic of Korea
        Air Force (ROKAF) (38 FG Command Post, 782-4025).
        2.1.2. 8 OSS/OSOS will forward the approved Quiet Hours Request to 8 OSS/OSA, 35
        FS/DO, and 80 FS/DO via email. It will include date, time, and type of approved quiet
        hours, along with any variations to the standard policy. 8 OSS/OSA will publish the
        appropriate NOTAM as required.
