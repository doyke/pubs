SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change reflects new requirements for management of the Information Security
Program at all echelons; transfers responsibility for Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information;
reflects the transfer of Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) duties and responsibilities
from the Chief, Security Forces or installation security official to the Chief of Information
Protection at MAJCOM and installation levels and codifies staff office changes from that action;
updates locations possible for overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases; updates
references and deletes terms not used in the text; updates glossary of references and supporting
information (Attachment 1); updates transmission procedures for unclassified controlled nuclear
information (Attachment 2); deletes use of United States Postal System registered mail or
Express Mail to transfer Secret or Confidential material (Attachment 4). An asterisk (*)
indicates newly revised material.

(TINKERAFB) This supplement is extensively revised to line up with the latest Air Force
Instruction concerning Information Security Program Management.

                                             Chapter 1

                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and
destroy its classified and unclassified information and material consistent with national policy.
This general policy statement also applies to unclassified controlled information (Attachment 2)
under the purview of relevant statutes, regulations and directives [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C1.1.]
1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the
Information Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by
delegating authority to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk
management principles; focusing on identifying and protecting only that information that
requires protection; integrating security procedures into our business processes so that they
become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands their security roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in
its infrastructure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of
our security policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support
of commanders at all levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information
Security Program Manager (ISPM) and security manager system. Both play an integral role in
ensuring unit personnel know and understand their role in protecting classified information
against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.2.]
     1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air
     Force (SAF/ AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for
     ensuring implementation of the Information Security Program.
     1.3.2. Air Force Program Manager. The Director, Information Protection (SAF/AAP) is
     responsible for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of this program.
     1.3.3. Commanders of Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs),
     Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Installations. These commanders are responsible for:
        1.3.3.1. Establishing information security programs.
        1.3.3.2. Identifying requirements.
        1.3.3.3. Executing their programs to comply with this policy.
     1.3.4. The installation Chief of the Information Protection (IP) Office (IPO) or MAJCOM
     Director, Information Protection is designated the ISPM at each Air Force installation or site.
     Air Force Chiefs of Information Protection:
     1.3.4. (TINKERAFB) The 72d Air Base Wing Vice Commander (72 ABW/CV) has
     delegated the position of Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) at TAFB to the
     Chief, Information Protection Office (72 ABW/IP), who implements the Information
     Security Program. 72 ABW/IP provides instruction, guidance and interpretation for
     implementing the DoD/AF Information Security Program for TAFB personnel.

          security programs performed by an ISPM, or designated representative(s) on a
          subordinate ISPM or security manager. It is a non-rated review for policy and
          program effectiveness to benchmark processes/products, identify problem areas and
          corrective actions. A key component of the ISPR is an assessment of the effectiveness
          of the information security training program.

   conducted every two years for activities or units that do not store classified information.
   1.4.2. (TINKERAFB) The ISPM has delegated authority to the 72 ABW Information
   Security (IPI) to conduct annual program reviews. NOTE: There will be no exceptions to
   annual reviews. Reviews will cover protection of collateral classified only and will not be
   rated. Reviewers use a random sampling method. A discrepancy is defined as any
   observation or condition that, left unchanged, would likely result in a security incident or
   other action/inaction that could seriously degrade the security program. Special Access
   Program (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) classified information
   security programs are reviewed within their respective channels.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      15

   annual security self-inspections in March and September. The Information Security,
   Personnel Security and Industrial Security checklists to be used can be found on the Tinker
   AFB SASM SharePoint. The SM will monitor semiannual security self-inspections to ensure
   they are conducted on time and be available to advise and assist the inspector(s). The
   inspection file maintained in the handbook will contain a copy of the inspector‘s appointment
   letter, a copy of the inspection report with endorsement by the Commander/Staff Agency
   Chief or equivalent and a copy of the inspector‘s completed checklists. Ensure reports
   address the status of the security program and corrective actions to be completed.
      1.4.3.1. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will appoint an
      individual, in writing, other than the unit security manager to conduct a semiannual

2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information
Security Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
   2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be
   expected to cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and
   that the interests of the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the
   Information Security Program to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who
   have been specifically delegated the authority to do so, have received training in the exercise
   of this authority, and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information
   [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
        2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that
        classification guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans
        or other memoranda.
        2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification
        decisions.
        2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs‘ decision must be rendered verbally due
        to the priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within
        seven days.
        2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
        2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony
        in courts of law concerning classification of national security information and be
        prepared to defend and justify their original decisions.
   2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or
   for, or is under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered
   for classification only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO
   12958, as amended.
2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating
in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material
consistent with the markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily
consists of a classified document or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all
cleared personnel can perform derivative classification.
   2.3.1. Originating Agency‘s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an
   approved marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that
   have been created after October 14, 1995.
   2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any
   originally classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
   2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that
   contains OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following
   information in the Declassify On line:
      DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is applicable)
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                        21


         Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)

   2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date
   of the source document.
2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal
   violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person,
   organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of
   information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security [Reference
   EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD 5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security
   Guidance 16 April 2004].
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information
   requested under the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO
   12958, as amended, should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]
2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or
   unnecessarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or
   equivalent, staff agency chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over
   the information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain
   classified until a final resolution is reached.
2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7
   for sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate
   declassification instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the
   classified system, plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing
       address, organizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions
       regarding the classification guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be
       downgraded, or not to be declassified.
22                                   AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


     2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and,
     when useful, specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one
     level of classification will be annotated for each element of information.)
     2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the
     applicable classification category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
     2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
     2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic
     declassification pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification
     provisions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of
     information to be exempted from declassification to include:
         2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when
         citing the exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable
         statute, treaty or international agreement; and
         2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5.
  2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
     2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification
     guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of
     their information. NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing
     classification guidance in other forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans,
     system protection guides, AFIs. In these cases, the applicable publication will be
     considered the guide and the publishing requirements in paragraph 3.3 still apply.
     2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4 below) their security
     classification guides to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information
     section:
         2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be
         taken when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or
         unprotected World Wide Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned
         approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed for such release
         must ensure that it is not susceptible to compilation with other information to render
         sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The search and data mining
         capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk management
         perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or
         unprotected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication
         according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any
         doubts, do not release the information.
     2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before
     final approval.
     2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as
     circumstances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                   23


     changes implemented by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force
     classification/declassification guides will be reviewed no later than 31 December 2005,
     and every five years thereafter.
     2.6.2.4. (TINKERAFB) 72 ABW/IP will notify the OPR when the five-year review is
     required. Coordinate OC-ALC Security Classification Guide (SCG) actions through 72
     ABW/IP. Program managers must ensure that copies of SCGs (changes, reviews and
     related correspondence) are provided to 72 ABW/IP.
  2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
     2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the
     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed
     the guide, the document will be sent to SAF/AAP who will forward it to the ISCAP for
     approval.
     2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/
     declassification guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center
     (DTIC) using DD Form 2024. DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to
     SAF/AAP        at     SAF.AAP.workflow@pentagon.af.mil         and     AFDO        at
     AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of all Air
  Force classification/declassification guides and will provide guides made available on the
  MOSIAC SIPRNET Community of Practice (CoP). Guides are also located on the DTIC
  web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC account. The URL for this is
  http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy
  (DoE) issue joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear
  weapons. The Air Force issues security classification policy for information relating to
  nuclear weapons. Most of these products are classified and users will require the appropriate
  security clearance before accessing them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE
  classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users forward requests for copies of these
  guides to SAF/AAP (1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through
  command IP channels. Requests must include the name, address, and phone number of the
  activity POC, and the POC‘s level of access. IPs will validate this information before
  submitting the requests to SAF/AAP. For all other Air Force or other agency guides, go
  direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD Index of Security Classification
  Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons classification guidance
  are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                            Chapter 3

               DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the
authority to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive
Number 1, Section 2001.21(3)(i).
   3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the
   duration of protection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO
   Directive Number 1, Section2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified,
   original classifiers will determine which of the following four declassification instructions
   will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declassification instruction that will result in
   the shortest duration of classification.
       3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to
       identify such a date or event;
       3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
   3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The ―Declassify on‖ line must include one of the
   following:
       3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
       3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995);
       3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003);
       3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
       3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).
3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD
or FRD are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date.
RD must be reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents
containing FRD prior to release.
3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force
activities that possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years
old or older should have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec
2006.
3.4. (TINKERAFB)Activities that possess classified information, which is 25 years old or
older and of permanent historical value, will perform declassification reviews
annually. Date of review along with initials of personnel conducting review will be annotated
on the back of the document. Documents no longer of value should be destroyed.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      25


   3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force
   Declassification Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3
   of EO 12958, as amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old
   or older as of 31 December 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have
   permanent historical value. The Air Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web
   site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm). It is critical that records management and
   information security personnel work together to ensure that requirements of both are met on
   classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or Federal Records
   Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year
   that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the
   exemption categories (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved
   through the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security
   classification/declassification guide. (See paragraph 2.6 and Attachment 7). The Air Force
   has an approved list of exemption categories (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan);
   however, the specific item must still be annotated in the security classification/
   declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For original
   classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than ―25X1-human,‖ is permitted on the
   ―declassify on‖ line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event
   less than 10 years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking ―25X1-
   human.‖ This marking may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected
   to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the
   only 25X marking that does not require a date or event for declassification to be cited with
   the 25X marking.
3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough
   specificity to allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air
   Force Appellate Authority for MDRs.
3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for
conducting systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These
   records will be reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification.
   3.6.1. (TINKERAFB) All units will conduct an annual review of all classified holdings
   prior to the twenty-fifth anniversary of records original classification date between 1-15
   August of each year. The data collected will be included as part of the SF 311 reporting.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting
   declassification reviews for all other classified records.
 26                                    AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


   3.6.2. (TINKERAFB) All units will conduct an annual declassification review of all
   classified holdings 1-15 August of each year. The data collected will be included as part of
   the SF 311 reporting.
3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as
amended, Section 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34,
and has been referred to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for
processing Air Force referrals. Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found
in the Air Force Declassification Plan.
3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it
has been approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.
The same holds true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet
site that can be accessed by the public.
3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate
when the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be
properly protected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the
information and has authority over the information may downgrade information.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      27

                                FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA

     “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as
     Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic Energy Act, 1954
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.
4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69,
United States Implementation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and
procedures contained in C-M(2002)49 and it‘s supporting directives take precedence, where they
conflict, over the guidelines expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.
4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification
   designations. Moreover, many foreign governments and international organizations have a
   fourth level of classification that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of
   unclassified information that is protected by law in the originating country and is provided on
   the condition that it will be treated "in confidence." A table of U.S. and foreign government
   classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify
   the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification
   designation has been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable
   U.S. English language designation, only the identity of the originating country need be
   applied to the document. Examples:
    A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU SECRET.
    A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR SECRET.

   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a
 30                                  AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


   DOD Component on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked
   to identify the originating government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in
   confidence." Additionally, they shall be marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling".
   Example:
               A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte‖ would be marked:

FRENCH                             RESTRICTED                                INFORMATION
Protect as:
CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling
       4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI
       provided in confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government
       unclassified information provided in confidence), such information must be classified
       under EO 12958, as amended. Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least
       equivalent to that required by the foreign government or international organization that
       provided the information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the
       protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following requirements
       shall be met:
          4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
          need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
          4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling
          instructions.
          4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.
4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
   4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature
   declassification or unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that
   contain FGI shall be marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
   (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to
   identify the classification level and the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the
   identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the cover or first page of the document
   shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
   INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI together with the
   appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
   maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
   4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification
   sources. If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line
   shall contain the marking "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the
   foreign government will be maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A
   U.S. document shall not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the
   document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that
   originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      31


   shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document to the originating
   foreign government.
   4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall
   be marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO
   information (e.g., NS). When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED
   information is included in otherwise unclassified DOD documents, the following statement
   shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the page containing the information: “This page
   contains (indicate NATO or country of origin) RESTRICTED information”. The
   restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The cover, (or first page, if no
   cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This document contains
   NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of source) and
   shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69".
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to
   identify the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided
   to a DOD component, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether
   they are restricted or provided in confidence.
4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original
classified audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include
footers/headers showing the applicable classification markings. However, the required
classification markings must be placed on the outside of the container and reel. All copies made
from the original tapes must include headers/footers that show the applicable classification
markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is not inadvertently erased
during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]
4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP
Media Classification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708,
Confidential ADP Media Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP
Data Descriptor Label, on removable information systems storage media. These are available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs
5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that
   precludes application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must
   be permanently marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions
   upon, and prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage
   media for classified systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or
   destruction, procedures for unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing
   takes place. Personally owned information systems storage media are prohibited in areas
   where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using
   them for storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for
 32                                    AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


   accidental loss must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these
   procedures in the semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.
4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented
   Information, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of
   SCI. The Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the
   Dissemination of Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy
   provide criteria for release of intelligence to foreign officials.
4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep
2004, subject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
   4.10.1. ―REL TO‖ identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to
   be releasable based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign
   disclosure official or has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures
   and channels, to the foreign country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
   4.10.2. ―REL TO‖ cannot be used with ―Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals‖ (NOFORN)
   on page markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions,
   NOFORN takes precedence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
   4.10.3. The full marking ―REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international
   organization or coalition force tetragraph‖ shall be used after the classification and will
   appear at the top and bottom of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one,
   the first page and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. ―REL TO‖ must include
   country code ―USA‖ as the first country code listed. After the USA, country trigraphic code
   shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international organization/coalition
   tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
   4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code
   separated by a space, a lower case ―and‖ and a space. EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO
   USA, EGY and ISR.
   4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different
   from the countries listed in the ―REL TO‖ at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is
   releasable to all the countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked
   ―REL‖. EXAMPLE: (TS//REL).
   4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the
   overall ―REL TO‖ marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific
   countries/organizations listed alphabetically. EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is
   ‗SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.‖ However, the portion marking may be:
   (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that information contained in this
   portion is also releasable to Australia.
   4.10.7. ―NOFORN‖ is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW
   DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use
   the ―NOFORN‖ dissemination control marking on any document, including derivatively
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                        33


   classified documents, without first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and
   that the marking is actually warranted.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   3166 trigraphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.
4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail).
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or
   unclassified, will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not
   be transmitted on the NIPRNET.
   4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of
   the e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified.
   Following this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
   Example: Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
   4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an
   unclassified network.
   4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the
   classification marking and the text.
   4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion
   marking. Use the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and
   subparagraphs.
   4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion
   markings. Indicate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated
   classification symbol in parentheses before the attachment icon.
   4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the
   signature block on the left margin.

                                      SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for
safeguarding classified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording,
or removing, for any unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is
prohibited.
   5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing
   means to quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or
   transmission devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information
   increases the risk to that information.
   5.1.1. (TINKERAFB) Use or possession of any non-NSA approved secure wireless
   technology (devices) used for storing, processing and/or transmitting information is strictly
   prohibited in areas where classified information is electronically stored, processed, discussed
   or transmitted unless approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA) in
   consultation with the Cognizant Security Authority (CSA) and Certified TEMPEST
   Technical Authority (CTTA).
   5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas
   containing Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial
   Wireless Devices, Services, and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global
   Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information
when required for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance
eligibility according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF
312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the
information. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator‘s approval
before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the originator of
the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1 of this AFI. [References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO
12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
5.2. (TINKERAFB)In organizations that store classified information, commanders and
supervisors must designate as a minimum: one security container custodian and one alternate;
one area checker and one alternate. The written designations will be acknowledged by signature.
Training for newly appointed custodians is provided on the Tinker AFB SASM SharePoint.
   5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with
   Top Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented
   information to make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The
   verbal attestation must be witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                       35


   presides over the attestation and manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The
   procedures for personal attestation include:
       5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the
       Organization block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
       5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF
       312. The witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the
       Acceptance block.
       5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
   5.2.2. Confirm an individual‘s access level. The holder of the information must confirm
   valid need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access
   to classified information will confirm a person's access level by:
   5.2.2. (TINKERAFB) Custodians are responsible for verifying security clearance level,
   need to know and that a Standard Form 312 has been signed prior to granting access.5.2.2.4.
   (Added) At a minimum custodians must annually change combinations of classified storage
   containers for which they are responsible.
       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person
       signed the SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or
       supervisor. See paragraph 5.5 for further guidance.
5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access
(see paragraph 5.2). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for
ensuring their employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee‘s personnel
records. If they have not signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified
Information Nondisclosure Agreement (Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people
on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through JPAS prior to sending the signed form for
retention. NOTE: When the employee‘s access level is passed to another office or activity, that
office or activity can assume the employee has signed one.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will
   retain the NdAs for 50 years.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21,

      5.3.1.5. For persons outside the Executive Branch who receive access according to
      paragraph 5.4, the servicing ISPM to the activity granting access will file the NdA.
   5.3.2. Refusal To Sign. When a person refuses to sign an NdA, the commander or
   equivalent, or staff agency chief:
      5.3.2.1. Initiates security incident report, in JPAS, that the person refused to sign the
      NdA.
      5.3.2.2. Denies the individual access to classified information.
      5.3.2.3. Initiate actions to establish a Security Information File (SIF) according to AFI
      31-501.
5.4. Access by Persons Outside the Executive Branch.

   authorize individuals outside the executive branch to access Air Force classified material as
   follows unless otherwise provided in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.2.2.
      5.4.1.1. Authorizing Officials (those cited in paragraph 5.4.1 above) may grant access
      once they have:
          5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information.
          Normally, this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2 below.
          5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security
          investigation as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check
          (LFC) shows there is no unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC
          must be processed according to AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is
          no current personnel security investigation as defined in AFI 31-501,
          MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request a National Agency
          Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is complete
          when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
          (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS.
          When applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501,
          paragraph 3.11. for interim security clearance eligibility.

  5200.1-R, C6.2.2.4.]
     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be
     processed only in exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access
     will be granted to the researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available
     declassification processes (i.e., the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access
     clearly supports the interests of national security.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
38                                  AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the
         access. The application will fully describe the project including the sources of
         documentation that the researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation
         security forces office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC
         according to AFI 31-501.
         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves
         access, the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and
         manuscript(s) for security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure
         the documents do not contain any classified information and, if so, determine if they
         can be declassified. Send the SF 312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified
         information will not be removed from government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
             5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is
             possible. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in
             the months before the end of the original agreement.
             5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
             5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential
             information but does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP
             information. Access to Top Secret or SCI information is not authorized.
             5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO,
             AFHRA, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
             5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating
             offices in the Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing
             by the originating offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the
             researcher to secure this approval.
  5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making
  positions to which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon
  departure from office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S.
  Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information they
  originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that was addressed to them while serving in their
  official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.5.]
     5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the
     interests of national security;
     5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4 of
     this AFI;
     5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force
     OCA has classification jurisdiction;
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      39


       5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the
       custody of the NARA; and,
       5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual‘s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit
       any notes and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that
       the documents do not contain classified information or to determine if any classified
       information should be declassified.
   5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information
   regarding the release of classified information in litigation.
   5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1 above. [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.2.2.7.]
   5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of
   classified information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international
   organizations only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting
   classified information to foreign governments.
   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These
   individuals need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or
   JPAS. (see paragraph 5.3.1.3).
5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD
and DOD contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security
clearance information unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
5.5. (TINKERAFB)JPAS will be used for confirming access eligibility. Visit authorization
memos will be used only when JPAS is unavailable. Prior to allowing a foreign national access
to the installation, the visit must be approved by the Foreign Disclosure Policy Office (OC-
ALC/FDO).
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee
   requires access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the
       office to be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE
       Form 5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted
       Data. Also see paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority
   for visits to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel,
   including DOD contractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff
   agency chiefs receiving a visit request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government,
       process the visit request according to AFI 16-201.
 40                                    AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for
guidance on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in
personal or commercial articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general
publication or distribution.
5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders
allow access under the rules of the originating agency.
5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with
   Top Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These
   procedures ensure stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our
   most critical and sensitive information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and
   disposes of such administrative records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
       5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or
       equivalents, and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch
       Top Secret material establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control
       Officer (TSCO), with one or more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff
       agency chief will notify the installation ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the
       names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form143, Top Secret Register Page, to
       account for each document (to include page changes and inserts that have not yet been
       incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or equipment to include
       IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs must either
       describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach a
       list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost
       or stolen. EXCEPTIONS:
           5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret
           messages kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30
           days. Instead, use message delivery registers or other similar records of
           accountability.
           5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don‘t use AF Forms 143
           as a receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts
           suffice for accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims
           Records Disposition Schedule. NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long
           as all of the required information is included in the information system.
       5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
           5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover
           Sheet, as the disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret
           material. Each person that accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the
           form prior to initial access.
           5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several
           hundred documents) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the
           material. NOTE: This applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and
           appropriately cleared personnel identified on an access roster.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                   41


        5.8.1.2.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Remove the AF Form 144, TOP SECRET Access
        Record and Cover Sheet when Top Secret (TS) material is destroyed, downgraded or
        declassified and retain it with the inactive records IAW the AFRIMS Records
        Disposition Schedule. If the TS material is transferred to another Top Secret Control
        Account (TSCA), send the AF Form 144 with the material.
     5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
     chiefs:
        5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret
        material in the account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in
        TSCOs. These officials must be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of
        the TSCA being inventoried. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top
        Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies resolved, and its status is correctly
        reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
        5.8.1.3.1. (TINKERAFB) Conduct annual inventories as of 31 December each year.
        Do not inventory material received or disposition entries after 31 December. The
        incoming TSCO may conduct the inventory prior to assuming responsibility for the
        TSCA. Contractor employees may not conduct the inventory for a government
        organization.
        5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the
        inventory report.
        5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are
        maintained with the account.
        5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material
        in repositories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents
        and material be limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated
        below. If account discrepancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff
        agency chief must determine if the random sample percentage method will suffice or
        if a higher percentage inventory will be accomplished. If the higher percentage
        inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will increase by no less than 20 percent.
           5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret
           documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top
           Secret documents.
42                                  AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


             5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top
             Secret documents.
             5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top
             Secret documents.
             5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top
             Secret documents.
             5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret
             documents.
     5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability
     requirements prescribed by the AFSAPCO.
     5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring
     Top Secret material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
     5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy
     of the main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the
     register page and disclosure record will be faxed along with the document to the
     addressee. The addressee will sign and return them immediately to the sender for
     inclusion in the TSCA.
     5.8.1.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) TSCA Records Maintenance. The TSCO will maintain
     a TS Control Log consisting of the following records:
         5.8.1.7.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Letter establishing the TSCA.
         5.8.1.7.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) Appointment record for primary and each
         alternate TSCO.
         5.8.1.7.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Copy            of   the   TSCO     Roster   (listing   of
         TSCAs/TSCOs on base).
         5.8.1.7.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Active records. AF Form 143, TOP SECRET
         Register Page, to document receipt of TS documents or material and to show change
         actions performed.
         5.8.1.7.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Inactive records. AF Form 143 to document final
         action taken to dispose of the TS documents or material by transfer or destruction.
         5.8.1.7.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) The last annual inventory report.
  5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for
  internal control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution
  system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
  5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked
  to do so by the originating activity.
  5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for
  receipting requirements.
  5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims
  Records Disposition Schedule.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                        43


   5.8.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) Classified Custodians should (highly suggested) maintain an
   inventory sheet on all materials/items classified as ―secret” or “confidential” which are
   stored within the security container. An inventory of all classified holdings should be
   conducted annually and/or when a change in safe custodians occurs. The inventory should
   be conducted in conjunction with the annual clean out date and documented.

Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
       5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret
       Cover Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2
       above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
       5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF
       Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through
       the Air Force Publications Distribution system.
       5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services
       Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage
       rooms.
       5.9.1.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Organizations will establish emergency procedures for
       protection of classified information in the event of fire, natural disaster, bomb threat or
       enemy action. Classified information/material must be protected at all times when it is
       removed from the security container.
           5.9.1.4.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) In any emergency situation, the individual
           working with classified material must ensure the material is protected until the
           situation is over. If possible, the individual should return the material to the security
           container and make sure the container is locked.
           5.9.1.4.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) If delaying to secure classified material would
           jeopardize personal safety, the individual will keep the classified material in his/her
           possession and immediately notify the SM and/or supervisor.
           5.9.1.4.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) If the emergency situation prevents returning the
           classified material to the security container, the SM, supervisory personnel or higher
           authority will make storage arrangements.
   5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault
   may preclude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
   5.9.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Ensure that the door to the room where classified
   information will be processed remains closed. When working with classified information a
   notification ―Classified Work In Progress,” will be posted outside the door.
5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or
generates classified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified
material is stored appropriately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each
working day and record them on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if
 44                                   AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010


the container was not opened that day. The ―Checked By‖ column of the SF 702 does not require
end-of-day documentation. Activities that are continuously staffed will establish local procedures
to provide for daily security checks. Document those daily security checks on the SF 701. Note:
Additional security and safety checks may be added in the blanks on the SF 701. All security
containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (TINKERAFB)End-of-Day Security Checks. The unit‘s security operating instruction,
signed by the unit commander, 2-letter chief or equivalent, will include written procedures for
conducting end-of-day security checks and directing office chiefs to designate a time and appoint
personnel, in writing, to accomplish those checks.
   5.10.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Every organization that processes/handles classified
   information must perform end-of-the day security checks. End-of- the day security checks
   will be accomplished every duty day, Standard Form 701, Activity Security Checklist.
   Destroy when superseded or no longer needed.
   5.10.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) Standard Form 702, Security Container Check Sheet, will
   be annotated every duty day regardless whether the container was opened. It will be
   annotated ―NOT OPENED,‖ then the ―Checked By‖ will be initialed and dated. The same
   individual who signs the ―Opened By‖ and ―Closed By‖ blocks on the SF 702, will not sign
   the ―Checked By‖ block unless no additional personnel are on duty. Destroy when
   superseded or no longer needed.
   5.10.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Those activities continuously staffed (24 hr operations) will
   account for all classified material upon each shift change and establish unit guidance on
   documenting the accountability within the unit operating instruction.
5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
   5.11.1. SECAF and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from
   designated working areas. Requesters send requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing
   Secret and Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C63.7.2.]
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up
   the classified container and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]
5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed
   awareness program ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers,
   and billeting staff are aware of the availability.
   5.12.1. (TINKERAFB) Visitors to offices on TAFB will use storage facilities in the host's
   office or host will make arrangements for overnight storage of hand carried material. If a
   visitor carrying classified material is scheduled to arrive after normal duty hours, a
   representative from the host activity will meet the individual and ensure the material is
   secured.
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      45


   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-
   processing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security
   container and the in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.
5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200. 1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of
   meetings, conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall
   be limited to appropriately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor
   locations. Auditoriums, assembly halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public
   gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be used for a classified meeting at which
   Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even though it is located on a portion
   of the contractor‘s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the
   need to establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally,
   secure conference or classified training facilities are only established at locations where
   frequent classified meetings or forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store
   classified information, secure construction requirements are not mandated. However, if
   installation commanders or their designees determine the local threat and security
   environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
       5.13.2.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Activities hosting classified meetings and conferences
       will ensure appropriate security measures are taken to protect classified information
       discussed. The facility must afford security against unauthorized access, from both
       physical intruders and sound emissions. The hosting activity is responsible for all actions
       associated with conducting a classified meeting on base. The hosting official will
       coordinate security requirements through the activity‘s SM. The hosting official will
       establish entry control and, when necessary, obtain perimeter area surveillance by posting
       personnel from the hosting activity. NOTE: 72d Security Forces do not provide this
       function. The hosting official will instruct individuals to remove electronic devices such
       as pagers, cell phones and Blackberries prior to entry. For additional assistance, a
       handout for in-house classified meetings/conferences is located on the Tinker AFB
       SASM SharePoint.
   5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of
   Classified and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for specific guidance.

      container as described in paragraph 5.14.2.2. Lock all aircraft egress points or secure
      them from the inside. Seal the aircraft with tamper proof seals such as evidence tape,
      numerically accountable metal, or plastic seals.
      5.14.5.2. If the aircraft can be locked and sealed but there is no storage container,
      remove all removable classified material and store it in an approved security container in
      an authorized U.S. facility. Classified components (e.g., AAR 47, ALE 47, etc.) may be
      stored in a locked and sealed aircraft.
      5.14.5.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and sealed and no storage container is available,
      off-load all classified material and components to an approved security container in an
      authorized U.S. facility.
      5.14.5.4. If none of the above criteria can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide
      continuous surveillance. Foreign national personnel cleared by their government may be
      used if all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to
      the host nation by a cognizant foreign disclosure authority.

  replaced with those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the
  most sensitive information according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
  5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it
  may be necessary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or
  vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be
  constructed IAW DOD 5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to
  preclude unauthorized access. Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an
  appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified material/information
  within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall
  be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure
  to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. The nature of the
  classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may preclude the use of
  cover sheets.

                        TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
   6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand
   carrying classified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in
   critical situations. Whenever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for
   relaying the data, e.g., mail through secure channels or through approved secure electronic
   means. Authorizing officials must assess the risk before authorizing the hand carrying of
   classified material. Some factors to consider during the risk assessment process are:
       6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the
       chances of the material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing
       AFOSI office should be able to assist in determining the risks associated with the
       environment.
       6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the
       United States if the information was compromised.
       6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight
       layovers, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military
       installation or other government facility.
       6.1.1.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) When hand carrying classified material from one
       building to another on TAFB, the classified material must be carried in a sealed folder
       identifying it as classified (Level). The folder is required to be placed in some type of
       sealed container which is not marked as classified and does not make it obvious that the
       contents are classified. When classified material is removed from the installation,
       individuals must have in their possession an approved courier letter.
   6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop
   computers are an especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When
   using laptops to handcarry classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks
   are prepared according to paragraph 6.6.3 In addition, as required for all classified material,
   couriers must take special care to ensure laptops and disks are kept under constant
   surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
   6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation
   Policy. SAF/AAP establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and
   transportation of classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation
   commanders approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and
   procedures provide adequate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel
   may acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC
AFI31-401_TINKERAFBSUP_I 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                      57


   information and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201,
   AFI 33-211, AFI33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
   6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to
   owners of other agency information to request permission to release the information outside
   the DoD [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]
6.2. Transmission and Transporting Top Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.2.]
   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via
   electronic means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8 [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier
   service [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport
   classified material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]
      6.2.3.1. Transporting classified material through or within countries hostile to the United
      States or any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic
      pouch. Personnel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local
      military postal office.
6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
      6.3.1.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Accountable Mail Section. The 72 ABW/SCOSD is
      designated as the base facility to receive and dispatch all Secret and Confidential material
      via the United States Postal System. Each commander or staff agency chief will
      designate personnel who are authorized to receipt for classified and/or accountable
      material.
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
   overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
   DOD Components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
   Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico when overnight
   delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the conditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R,
   paragraph C7.1.3.3, have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.3.]
   6.3.2. (TINKERAFB) Also comply with guidance provided by the Official Mail Program,
   DoDI 4525.8, AF Supplement, DoD Official Mail Management and DoDM 4525.8 AFMAN
   33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual.

          6.3.2.1.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) US Postal Service (USPS) Registered Mail,
          USPS Express Mail, GSA approved carrier for overnight delivery have been
          authorized to transport secret and confidential material addressed to other DoD
          activities within the CONUS. Use of these carriers will be when it is the most cost
          effective way to meet program requirements. Personnel should be aware that all
          incoming shipments from any of these carriers could contain classified material.
          Internal procedures should be developed to ensure only properly cleared individuals
          sign for incoming shipments from any of the listed carriers. NOTE: FedEx
          Corporation was awarded October 6, 2006 a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for
          Express and Ground Domestic Delivery Services (ExGDDS).
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery
      of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when
      overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service.
      However, classified COMSEC information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled
      Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified
      material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures
      that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend.
      However, the security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the
      receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared
      person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that
      he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.
   6.3.3. For more information on protective security service carriers see DOD 5220.22-R,
   Industrial Security Regulation, AFI 31-601, AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air
   Force Materiel, and AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.8.]

   electronic means from the supporting Information Assurance office.
6.4. Transmitting Confidential Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.4.]
   6.4.1. Since first class mail bearing the ―Return Service Requested‖ notice is an option for
   transmitting Confidential material, recipients must protect it as Confidential material unless
   they determine the contents are unclassified. EXCEPTION: Official Mail Center (OMC) and
   Activity Distribution Offices (ADO) will comply with the provisions of DOD 4525.8-M/AF
   Sup.
   6.4.1. (TINKERAFB) After delivery to organizations by Base Information Transfer System
   (BITS) or other courier means, protect all First Class (marked "Return Service Requested"),
   Registered and Certified mail and approved GSA carrier packages as classified until
   determined unclassified.

   be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the
   suspected disclosure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and
   disciplinary action to be taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]
9.2. Definitions.
   9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as
   defined in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
       9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
           9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure
           of classified information.
           9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the
           requirements of this order or its implementing directives.
           9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as
           amended.
       9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the
       requirements of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
   9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have
   had access to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals
   with the appropriate security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
   9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official
   concludes that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a
   result of a security incident.
9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving
information systems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to
begin an evaluation on the impact of the incident to national security and the organization‘s
operations. If COMSEC material is involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC
Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Volume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).
9.3. (TINKERAFB)SM will notify 72 ABW/IP, the Wing IA office, 72 ABW/SCXS and 72
ABW/SCOO Network Control Center (NCC) of all security incidents involving information
systems.

       incident involving information systems, they will immediately contact the 72 ABW/IP
       office of the incident.
9.4. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Incidents. Safeguard all SCI material and
report incidents involving SCI to the Special Security Officer.
9.5. Special Access Program (SAP) Incidents Report security incidents involving DOD SAP
materiel through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).
9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and
   security incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if
   they contain classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable
   unauthorized individuals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In
   the latter case, the documentation must remain classified until the information has been
   retrieved and appropriately safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports
   pertaining to security incidents that have occurred in the information system environment
   when the system has been appropriately purged and the correspondence does not contain
   other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the
       classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
       9.6.1.2. Mark security incident notices, memorandums, and reports using derivative
       classification procedures. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5.
   9.6.2. All security incident reports will, as a minimum, be marked ―For Official Use Only.‖

  date the inquiry report will be complete. Extensions must be received in writing and signed
  by the appointing official. The completed report will be routed as follows:
     9.9.3.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) The inquiry official will deliver the completed report to
     72 ABW/IP for technical review and then to OC-ALC/JA for legal review. The inquiry
     official will then return the report to the appointing authority for review and action. The
     appointing authority will make the final determination to close the investigation or to
     proceed with a formal investigation. The final report with the request for closure letter
     will be delivered to 72 ABW/IP for file.
  9.9.4. The report from the preliminary inquiry will be sufficient to resolve the security
  incident if:
     9.9.4.1. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has not
     occurred.
     9.9.4.2. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has
     occurred, but there is no indication of significant security weakness.
     9.9.4.3. The appointing official determines that no additional information will be
     obtained by conducting a formal investigation.
  9.9.5. If the report from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficient to resolve the security
  incident, the appointing authority initiates a formal investigation. The preliminary inquiry
  report will become part of any formal investigation. If the inquiry is closed out as a
  compromise or potential compromise the appointing authority notifies the OCA to perform a
  damage assessment.
  9.9.6. If the inquiry reveals suspected unauthorized disclosure to the public notify SAF/AAP
  through IP channels [DODD5210.50, Para 5.2.1.]. Classify security incident notices,
  memorandums, and reports according to the classified source from which they are derived.
  Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3. Specifically address:

                   CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION

A2.1. For Official Use Only (FOUO). FOUO is a designation that is applied to unclassified
information that is exempt from automatic release to the public under FOIA. See DOD 5400.7-
R/AF Supplement for further guidance [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 3, Para AP3.2.]
   A2.1.1. Access to FOUO Information.
      A2.1.1.1. No person may have access to information designated as FOUO unless that
      person has been determined to have a valid need for such access in connection with the
      accomplishment of a lawful and authorized Government purpose.

      for access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has
      authorized possession, knowledge or control of the information and not on the
      prospective recipient.
      A2.1.1.3. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DOD
      Components and between officials of DOD Components and DOD contractors,
      consultants, and grantees to conduct official business for the DOD, provided that

      Privacy Program, are satisfied.
      A2.1.1.5. Release of FOUO information to Congress is governed by AFI 90-401, Air
      Force Relations With Congress. If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is
      authorized if the requirements of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
      A2.1.1.6. DOD Directive 7650.01, General Accounting Office (GAO) and Comptroller
      General Access to Records, governs release of FOUO information to the Government
      Accountability Office (GAO). If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is

     Federal Records Act and the DOD Component records management directives. Non-
     record FOUO documents may be destroyed by any of the means approved for the
     destruction of classified information, or by any other means that would make it difficult
     to recognize or reconstruct the information.
  A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute
  an unauthorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However,
  appropriate administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized
  disclosure of FOUO whenever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken
  against those responsible. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by
  the Privacy Act may also result in civil and criminal sanctions against responsible persons.

       FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive information, the appropriate
       classification designation is sufficient to protect the information.
   A2.2.3. Access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. The criteria
   for allowing access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive are the same
   as those used for FOUO information, except that if the information also bears the marking
