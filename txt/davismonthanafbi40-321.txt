Terms
Cardio—Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) – The act of providing respiratory ventilation and
heart (cardiac) compression by an external source. Most commonly provided to an individual
who is without both spontaneous respiration and heartbeat, and performed by someone capable
of the required mechanical action.
Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS)— A training program that teaches basic CPR techniques
as well as AED use.
Automated External Defibrillator (AED)— A defibrillator device that is:
1. Commercially distributed in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
2. Capable of recognizing the presence or absence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular
tachycardia, and is capable of determining, without intervention by the user of the device,
whether to perform defibrillation.
3. Able to deliver an electrical shock to an individual upon determining that defibrillation is
necessary.
Ventricular Fibrillation— An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with life if not
immediately treated (Hereafter referred to as heart attack).
Pulse less Ventricular Tachycardia— An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with
life if not immediately treated (Hereafter referred to as heart attack).
Defibrillation— The application of an electric shock, via a defibrillator, directly through a
person's chest.
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)— An abrupt cessation of normal cardiac function that typically
results from ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with rapid progression to
death if not immediately treated.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS)— The rapid response team of medically trained personnel
to provide emergency medical assistance as necessary.
Perceived Medical Emergency— When circumstances exist whereby the behavior of an
individual leads a reasonable person to believe that the individual is experiencing a life
threatening condition that requires an immediate medical response.
Federal Building— A building or portion of a building leased or rented by a federal agency, to
include buildings on military installations of the United States.
Harm— For purposes of this document, this term may include physical, non-physical,

               TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A7.1. What is TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE?
   A7.1.1. It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention designed to assist individuals and
   groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist events, and suicides, death -
   either accidental or intentional). Details of the program can be found in AFI 44-153,
   Traumatic Stress Response.
A7.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services?
   A7.2.1. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community
   traumatic stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc)
   and small-scale disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence
   event, etc). Provide TSR services after traumatic events to help those who have experienced
   the events. The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal
   stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the impact of
   exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A7.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services?
   A7.3.1. The office of record for TSR services is the Mental Health Flight (228-4926).
   Please address any inquiries about TSR services to the Chief of the TSR team.
