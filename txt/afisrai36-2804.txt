1. Introduction. This program is named in honor of the late Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt)
James C. Swindell. He is considered the most professional communicator ever assigned to the
United States Air Force Security Service (USAFSS) (predecessor of the Electronic Security
Command [ESC]), Air Force Intelligence Command (AFIC), Air Intelligence Agency (AIA), and
Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA). He was
instrumental in obtaining the first long-haul, secure, on-line circuits for USAFSS in the early
fifties. He was also the prime architect for the eventual merger of critical communications and
automatic digital network (CRITICOMM/AUTODIN) trunking. These two actions are
considered major milestones in arriving at the present communications capabilities of AFISRA.
Chief Swindell was selected for promotion under the Air Force's first Chief Master Sergeant
promotion cycle on 1 December 1959.
2. Program Objective. The Chief Master Sergeant James C. Swindell Awards Program
objective is to recognize a unit's outstanding communications and information operations
systems. The CMSgt James C. Swindell Awards Program, originated in 1974, is a means to
recognize the best communications and information systems operations in the agency.
     2.1. Award. Each year the AFISRA Commander presents an appropriate award to the
     winning unit, engraved with the unit's name and the year received.
     2.2. Permanent Plaque. An engraved wall plaque, entitled "Chief Master Sergeant James
     C. Swindell Award," is presented to the commander of the winning unit at the AFISRA
     Commander’s Conference.
     2.3. Eligible Units. Any unit that has a communications and information operations system
     function supporting the AFISRA mission is eligible for this award.
     2.4. Who May Submit a Nomination. Any AFISRA or AFISRA supported unit
     commander or director.
     2.5. Selection Panels, Process, and Rules of Engagement. AFISRA Director of
     Communications or delegated representative shall administer the selection board.
     2.5.1. Panels. The Panel shall consist of at least three but no more than 5 members who
     will evaluate and score the nominees. Panel membership shall be functional in nature and
     USAF military members and federal civilian employees assigned to AFISRA
     Communications Directorate.
        2.5.2. Process. The senior-ranking member on the panel shall take the role of president.
        Panel presidents will not score the nominations unless a requirement exists for the
        president to score. They will take the role of tie-breaker, if and when a requirement
        exists, and will certify the panel members’ scores and the outcome of the competition.
        2.5.3. Rules of Engagement. The board rules of engagement shall provide no room for
        discussions about the nominations or scoring decisions, in whole or part, between panel
        members or with anyone else inside or outside of the selection process. Panel members
        will not attempt to coerce or influence any other members on the panels to formulate
        scores. Exception to the ―no discussion rule may take place only if and when significant
        differences occur between panel members’ scores or ties occurred and the members must
        talk to each other to resolve the differences.
