Programming Division, Bases and Units Branch (HQ AFGSC/A8XB), is responsible for
managing site survey requests, managing and leading the site survey process, and managing the
PPlan development and implementation process, to include associated SATAF support (see

commanders and headquarters staff agencies will inform HQ AFGSC/A8XB of planned mission
changes or relocations affecting AFGSC.
2.1. Site Survey Request Procedures and Format. Contact HQ AFGSC/A8XB for all requests to
relocate existing AFGSC units, beddown new AFGSC units, or locate non-AFGSC units on
AFGSC installations. Specific procedures for intra-AFGSC and non-AFGSC requests are as
follows:
2.1.3. (Added) Intra-AFGSC Requests:
2.1.3.1. (Added) Headquarters staff agencies will forward all intra-AFGSC site survey requests
to HQ AFGSC/A8XB (for e-mail use AFGSCA8Xworkflow@barksdale.af.mil). These requests
must come from an A8XB equivalent office or higher.
2.1.3.2. (Added) On receipt of a site survey request, HQ AFGSC/A8XB will initiate
coordination to gain approval for the survey. HQ AFGSC/A8XB is responsible for appropriate
headquarters agencies being included in the coordination.
2.1.3.3. (Added) After the survey is approved, HQ AFGSC/A8XB will work with the requesting
agency to conduct the survey. HQ AFGSC/A8XB will provide the survey team chief, publish the
survey report, and coordinate any subsequent beddown requests according to paragraph 3 of
AFI10-503.
2.1.4. (Added) Non-AFGSC Requests:
2.1.4.1. (Added) AFGSC units and headquarters staff agencies will forward requests from non-
AFGSC agencies to locate on, or for survey of, AFGSC installations to HQ AFGSC/A8XB.
Requests should contain information shown in Attachment 5.
2.1.4.1.1. Prior to the site survey, the proposed gaining installation will review the information
submitted by the proponent in the unit beddown application (Attachment 5) and identify siting
alternatives which appear to meet proponent requirements and are compatible with the base
comprehensive plan. These alternatives will be presented and evaluated during the site survey
and siting recommendations will be documented in the site survey report.
2.1.4.2. (Added) Unit commanders and headquarters agencies are not restricted from making
contact with non-AFGSC agencies as part of the survey planning process. AFGSC units hosting
planning teams will inform HQ AFGSC/A8XB of the planning visit results.

coordinate beddown planning to include PPlan preparation and SATAF meetings as follows:

information concerning AFGSC PPlan preparation.
3.3.1.2. (Added) Site Action Task Force (SATAF):
3.3.1.2.1. (Added) A SATAF will be conducted to identify the actions and tasks required to
transfer, beddown, and operate. The SATAF is conducted prior to PPlan publication. The
SATAF will produce a compilation of the tasks, OPRs, estimated completion dates, and
pertinent comments that will support PPlan implementation. Additionally, the SATAF will
attempt to identify all costs associated with the transfer, beddown, and operation of the program.
3.3.1.2.2. (Added) HQ AFGSC/A8XB will provide the AFGSC SATAF team chief.

3.3.1.2.3. (Added) The SATAF is composed of personnel from HQ AFGSC, other MAJCOMs,
outside agencies, and affected base-level agencies. The SATAF may be subdivided into groups
or teams with designated team chiefs. The team chiefs will work with their teams and interact
with other teams to identify the action items and tasks that are needed to achieve the goal of the
PPlan. AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP contains additional information concerning SATAFs.
