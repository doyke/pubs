                                                  AFSC 1A3X1
PART I
Preface
1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document
   that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task
   requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor
   in all aspects of career field training.
2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training
   within the career field.
   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how
   everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities,
   training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications
   (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds,
   manpower, equipment, and facilities. Note: The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI
   36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions.
   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
   duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted
   training, and correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
   standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements. Section C identifies
   available training support materials. Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine
   resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Sections E and F
   identify MAJCOM unique training requirements.
   2.3. Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart. This chart provides a visual
   depiction of the Airborne Missions Systems AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of
   aviation service, and key information to education, training and qualification. It also contains promotion
   information specific to the Airborne Missions Systems AFSC, such as average time in grade, time in service, as
   well as Air Force averages. This chart provides a timeline for achieving additional qualifications such as
   instructor, evaluator, FTU assignment, and leadership opportunities within the squadron, Group, Wing and
   MAJCOM and HQ/USAF.
3. This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1A3XX receive comprehensive and effective training at
   the appropriate phases of their career. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and
   conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose.
This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM
functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage,
and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals
must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. For the purpose of this plan, training is
divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training
(CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air
Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory
courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 5-, 7-, and
9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed
to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job. Continuation training is additional
training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to
maintain their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required. The CFETP has several purposes, some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends
training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired specialty training program.
2. Uses.
The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training
programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. Training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, and exportable training based on
requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP. The lead command MFM will work
with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills
requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable
courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must
not duplicate available training resources.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in
Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
2.4. Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623).
That training is certified via AF Form 8 by trained flight examiners. Certification of the AF Form 8 eliminates the
requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.
3. Coordination and Approval.
 The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify
and coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this
document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part
II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM
functional managers to HQ USAF/A3O-AM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the
following organizational email address: afa3oam.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.

5. Skill/Career Progression.
Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an extremely
important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission. Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved in
training do their part to plan, develop, manage, conduct, and evaluate an effective and efficient training program.
The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate
points in their career. The following narrative and the AFSC 1A3XX career field flow charts identify the training
career path. They define the training required in an individual’s career.
5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Meeting requirements listed in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer
and Enlisted), specialty description, completion of the Aircrew Fundamentals Course at Lackland AFB, TX. Initial
skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level resident
course (1A331). Tasks and knowledge training requirements are identified in the specialty training standard, at Part
II, Section A. Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 1A331.
5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Non-prior service trainees must meet all requirements prescribed in the applicable
MAJCOM aircrew training directives and a minimum of 12 months upgrade training beginning on the first day of




                                                           9
                                                                                                  CFETP 1A3X1
                                                                                               31 December 2012
Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Completion of IQT is required. Individuals in retraining status are subject to
the same training requirements and a minimum of nine months in upgrade training.
5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. To be awarded AFSC 1A371, the trainee must be a SSgt, complete all 3- and 5-skill level
training requirements and meet all requirements as listed in the applicable MAJCOM aircrew training directives and
have completed 12 months of upgrade training. Individuals in retraining status are subject to the same training
requirements and a minimum of six months in upgrade training.
5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. To be awarded AFSC 1A391, an individual must be a SMSgt and have his or her
supervisor’s recommendation. Additionally, complete any other requirements specified in the Air Force Enlisted
Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).
5.5. Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM). CEM code is award when selected for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant.
6. Training Decisions.
The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training
requirements for the Airborne Mission Systems specialty. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one
through retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and
how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of
training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
6.1. Initial Skills Training. Initial physiological training will be conducted at the Aircrew Fundamentals Course.
Significant changes were made in initial skills training. The STS was changed to include Aircrew Fundamentals
Course to align common core training amongst all 1AXXX AFSCs. The initial skills training will be revised to
provide training needed to prepare graduates for Airborne Mission Systems related positions.
6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training. Completion of 12 months of upgrade training starting on the first day of IQT.
Individuals in retraining require completion of nine months of upgrade training starting on the first day of IQT.
Completion of CDCs is no longer required for 5-skill level upgrade.
6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training. No formal training. The CSAF has approved a variance, eliminating the
requirement for in-residence 7-level training for all 1AXXX (Aircrew Operations Career Field) personnel.
7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs.
CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences (AAS) Degree. Enrollment in CCAF
occurs upon completion of basic military training. Off-duty education is a personal choice but is highly encouraged.
See the CCAF web site for program details regarding the AAS degree at: http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf.
Additionally, see the Air Force Virtual Education Center website regarding AAS degree progress at:
https://my.af.mil/afvecprod/. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:
7.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. The College offers the Occupational Instructor Certification to
instructors teaching full time in a CCAF affiliated school. To qualify, instructors must complete an instructor course,
a Teaching Practicum, have two years teaching experience, hold an associate or higher degree, and be recommended

7.2. Instructor of Technology & Military Science Degree. This program is offered to enlisted members who are
assigned to CCAF affiliated schools teaching CCAF degree-applicable courses. Applicants must complete three
semester hours of CCAF-approved instructor methodology coursework and hold their career-field related CCAF
degree or equivalent civilian college degree before registration.
7.3. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is awarded for
the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment process for trade skill
certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor, or Master
Craftsman/Manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.
7.4. Degree Requirements. All Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. The current program
associates degree available from the CCAF for AFSC 1A3XX is the Information Systems Technology Associate of
Applied Science degree. Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-skill level must be awarded and the

8.1. The flow outlined in figure 1 (above) represents the formal training courses required for personnel entering and
becoming fully qualified in the AIRBORNE MISSION SYSTEMS. The locations, course lengths, and titles are subject
to change. Changes will be updated in the Education Training Course Announcement by the course owner.
8.1.1. The course flow has been developed and agreed upon by the MAJCOM functional managers to minimize days
students are awaiting training and to ensure survival training is received prior to AFSC award--minimizing the impact of
not having the prerequisites completed before entering weapons system training.
8.1.2. Personnel graduating from the Lackland AFB course are awarded AFSC 1A331 and are authorized to wear the
Basic Aircrew Member Badge. Wear and permanent awarding requirements of the Basic Aircrew Member Badge will be
IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service Aeronautical Ratings and Badges and MAJCOM supplements.
Failure to complete initial qualification training (IQT) is justification for supervisors to recommend revocation of wear of
the aircrew member badge.

Section B - Course Objective List
4. Measurement.
Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written
test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W
indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance
progress check. P indicates performance test only.
5. Standard.
The standard is 85% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the
objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the
progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
attained.
