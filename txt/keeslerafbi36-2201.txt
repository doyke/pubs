          third place receives 16 points, etc.
          3.5.1.2. Regulation Drill. First place receives 20 points; second place receives 18
          points; third place receives 16 points, etc.

       3.5.2. Points received in all categories will be totaled to determine the overall first,

       uniform.

       hours.
       3.7.3. Accessories may consist of berets, metal heel plates and toe plates, ascots, white or
       black gloves and black aiguillettes.
KEESLERAFBI36-2201 5 JUNE 2012                                                               7


        3.7.3.1. Berets will not conflict with AFSC-specific colors e.g., dark blue berets for
        security forces or red berets for combat controllers.
        3.7.3.2. Conservative color ascots are authorized for wear with the Airman Battle
        Uniform (ABU). White ascots may be worn with the service uniform.
        3.7.3.3. Airmen assigned to drill teams will wear solid black color utility aiguillette
        when performing drill team duties or activities. Aiguillettes are authorized for wear

     3.7.4. Requests to deviate from uniform standards must be submitted for approval in
     writing to 81 TRG/MTO at least one week prior to the event. Failure to do so will result
     in the team being disqualified from the competition.
  3.8. Annual Award. Team placement throughout the year will determine the Drill Team of
  the Year. Placement will be determined by the following point system:
     3.8.1. First Place = 10 points
     3.8.2. Second Place = 9 points
     3.8.3. Third Place = 8 points
     3.8.4. Fourth Place = 7 points
     3.8.5. Fifth Place = 6 points
     3.8.6. If there is a tie for Drill Team of the Year using the above system, the team with
     the most first place finishes throughout the year wins the award. If two or more teams
     have the same number of first place finishes, the team with the most second place finishes
     throughout the year wins the award. This process will continue to third and fourth place,
     if necessary, to break the tie.
