       the required retention period has been met, the towing company will dispose of the vehicle per

       pay the required towing and storage fees before receiving the vehicle. Towing and storage fees are
       dictated by the towing company.

       mobile insurance before the vehicle will be released. If a member is deployed or otherwise

       ship if item is included in POA.
