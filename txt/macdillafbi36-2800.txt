   the requirements for submission for the ―AMC Outstanding CGO of the Year‖ Award in
   accordance with AMCI 36-2808. A complete electronic package, including a cover letter,
   AF Form 1206 (Attachment 2), biography (Attachment 8), RIP, and statement of intent
   must be submitted due to a short suspense.
   3.5. There will be a wing First Sergeant of the Year Category. The wing winner will
   compete for the ―USAF First Sergeant of the Year Award.‖ First Sergeants (8F000) assigned
   to 6 AMW will compete through their respective chains of command.
4. Amn, NCO, SNCO, and CGO of the Quarter and Annual Programs.
   4.1. Applicability: All units administratively assigned to the 6 AMW may nominate an
   individual to compete.
   4.2. Eligibility: Amn, NCOs, SNCOs, and CGOs are eligible to compete. Note:
   Individuals should compete in the category in which they held the rank for the majority of the
   time frame (quarter/annual). For example, in the case of a senior airman (SrA) who is
   promoted to SSgt on 1 November (served 10 months as an Amn/two months as an NCO), it
   would be appropriate for them to compete in the Amn category for an annual award, but
   since they were an NCO for 2 of the 3 months in the quarter (served as a SrA during the
   month of October and a SSgt during the months of November and December), they should
   compete for the NCO of the Quarter award.
