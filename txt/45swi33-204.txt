1. COMSEC Program.
    1.1. Overview. COMSEC refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized
    persons information derived from information systems of the United States Government
    related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems.
    COMSEC protection results from applying security measures (i.e., crypto security,
    transmission security and emission security) to communications and information systems
    generating, handling, storing, processing or using classified or sensitive government or
    government-derived information, the loss of which could adversely affect national security
    interests. It also includes applying physical security measures to COMSEC information or
    materials.
2. Unit COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) and Secure Voice Responsible Officer
(SVRO) Appointment.
    2.1. IAW AFI 33-201V2, when required, each organizational/unit commander will appoint
    in writing a primary and at least one alternate focal point for unit COMSEC and secure voice
    accounts. If a unit has a CRO and also requires an SVRO, it is strongly recommended the
    CRO also serve as the SVRO. A SVRO will be appointed if the unit has no additional
    COMSEC requirements or if the unit commander determines that the CRO and SVRO should
    be different individuals.
       2.1.1. Dependent upon the mission of an organization and the amount of COMSEC
       material involved, the duties of a CRO or SVRO may be intense. Unit commanders must
       be cognizant of the additional duty workload assigned to personnel appointed as CROs
       and/or SVROs. COMSEC demands extensive attention to detail and there is little room
       for error. Workload leveling is strongly encouraged. The below formula is suggested as
       a tool to accomplish this.
       2.1.2. Formalize a complete list of additional duties with primary and alternates assigned
       as appropriate.
       2.1.3. Categorize each additional duty as level 1, 2 or 3 based on the time requirement it
       levies on the appointee (1 is lowest).
       2.1.4. Ensure additional duties are assigned in such a way as to avoid more than one 3-
       level duty per individual.
       2.1.5. Quantify each individual's time commitment to additional duties by summing the
       category number for each duty assigned.
       2.1.6. Ensure additional duties are assigned in such a way as to avoid excessive duties
       for any one individual.
       2.1.7. Unit commanders must appoint a new CRO or SVRO if the individual currently
       appointed as primary or alternate will be deployed or on temporary duty (TDY) for more
       than 90 days. This must be accomplished no later than 30 days prior to the individual’s
       departure.
45SWI33-204 26 JANUARY 2011                                                                    3


       2.1.8. If the primary CRO is being replaced he/she must accomplish an inventory of their
       COMSEC material with the newly appointed CRO. The managing COMSEC office will
       provide the CRO a current inventory of the unit’s account to use in accomplishing this.
       2.1.9. The departing CRO will complete the inventory with the newly appointed CRO
       before being relieved from the account. The newly appointed CRO will sign the
       inventory, post a copy in the account’s six-part folder and provide a copy to the managing
       COMSEC office.
3. Training.
   3.1. Training is mandatory for each newly appointed CRO and SVRO and annually
   thereafter. Training sessions are conducted on the second Tuesday of each month.
   Attendance will be confirmed no later than the last duty day before or the class may be
   cancelled. Personnel requiring training must make every effort to attend on the normally
   scheduled day. Individual training session’s out-of-cycle will only be scheduled as a last
   alternative and coordinated through the trainee’s unit commander. The COMSEC manager
   has the discretion to schedule any CRO or SVRO to attend if he/she feels additional training
   is required based on duty performance.
       3.1.1. The COMSEC Manager will gauge comprehension of the training material by
       giving four tests at the end of key areas. Trainees are also required to perform several
       practical tests (i.e., accomplish/critique an AFCOMSEC Form 16, Disposition Record
       Card, SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, etc.). Responses are evaluated during the
       session to ensure a thorough understanding of the material before the trainee and trainer
       sign the AF Form 4168, COMSEC Responsible Officer and User Training Checklist.
       3.1.2. Unit CROs and SVROs are required to train their users before granting access to
       COMSEC material and annually thereafter. CROs and SVROs will train their users to
       the level of training they received from the COMSEC office. Training material will be
       provided upon request.
       3.1.3. The COMSEC Manager will conduct quarterly meetings with all CROs and
       SVROs to discuss error trends, new or updated procedures and any new developments in
       the COMSEC duties and responsibilities. Individuals can also take this opportunity to
       address any concerns or questions they may have.
4. Inspection Criterion.
   4.1. IAW AFI 33-230, Information Assurance Assessment and Assistance Program, and this
   instruction, the 45 SW main and associated COMSEC subaccounts will be inspected using
   the following criteria.
       4.1.1. Unit CROs and/or SVROs will accomplish a self-inspection, utilizing AF FM
       4160, Information Assurance Assessment and Assistance Program (IAAP) Criteria,
       twice a year (January and July). The CRO/SVRO will forward the results to the
       managing COMSEC manager no later than the 21st day of the self-inspection month.
       The COMSEC manager will use these results as a comparison tool to any actual findings
       discovered during the routine semiannual inspection.
 4                                                              45SWI33-204 26 JANUARY 2011


        4.1.2. The managing COMSEC office will conduct a routine semiannual inspection of
        the local elements along with a 100% hands-on inventory of all COMSEC material in the
        February and August timeframe. A satisfactory or unsatisfactory rating is determined by
        the COMSEC manager based on the number and criticality of discrepancies.
        4.1.3. The managing COMSEC office will conduct a minimum of two no-notice
        inspections of each local element annually. The frequency of no-notice inspections will
        be dependent on the number of deficiencies noted during previous inspection. For
        example, at least one no-notice inspection will be conducted according to Table 1.

Table 1. No Notice Inspection Criterion.

 1 critical finding or 5-9 non-critical findings     within 3 months
 2+ critical findings or 10+ non-critical findings   within 1 month
        4.1.4. The managing COMSEC account and all local elements are subject to inspection
        by AFSPC/A6 biennially. All accounts and local elements are subject to inspection by
        AFSPC/IG and the Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) at any time, provided inspectors or
        auditors meet the access requirements as defined in AFI 33-201V4.
        4.1.5. The inspected unit commander and 45 SCS commander will be briefed on the
        results of each inspection. The 45 RMS commander will also be briefed on inspection
        results for Cape Canaveral AFS (CCAFS), Antigua Air Station (AAS) and Ascension
        Auxiliary Air Field (AAAF). If the account is managed by a contractor, the applicable
        government contract monitor will be briefed as well.
        4.1.6. The final inspection report will be sent directly to the unit commander or
        government contract monitor for concurrence or non-concurrence and signature.
        4.1.7. All reports will be routed to the 45 OG/CC for review. All unsatisfactory
        inspection results will be reported to the violating unit’s group commander, 45 SW/CV
        and 45 SW/CC via the 45 OG/CC.
        4.1.8. Local elements will respond to their managing COMSEC office on all inspection
        findings 10 days after receipt of initial report and every 30 days thereafter until the
        finding is closed, IAW AFI 33-230.
        4.1.9. The managing COMSEC manager is the authority to close findings from the wing
        semiannual or no-notice inspection. AFSPC Inspector General (IG) or Air Force Audit
        Agency (AFAA) is the authority to close findings from their respective inspection.
5. Issuing COMSEC Material.
     5.1. COMSEC material is issued to users no earlier than 10 days from the material’s
     effective date. Users will be scheduled to pick up their material during a 2-day window in
     the 10-day period. Users will make every effort to meet their scheduled time for pickup.
6. Simple Key Loader (SKL).
     6.1. All first time users of the SKL must complete the SKL Computer Based Training
     (CBT). A certificate of completion will be maintained in the account’s six-part folder with
     the user’s AF Form 4168.
45SWI33-204 26 JANUARY 2011                                                                      5


   6.2. The managing COMSEC office will establish the user’s SKL account. The login ID
   will be the user’s “first.last” name all lower case (e.g., john.doe). Variations will be used in
   the event of duplicate names.
7. Destruction.
   7.1. For the first of the month routine destructions, users will make every effort to forward
   destruction reports to the COMSEC office before noon on the day of destruction. Users
   serviced by the Patrick AFB COMSEC account may FAX the destruction, SF 153, COMSEC
