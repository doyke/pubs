                                            Chapter 1

 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), the 618th Air & Space
Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) Weather Directorate, (618 AOC/XOW
[TACC]/XOW), and the 92 Operations Support Squadron (OSS)/OSW are the official weather
information agencies for Fairchild AFB, Washington. These agencies provide weather
information in support of the 92 ARW, the 141 ARW, and subordinate units and units assigned,
attached, or supported by Fairchild AFB. The 92 OSS/OSW is commonly referred to as the
Weather Flight (WF) and is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction will be
reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or IAW with host/parent unit procedures if the
time is less than biennially.
   1.1.1. The 25 OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses
   the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on
   Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
   1.1.2. 92 OSS/OSW and 618 AOC/XOW are considered exploitation units. Exploitation is
   the ability to minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while
   simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational
   advantage over enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor products provided by the
   characterization unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission
   profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not
   mean changing the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will
   use the characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, provides regional and operational-
   level weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the West region of the
   Continental United States.
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The 25 OWS performs a continuous
   METWATCH for Fairchild AFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for
   monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of
   a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge
   from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product
   or group of products, and notify designated agencies.
   1.2.3. The WF and 618 AOC/XOW are the primary source of tailored weather services in
   support of the 92 ARW, the 141 ARW, various headquarters elements, and visiting aircrews.
   The WF and 618 AOC/XOW will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather
   is anticipated and exploited, and that safety and RP are maintained.
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 25 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128, para 4.1
   and para 6.2, respectively.
 6                                                    FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


         1.3.1.1. The 25 OWS issues the Fairchild AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs),
         forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide flight weather briefings to
         transient aircrews passing through Fairchild AFB.  The OWS will issue observed
         warnings and advisories when the WF is closed.
         1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and observed warnings when the WF is
         open.
         1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
         products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
         into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF will provide flight
         weather briefings and operational weather support for the 36th Rescue Flight (RQF) and
         Army Aviation Support Facility number 2 (AASF). The WF will also provide flight
         weather briefings for transient aircrews IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
         1.3.1.4. 618 AOC/XOW. The 618 AOC/XOW provides flight weather briefings and
         operational weather support for the 92 and 141 ARWs.
      1.3.2. Fairchild AFB Installation Data Page. The 25 OWS and Fairchild WF will coordinate
      and maintain a Fairchild AFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and
      amendment criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information,
      Automated Dissemination System (ADS) back-up contacts and local outage back-up
      information.
      1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The Fairchild WF will act as the eyes forward for the
      25 OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in
      coded meteorological reports to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 92 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, para 1.3.3.1., the
WF has created the following duty priorities based on 92 ARW mission requirements.

Table 1.1. 92 OSS/OSW Duty Priority Listing.

 15           Provide Other Briefing Support
 16           Weather Functional Training.
 17          Accomplish Administrative Tasks.
 NOTE 1: Local dissemination refers to weather observations, forecasts, watches, warnings, and
 advisories sent to agencies operating an ADS. The WF expects agencies to use the ADS to the
 fullest potential prior to contacting the WF for weather data, due to the time-critical nature of the
 information. Agencies without ADS software that have a need for weather data should contact the
 WF for assistance in acquiring software installation and training or be placed on existing
 notification trees.
1.5. Hours of Operation & Contact Information.
      1.5.1. WF. Normal airfield and mission services hours of operations are Monday-Friday
      from 0500L-2100L, closure hours will vary based upon local flying. In addition, WF
      personnel will be on duty when the airfield is open and no automated observing system
      capability exists; or SWAP have been activated as outlined in para 2.8.2. The WF will
      stand up operations as directed by the 92 ARW/CC or 92 OG/CC. Staff services are
      available during normal duty hours or as required. A web-based aircrew-briefing terminal is
      located in base operations, Flight Planning Room. This briefing terminal allows aircrews to
      self-brief or schedule a flight weather briefing from the 25 OWS.
         1.5.1.1. Prior to closing the station, the weather technician is responsible for contacting
         the 25 OWS, Air Traffic Control (ATC), Base Operations, and Command Post (CP). The
         weather technician will not leave the work center until all agencies have been notified.
         1.5.1.2. The WF leadership will notify 25 OWS team of any one-time or short term
         deviations from the published hours of operation, IAW the Fairchild AFB Installation
         Data Page.
      1.5.2. 25 OWS and 618 AOC/XOW. Hours of operation are 24/7, 365 days a year.
      1.5.3. Contact Information
         1.5.3.1. WF (509) 247-5514/8411 / DSN 657-5514/8411
         1.5.3.2. WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL) (509) 247-4446/4401 / DSN 657-
         4446/4401
         1.5.3.3. PMSV 234.8 MHz
         1.5.3.4. 618 AOC/XOW (618) 229-0353 / DSN 779-0353
         1.5.3.5. 25 OWS (520) 228-7338 / DSN 228-7338
1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages at the 25 OWS, 618 AOC/XOW, and WF.
8                                                      FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


    1.6.1. WF COOP and WF AOL. In the event of a building evacuation, the WF will move to
    building 2005, first floor, room 125B, Comm (509) 247-4446/4401 / DSN 657-4446/4401.
    WF members will follow duty-specific standard operating procedures and evacuation
    checklists (including a list of required back-up equipment) while resuming services, to
    include operational support and eyes forward responsibilities for the OWS, at the AOL. If
    access to observing sensing equipment readouts is lost, manual equipment will be used to
    take observations. Most WF services/support will be provided, but will require a case-by-
    case assessment depending on communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most
    services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited
    facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including sensors and various data types
    (meteorological satellite, radar imagery, etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not
    evacuate during exercises.
    1.6.2. 25 OWS COOP.
       1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
       weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
       1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 25 OWS will resume all
       support from an alternate location.
       1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, 25 OWS conducts periodic COOP
       exercises.
    1.6.3. 618 AOC/XOW COOP.
       1.6.3.1. IAW AMCI 15-101, if the 618 AOC/XOW loses the capability to provide flight
       weather briefing services, the WF will assume responsibility for all Fairchild AFB
       Integrated Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM weather packages. If the WF is unable
       to provide the required support, briefing responsibility will be transferred to the servicing
       OWS.
       1.6.3.2. AMC Weather COOP Exercises. AMC weather units conduct coordinated
       COOP exercises on the second Wednesday/Thursday of each month. AMC/A3AW will
       issue Special Instructions (SPINS) outlining the functions and capabilities that are to be
       exercised. As a courtesy, the WF will coordinate COOP timelines and potential impacts
       with supported units prior to all scheduled COOPs.
           1.6.3.2.1. Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Outages. In the event of a GDSS
           outage, the WF provides MWPs via the 92 OSS/OSW Mission Execution Forecast
           (MEF) or verbal briefing. Servicing OWSs provide a MEF via email or a verbal
           briefing,
           1.6.3.2.2. GDSS Proficiency/Outage Exercise. GDSS proficiency exercises ensure
           the WF is prepared to support continuity of operations during TACC evacuations,
           operational surges beyond 618 AOC /XOW’s capability to support, or GDSS outages.
           During GDSS Proficiency/Outage Exercises the WF will:
              1.6.3.2.2.1. Provide mission weather packages through GDSS or alternate means
              if a GDSS outage is simulated.
              1.6.3.2.2.2. Ensure all briefing packages are completed and available to the
              aircrews NLT 4 hours prior to scheduled departure.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the Fairchild aerodrome (defined
within 5NM of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the AMOS. Most observations are taken automatically
by the AMOS with no human intervention. At times, it is necessary for a weather forecaster to
augment the system. Automated and augmentation processes are outlined in para 2.2.7 The
following observations are created and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Report
   (METAR). METAR observations are created between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour.
   METARs are disseminated both locally and long-line between 55 and 59 minutes after the
   hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the Fairchild AFB special criteria listed
   in Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found
   in a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 5 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The official observing is the location of the primary sensor
   group and the discontinuity sensor group. During periods of augmentation, the observation
   site is the manhole cover located on the runway side of building 1. During relocations to the
   AOL, and augmentation is required, the observation point is marked by a compass rose
   approximately 35 ft from the AOL flightline exit door.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
       2.2.5.1. The AMOS is properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
       2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site (Bldg 1). An
       unobstructed view exists of the runway and its approaches; however, the view west-
       north-northeast is restricted because of buildings/structures. These limitations are
       partially compensated by the Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) program.
       2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because the view from
       the west to the north is blocked by buildings. Both ends of the runway are not easily
       visible from the observation point. There are few adequate ground visibility reference
       markers beyond 1 mile. These limitations are partially compensated by the CWW
       program.
   2.2.6. AMOS. An automated observation is any observation having been evaluated,
   prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human intervention. In automated
   mode, the AMOS observing system will record and disseminate weather observations. The
 10                                                  FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


   AMOS uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated observation, sky condition will
   be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute period ending at the actual
   time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based on sensor data that is within
   10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.
   2.2.7. Forecaster AMOS Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having position-
   qualified weather technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a
   properly sited AMOS. The two augmentation processes used are supplement and back-up.
       2.2.7.1. Supplementing (definition). Method of manually adding meteorological
       information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AMOS to
       detect and/or report. Table 2.1 identifies elements that are mandatory to supplement.
       2.2.7.2. Supplementing procedures. Weather technicians will perform a basic weather
       watch and be prepared to supplement observations when the airfield is open and the
       weather conditions in Table 2.1 are observed and/or forecast to occur within 1 hour.
       Weather personnel are required to log on to an ADS and be prepared to supplement
       whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic activity.

       procedures will be implemented only during airfield operating hours and/or if tornadic
FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014                                                              11


       activity is occurring or forecast to occur. Weather technicians will use manual observing
       procedures for individual elements when performing back-up operations. Weather
       technicians will not replace the entire automated observation with a manual observation
       when backing-up malfunctioning sensors. Weather technicians will provide back-up
       information IAW AFMAN 15-111 Attachment 2 and Attachment 3. Elements entered
       will have been observed within 15 minutes of the actual time of the observation. Gusts
       and squalls will be reported if observed within 10 minutes of the actual time of the
       observation. When utilizing back-up equipment, all wind and pressure values must be
       estimated.
2.3. TAF Support. Fairchild AFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 25 OWS IAW
AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the Fairchild AFB Installation Data
Page. Attachment 4 lists forecast specification and amendment criteria. TAFs are valid for 30
hours, apply to the area within the 5NM area of the Fairchild AFB airfield complex, and will be
issued at 0300, 1100, and 1900 Zulu time. Attachment 5 contains examples of typical Fairchild
AFB TAFs.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
(WWA). The 25 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological watch to identify and assess
emerging and imminent threats to Fairchild AFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS) and
Watches, Warnings, and Advisories are special notices provided by the 25 OWS resulting from
both the forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military decision makers with resource
protection decisions. Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to
life or property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
phenomena with the potential to impact operations. Customer responses matrix to WWAs are
listed in the installation data page hosted at the 25 OWS https://ows.dm.af.mil/
ows_unique/25data/moa/Fairchild_AFB_Data_Page.pdf. All changes or updates to installation
WWAs will be coordinated through the 92 ARW/CC and appropriate Wing agencies.
   2.4.1. Special Weather Statements (SWS). SWSs are special notices issued by the 25 OWS
   to assist military decision makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation personnel/
   supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a
   hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to make
   force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius of the
   center point of the Fairchild AFB runway complex and are defined in the installation data
   page https://ows.dm.af.mil/ows_unique/25data/moa/Fairchild_AFB_Data_Page.pdf.
   2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
   established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
   occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
   environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
   take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius at the center point of the
   runway and are defined in the installation data page https://ows.dm.af.mil/ows_unique/
   25data/moa/Fairchild_AFB_Data_Page.pdf.
   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for Fairchild AFB and extends 5NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning
   warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the National
12                                                   FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


  Lightning Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no
  longer observed within 5NM for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will
  not be cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
  2.4.5. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather ADVISORY is a special product
  notifying an end user when an established environmental condition effecting operations is
  occurring on Fairchild AFB and are defined in the installation data page
  https://ows.dm.af.mil/ows_unique/25data/moa/Fairchild_AFB_Data_Page.pdf.
  2.4.6. Forecast Weather Advisories. Forecast weather ADVISORY is a special product
  notifying an end user when an established environmental condition effecting operations is
  occurring or is expected to occur on Fairchild AFB and are defined in the installation data
  page https://ows.dm.af.mil/ows_unique/25data/moa/Fairchild_AFB_Data_Page.pdf. All
  forecast weather advisories will only be issued when NAOC is present and/or expected to
  arrive in the near future.
  2.4.7. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
  consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
  followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
  second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
  Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
  in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
  and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
  are contained in Attachment 5.
  2.4.8. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from 35
  knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead times
  specified in the installation data page. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time
  (and will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings
  and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. With
  the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it
  becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be
  issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each
  criteria if necessary.
  2.4.9. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
  expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
  amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
  notices.
  2.4.10. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior
  to the expiration of the original notice.
  2.4.11. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are cancelled when the weather
  phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or cancelled
  will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
  when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. See
  para 2.4.4 for cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014                                                                 13


2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the AMOS automated observing system or
   the weather technician are disseminated via ADS. When ADS is nonoperational, the WF will
   relay observations to the following local organizations in order of priority listed in Table 2.2

Table 2.2. Notification Priority.
 1. Tower commercial (509) 247-4545/5152
 2. 92 ARW/CP commercial (509) 247-4051/4056
 3. 25 OWS (520) 228-7338
   2.5.2. TAFs. 25 OWS disseminates TAFs via ADS. If ADS is nonoperational, the WF will
   disseminate TAFs to ATC and 92 ARW/CP via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
   2.5.3. SWSs. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
   that have the potential to affect Fairchild AFB. 25 OWS transmits SWSs to WF leadership
   via email. WF leadership forwards SWSs to 92 ARW leadership.
   2.5.4. WWAs. The 25 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into ADS which will disseminate the
   information to ATC, 92 ARW/CP, 92 OSS/OSAA, MOC, POL. If ADS is out-of-service, 25
   OWS or the WF will make back-up calls. Upon notification, these units will further
   disseminate all WWAs using the pyramid notification scheme shown in Figure 2.1. In
   addition, the 92 ARW/CP disseminates all WWAs via E-Mail and/or AtHoc to appropriate
   base agencies.
       2.5.4.1. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated by the 92
       ARW/CP to the base populace via the AtHoc system, allowing members on base to be
       prepared for dangerous weather. Base Operations disseminates all lightning warnings via
       the Secondary Crash-net.
       2.5.4.2. Tornado Warnings. The 92 ARW/CP has the primary responsibility for
       sounding the base siren for base tornado warning notification. Alternate CP location has
       capabilities to sound the siren for a tornado warning.

Figure 2.1. Weather Pyramid Alerting




2.6. CWW. The WF and ATC have established a CWW as required by AFI 13-204V3 and
AFMAN 15-111. The agreement outlines each unit’s responsibilities when specific
meteorological phenomena are observed. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility
differing from the prevailing surface visibility, local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously
unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or
efficiency of other local operations and resources. All WF technicians must thoroughly
understand and be able to execute every element in the local cooperative weather watch
agreement.
   2.6.1. Fairchild AFB Tower personnel will:
       2.6.1.1. Notify the weather technician when the observed tower prevailing visibility
       decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles.
       2.6.1.2. Report changes in tower prevailing visibility to the weather technician when
       tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles and different from the surface prevailing
       visibility.
       2.6.1.3. Notify the weather technician when PIREPs are received of previously
       unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety
FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014                                                                15


       and efficiency of other local operations and resources. PIREP information will be
       relayed to weather personnel not later than 5 minutes after receipt.
   2.6.2. When augmenting observations Fairchild AFB weather technicians will:
       2.6.2.1. Notify the tower, as soon as possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at the
       official weather observation point decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4
       statute miles.
       2.6.2.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon initial
       receipt of a differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable
       changes at the control tower level. Note: automated stations do not include tower
       visibility in observation remarks.
       2.6.2.3. Use control tower values of prevailing visibility as a guide in determining the
       surface visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings,
       aircraft, etc.
   2.6.3. ATC Limited Observation Training. The 92 OSS/OSW oversees the Fairchild AFB
   Limited Observation Training Program. ATC personnel requiring training should contact the
   WF at DSN 657-5514/Commercial (509) 247-5514 to schedule an appointment. To satisfy
   Limited Observation Training requirements, personnel are required to pass a written exam
   and receive an orientation of the weather facilities.
2.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during duty hours on
frequency 234.8 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV traffic for all aircraft contacts.
For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, the Fairchild WF or 25 OWS can provide
PMSV support through a phone patch to the 92 ARW/CP (DSN 657-4051/4056 or Commercial
(509) 247-4051/4056). PMSV outages are discussed in para 5.3.2
2.8. Emergency Action(s) Response.
   2.8.1. Aircraft Mishap. When notified on an aircraft mishap, the WF will initiate a save of
   applicable data used in the development of any weather products provided and provide this
   data to investigating agencies upon request.
       2.8.1.1. If the WF provided the MWP, the WF will notify the OWS Operations Floor
       Production Supervisor of all aircraft mishaps as soon as possible after notification of the
       event. The WF will coordinate with 25 OWS to save all applicable data and products. If
       products from other OWSs were used, the WF will coordinate with all applicable OWSs
       to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering weather conditions before and after the
       mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct environmental conditions.
       2.8.1.2. If an OWS, 618 AOC/XOW, or another WF provided the MWP, they will
       conduct the data save in coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved.
   2.8.2. SWAP. The WF will initiate SWAP in accordance with criteria listed in table 2.3.
   SWAP ensures sufficient manpower is available to meet the increased demand for timely
   weather information from its supported unit(s) during significant weather events. It is
   imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all agencies to ensure personnel and RP. The WF will initiate a heightened
   METWATCH. The WF forecaster will notify the WF Superintendent and/or WF NCOIC of
   SWAP activation during normal staff duty hours. During non-duty hours, the 25 OWS will
 16                                                FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


   notify the WF standby forecaster when conditions listed in table 2.3 have been met and the
   WF technician will activate SWAP.

Table 2.3. Conditions Requiring SWAP Activation.
SWAP ACTIVATION Criteria
One of the following is issued by the OWS:
Tornado Watch
Tornado Warning
Severe Thunderstorm Warning (Damaging Winds > 50KTS and/or Damaging Hail > ¾ inch)
   2.8.3. WF Forecaster Recall Requirements. The WF forecaster will be notified/recalled
   under the following circumstances:
      2.8.3.1. The 25 OWS notifies the standby forecaster prior to issuing any watch or
      warning for Fairchild AFB.
      2.8.3.2. ATC via the 92 ARW/CP or the 25 OWS notifies the standby forecaster when
      automated weather sensor display data is unavailable.
      2.8.3.3. ATC via the 92nd ARW/CP or the 25 OWS notifies the standby forecaster when
      observations are not being transmitted locally or are not representative of current
      conditions.
   2.8.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive Response.
      2.8.4.1. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, make sure that
      observations and forecasts provided are representative of the location/time of the
      Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear event.
      2.8.4.2. The WF will work closely with Emergency Management or other functions to
      ensure the supported commander gets a consistent picture.
      2.8.4.3. Upon request from Emergency Management or any other agency, the WF will
      obtain/provide Chemical Downwind Messages from the servicing CU.

                                   MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF, 25 OWS, and 618 AOC/XOW support the Fairchild AFB flying and
non-flying missions. This chapter identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather
support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF and the 618 AOC/XOW provide weather support to the flying
units listed in Attachment 6. The bulk of flying operations at Fairchild AFB are supported by
618 AOC/XOW.
3.3. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). MWPs fuse theater scale products with local
mission requirements enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning
and/or execution. The result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant
environmental information for planning and execution. The MWPs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by any OWS and Air Force Weather
Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Flight Weather MWPs. GDSS is the primary command and control (C2) system used

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19 and GRS weather radar to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems provide customers the most
timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence possible. Note: TMQ-53 is a tactical
automated observing system that is used by the WF during contingency and exercise operations.
The TMQ-53 provides a capability that is very similar to the FMQ-19.
   5.2.1. AMOS. AMOS refers to any certified Air Force owed and Air Force or Army
   certified observing system (e.g. AN/FMQ-19, AN/TMQ-53, Automated Surface Observing
   System (ASOS)). The AMOS samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military
   reporting standards.
   5.2.2. Gibson Ridge Software (GRS). The WF utilizes the GRS applications including
   GRLevel2 for viewing Level II radar data and GRLevel3 for viewing Level III data. Both
   viewers feature high speed, high quality radar displays with an intuitive user interface.
   Weather technicians make use of the software to analyze complex radar signatures and obtain
   detailed information on storm intensity, movement, internal circulation, and general wind
   flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate the latest radar information into all
   mission execution forecasts and RP products.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. ADS. Automated Dissemination System (ADS) refers to any Air Force, Army or
   NWS accredited dissemination system (e.g. Joint Environmental Toolkit or Advanced
   Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)). As discussed in para 2.5 of this
   instruction, ADS is the primary system for disseminating forecast, observations, warnings,
   watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup for key aircraft controlling
   agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (234.8 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. For short term outages
   aircrews may contact the ATC who will then relay PIREPS to the WF. During extended
   outages, Airfield Operations will be notified and disseminate a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
   for aircrews to contact 92 ARW/CP and arrange for Giant Talk support, which will consist of
   a phone patch to the WF or the OWS.
 26                                                   FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014


   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.
5.4. Maintenance.

Table 5.1. identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair
weather and communications equipment.

Table 5.1. Equipment Maintenance List.

92 CS/SCOI (Network Maintenance)                           LAN/Internet Connectivity
   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist in the event natural
   disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impacting systems base wide. Significant
   indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while minimal means
   the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in
   Table 5.2 below (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather):

determined that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for reporting
RVR exist.
   A2.1.10. Upon Resumption of Observing Services. A special (SPECI) observation will be
   taken within 15-minutes after the weather technician returns to duty following a break in
   observing coverage or augmentation at the observing location unless a METAR observation
   is filed during that 15-minute period
   A2.1.11. Aircraft Mishap. When notified of an aircraft mishap, the WF will check the latest
   AN/FMQ-19 observation (i.e., METAR/SPECI/OMO (one minute observation) and perform
   augmentation/back-up if required. When operating in a back-up mode WF will immediately
   take a SPECI observation IAW AFI 15-111.
   A2.1.12. Alert Observation. Weather technician will transmit a SPECI observation via the
   ADS. At a minimum the weather technician will notify Command Post of the following
   weather criteria: Winds in magnetic, Temperature, Altimeter setting, and Pressure Altitude.
   A2.1.13. LOCAL Altimeter Setting Observations. Single element LOCALs for altimeter
   setting can be entered in the ADS Form 3813 for dissemination. If passed by voice, altimeter
   LOCALs can be recorded on AF 3803 if not recorded on a local dissemination log or a tape
   recording. If altimeter LOCALs are input into an ADS (e.g., Joint Environmental Toolkit),

FAIRCHILDAFBI15-101 14 MAY 2014                                                             37


A4.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
   A4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or SPECI
   is transmitted.
   A4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human intervention.
       A4.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician signs
       off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
       A4.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
       used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
       manually correcting the observation.
A4.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees using
three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
   A4.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following the
   wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if
   required, the hundreds digit.
   A4.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with wind
   speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
   A4.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying 60
   degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The variable wind
   direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional variability will be
   encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable from 180 degrees to
   240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   A4.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
A4.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen from
the airfield reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
A4.7. Runway Visual Range.
A4.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is mandatory
anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A5.2 lists the present weather codes:
