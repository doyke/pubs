                       MANAGEMENT OF PROPULSION ASSETS

3.1. Program Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM).
   3.1.1. Accountability for ILCM of Programs acquired IAW DOD Directive (DoDD) 5000.1,
   The Defense Acquisition System, is unchanged. The PM accountability and the Program
   Product Support Manager (PSM) responsibilities are contained in AFI 63-101/20-101, which
   take precedence concerning a conflict that may be within this publication regarding
   accountability of the PM or PSM. Therefore, in regard to the relationship between the PM,
   PSM and the DoP, the DoP is a Propulsion Product Group Manager (PGM) and a Product
   Support Integrator (PSI). Note. The terms PM and PGM throughout this publication refers to
   individuals as defined in AFPD 63-1/20-1.
   3.1.2. AFMC/CC has designated DoP responsibilities to the AF Life Cycle Management
   Center Propulsion Management Directorate (AFLCMC/LP). The DoP shall be the single
   focal point for propulsion life cycle management procedures and processes, and the AFMC
   point of entry for support to PMs and MAJCOMs.
3.2. Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS). CEMS, DSD-D042, the
accountable property system of record, shall be used to provide automated information system
capabilities for engine management. TO 00-25-254-1 and TO 00-25-254-2, Comprehensive
Engine Management System Manual for D042, provides CEMS reporting requirements and
procedures. CEMS identifies owning SRAN, status, condition, and configuration information for
all CEMS accountable engines by serial number and Configuration Item Identifier (CII). CEMS
capabilities include the following:
   3.2.1. Engine status reporting, engine inventory management, allocation and distribution,
   pipeline analysis, configuration management, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)
   management and actuarial experience.
   3.2.2. Tracking of engine life limits and life expended for life limited parts. For additional
   guidance, refer to TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment maintenance Inspection,

   formats/forms published in AFMAN 20-116; Propulsion Life Cycle Management for Aerial
   Vehicles.
   3.6.2. Whole engine computations will establish acquisition and distribution of spare engine
   levels. The acquisition computation will establish the procurement quantity of whole spare
   engines the AF needs to acquire in support of the respective weapons system life cycle. The
   distribution computation will establish the quantity and locations where the AF will place
   spare engines.
       3.6.2.1. The acquisition computation establishes the procurement quantity of whole spare
       engines the AF needs to acquire in support of the respective weapons system life cycle.
       3.6.2.2. The distribution computation establishes the quantity and locations where the AF
       will place its spare engines.
       3.6.2.3. Additional computations are accomplished for repair, overhaul, and retention
       requirements.
   3.6.3. The PRS results shall be used for computing engine overhaul and repair requirements.
       3.6.3.1. Engine overhaul requirements will be accomplished at least annually, beginning
       with the aircraft flying hours, engine cycle time, and/or time since last
       maintenance/overhaul (refer to specific engine technical data), to determine the number
       of whole engines requiring maintenance for the current year and for the Five Year
       Defense Plan (FYDP).
       3.6.3.2. Engine Intermediate Maintenance (EIM) repair computations will be
       accomplished at least annually. The EIM Computation Process shall include the repair
       computation for the current and next six years. Note: Computations will be used by
       repair activities/managers to determine recommendations for manpower, facilities, and
       spare levels required to support EIM.

Terms
Acquisition Stock Level Computation Process—The process that determines the number of
whole spare engines required to be procured in support of each Consolidated Sustainment
Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S).
Accountable Asset—Any asset monitored in the EJ-FJ account from initialization into the AF
inventory until the serial number is removed from the system.
Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS)—The “system of record” and tool used
for accurate information on the status, condition and location of engines in the Air Force
inventory throughout their life cycle.
Cost Per Engine Flying Hour (CPEFH)—A flying hour metric for an engine TMS. The values
for calculating CPEFH are a subset of the cost categories obtained from the Engine CAIG
product of the Air Force Total Ownership Cost (AFTOC) database. CPEFH will include all
Federal Stock Classes (FSCs) specific to engine expenses, e.g., 28 and 29, made by flying units
in Element of Expense/Investment Category Code (EEIC) 64402 (flying hour spares) and
consumption data (CSAG-S EEIC 644 & General Supply Division (GSD), EEIC 609) for parts
needed to repair engines. The formula is (CSAG-S plus GSD)/ (aircraft flying hours x installed
engines).
Constrained Engines—When computed spare engine requirements exceed total available spare
engine inventory.
Distribution Stock Level Computation—The computation that determines the whole spare
engine requirements for using MAJCOMs and depots.
Engine Health Management (EHM)—A program integrating hardware, software, maintenance,
processes and people to diagnose, quantify and monitor engine health.
Engine Total Ownership Cost (ETOC)—The total cost to operate an engine type. The formula
is (Depot Level Reparable (DLR) (fly) + GSD + Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance
(DPEM) + 0 Level labor + I Level labor)/engine flying hours. Future includes mod, CIP, 3400,
CEMS feed into ETOC. Source is AFTOC database. ETOC is a subset of engine cost categories
contained in the CAIG.
Engine Trending and Diagnostics—The monitoring by propulsion and Nondestructive
Inspection (NDI) technicians to predict engine health, performance, and structural integrity.
Factor—A value used in computing requirements and assessments. Factors are developed for
peace (readiness), and for war (surge and sustained).
Life—of-Type Buy (Buyout)—Acquisition of enough total spares required to support the entire
*-planned weapons system’s life cycle prior to ceasing engine production.
Mission, Design, and Series (MDS)—Standard nomenclature used to identify aircraft and
missiles.
Mission Essential Item—An item or repair part whose absence renders the supported system or
end item inoperable.
Non—accountable Item—Assemblies and/or parts tracked by CEMS for reasons of life
limitations or logistical criticality.

Non—Constrained Engines—Refers to the circumstance when total spare engine inventory
meets or exceeds computed spare engine requirements.
Process Owner—An individual with the authority and responsibility for overseeing the
development and execution of a process.
Propulsion Requirements System (PRS)—The AF standard system for the computation of,
whole engine stock levels for both acquisition and distribution, overhaul requirements, and
retention requirements.
Reliability Centered Maintenance—An analytical process to determine the appropriate failure
management strategies, including preventive maintenance requirements and other actions needed
to ensure safe operations while balancing readiness and costs.
Retrograde—An engine or item being returned from the operating unit to source of repair.
SRAN Engine Manager (SEM)—Manager of engines under an assigned SRAN and is
responsible for CEMS reporting.
Type, Model, Series (TMS)—Standard nomenclature for engines according to MIL-STD-879.
War Readiness Engines (WRE) Levels—The quantity of net serviceable engines required to
sustain an operational unit’s war effort until resupply is established.
