SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has transferred from ACC to AFGSC. This document is substantially revised
and must be completely reviewed. Aircrew training priority has shifted to the nuclear mission.
The Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) has significant changes. Non-RAP sorties are renamed to
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) sorties. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) sorties and missions
are redefined. A sortie is defined as a takeoff and a landing. Missions are now tracked
separately from sorties. Each mission now requires a separate certification brief. Sorties and
missions now have 1/3/6 month lookbacks. Not all aircrew members require qualification in all
missions. All training events are defined. Where necessary, paragraphs are renumbered to
accommodate updates. Other changes include updating the currency and supervision
requirements for Dual Seat Navigator, updating the currency and supervision requirements for
Combat Mission Pilots, incorporating Weapons Qualification Training as a phase of training, and
incorporating specific requirements for Nuclear Mission Qualification Training. All changes
from the previous RAP Tasking Memorandum (RTM) are incorporated. Future RTMs may be
used to provide guidance addendums.

       1.2.2.3. Review subordinate unit supplemental instructions and supplemental training
       programs annually.
       1.2.2.4. Continually optimize RAP tasking in support Combatant Commander (COCOM)
       evolving objectives.
   1.2.3. DRUs will:
       1.2.3.1. Provide standard instructional texts to support operational weapons/tactics
       training. Distribute the document electronically to the following organizations: CAF
       wing/group, NAF/A3/A3V/OV and MAJCOM.

       Capability (DOC) statements and COCOM Operations Plan (OPLAN) requirements.
       Assist subordinate units in management of training programs, ensure programs meet unit
       needs, and provide necessary staff support. AFGSC wings/groups will also assist AFRC
       unit training programs as required/requested.
       1.2.4.2. Attach Aircrew Position Indicator (API)-6/8 flyers to a flying squadron.
       Reference AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements, and Unit Manning
       Document for API codes and descriptions.
       1.2.4.3. Designate the training level to which each API–6 (AFRC: all flyers) will train.
       Upon request provide respective MAJCOM A3T with a list of Basic Mission Capable

       manning position designations annually. OG/CCs will report changes in position
       designations as they occur to respective MAJCOM A3T.
       1.2.4.4. If applicable (initial or significant changes), forward supplements of this
       instruction and other supporting documents to HQ AFGSCA3T for review each training
8                                                      AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


       cycle. Review supplements each training cycle. (AFRC: units will forward for review to
       AFRC/A3T through 10AF/A3T)
    1.2.5. Squadron (SQ) supervision (AFRC: Appropriate operations supervisor) will:
       1.2.5.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs,
       experience, and proficiencies of assigned/attached aircrew members. Develop programs
       to ensure training objectives meet unit DOC statements. Squadron commanders have the
       authority and are expected to tailor their unit’s training program to focus on those
       missions, events, and Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) most relevant to their
       next deployment vulnerability while considering prioritizing resources available.
       Deployment Prep Messages, COCOM guidance, and previous operations ―Lessons
       Learned‖ are the basis for developing the squadron’s training program.
       1.2.5.2. Review training and evaluation records of newly assigned aircrew and those
       completing formal training to determine training required to achieve BMC or CMR and
       to ensure training met the provisions of this instruction. This review is accomplished
       prior to newly assigned aircrew members flying in unit aircraft.
           1.2.5.2.1. Squadron training flights will monitor the Mission Qualification Training
           (MQT) process of squadron aircrew.
       1.2.5.3. Ensure RAP missions are oriented to developing fully combat ready skills and
       practice tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission. See
       Attachment 2 for RAP mission definitions.
       1.2.5.4. Review qualifications and training requirements of Flight Surgeons (FS) and
       determine appropriate flight restrictions.
       1.2.5.5. Determine mission certifications and training event qualifications individual
       BMC aircrew members will maintain.
       1.2.5.6. Determine utilization of BMC aircrew members.
       1.2.5.7. Determine how many and specify which BMC and CMR aircrew members will
       carry special capabilities/qualifications/certifications.
       1.2.5.8. Identify the level of supervision necessary to accomplish the required training,
       unless specifically directed.
       1.2.5.9. Determine the breadth and depth of the supervisory review required for weapons
       delivery recordings.
       1.2.5.10. Provide support to the wing/group by developing the unit training programs.
       1.2.5.11. Monitor individual assigned/attached aircrew member currencies and
       requirements.
       1.2.5.12. Ensure aircrew members only participate in sorties, events, and tasks for which
       they are adequately prepared, trained, and current. If the aircrew member is non-current,
       ensure they are under instructor supervision.
       1.2.5.13. Submit squadron RAP training health status reports periodically throughout the
       training cycle (N/A 49 TES/340WPS). AFGSC combat coded squadrons will submit
       their training health reports to HQ AFGSC/A3TO every 4th month during the training
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 9


      cycle (due 2nd Monday in Feb, Jun, Oct; thru NAF/A3). 93 BS (FTU) will submit an
      annual training report to HQ AFGSC/A3TO through 10AF/A3T and AFRC/A3T.
      Quarterly FTU reports may be requested through 10AF/A3T. Squadrons may submit an
      out of cycle report anytime HHQ assistance is required to prepare for DOC or AEF
      tasking. Prior to submitting the annual report, units are reminded to prorate incomplete
      training per Para. 4.3.6 Report squadron CMR status per each mission set. Refer to
      Table 1.4, 4.1, and 4.3 to determine CMR status.
          1.2.5.13.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
          accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc.
          Example: unable to accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training
          weapons.
          1.2.5.13.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
          effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is
          limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may
          include support hardware and software.
          1.2.5.13.3. Report all deviations from these training requirements, after proration, to
          HQ AFGSC/A3TO (thru NAF/A3) with the Post-AEF (end of the 1st month after
          AEF vulnerability period) RAP Training Health Report IAW AFKN AFGSC A3TO
          COP. This report will include requirements waived by OG/CC. Email training
          reports      to:      HQ        AFGSC/A3TO           RAP        program       manager,
          afgsc.a3tworkflow@barksdale.af.mil, DSN 781-4567. Commanders should use the
          ―Remarks‖ section in Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) to highlight
          specific decisions on training or equipment priorities as they relate to DOC tasking to
          communicate shortfalls.
      1.2.5.14. Ensure newly assigned aircrew members (both Initial Qualification Training
      (IQT) and squadron transfers) are familiar with local area procedures by completing a
      unit directed local area procedures course to emphasize applicable squadron OIs, local
      base instructions, OGOIs, and local base supplements to AFIs. Training should also
      include WST MQT-1 simulator training. See Para. 3.2.5. and Para. 3.2.5.1 WST MQT-1
      profile can be waived by SQ/CC for aircrew members already familiar with the local
      flight area.
   1.2.6. Individual aircrew members will:
      1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records or confirm electronic transmission to
      assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifications and training requirements.
      1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
      guidelines of this volume.
1.3. Processing Changes.
   1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to MAJCOM A3T on AF IMT
   847, Recommendation for Change of Publication IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals
   Program.
   1.3.2. MAJCOMs will approve and forward recommendations to HQ AFGSC/A3.
   1.3.3. HQ AFGSC/A3 will:
 10                                                     AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


       1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic volume with all MAJCOM A3s.
       1.3.3.2. Process recommendations for change.
       1.3.3.3. Forward recommended changes to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for HQ USAF/A3/5
       approval.
       1.3.3.4. Address time sensitive changes by an immediate action message.
       1.3.3.5. MAJCOM/A3s will determine training requirements for their subordinate units.
       These training requirements will be coordinated through HQ AFGSC/A3. This includes
       making changes, additions, or deletions to this instruction at anytime. These changes
       may be via MAJCOM supplement, RAP Tasking Memorandum, or immediate change
       messages. All changes will use HQ AFGSC/A3 as an info addressee.
1.4. Training. The breadth and depth of B-52 mission capabilities preclude inexperienced and
many experienced aircrew members from sufficient training to achieve qualification and
maintaining currency in every CMR mission. Training programs are designed to progress
aircrew from IQT or Transition/Re-Qualification Training (TX), to Weapons Qualification
Training (WQT) and MQT, and then finally to Continuation Training (CT). These training
phases use a building block process incorporating mission essential competencies throughout
each phase. Beginning with IQT/TX, each phase establishes the basic aircraft operational
competencies and general weapons competencies required for aircrew in every phase of training.
The MQT phase of training focuses on specialized weapons (delivered via WQT) and
employment tactics specific to the unit’s DOC and tasked missions. The CT phase of training
maintains and enhances all mission essential competencies, including basic aircraft operation,
specialized weapons, employment tactics, and unit tasked missions. The ultimate goal of these
training programs is to train aircrew members with essential mission skill sets supporting
required unit mission taskings.
   1.4.1. IQT and TX. These courses provide the training necessary to initially qualify or re-
   qualify aircrew members in a basic duty flying position without regard to the unit's mission.
   Upon completion of IQT or TX, the aircrew member attains BAQ status. BAQ is a
   prerequisite for MQT. Except for General Officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-
   term qualification status. MAJCOM A3 is the waiver authority for any aircrew member,
   other than general officers above the wing level, to remain in BAQ for longer than six
   months. Aircrew who remain in BAQ status for more than six months will be grounded
   (except general officers above the wing level and waived aircrew members).
   1.4.2. WQT. This phase of training provides specialized weapons qualification training
   throughout IQT, TX, MQT and CT phases. WQT for specific weapons is a pre-requisite for
   Nuclear CMR and Conventional CMR. WQT requirements for Nuclear CMR and
   Conventional CMR are IAW Chapter 5 and as amended by current RAP Tasking
   Memorandum (RTM).
   1.4.3. MQT. This phase of training provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-
   qualify aircrew in a specific flying duty position and to perform the missions assigned to a
   specific unit. Aircrew members maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion
   of MQT is a pre-requisite for BMC and CMR.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             11


  1.4.4. CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic
  flying skills contained in Table 4.2 These skills ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The
  second aspect of CT consists of specific mission-related training sortie and event types
  required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions. Both aspects of CT are directed in this
  volume and the current RAP Tasking Memorandum.
  1.4.5. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). The RAP is designed to focus training on capabilities
  needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Following completion of IQT/TX the
  aircrew member is assigned to either a CMR position or a BMC position. MQT will reflect
  the unit’s requirements for the CMR or BMC position. Aircrews are then trained in all the
  core missions of a specific unit through MQT, unless exempted in Chapter 4. The RAP
  provides the minimum required mix of annual events, missions, and sorties an aircrew
  member must accomplish to sustain combat mission readiness. Accurate reporting of RAP
  missions and events permit the MAJCOM to apply resources, policy, or guidance to address
  or prevent shortfalls.
     1.4.5.1. CMR. When assigned to a CMR position, aircrew members will train to the
     CMR level commensurate with their experience level as defined in Para. 6.14 SQ/CC
     will assign aircrew members to core CMR mission sets (MR42, MR10A, MR10B) ref.
     Table 1.3. The SQ/CC will add additional mission assignments as deemed necessary to
     meet the squadron DOC statement. Aircrew members need not be certified in all
     missions sets. SQ/CC may elect for certain aircrew members to maintain a familiar or
     BMC level in special mission sets. Each squadron will maintain an instructor cadre
     capable of instruction in the special mission sets.
         1.4.5.1.1. CMR Positions. All designated combat coded unit Regular Air Force (Reg
         AF) API-1/2 positions, flying SQ/CC, and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR
         positions. OG/CCs may designate other API-6 positions not assigned to a flying
         squadron as CMR. (For AFRC: Any API-1/2/6 may be designated CMR at OG/CC
         discretion.) CMR aircrew members will maintain proficiency and certification in all
         missions assigned by the SQ/CC. CMR aircrew members will maintain currencies
         which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties,
         missions, and events), and all mission ground training ref. Para. 1.5.5 Failure to
         complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to Non-CMR
         (N-CMR) status, unless waived by MAJCOM/A3 or the delegated representative.
             1.4.5.1.1.1. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to
             train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1/2s to CMR
             and designate the corresponding percentage of overage crews to BMC. Total
             Force Integration (TFI) personnel from another MAJCOM will not be designated
             BMC without coordination with MAJCOM, Wing, and A3T coordination and
             approval. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew members
             with at least 50%, if available, designated CMR.
     1.4.5.2. BMC. When assigned to a BMC position, aircrew members will train to the
     BMC level commensurate with their experience level as defined in Para. 6.14
     Commanders must prioritize crew allocation mission sets per unit DOC. SQ/CC will
     assign aircrew members to core BMC missions (MR42, MR10A, MR10B) ref. Table 1.3
 12                                                     AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


      The SQ/CC will add additional mission assignments as deemed necessary to meet the
      squadron DOC statement.
          1.4.5.2.1. BMC Positions. All other wing aircrew member positions, not identified in
          Para. 1.4.5.1.1, are designated BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned to
          aircrew members who have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff
          functions that directly support the flying operation. These are FTU instructors,
          Weapon School instructors, or Operational Test aircrew members. However, these
          aircrew members are required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either
          in lieu of, or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMC
          aircrews maintain familiarization with all unit DOC missions. They may also
          maintain proficiency and certification in some of the unit DOC missions. The intent is
          for BMC aircrew to attain proficiency and CMR in 30 days or less. BMC aircrew
          members accomplish all mission-related ground training designated by their SQ/CC.
          BMC aircrew may deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are
          proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.
          Failure to complete BMC required training results in regression to Non-BMC (N-
          BMC) status.
      1.4.5.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrews that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will
      accomplish the requirements according to Para. 4.3.4 N-CMR/N-BMC aircrew, due to
      regression, may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) in which they
      are current, qualified, and proficient. N-CMR/N-BMC aircrew may not perform
      regressed RAP training missions without supervision until SQ/CC approved
      recertification program is complete ref. Para. 1.5.4
      1.4.5.4. Specialized Training. Specialized training is any special skills training
      necessary to carry out the unit's assigned missions that are not required by every aircrew.
      Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as Flight Lead Upgrade Program
      (FLUG), Combat Flight Instructor Course (CFIC), special mission sets (MR10C,
      MR10D, MR10E), and etcetera. Specialized training is normally accomplished after an
      aircrew member has completed MQT in assigned CMR or BMC mission sets and is
      normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, aircrew in
      CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities, qualifications, and/or certifications
      as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished ref. Chapter 6.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against expected threats, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This volume provides
   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying or operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop, validate, and maintain
   currency of B-52 training programs when tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. IAW established
   Memorandum of Agreement, HQ AFGSC/A3T will submit requests for TRSS support
   through HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC
   TRSS. Designated test units may develop syllabi to upgrade Operation Test aircrew in
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   13


   support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the OG/CC and submitted to
   ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, enhance mission accomplishment, and enhance mission safety.
   RAP training missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect
   procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and
   opposition capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are
   desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe
   recovery procedures, tactical deception, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing).
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
      necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
      introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor of
      like specialty may be required.
      1.5.4.2. Instructor pilots and Flight Lead (FL) qualified SQ supervisors may allow any
      pilot to lead limited portions of a mission if appropriately briefed. Only utilize this
      provision to allow the pilot to practice events in which they are already qualified or to
      help determine if the pilot is ready for Flight Lead Upgrade Program (FLUG). In either
      case the instructor or SQ supervisor is responsible for the flight (must be flying in same
      formation).
          1.5.4.2.1. FL training should include how to pass tactical lead to their wingman for
          specific tasks. As the tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the
          flight, but the flight lead retains overall authority and responsibility.
      1.5.4.3. Mission leads are responsible for making employment decisions to ensure B-52
      formation(s) accomplish the mission IAW the mission commander’s plan.
   1.5.5. Aircrew will accomplish ground and/or ancillary training as required by AFI 11-
   202V1, this volume, and AFI 36-2201V1, Training Development, Delivery, and Evaluation.
   1.5.6. Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,
   countermeasures, aircrew training devices and dissimilar aircraft.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management.
   1.6.1. The 12-month training cycle is concurrent with the fiscal year. Each RAP
   qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, RAP mission types, specific
   weapons qualifications, and associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit
   commanders. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle
   except where specifically exempted.
   1.6.2. The total number of sorties for a CMR or BMC level is the first factor in managing an
   individual's RAP qualification.
      1.6.2.1. For the purpose of this regulation, takeoff and landing are the only event
      requirements for sortie credit. The intent is to reflect the fact that every sortie regardless
      of event activity requires a level of BAQ proficiency regardless of crew position. See
      sortie definitions in Attachment 2.
14                                                     AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


     1.6.2.2. Sorties should include a mission emphasis but is not required for sortie credit.
     See Table 1.1 for sortie minimums.
     1.6.2.3. RAP sortie credit in the WST is not permitted. See also Para. 1.7.5
  1.6.3. Track missions separately from sorties. See mission definitions in Attachment 2.
  Each mission set has a separate certification brief required ref Para 3.2.3
     1.6.3.1. SQ/CCs will focus training through mission emphasis. Mission emphasis is a
     crew concept. Crews will only log missions planned, executed, and debriefed as a crew.
     Credit no more than two different missions on a sortie. For RAP mission credit, mission
     type events must be completed as specified in Attachment 2.
         1.6.3.1.1. RAP mission credit is given up to 50% of the ―12-Month Mission
         Minimum‖ requirement in Table 1.3 for each mission accomplished in the WST.
         See also Para 1.7.5
     1.6.3.2. SQ/CCs have the flexibility to choose the mission sets appropriate to training
     assets available. Mission set requirements are depicted in Table 1.3, which also defines
     Inexperienced (I) and Experienced (E) guidelines to be followed with minor variances
     authorized. Variations may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC ref. Para.
     4.3.3. SQ/CC determines certification in a mission based on consideration of MAJCOM
     guidance and the individual's capabilities.
  1.6.4. Unless otherwise tasked, the SQ/CC's first priority is to ensure designated aircrew
  members meet all nuclear mission (MR42) training requirements and CMR-N status.
  1.6.4.1. Unless otherwise directed in the RTM, 11BS FTU instructors will maintain BMC-N.
     1.6.4.2. During Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking cycles, CMR mission training
     priorities will be in direct support of that tasking a minimum of 30 days prior and
     throughout the duration of the assigned AEF tasking. Training should focus on specific
     mission elements anticipated by the COCOM. (AFRC: Allow traditional reservists 45
     days prior to deployment.)
         1.6.4.2.1. Units should reconstitute and return to pre-deployment CMR status in core
         missions within 45 days.
  1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
     1.6.5.1. A one-month lookback at the CMR sortie and mission rate.
     1.6.5.2. Qualification in all events required at CMR .
     1.6.5.3. Must be current in RAP mission related ground training to include a current
     mission certification.
  1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew to train and maintain special capabilities,
  qualifications, or certifications. Specialized training is normally accomplished in addition to
  baseline CMR or BMC mission and event requirements, except for mission commander and
  flight lead training.

  unable, refer to regression, Para. 4.3.3
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               15


   1.6.8. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew's experience level on the
   last day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.9. Units converting to another MDS may fly aircrew in CMR positions at the BMC rate
   until one month prior to the operationally ready date if the Utilization (UTE) rate will not
   support CMR sortie rates. CMR aircrew should fly at a CMR rate for the month prior to
   IOC.
   1.6.10. RAP Reporting. Squadron RAP training health status reports are intended to provide
   a snapshot assessment of squadron readiness as supported by RAP guidance. Additionally,
   this report provides an opportunity for the squadron commander to provide valuable feedback
   to the MAJCOM on the overall effectiveness of the ready aircrew training program. The
   formatted report templates and instructions are located in the ―RAP Reporting Tools‖ section
   on the AFKN HQ AFGSC/A3TO CoP and consist of the following:
      1.6.10.1. Commander’s E-Memo. Memorandum originating from the squadron
      commander summarizing results or unresolved issues since the last report, current
      training plan summary, and significant shortfalls or limiting factors (LIMFACS) affecting
      training.
          1.6.10.1.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
          accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc.
          Example: unable to accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training
          weapons.
          1.6.10.1.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
          effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is
          limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may
          include support hardware and software.
          1.6.10.1.3. Report only significant shortfalls or LIMFACS of events/sorties that
          affect 15% or greater of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions or
          specific assistance required if able. AFGSC will address noted shortfalls/LIMFACS
          while the training cycle is under way.
      1.6.10.2. Training Health Memo. A formatted squadron training health memorandum
      (attachment to the commander’s memo) with specific fields summarizing crew, sortie and
      mission training issues.
          1.6.10.2.1. Report a crew as CMR when an aircrew member meets CMR sortie
          lookback, nuclear mission (MR42) lookback, core conventional mission (MR10A and
          MR10B) lookback, maintains flight currencies, and has completed all nuclear and
          conventional ground training requirements.
          1.6.10.2.2. Report the squadron RAP sortie plan (sorties required, scheduled and
          flown) for each month of the RAP training cycle.
          1.6.10.2.3. Report the number of aircrew that meets CMR status for each mission set.
          Refer to Table 1.4 to determine CMR status.
      1.6.10.3. Future RAP Taking Messages may direct additional reporting criteria.

  1.7.1. RAP sortie (SR00) and event requirements (see Attachment 2) apply to CMR and
  BMC aircrew. The standard sortie requirements in Table 1.1 establish the minimum number
  of sorties per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. See Table 1.3. for further
  definition of minimum mission requirements by sortie.
  1.7.2. BAQ requirements are in addition to RAP requirements. Table 1.2 lists these BAQ
  sortie types. These sorties ensure basic aircrew skills are maintained to operate in the civil
  airspace environment safely. Some sorties are considered Special Capability Events. Special
  Capability Events are events that require special events or exercises to achieve credit (See
  Attachment 2). These sorties are not standalone events. A RAP sortie must be logged in
  order to log a BAQ or Special Capability Event.
  1.7.3. Collateral or Cost of Business sortie requirements must be considered when
  developing unit flying hour programs (HQ AFGSC/A3B). These sorties are not directly
  related to combat employment training but are necessary in day-to-day unit operations.
  These include but are not limited to: instructor sorties, ferry flights, incentive/orientation
  flights, deployments, and air shows. For the training cycle, the MAJCOM allocates a block
  of sorties to the unit for these purposes.
  1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
  for non-effective training sorties. OG/CCs will coordinate required operational attrition
  sorties with maintenance group commanders via the AFI 21-165, Aircraft Flying and
  Maintenance Scheduling Procedures, and scheduling process. When possible, operational
  attrition sorties will be executed concurrently with scheduled maintenance attrition sorties.
  Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie, RAP or BAQ, is planned but a major
  portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to poor weather, air
  aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it is essential that
  non-effective sorties are logged and tracked appropriately.
     1.7.4.1. -(AFRC: N/A.) Units will report net non-effective sorties to AFGSC in the RAP
     Training Report ref. Para. 1.2.5.13.
  1.7.5. Aircrew Training Devices (ATD) are an integral part of a training sortie program
  development plan.
     1.7.5.1. ATD training.
         1.7.5.1.1. Instructors may take mission and applicable event credit when instructing a
         trainer.
         1.7.5.1.2. Units will develop ATD training profiles to meet mission requirements.
         1.7.5.1.3. Fill all crew positions for all integrated simulator missions.
         1.7.5.1.4. Aircrew will use motion during training profiles when available.
         1.7.5.1.5. When creditable, only 50% (rounded up) of the proficiency event totals in
         Table 4.2 may be accomplished in the ATD.
         1.7.5.1.6. WST can be used for RAP mission credit, but not RAP sortie credit,
         assuming the aircrew accomplishes events per MR10X or MR42 descriptions. Dual
         logging missions for RAP mission credit is not allowed in the WST.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             17


      1.7.5.2. Nuclear Training. In the nuclear training environment, the profiles in the ATD
      can provide unique training unavailable on normal airborne sorties. These ATD profiles
      will count toward mission credit when crews accomplish training objectives as described
      in MR42 (Attachment 2).
      1.7.5.3. Conventional Training. When combined with a sortie’s mission planning, the
      ATD provides enhanced flight profile training. The annual ATD requirements represent
      the minimum number of mission profiles that must include the ATD as a mission
      prerequisite. Plan conventional ATD missions as a prerequisite to the equivalent mission
      focused sortie (i.e., MP/WST/Sortie). When accomplishing this ATD as a standalone
      event, SQ/CC will ensure scheduled time is sufficient to accomplish MR10X mission
      requirements. (Attachment 2)

      Notes:

       1. N/A for RN/N/EW/. A night sortie may be dual logged with the
       appropriate RAP sortie. Once pilots are trained and equipped, all night
       sorties should include the use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG)s. All NVG
       aided missions should include covert/lights-out training. Aircrew must be
       acting in this capacity to log this type sortie.
       2. 50% of LFEs may be in the WST using DMO.

       3. SQ/CC designates event types with ( ) requirements to best meet the SQ
       and Wing DOC statements.

Notes:
1. WST must meet required mission elements for mission credit. Ref. Para. 1.6.3.
2. BMC ATD requirements are 50% of CMR unless otherwise noted.
3. This mission type is a CMR-N event accomplished either in flight or in ATD.
4. Conventional WST requirements. WST mission profiles will be a min of 2 hours of mission highlights from
the MR10X mission descriptions. This profile should be part of a mission plan, simulator, debrief, flight,
debrief sequence. If the flight cancels or is unavailable, mission planning and debriefing will be part of the
scheduled simulator activity. MR10X missions will not be dual logged in the simulator.
5. EW is highly encouraged but not mandatory for basic training missions in this mission category. EW can
maintain CMR at the BMC rate for this mission. The intent is to reflect that an EW is not required during a
mission that simulates a non-threat environment.
6. Requirement applies when assigned to a particular mission set. For units without a WST and AFRC, the
minimum requirement is two MR42s and one for all other mission sets.
7. Experienced BMC aircrew members should meet three-month mission lookback. Although an aircrew
member can meet one-month lookback without accomplishing a mission, experienced BMC aircrew members
should attempt to meet three-month lookback requirement.
       1.7.5.4. To determine CMR-N, complete this matrix for MR42. To determine CMR-C,
       complete this matrix for each conventional mission where the aircrew member is
       assigned and certified. See example in Table 1.4 Reference Table 4.3. for currency
       events that affect CMR.

Figure 1.1. CMR Decision Matrix.




      1.7.5.5. Example: (ref Tables 1.1 and 1.3) Capt Joe Pilot, (inexperienced pilot) has been
      assigned to the core CMR missions (MR42, MR10A, MR10B). He was reported CMR-N
      and CMR-C in Jan. Each month Feb-May, he flew two ERCCs, one MR42, one
      MR10A/B, and accomplished one MR42 in the WST. In June he did not perform any
      MR10A/B missions because of an IFE on the scheduled mission. In July, he only
      accomplished one MR10A/B sortie and one MR42 WST. He is current in all Nuclear and
      assigned conventional CMR ground training. In this scenario, Capt Pilot fails one-month
      sortie lookback for having flown only one of the required four sorties. He also fails
      three-month lookback with 9 sorties instead of the 11 required sorties. However, he
      meets the six-month lookback with exactly the 21 required sorties. He fails MR42 one
      and three-month mission lookback, but meets six-month mission lookback. His resulting
      CMR status is CMR-N, but not CMR-C. He failed to meet lookback in both MR10A and
      MR10B in June and was placed in probation. He met one-month lookback in MR10B but
      failed to achieve one-month lookback in MR10A and now has to re-certify MR10A.

1.9. Mission Scenario and Weapons Employment Recording.
   1.9.1. Aircrew members will use all available recording devices to document mission
   scenarios and release training to the maximum extent possible. These recording devices
   include Weapons Impact Scoring Set (WISS), screen capture, Range Integrated
   Instrumentation and Integrated Tactics Assessment Systems (RIIS & ITAS), GPS trail, audio
   recording devices, FRMT-15, and other recording systems. Aircrew members must review
   their recordings/results after every mission.
      1.9.1.1. The review should include the following items: weapons release parameters
      (both planned and actual), accuracy, adherence to training rules IAW AFI 11-214, Air
      Operations Rules and Procedures and range specific guidance, communications
      procedures and discipline, flight discipline, and tactical employment IAW AFTTP 3-
      1.B52, B-52 Tactical Employment, AFTTP 3-3.B-52, B-52 Combat Aircraft
      Fundamentals, maneuvers and tactics.
1.10. Aircrew member Utilization Policy.
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure that wing/group tactical aircrew members (API-1/2/6s Ref.
   Para. 1.11) fill authorized positions IAW unit manning documents and properly designate
   aircrew member status. The overall objective is that aircrew members perform combat-
   related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrew members to valid, short-term tasks (escort
   officer, Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually
   weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew member tasking, flying proficiency,
   currency, and experience.
      1.10.1.1. Inexperienced aircrew members will not be given non-flying primary or
      additional duties in the first six months of their initial operational assignment. These
      aircrew members will use this time to focus purely on MQT, unit weapons and tactics
      training, and honing flying skill sets. The intent is to provide aircrew members an
      opportunity to gain experience in their primary Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) before
      being tasked by other SQ duties.
   1.10.2. Duties that may be assigned to CAF API-1/2 aircrew members are weapons and
   tactics officer, programmer, scheduling officer, flying safety officer, Supervisor of Flying
   (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ
   Standardization/ Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), squadron flight equipment officer
   (FEO), electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. In
   some instances, such as additional duty flying safety officers or SELOs, API-1/2s may be
   attached to the wing/group. API-1/2s will not be attached to wing/group staffs or man
   wing/group staff positions unless total wing API-1/2 manning is 100 percent or better. CCs
   will ensure wing/group staff aircrew members (API-6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM
   manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.
   1.10.3. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from primary
   duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.
1.11. Sortie Allocation and Manning Guidance.
   1.11.1. In general, inexperienced API-1/2 aircrew members should receive sortie allocation
   priority over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   23


         1.11.1.1. Formal Training Units (FTU and USAFWS). Formal syllabus training,
         Instructor Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or
         SEFE duties (to include API-5 pilot physicians not on instructor orders).
         1.11.1.2. Combined Formal Training (FTU and USAFWS) and Operational Units.
         Formal syllabus training, CMR API-1/2, MQT API-1/2, CMR API-6, MQT API-6, BMC,
         API-5 aircrew physicians, others.
         1.11.1.3. Operational Units. CMR API-1/2, MQT API-1/2, CMR API-6, MQT API-6,
         BMC (to include API-5 aircrew physicians).
         1.11.1.4. Test Units. Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to prepare
         for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on
         primary missions, API-5 aircrew physicians.
   1.11.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents. Regular Air Force
   wings converting to new Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) are authorized one SQ
   equivalent of additional RPI/API-6s during the conversion period. However, total wing staff
   flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipment.
   1.11.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following
   aircrew will maintain formal instructor status: WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, or OG/CD.
   1.11.4. API-8 (above wing level staff, also including HQ ACC/TRSS Det or HQ AFGSC/IG
   API-6) rated personnel flying authorizations and test aircrew will be IAW AFI 11-401 and
   MAJCOM guidance. They will fly the BMC rate; however, they are not required to
   complete BMC specific missions/events nor maintain lookback requirements. Accomplish
   BAQ requirements within their BMC number of sorties. Units should provide assigned API
   6/8 flyers adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements. However, API-6
   flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. API-6
   flyers will accomplish BAQ requirements with allotted BMC sorties. API-8, AFGSC IG, HQ
   ACCTRSS staff flyers will strive to accomplish BAQ requirements with allotted BMC
   sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request relief
   IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached
   API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
   Wings are allocated flying hours for attached API-8s.
   1.11.5. There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR aircrew. Table 1.5 defines the
   maximum sortie allowance for other aircrew. On occasion, unique operations may require
   aircrew to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized. However, this may
   affect training of other aircrew members.

                                          Chapter 2

                                   FORMAL TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines formal training of aircrew members into unit aircraft.
Formal training includes IQT, and Transition (TX)/Requalification/Senior Officer training. This
training will normally be conducted during formal syllabus courses at the formal training unit
(FTU). In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available within a reasonable
time, local units may conduct IQT IAW provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will normally
be conducted using appropriate USAF Transition or Requalification Training Course syllabus
tracks, flow programs, and requirements. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM
assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training. The following guidance applies
only to other than formal course IQT.
2.2. Training Management.
   2.2.1. HQ AFGSC/A3TO in conjunction with HQ AFGSC/A3TA and HQ AFPC/DPAR,
   determines FTU output requirements and publishes an annual schedule of classes. HQ
   AFGSC/A3TA is responsible for initial quota assignments and managing direct quota
   allocations and day to day adjustments.
   2.2.2. The FTU determines the annual schedule of classes, and provides qualification
   training IAW the appropriate course syllabus.
   2.2.3. Units and individual aircrew members must ensure all entry prerequisites and
   requirements are met. Individuals arriving at the FTU for training without having all
   prerequisites met or waived may be returned to their home station at their unit's expense.
   2.2.4. The FTU notifies HQ AFPC/DPAOC (info HQ AFGSC/A1KA/A3TO/A3TA, HQ
   AFRC/A3T, and the gaining unit) when student orders need to be extended beyond the
   established graduation date. Units will ensure student temporary duty (TDY) orders
   authorize variations in itinerary.
   2.2.5. The FTU will provide the aircrew member with his/her completed training folder (to
   include official documentation of checkride completion, FTU Student Closeout Training
   Report, ARMS report documenting all completed training, and any other applicable waivers)
   to hand-carry to his gaining unit upon completion of training.
2.3. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Qualifies aircrew members in the B-52.
Prerequisites and time limitations are listed in Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcements (ETCA) and the B-52 IQT syllabus.
2.4. Requalification/Transition Training Course (TX Course).
   2.4.1. The TX Course requalifies non-current B-52 aircrew members. Prerequisites and time
   limitations are listed in Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)
   and the B-52 TX syllabus. For details concerning the senior officer training course refer to
   Para. 2.8
   2.4.2. Individuals requiring requalification training may not be assigned to RAP CMR or
   BMC until completion of MQT.

   2.4.3. (N/A AFRC) Units will assign re-qualified aircrew members to an active flying
   position for a minimum of 18 months.
2.5. Upgrade Training. Prerequisites and time limitations are listed in the Air Force ETCA
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp and the associated syllabus.
   2.5.1. Category I (CAT-I) and Category II (CAT-II) training. CAT-I and CAT-II training
   definitions and requirements can be found in the FTU syllabus. Aircrew members in CAT-I
   training must retain currencies in primary crew position (pilot or navigator). Aircrew
   members in CAT-II training will retain previous academic training and weapons
   qualifications and mission certifications in their new position.
   2.5.2. The Aircraft Commander Upgrade Course (B52AC) qualifies current B-52 pilots (P)
   as aircraft commanders.
       2.5.2.1. The Aircraft Commander Upgrade Academic Course (B52ACA) is the in-unit
       training version of the B-52AC training.
   2.5.3. The Radar Navigator Upgrade Course (B52RNUP) qualifies current B-52 navigators
   as radar navigators.
       2.5.3.1. The Radar Navigator Upgrade Academic Course (B52RNUPA) is the in-unit
       training version of the B-52RNUP training.
2.6. Instructor Training. CFIC attendance is a requisite for B-52 flight instructor status.
Flight instructor status is then recommended by the SQ/CC and granted by the OG/CC.
   2.6.1. Aircrew members are identified for CFIC attendance through the squadron Training
   Review Board (TRB) process. Prerequisites and time limitations are listed on the ETCA
   website and the B-52 CFIC syllabus. Attending another aircraft's CFIC does not satisfy B-52
   CFIC attendance requirements. Failure to complete the initial instructor check IAW AFI 11-
   2B-52V2, B-52 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, for any reason, requires appropriate action IAW
   AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service Aeronautical Ratings and Badges; and AFI
   11-202V2.
   2.6.2. Once identified as an instructor candidate, training accomplished in preparation for
   CFIC can be logged for currency provided the training is performed to a proficient level.
   Candidates should prepare by focusing on seat/crew duties of lesser proficiency. Other pre-
   CFIC syllabus requirements include a pre-CFIC workbook and unit directed missions/events.
2.7. Faculty Training Course (FTC). An informal flight training program designed to certify
B-52 instructors for faculty duties in the FTU. This is an in house training course that includes
academic and flight training to prepare an instructor to teach in an FTU environment. The FTU
SQ/CC will ensure all new instructors to the FTU complete FTC prior to instructing FTU
students. Upon course completion and FTU/CC approval, graduates are fully qualified as FTU
flight instructors and granted the T-prefix.
2.8. Senior Officer Training.
   2.8.1. This qualification or requalification training is for rated colonel selects and above
   (wing commanders, vice wing commanders, operations group commanders and deputy
   commanders, etc.). Requisites are listed on the ETCA webpage and the B-52 Aircraft
   Commander Senior Officer Transition Course (B-52ACSOTX), B-52 Radar Navigator
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 27


   Senior Officer Transition Course (B-52RNSOTX), B-52 Electronic Warfare Officer Senior
   Officer Transition Course (B-52EWSOTX), and associated Senior Staff Orientation Course
   (B52SSOC) syllabus.
   2.8.2. The crew specialty specific Senior Officer Transition Course provides senior officers
   with the baseline academic knowledge to qualify in their primary crew position. Graduates
   of the SOTX will be BAQ qualified, and must complete their MQT training IAW paragraph
   3.1.3.1 to be certified BMC/CMR. Failure to complete full MQT will require approval from
   HQ AFGSC/A3T (AFRC/A3TT for AFRC) to be certified CMR/BMC.
   2.8.3. The Senior Staff Orientation Course (SSOC) leads to no qualification in the aircraft.
   Instead, it allows officers to become familiar with B-52 operations and capabilities by
   attending the academic/simulator training portion of their crew specialty B-52 SOTX.
   2.8.4. If senior officers are in training at the FTU and assigned to the same wing or
   completing training in-unit, they will be placed in formal training status. Unit duties will be
   delegated to the appropriate deputies or vice commanders until training is completed.
   Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the MAJCOM/CC.
2.9. Weapons Instructor Course (WIC). A formal flight training program designed to qualify
B-52 instructors as USAF Weapons Officers. The course is conducted by 340WPS, 57 WG.
Requisites are listed on the ETCA webpage and the B52 WIC syllabus. Upon course
completion, graduates are fully qualified as USAF Weapons Officers and granted the W-prefix to
the aircrew member’s AFSC.
2.10. Instructor Weapons Officer Upgrade (IWUG). Training and instruction required to
upgrade a returning graduate of the B-52 WIC to instructor status in the Weapons School (WS).
340 WPS/CC executes IWUG training and certifies newly assigned personnel as weapons school
instructors.
2.11. Test Qualification. 49 TES/CC will ensure newly assigned aircrew members complete a
unit derived program to certify aircrew members as test qualified.

                                           Chapter 3

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT completion is a prerequisite to establishing a Combat Mission Ready
(CMR) status or a Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status. Missions require certification for
credit. Elements within each mission require qualification which aircrew members achieve by
demonstrating proficiency in events as a culmination of an aircrew training program. An aircrew
member’s assigned position determines to which status they will train. Guidance in this chapter
is provided to assist the unit in developing their MQT program. Currency and frequency dates
are established by the date the appropriate event was last accomplished, regardless of training
status. See Attachment 2 for mission definitions.
   3.1.1. Initial CMR or BMC status requires MQT in MR42 for CMR-N and MR10A and
   MR10B for CMR-C.
       3.1.1.1. SQ/CC will determine if training is required in additional missions (i.e., MR10C,
       MR10D, and MR10E) to meet unit DOC statement.
       3.1.1.2. MQT items may be taught concurrently with IQT/RQT at the discretion of the
       unit. All training events accomplished to the required proficiency level during syllabus
       directed training are creditable (if applicable) for MQT. Accomplish waived FTU
       proficiency items prior to declaring the individual BMC or CMR.
       3.1.1.3. No one mission is a prerequisite to achieve MQT in any other mission (i.e.
       MR42 does not require any MR10X mission).
   3.1.2. Local MQT programs should consist of ground and flying training applicable to unit
   tasking. Units are allowed to further tailor their local MQT program for all aircrew based on
   current qualification, experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training.
       3.1.2.1. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a requalification program for
       aircrew that regressed from CMR or BMC to specifically address deficiencies which
       caused regression.
   3.1.3. BAQ and MQT aircrew members or new crew designations (e.g. DSN, Experienced
   DSN) will reference AFI11-401 AFGSC Supplement 1 Aviation Management for Flight
   Authorization Duty Codes for the crew position block on the AFTO 781, ARMS
   Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   3.1.4. Transferring Between Units. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units
   will complete MQT as determined by the gaining unit SQ/CC. Training should be based on
   experience, proficiency, currency, and previous formal training of the transferring individual.
   If the gaining unit's assigned weapons are different, accomplish Weapons/Tactics academics
   as required. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units must complete the Unit

          complete all MQT within 90 days.
          3.3.1.2.2. Units with a dual mission tasking (nuclear and conventional) will complete
          all MQT within 120 days. (AFRC) Notify the HQ AFRC/A3 and NAF/A3 if training
          exceeds 120 calendar days.
   3.3.2. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to initial CMR or BMC status.
      3.3.2.1. SQ/CC will certify aircrew members who have completed initial MQT and/or
      local MQT.
      3.3.2.2. Initial MQT certified aircrew members should be assigned MR42, MR10A, and
      MR10B.
   3.3.3. Once assigned a CMR or BMC status he/she will maintain currencies, proficiencies,
   and lookback for their qualification level IAW with Chapter 4.
      3.3.3.1. If a SQ/CC directs MQT training in a mission that the aircrew member is not
      certified, then the SQ/CC has the option to allow the aircrew member to regress to non-
      CMR or non-BMC until the MQT training is complete.

      mission types and events the aircrew member is authorized to fly.
4.2. Ground Training.
   4.2.1. General. Ground training will be accomplished IAW Table 4.1 Waiver authority for
   ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. This table is intended to be a
   reference for MDS-specific ground training only and does not include non-MDS specific
   ancillary training, which will also be tracked at unit level. Where discrepancies exist, the
   reference directive takes precedence. Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may
   be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
   Ground training will expire the last day of the month accomplished.
      4.2.1.1. The Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) is responsible for establishing and
      maintaining the academic ground training program. The OG/CC may delegate to the unit
      OPRs and the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) the responsibility for complying with
      applicable requirements. Unit commanders will ensure aircrew members accomplish
      academic training requirements. Commanders may direct additional training as
      necessary to ensure all aircrew members attain and maintain a state of proficiency which
      will permit immediate and successful completion of the assigned mission.
      4.2.1.2. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that academic training
      requirement. Ground training accomplished at the FTU, USAFWS, or other approved
      training courses may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which
      it was accomplished.
      4.2.1.3. Course Description Format. Attachment 2 contains a standardized definition to
      describe some courses. The purpose is to provide units the basic information concerning
      the course. It is not to be considered a lesson plan.
   4.2.2. Mission Re-Certification:
      4.2.2.1. Conventional re-certification uses the same course as the initial (GS52X). See
      Para. 3.2.3
          4.2.2.1.1. Aircrew members who participate in any unit deployment to a tasked
          theater of operations may receive credit for continuation certification in the mission
          set(s) executed. Credit date will be date coincident with the last mission executed on
36                                                     AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


         a deployment Air Tasking Order (ATO). Aircrew members will receive credit only
         for re-certification.
     4.2.2.2. Nuclear Re-Certification will be accomplished IAW AFGSCI 10-450V2.
  4.2.3. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). Guidance for course development of a unit
  level program and accomplishment are contained in AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher
  Program (IRP), AFI 11-202V1 and applicable MAJCOM guidance. The purpose of the IRC
  is to provide aircrews with sufficient knowledge of all applicable directives, procedures, and
  techniques to safely manage any instrument procedure encountered.
  4.2.4. Situation Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
     4.2.4.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
     procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. This
     training should present a situation and discuss crew actions necessary to manage a
     malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. Critical Action Procedures (if
     applicable) and Special Interest Items should be emphasized.
     4.2.4.2. SEPT must be accomplished prior to the first flight of each month. SEPT will be
     included in aircrew GO/NO GO criteria.
     4.2.4.3. SEPTs should be accomplished as an aircrew. Intent is for all aircrew to
     participate to the max extent and share equal time responding to emergency situations.
     SEPTs may be accomplished in an ATD, if available.
     4.2.4.4. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
         4.2.4.4.1. SQ/CC or DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic. Unit
         established monthly scenarios will be updated on annual basis to keep topics current
         and relevant.
         4.2.4.4.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using B-52 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
         4.2.4.4.3. Discuss at least two EPs during the SEPT session.
         4.2.4.4.4. Accomplish two SEPTs with an instructor/squadron supervisor (Flight/CC
         or higher) each training period.
         4.2.4.4.5. At least one SEPT per training cycle will emphasize the intricacies and
         difficulties involved with heavy gross weight takeoff and particularly the dangers
         associated with aborting a takeoff at or near S1.
     4.2.4.5. Other ways to satisfy SEPT requirements include:
         4.2.4.5.1. Complete of a WST Emergency Procedure (EP) profile.
         4.2.4.5.2. Instructors administering formal course student SEPTs.
         4.2.4.5.3. -(AFRC) Aircrew accomplishing the AFRC quarterly CRM training
         program may use that training event to satisfy the monthly SEPT training requirement
         for the month it was accomplished in (i.e. accomplishing the third quarter AFRC
         CRM training 8 Jul 06 would count for Jul 06 SEPT and the next SEPT training
         would be due 30 Aug 06) with a maximum of four allowed.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             37


  4.2.5. Air Weapons Refresher (AWR) Training. Units will establish a weapons/tactics
  academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in
  each training cycle.
     4.2.5.1. USAF Weapons School Graduates are the preferred academic instructors.
     Audiovisual programs may be used in place of academic instruction.
     4.2.5.2. AWR training topics. Training should include description, operation, parameters,
     fuzing, limitations, preflight, effective employment procedures, normal and alternate
     delivery procedures/techniques, airborne weaponeering, and current application.
     Preflight training should include "hands-on" training with actual weapons loads, if
     possible, or properly configured training weapons on/off the aircraft. All weapons types
     (as applicable to unit tasking) with all available weapons/fuze configurations should be
     covered. Audiovisual aids can be used for unavailable weapons. See Attachment 5.
         4.2.5.2.1. Emphasize effective employment procedures to include targeteering/
         weaponeering methods (Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM)/Combat
         Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS)), frag deconfliction, and hung stores
         procedures.
         4.2.5.2.2. Nuclear Weapons. Training should include description and effects, safety
         and security, operation, options, hands on preflight, delivery considerations,
         arming/dearming, normal and emergency procedures, safe escape, and flash blindness
         protection for all tasked weapons.
         4.2.5.2.3. Defensive Maneuvering. Training should include current and emerging
         threats (both surface-to-air and air-to-air threats) and appropriate B-52 defensive
         actions from AFTTP 3-1.B-52 and AFTTP 3-3.B-52. Defensive Maneuvering should
         be taught by unit weapons officer. Instructor will teach and apply defensive
         maneuvering to both a static and mobile threat system and apply examples for
         commit criteria. Instructors must emphasize CAF asset integration and how some
         MDS’s specifically benefit from mutual EA as well as how flight leads can ensure
         supporting assets have B-52 positional SA i.e. 30 seconds early/late and/or 5 NM off
         course.
  4.2.6. Intelligence Training. The unit intelligence training program will be coordinated
  through the wing/group and squadron Weapons and Tactics Flight or Officer. The focus and
  extent of academic training will be determined by the OG/CC and will be aligned with
  projected wartime tasking, threats, and unit equipage. The training program will meet
  standards prescribed in AFI 14-2B-52 V3, Unit Intelligence Procedures, chapter 3.
     4.2.6.1. The training program will include threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR),
     collection and reporting (C&R) and personnel recovery (PR) for both conventional and
     nuclear-related missions under AFGSC authorities.
     4.2.6.2. Current Intelligence will cover significant military/political developments
     (including threat updates) in the squadron's mission areas of interest.‖
  4.2.7. Crew Resource Management (CRM). All aircrew are required to attend regular
  CRM training sessions IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
  Program and applicable MAJCOM CRM Sup (one-time for flight surgeons). Failure to
38                                                    AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


  accomplish by the end of the last month will result in grounding until subsequently
  completed. OG/CC may waive up to end of next month after expiration of training.
     4.2.7.1. RegAF currency is every 24 months. Each aircrew member is required to
     participate in one training session.
     4.2.7.2. AFRC currency is quarterly. Training will be accomplished each quarter and the
     currency will expire at the end of the next quarter. Failure to accomplish by the end of
     the last month will result in grounding until subsequently completed. AFRC OG/CC may
     waive CRM for a one-time sortie.
         4.2.7.2.1. RegAF instructors assigned to the 11 BS will attend quarterly CRM
         training sessions which satisfies the 24 month currency requirement. When the
         aircrew member departs the 11 BS via PCS or PCA, they will update their currency,
         if necessary, with the 24-month course at the first available opportunity.
  4.2.8. Communications Training.
     4.2.8.1. Communications Training (GS15).         Units will establish an aircrew
     communications proficiency training program. Training is required in each training cycle
     IAW the RAP Tasking Memorandum. Training should include SATCOM, MRT, HQ,
     DAMA/Secure Voice, EDL, etc.
     4.2.8.2. COMSEC Training (GA10) See Para 3.8.2. Aircrew members must be current
     on this training prior to being issued a communications kit.
  4.2.9. Electronic Combat Training. Ensure all Electronic Warfare Officers possess the
  knowledge and skills necessary to employ their aircraft's EA equipment against known threat
  systems. Aircrew training devices will be employed to the maximum extent possible.
  Specific topics include:
     4.2.9.1. EW related threat system information to include signal analysis, capabilities,
     limitations, strengths, weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
     4.2.9.2. Aircraft EA systems hardware and software capabilities and limitations.
     4.2.9.3. Signal ambiguity resolution.
     4.2.9.4. Electronic Attack (EA) techniques and application.
     4.2.9.5. EW related issues to include training and operational guidance.
  4.2.10. NVG Academics. All NVG qualified aircrew members must obtain NVG
  academics refresher. Refresher training as a minimum will consist of common NVG
  hazards, MDS specific hazards, limitations and performing preflight adjustment procedures
  and focusing on an eye chart or the use of a Hoffman 20/20 tester. The use of a mock-up
  terrain display is encouraged for this training. NVG academics can be obtained during
  Weapons/Tactics Academics training.
  4.2.11. Aircrew Flight Equipment.
     4.2.11.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). Includes the training directed on Table 4.1,
     and the applicable guidance in AFI 11-301 and MAJCOM supplements.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               39


       4.2.11.2. SERE/CoCCT. Includes the training directed on Table 4.1Survival, Evasion,
       Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Code of Conduct Continuation Training (CoCCT),
       will be conducted IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
       Program, and MAJCOM supplements. SERE CoCCT will be a coordinated effort by
       SERE Specialist, Intelligence, and Aircrew Flight Equipment.
   4.2.12. Physiological Training. IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training
   Program, and MAJCOM supplements.
   4.2.13. Nuclear Surety (If Required). IAW AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons
   Surety Program, and MAJCOM supplements.
4.3. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Flight Training. The B-52 community uses RAP to
manage sortie and mission event requirements. The Aircrew Training Device (ATD) is a tool
used to aid in achieving event currency and proficiency. Total sorties, missions and events are
minimums. Minimums are set to ensure training continually meets all DOC tasked requirements
as well as specific deployment requirements. These minimums will not be reduced except in
proration/waiver situations. Squadron commanders have the authority to set the quantities in
parentheses ( ) based on squadron tasking, individual aircrew utilization, certification, and
qualification. Commanders must continue to provide robust, realistic training programs. AFGSC
expects to see shortfalls that document the underlying problems of over tasking, limited
airspace/ranges, weapon deficiencies, and other LIMFACS. RAP numbers should accurately
reflect shortfalls; RAP reporting is not a unit report card. Credible and detailed RAP reporting
arms leadership with an accurate assessment of readiness. Additionally, it provides the data
needed to advocate for adequate resources throughout the CAF and allows the Commands to
make the right decisions regarding tasking and training.
   4.3.1. Aircrew Training Device. The ATD is not intended as a substitution but as an
   augmentation to airborne sorties in which realism and dynamics can be induced through
   instructor or crew console operator involvement. See Table 1.2 and Table 1.3 for ATD
   training cycle requirements.
       4.3.1.1. Instructors are required for ATD training when the aircrew member is non-
       current or un-qualified. Units should determine additional CT training device supervision
       requirements based on expected employment tasking, and mission training objectives.
       Independent operations may be conducted in the CPT, OSMT or AN/ALQ T-4.
       4.3.1.2. Units with WSTs will ensure scenarios are based on expected employment
       tasking and training device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not
       readily attainable during daily flying activities.
       4.3.1.3. Simulator Certification (SIMCERT). 29 TSS, 53 Wing, will conduct SIMCERT
       and recommend certification the ATD to command standards before crediting transfer of
       task learning from the ATD to the aircrew. Within the preceding 24 months the
       individual ATD must have been certified in each specific event through SIMCERT.
       Checkride completion may be accomplished per AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2B-52V2 for
       WST certified events. WST certified events are indicated in Table 4.2 and may be used
       to complete RAP and BAQ event requirements. OG/CCs may designate additional
       simulated events to count towards RAP completion through coordination with HQ
       AFGSC/A3T. Refer to the B-52 WST SIMCERT Report for an all-inclusive list of
40                                                    AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


     recommended certified events. The overall training accreditation authority of an event is
     HQ AFGSC/A3T.
     4.3.1.4. The events indicated in the ATD column in Table 4.2 may be accomplished for
     currency and for RAP proficiency counters in the designated ATD. When creditable,
     only 50% (rounded up) of the event totals will be accomplished in the ATD. When
     creditable, 50% (rounded up) of annual mission requirements can be logged in the WST.
     RAP Sortie credit in the ATD is not permitted. When creditable, currency may still be
     updated no matter how many events have been logged for annual proficiency.
  4.3.2. Currencies/Re-currencies/Re-qualifications.
     4.3.2.1. Currency.   Table 4.3 defines currency requirements for all B-52 aircrew
     members.
        4.3.2.1.1. Upon completion of Qualification Evaluation, events accomplished during
        formal training (IQT, RQT/TX, PUP, NUP, CFIC, FTC, and SSC) to the proficient
        level may be used to establish currency dates for continuation training.
     4.3.2.2. Re-currency. Re-currency is required whenever an aircrew member exceeds a
     currency requirement in this volume. If a primary crew position is manned by a non-
     current aircrew member, the event the individual is non-current in cannot be
     accomplished without supervision by an instructor of like specialty. (example: If the
     pilot is non-current for touch-and-goes, the aircraft commander cannot perform touch-
     and-goes unless an IP is supervising)
        4.3.2.2.1. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the aircrew
        member is considered qualified to perform tasks applicable to the type of training in
        which delinquent. Training annotated as affecting CMR or BMC status will require
        regression to N-CMR or N-BMC until appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC is
        accomplished. Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require
        regression from CMR although it may result in grounding until training is completed
        (e.g., AFE training). The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will
        determine the effect on CMR status. Regaining currency is based on time elapsed
        from the date the individual became non-current:
            4.3.2.2.1.1. Up to 6 months. Training as directed by the SQ/CC and a proficiency
            demonstration of the non-current event to a like specialty instructor.
            4.3.2.2.1.2. 6 months through 1 year. Training as directed by the squadron
            commander. Individuals need to re-qualify only in events required by their
            training level. Flight evaluation by an evaluator is required only for non-current
            items.
            4.3.2.2.1.3. 1 year through 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 51
            months at the end of any active flying assignment. Complete training in all
            delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the squadron
            commander, and a flight evaluation. Individuals must complete the formal TX-3
            course at the FTU prior to training at the unit.
            4.3.2.2.1.4. Over 39 months at the end of a non flying assignment or 51 months at
            the end of any active flying assignment to 8 years. Individuals will be requalified
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  41


            in accordance with     Chapter 2 and the applicable syllabus.
     4.3.2.3. Instructor Re-qualification. Instructor re-qualification is required whenever an
     instructor becomes decertified. Instructors will be decertified if:
         4.3.2.3.1. The instructor fails an evaluation. To regain instructor status, the instructor
         must successfully complete assigned corrective training and/or a flight evaluation
         IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2B-52V2.
         4.3.2.3.2. The instructor becomes non-current in an event/sortie which causes
         removal from CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of
         sufficient importance to require de-certification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this
         option or if the instructor becomes non-current in events/ sorties which do not require
         removal from CMR/BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the instructor
         will not instruct in that event/sortie until the required currency is regained.
  4.3.3. Regression.
     4.3.3.1. Lookback is based on the calendar month. If an aircrew member does not meet
     lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either: Regress the
     aircrew member to N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable; or remove the aircrew member
     from a CMR manning position; or initiate action to remove the aircrew member from
     active flying status.
         4.3.3.1.1. Lookback computations begin following the awarding of any CMR or
         BMC rating. The aircrew must maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is
         established. Report aircrew as N-CMR until 3-month or next one month lookback is
         met.
     4.3.3.2. 3-Month Lookback. Failure to meet 1-month lookback requires a review of the
     aircrew member's 3-month sortie/mission history. If the 3-month lookback has been met,
     aircrew members may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC.
     4.3.3.3. 6-Month Lookback. Failure to meet 3-month lookback requires a review of the
     aircrew member's 6-month sortie/mission history. If the 6-month lookback has been met,
     aircrew members may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC.
         4.3.3.3.1. Failure to meet the 6-month lookback will result in probation or regression
         to N-CMR/N-BMC as appropriate. The aircrew member may be placed in probation
         status for 1 month at the squadron commander's discretion. If probation is chosen,
         the only way to remove an aircrew member from probation and preserve the current
         status is to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period. (See
         Figure 4.1)
     4.3.3.4. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
     qualification at the end of the training cycle or events tasked as Qual at CMR/BMC, will
     require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC in the associated mission sets unless waived by the
     SQ/CC.
     4.3.3.5. Regression for Failure of Evaluations. Aircrew members who fail an aircraft
     qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2 and
     AFI 11-2B-52V2. Aircrew members will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable.
     These aircrew members will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until successfully completing
42                                                       AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


     required evaluation corrective actions. Mission re-certification per Para 3.2.3 is also
     required, but may be waived by SQ/CC.
  4.3.4. Regaining CMR/BMC Status.
     4.3.4.1. CMR/BMC status lost due to regression for weapons qualification will require
     the aircrew member to re-accomplish initial qualification training in the deficient
     weapons event (see paragraph 5.2). Events accomplished for this initial qualification
     may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the next
     training period.
     4.3.4.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW Para. 4.3.3, the
     following applies (timing starts from the date the aircrew member came off CMR/BMC
     status):
         4.3.4.2.1. Up to 90 Days. Accomplish mission(s) and sortie(s) to meet one month
         lookback. All mission specific RAP event currencies and overdue ground training
         must be regained.
         4.3.4.2.2. 90 to 180 Days. Accomplish SQ/CC directed training to include the
         aircrew member mission certification as described in Para 3.2.3 All mission specific
         RAP event currencies and overdue ground training must be regained.
         4.3.4.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT in all mission related events.
  4.3.5. RAP Proficiency Event Annual Requirements. Aircrew members are required to
  accomplish only proficiency events (Table 4.2) that apply to the missions for which they are
  certified. Aircrew members should focus on training events that apply to the particular
  mission set(s) they are training on a given sortie/ATD. See mission descriptions in
  Attachment 2 for training restrictions. Training events outside assigned mission sets may be
  accomplished, under instructor supervision, for the purpose of MQT or aircrew member
  familiarization. Instructor supervision is not required for aircrew members who are qualified
  and current in a particular training event outside their assigned mission set.
     4.3.5.1. Aircrew members who fail to complete sortie, mission, and/or event
     requirements of this volume at the end of the training period may require additional
     training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. The SQ/CC will
     determine if additional training is required. Refer to Para. 4.3.6 to determine if some of
     these requirements can be prorated. Refer to Para. 1.12 for waiver authority.
         4.3.5.1.1. Aircrew who fail to meet the total RAP sortie or mission requirements may
         continue CT at CMR/ BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine
         if additional training is required.
         4.3.5.1.2. Aircrew who fail to meet total BAQ sortie and/or event requirements may
         continue CT at CMR/ BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine
         if additional training is required.
         4.3.5.1.3. Failure to accomplish missions required for special capabilities,
         qualifications, or certification will result in loss of that qualification or certification.
  4.3.6. Proration of End of Cycle (Annual) Requirements. The SQ/CC may prorate total
  sortie (Table 1.1), total mission (Table 1.3), and proficiency event (Table 4.2) training
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 43


  requirements. Prorate end of cycle requirements when Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIFs),
  emergency leaves, non-flying TDY/exercises, non-flying combat/contingency deployments,
  and/or (AFRC) mandatory training required by civilian employment preclude training for a
  portion of the training period. HHD sorties, Combat sorties, Contingency sorties and
  Ordinary annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. This allows for accurate
  reporting of mission and event accomplishments. Extended bad weather which precludes the
  unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered non-availability.
     4.3.6.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
     availability, not to mask readiness, training or planning deficiencies.
     4.3.6.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the
     training period. Use Table 4.4 to determine the number of months to be prorated based
     on cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
     4.3.6.3. If IQT or MQT is re-accomplished, an aircrew member's training period will
     start over at a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
         4.3.6.3.1. Proration Example. An aircrew member was granted 17 days of
         emergency leave in January and attended SOS in residence from March through April
         for 56 consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a total of 3 months
         proration from his training cycle (1 month for emergency leave and 2 months for
         SOS).
     4.3.6.4. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the
     next lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
     4.3.6.5. Newly assigned aircrew members and aircrew members achieving CMR/BMC
     after the 1st of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following
     month for lookback and proration purposes. A prorated share of RAP sorties and
     assigned missions must be completed in CT.
     4.3.6.6. Night and AR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward
     prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the aircrew was
     declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
     4.3.6.7. An aircrew member's last month on station prior to departing Permanent Change
     of Station (PCS) may be prorated provided 1 month's proration is not exceeded.
     Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes during a
     period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or
     sign in at new duty station.
     4.3.6.8. CMR aircrew members who attend FTU/USAFWS in TDY-and-return status
     may be reported throughout the TDY as CMR if they departed CMR. Upon return, those
     aircrew members will accomplish a prorated share of sortie/mission/event requirements
     (see Table 4.4).
     4.3.6.9. A SQ/CC may elect to change the missions an aircrew member has been
     assigned. Aircrew members are only required to maintain proficiency events and
     currency events that pertain to the missions for which they are assigned and have been
     certified. Proration may be applied to the annual events in both the mission certifications

                    WEAPONS QUALIFICATION TRAINING (WQT)

5.1. General. WQT guidance is provided to train aircrew members in weapons other than what
is taught during IQT. This training can also be used for re-qualification training in IQT
weapons. Refer to "Glossary of Events" at Attachment 2 for further guidance on weapons
events.
   5.1.1. The OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the weapons qualification
   program. The OG/CC may delegate to individual tactical squadrons or the OSS
   responsibility for executing this program.
   5.1.2. Weapons qualification will be achieved/maintained by completing a minimum number
   of effective releases (―Hits‖) as determined by the OG/CC and requirements in Para. 5.3 and
   Para. 5.4
   5.1.3. Actual WISS-scored releases are the preferred method of scoring deliveries, however,
   unit developed training guides may be used.
   5.1.4. 340 WPS/CC qualifies and certifies B-52 USAFWS instructors.
5.2. Initial Weapon Qualification.
   5.2.1. Every aircrew member must accomplish initial qualification in each applicable type of
   weapon requiring qualification for CMR/BMC. Initial qualification achieved in IQT or MQT
   satisfies requirements for initial qualification, but not for CT event requirements. Initial
   qualification will carry over for consecutive tours in the B-52.
       5.2.1.1. For FTU IQT, releases accomplished after obtaining proficiency may be credited
       for initial qualification.
       5.2.1.2. Failure to qualify in one weapon does not invalidate qualification in others.
   5.2.2. Initial Weapons Qualification Training. Qualification in each B-52 weapon type
   requires unique training events. However, the general characteristics of the training and
   desired flow consists of academics, simulator training, and flight training.
       5.2.2.1. Academics. All aircrew members will accomplish initial academics ground
       training prior to any flight/WST training. Emphasis will be: weapons characteristics,
       mission planning (JWS, IMEA, CWDS, PFPS, and MPS), preflight, programming,
       targeting, retargeting, release, crew coordination, and tactical employment. Academics
       will cover both normal procedures and abnormal procedures (e.g. malfunctions, jettison
       procedures, etc). WQT Academics will end with an open book and closed book weapon
       test.
       5.2.2.2. Simulator training. The WST should be used to the maximum extent possible
       for all initial WQT. Emphasis of weapon qualification WSTs should be checklist
       procedures for normal and abnormal situations. Attaining proficiency in the WST is
       desired prior to flight training.WQT should focus on weapon employment during
       appropriate mission type.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 57


       5.2.2.3. Flight training. WQT flight training should focus on tactical employment and
       crew coordination skills.    Sortie profiles should emphasize targeting/retargeting
       command and control unique to the different mission types, and both pre-planned and
       multi-weapon dynamic targeting. For applicable weapons, demonstrate proficiency in
       multi-DPI (single target with multiple DPIs), and multi-target area attacks (multiple
       targets with multiple DPIs).
5.3. Weapon Continuation Training. These requirements establish minimum standards for
crews to maintain qualification in the appropriate RAP-tasked weapons delivery events and do
not necessarily determine evaluation criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g.,
inspection/evaluation teams). These qualifications are valid throughout the following training
period. Aircrew members must accomplish recurring qualification for each weapon applicable to
the mission sets that the SQ/CC has assigned to each aircrew member. i.e. If an aircrew member
was only assigned to be CMR-N that aircrew member would only need maintain qualification in
ALCM, B-61 and B-83.
   5.3.1. CT weapons deliveries will be tactical deliveries simulating realistic employment of
   Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML), considering such factors as fuzing, safe
   escape/separation, frag deconfliction, probability of destruction (PD), egress, etc. To
   maintain a combat perspective in a peacetime environment, weapons deliveries should
   simulate realistic employment of live munitions/SCLs and fuze settings.
   5.3.2. Weapons qualifications will be maintained by achieving 6 record hits and an overall
   hit rate of 50%. Hit criteria are described in paragraph 5.4 Fiscal/resource constraints may
   preclude actual weapons releases for record for every weapon. Units should establish
   programs to track reliability of unique weapons by measuring the effectiveness of aircrew
   procedures, e.g., all weapons parameters were met, systems were configured correctly.
   Weapon training accomplished in the WST is creditable if the WST is SIMCERT 1 for that
   weapon.
   5.3.3. Failure to maintain qualification in one weapon does not invalidate qualification in
   others. SQ/CCs may declare an aircrew member unqualified in an event and invalidate all
   previous record deliveries for that event at any time during a training cycle without affecting
   other weapons event qualifications. The aircrew member will revert to N-CMR (Nuclear or
   Conventional or both)/N-BMC and will remain in that status until completing SQ/CC
   specified additional training/requalification.
5.4. Qualification/Hit Criteria. These criteria establish minimum standards for RN/DSNs
during all initial and recurring weapons qualifications and do not necessarily determine
evaluation criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation
teams). These qualification standards remain valid throughout the following training period.
   5.4.1. General Criteria. A reliable hit is predicated upon achieving the desired PD per target
   type and number/type of weapons as defined by JMEM and NWP documents. Mission
   planning should carefully consider the target type and account for weapons effects in
   accordance with JMEM requirements for probability of damage. Reliability will be
   determined by resolving the impact scores of single releases to the actual PD achieved. All
   unguided General Purpose (GP) weapon single releases will simulate weapon trains. Unit
   OPRs will select realistic weapons and target combinations for annual CT and initial
   qualification standardization throughout the unit. Weapon/target combinations used should
58                                                     AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


  reflect target sets applicable to unit taskings. AGM-86C/154A/158A and guided weapon
  scoring criteria will be in accordance with unit developed training guides if not addressed
  below. For unguided gravity weapons, the scoring criteria listed in Table 5.1, Unguided
  Gravity Weapons Scoring Criteria, may be used when PD computations from JMEM/NWP
  are not readily available. For TGP employment Tables 5.2 and 5.3 define qualification
  criteria.
  5.4.2. TGP Coordinate Generation (TCG) Hit Criteria. TGP coordinate generation solutions
  can be used to immediately update MIL-STD 1760 weapons solutions just prior to release.
  As such, the RN must demonstrate the required skill-sets to accurately measure a specific
  DPI using the criteria listed in Table 5.2. TCG record measurements should be taken against
  pre-planned, mensurated aimpoints/targets to facilitate accuracy assessments.
  5.4.3. Self-Designation LGB Hit Criteria. Can be demonstrated empirically with actual
  weapon releases or can be assessed during dry attacks using the criteria listed in Table 5.3.
  For all actual LGB releases, hit criteria is 10 meters.
  5.4.4. Inertially-aided Munitions Hit Criteria. Hit criteria for actual deliveries is 15m for
  JDAM (GBU-31/38) and 30m for WCMD. Hit criteria for simulated deliveries require good
  indications of weapons release within weapons/fuze parameters.
  5.4.5. Weapons Delivery. A delivery is defined as a pass at a target on which ordnance is
  expended or a pass meeting the criteria defining a specific weapon delivery.
     5.4.5.1. All deliveries will be recorded, but not necessarily as a "record" delivery. There
     are two types of deliveries:
         5.4.5.1.1. Basic Delivery. A delivery without defensive maneuvering. It may be
         used as a record event only for initial qualification. There is no restriction on the
         number of dry passes made before or during basic deliveries in a record event for
         initial qualification; however, only the first two deliveries per event may be made for
         record.
         5.4.5.1.2. Tactical Delivery. Any delivery using patterns and techniques that
         minimize final flight path predictability, yet allows sufficient time for accurate
         weapons delivery. When a tactical delivery is flown for record, dry passes in the
         event are not permitted before or during the event.
     5.4.5.2. A delivery constitutes a weapons delivery event based on two categories: by
     record keeping (Record or Non-Record), and by RAP tasking (FAM and QUAL):
         5.4.5.2.1. Record Keeping.
             5.4.5.2.1.1. Non-Record. Basic or Tactical weapons delivery accomplishments
             not credited toward weapons qualification provided the aircrew member declares
             non-record prior to beginning event.
             5.4.5.2.1.2. Record.    A weapons delivery scored for individual weapons
             qualification. Scoring shall be accomplished by ground, or camera scoring, or as
             appropriate. Scores will be documented by CEP and clock position.
         5.4.5.2.2. All delivery attempts should be record attempts unless declared "non-
         record" prior to release. Additional guidelines are:

           5.4.5.2.2.1. Basic. Must be scored on a ground scored range or as appropriate.
           5.4.5.2.2.2. Tactical. A minimum of 50% must be accomplished on a ground
           scored range or as appropriate.
     5.4.5.3. RAP Tasking.
        5.4.5.3.1. FAM. Weapon events tasked at FAM may be basic/tactical record
        deliveries. Each single weapon run counts as one delivery. Unless otherwise
        specified in the RAP Tasking Memorandum or formal course syllabi, FAM tasking
        normally requires a minimum of three weapons deliveries, PGMs, AGMs and
        bombing events.
        5.4.5.3.2. QUAL. Weapons tasked at QUAL must be tactical, record deliveries,
        excluding initial qual. QUAL tasking demonstrates the aircrew member's capability
        to put appropriate ordnance on target. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP Tasking
        Memorandum or formal course syllabi, QUAL criteria are established in Chapter 5.
     5.4.5.4. Miscellaneous weapons delivery definitions to be considered for event
     descriptions:
        5.4.5.4.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended.
        Such dry passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the
        aircrew members as gross errors unless pass was dry because of safety interests,
        system malfunctions, basic delivery requirements, or directed for flight integrity
        purposes.
        5.4.5.4.2. Hit. Predicated upon achieving the desired Probability of Damage per
        target type and number/type of weapons as defined by JMEM documents or
        established CEP requirements. See criteria in paragraph 5.7
        5.4.5.4.3. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against the same target
        on a single pass.
        5.4.5.4.4. Intentional. The aircrew member must advise the range officer prior to
        delivery and designate which impact to be scored.
        5.4.5.4.5. Inadvertent. Ordnance which was released without command by the
        aircrew members. Impact will not be scored.
        5.4.5.4.6. System Malfunction. An undeclared multiple release caused by a verified
        system malfunction. Score is void after system malfunction verification, otherwise,
        unintentional rules apply.
        5.4.5.4.7. Unintentional. Ordnance released due to aircrew member's error. Will be
        scored as gross error regardless of impact point.
        5.4.5.4.8. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No
        score or error will be assigned.
        5.4.5.4.9. Void Delivery. Weapons delivery not successfully completed due to: a
        documented and verified weapons system malfunction; a pass aborted for safety; no
        spot; or circumstances beyond the control of the aircrew members.

B-52 aircraft commanders to supervise pilots in air refueling, visual refueling formation
(observation position), route formation, and battle damage checks.
   6.7.1. An instructor pilot will fly with and recommend each aircraft commander cleared to
   supervise his pilot's air refueling, visual refueling formation (observation position), route
   formation, and battle damage checks. The squadron commander approves and designates
   these pilots in writing. Aircraft commanders may be further certified to supervise any pilot in
   these events.
       6.7.1.1. AR supervision requirement only applies for copilots who have not been
       qualified in air refueling IAW AFI 11-2B-52V2 flight evaluation or who are non-current
       per Table 4.3. If supervising a copilot who is qualified but non-current in air refueling,
       the copilot will not log air refueling on his mission accomplishment report (MAR) unless
       under the supervision of a current and qualified Instructor Pilot.
   6.7.2. The instructor pilot completes a TAR on each individual flown with and files it in the
   individual's training folder. The SQ/CC will certify pilot’s status, including any restrictions,
   in appropriate written format (Letter of Xs, grade sheets, AF Form 4348, etc.).

Terms
Academic Training—This training includes classroom, Computer Based Training (CBT), and
Aircrew Training Devices (ATD) related to aircraft systems and operation, flight characteristics
and techniques, performance, normal and emergency procedures, and safety of flight items.
Academic courses prepare aircrew members for flight training and are normally completed
before flight training.
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)—The ATD is intended to enhance, not replace actual flight
training. ATDs do this by allowing aircrew members to practice tactics, malfunctions, and
emergency procedures which cannot be practiced in-flight. ATD missions must be designed to
ensure that the prescribed subject matter is presented in a realistic manner that resembles to the
maximum extent possible actual flight procedures, tactics, and threat environments.
Alternate Release—The technique of determining the release point by the best means available
without any INS or GPS inputs.
Attrition Sortie—A scheduling tool for long range planning. for maintenance or weather
cancels during a week or month. The sortie would be used if a maintenance or weather cancel
cause a loss of training opportunity.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to safely operate the unit aircraft.
The member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie
and flight standards set for the weapons system. Aircrew members are not authorized to perform
RAP-tasked combat event/sorties/missions unless under the supervision of a like specialty
instructor and when authorized by the unit commander. API 1 or 2 individuals will not train at
this level. Flight duties will be limited to those identified in Para. 4.1
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—(also BMC-N and BMC-C)A status of a aircrew member who
has satisfactorily completed MQT prescribed to perform the unit’s DOC mission but does not
maintain CMR status. This basic mission capability provides the absolute minimum ability to
perform the missions and anticipates a higher attrition rate during challenging scenarios.
Completion of these events does not necessarily equate combat ready proficiency. Additional
training is required for proficiency and to effectively use the full capability of the aircraft. The
intent is for the SQ/CC to direct the performance of RAP-tasked combat events/sorties/missions
after completion of MQT as appropriate. (Refer to Para. 4.1)
Certification—Procedure used to document competency in a particular task which requires an
AF IMT 1522 or MAJCOMs approved unit certification document signed by an authorized
official. The Nuclear certification process is IAW AFGSCI 10-450V2. Not interchangeable with
―qualification,‖ which requires AF IMT 8/8a documentation. Applies to procedure aimed at
verifying and refreshing aircrew members tactical employment knowledge, emphasizing
conventional operations according to the unit's wartime tasking. Certification is conducted in
both initial and follow-on phases. Initial certification phase is a formal board proceeding
convened to verify individual aircrew member’s knowledge. Continuation certification training
 94                                                      AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011


is to reinforce, refresh, and update aircrew members on unit wartime mission/tasking, tactics, and
procedures. See Chapter 3.
Circular Error—Miss distance of a given weapon impact expressed in radial distance from
center of target.
Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)—A device used to train normal, emergency, and
instrument procedures. Aircraft instruments and other displays are activated to respond to flight
control and switch inputs; however, exact dynamic simulation of all functions is not required.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—(also CMR-N and CMR-C)-A status of a aircrew member
who has satisfactorily completed MQT prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the unit’s
DOC mission. CMR is also a level of training which allows the aircrew to fully exploit the
aircraft capability across the spectrum of mission taskings. This is the desired level of training
and requires a fully funded training program. In combat coded flying squadrons, this category
includes operations officers and squadron commanders.
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew member
capabilities to perform unit missions, and aircrew member proficiency sorties not flown in
formal syllabus missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR, BMC, or BAQ aircrew
members.
Critical Phases of Flight—As described in AFI 11-2B-52V3.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event, mission, or sortie safely.
Degraded Release—The act of determining the release point utilizing the capability of the OAS
computers without updates from the radar or GPS. The INUs may be updated through inputs
from visual, EVS aided, etc. INU/GPS with no useable radar scope is considered degraded.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general
purpose/nuclear ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/weapons Tech
Orders must be consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria, and -1 performance charts.
Desired Learning Objectives (DLO)—Objectives set for use as learning progress benchmarks.
DLOs should be understandable, attainable, and quantifiable. Accomplishment of DLOs will
indicate mission success on training missions via completion of specific mission tasks. An
example DLO would read, "For a given threat, determine the amount of time elapsed between
track and search." The corresponding mission task would read, "Electronic Warfare Officer
correctly identify and direct successful maneuvers within 10 seconds."
Designed Operation Capability (DOC)—MAJCOM defined statement providing a narrative
description of the unit’s full wartime mission(s). The purpose is to provide units with a single
source document of the information necessary and the location of the references specifying
resources to measure and report.
Dual-Seat Navigator (DSN)—A navigator who has received formal qualification training in
both RN and Nav positions and can perform primary duties in either seat.
Electronic Scoring Site (ESS)—Sites capable of EA threat training with fixed or mobile surface
to air emitters.
AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  95


Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of aircrew member’s knowledge
and responsiveness to critical and non-critical Emergency Procedures conducted by a Flight
Examiner verbally, in a WST, CPT, or aircraft cockpit in IAW AFI 11-2B-52V2.
EVS Bombing—This category includes bomb runs conducted using primarily EVS inputs (with
or without pilot visual assistance). No steering or timing inputs from the OAS computers are
authorized for the entire bomb run from the IP to the target. Visual references for both the IP
and the target are required.
Familiarization (FAM)—A level of proficiency definition. Exposure to an event through
academic instruction and/or instructor supervised activity in flight/ATD simulated.
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the aircraft commander responsible for
overall conduct of formation from preflight preparation/briefing to post flight debriefing,
regardless of actual position within the formation. See Para. 6.2
Forward Air Controller (Airborne) FAC(A)— A specifically trained and qualified aviation
officer who exercises control from the air of aircraft engaged in close air support of ground
troops. The forward air controller (airborne) is normally an airborne extension of the tactical air

AFI11-2B-52v1 8 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  99



Conventional Missions.
Missions designed to emphasize conventional employment of the B-52. The sortie profile should
be planned to include: formation takeoff, departure, en route navigation, air refueling, electronic
rendezvous, conventional weapon procedures, EDL procedures, retargeting exercise,
instrument/emergency/visual approach and landing procedures. Aircrew will plan and execute
with realistic AOR specific SPINS and train to the PROFICIENT level. Scenario should include
commanders intent, tactical implications, and target set weaponeering. The scenario should also
include AOR Integration of simulated/real package players for target area assignments. Log
applicable RAP and Basic Skills events in addition to this mission. A limit of two MR10X
missions can be logged on the same sortie. For mission credit, SQ/CCs will ensure crews satisfy
both mission’s objectives. Both missions will be mission planned, flown and debriefed per
mission description.
MR10A. Standoff Attack Mission (SO). A Standoff Attack Mission is a mission in which
primary planning and execution focus is on standoff weapon employment (CALCM, JASSM,
MALD) targeting command and control facilities or IADS. Missions should focus on early
phases of a conflict and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communication procedures for command
and control. Aircrew will use voice satellite (V-Sat) and Tactical Data Link in scenario on every
mission when the equipment is available. When simulated, credit requires a Command and
Control Event, a Standoff Weapons Release, and a Defensive scenario including AI/Naval
strategic or tactical threats. This mission also requires at least one of the following events: 1)
Formation, 2) Retargeting Exercise, 3) A/R or A/R EMCON 3. Log applicable RAP and Basic
Skills events in addition to this mission. Missions involving actual weapon releases will receive
mission credit and should follow the SO mission training profile. The standoff attack mission is
intended to better focus unit training objectives to meet unit Strategic Attack (SA) or Offensive
Counter Air – Surface Attack (OCA-SA) DOC taskings.
MR10B. Direct Attack / Close Air Support Mission (DA/CAS). A Direct Attack / CAS Mission
is a mission in which primary planning and execution focus is on preplanned direct attack
weapon employment (JDAM/WCMD/LGB/GP) targeting enemy IADS, fielded forces,
communication nodes, airfields or airfield support systems. Missions should focus on
interdiction of targets beyond the FLOT/FEBA and require integration of C2,
SWEEP/OCA/DCA and SEAD i.e. Major Combat Operations (MCO). However, past conflicts
have and future conflicts most likely will prove that friendly forces have made contact with the
enemy in rapid schemes of maneuver. This lesson demands that aircrew must be prepared to
conduct bomb on coordinate (BOC) CAS as described in JP 3-09.3 and JFIRE. Units must
ensure training scripts emphasize integrated MCO scenarios in a medium/high threat
environment before CAS. This focus ensures aircrew proficiency in brevity and CAF
integration. This is a must in preparation for high threat environments and B-52 success. For
missions focused solely on CAS and NTSR see MR10C. Aircrew will use Tactical Data Link,
Secure Voice, and/or Have Quick in scenario on every mission when the equipment is available.
Credit requires at least one internal/external release of a direct attack weapon and a Defensive
scenario including AI/Naval/Ground Strategic or Tactical threats. This mission also requires any
two of the following events: 1) Multi-SMO event, 2) Formation, 3) Retargeting Exercise, 4)
Time sensitive Targeting exercise, 5) CAS/CAS with JTAC, or 6) Degraded GPS Weapon
Release. Missions involving actual weapon releases will receive mission credit and should

follow the DA/CAS mission training profile. The Direct Attack / Close Air Support Mission is
intended to better focus unit training objectives to meet unit OCA-SA and Offensive Counter
Land (OCL) taskings.
MR10C. Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance /Armed RECCE/OVERWATCH Non
Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance Mission (CAS/NTSR). A CAS/NTSR Mission is a
mission in which the primary planning and execution focus is detailed integration with friendly
ground forces. Aircrew performing SCAR verify preplanned target locations, discriminate
between actual and deceptive targets, evaluate Bomb Hit Assessment (BHA), direct re-attacks,
and engage mobile targets with own ship ordnance. Armed RECCE is locating and monitoring
targets of opportunity i.e., enemy material, personnel, and facilities in assigned general areas or
along assigned ground lines of communication routes, and not for the purpose of attacking
specific/located briefed targets. Armed OVERWATCH involves direct support of stationary or
mobile friendly ground maneuver forces. These missions may involve escalatory ROE involving
Show of Force tactics and DA weapon employment in a BOC or bomb on target (BOT) CAS
role as described in JP 3-09.3 and JFIRE. Aircrew will use Digital CAS/TDL, Secure Voice,
and/or Have Quick in scenario on every mission when the equipment is available. Credit must
include TGP activity for any of these missions. This mission also requires any 2 of the following
events: 1) EA activity, 2) Formation, 3) LOWAT, 4) CAS/CAS with JTAC, or 5) Video Data
Link. The NTSR Mission is intended to better focus unit training objectives to meet modern
COCOM CAS taskings.

MR10D. Information Ops Mission (IO). An Information Ops Mission is a mission in which
psychological operations or electronic attack methods are employed to achieve a desired
outcome to the enemy or personnel within an AOR without the use of kinetic force. This
mission must include either employment of M129 leaflet canisters, low altitude show-of -force
tactics, MALD/J, or use of other non-kinetic capabilities. This mission will also include any one
of the following events: 1) Low altitude training, 2) Command and Control Event, 3) Formation,
4) EA activity, or 5) A/R or A/R EMCON 3. Log applicable RAP and Basic Skills events in
addition to this mission. The Information Ops Mission is intended to better focus unit training
objectives to meet unit Counter Information or PSYOPS DOC taskings and/or required activity
accomplished per COCOM tasking.
MR10E. Counter Sea Mission (CS). A Counter Sea Mission is a mission in which counter sea
operations are conducted to attain and maintain a desired degree of maritime superiority by the
destruction, disruption, delay, diversion, or other neutralization of threats in the maritime
environment. As a minimum, one of the following events must be accomplished: Conventional
Weapon Release in a maritime environment i.e. mine run, AIMT, or JABS. This mission will
also include any 2 of the following events: 1) LOWOW (low alt training over water), 2)
Command and Control Event, 3) Formation, 4) TGP activity, 5) EA activity, or 6) A/R or A/R
EMCON 3. Log applicable RAP and Basic Skills events in addition to this mission. The
