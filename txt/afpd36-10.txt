SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This policy directive has been revised to delete the measurement and metrics and update the reference
information. It implements and complies with DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapters 430, Performance Manage-
ment (The DoD Performance Appraisal System), and 451, Awards. A bar (|) indicates revision from the
previous edition.

1. The Air Force depends upon a large civilian work force to accomplish its various missions. Managing
this work force requires an effective system for use in promotion consideration, award nominations, etc.,
that helps plan, monitor, develop, evaluate, and reward individual and organizational performance.

2. The Air Forceâ€™s performance appraisal system is based on objective measurements of performance
against individual and organizational goals, establishment of accountability in meeting those goals, and
evaluation of individual and organizational accomplishments.

3. The Air Force endorses incentive awards to recognize employee or organizational contributions that
result in benefits or savings to the government.

4. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
   4.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Envi-
   ronment (SAF/MI) is responsible for civilian performance and recognition policy matters as described
   in Air Force Directive 90-1, Policy Formulation. SAF/MI approval is required before this document
   is changed, reissued, or rescinded.
   4.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (HQ USAF/DP) develops, coordinates, and executes
   personnel policy and approves essential procedural guidance for the management of the Civilian Per-
   formance and Recognition Programs.

5. The Air Force civilian performance and recognition programs apply to all General Schedule (GS) and
Federal Wage System (FWS) employees serving under appointments such as career, career-conditional,
and temporary. This includes senior-level, scientific, and professional employees paid under Title 5,
United States Code, Chapter 53, Section 5376, as well as Air Reserve technicians.
