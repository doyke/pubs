8. TWP Board Procedures and Scoring.
   8.1. 88 ABW/CCCE will:
      8.1.1. Ensure the AF Form 1206 is limited to fifteen lines for quarterly or thirty lines for
      annual. Category headings are required to be included in the body. The following three
      categories will be used (1) Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty, (2)
      Significant Self Improvement, (3) Base or Community Involvement.
      8.1.2. Board results and nomination packages are retained by 88 ABW/CCC in
      accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 36-33, Rule 3.
   8.2. Board Members will:
      8.2.1. Board members must remember this is a “whole person” program and the focus
      should be selecting who will best represent the organization using the scoring criteria.
      8.2.2. Rankings of board members will be added and the package with the highest
      overall ranking (lowest total number) will be the winner for that category. All significant
      differences as determined by the board will be discussed. Board members must maintain
      the confidentiality of the meetings.
      8.2.3. FFB: The primary purpose of the FFB board is to ensure the professionalism and
      appearance of assigned Airmen is commensurate with written performance. There are
      three areas evaluated during the interview: (1) Military Image, (2) Military Bearing and
      (3) Communication Skills. Each board member will prepare two questions for the
      nominee and will score the member based on the nominee’s answer to their questions.
      The questions will be from the following four categories (1) Current Events, (2)
      Standards of Conduct, (3) Dress and Appearance and (4) Customs and Courtesies. All
      opinionated questions will be based on the AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development
      Guide, AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure, and current media such as local and
      base newspaper, Air Force Times, Airman Magazine, etc. All board results will be
      provided to the 88 ABW/CCC.
   8.3. Scoring will:
      8.3.1. Selection will be based on a combination of the AF Form 1206 and FFB using the
      Quarterly/Annual Awards Score Sheet.
      8.3.2. The AF Form 1206 is worth a total of 45 points for quarterly/annual, up to 25
      points for Leadership/Job Performance, up to ten points for Significant Self
      Improvement and a total of ten points for Base/Community Involvement. Board
      Members will evaluate each nominee’s AF Form 1206 and score them using the
      “Quarter/Year Score Sheet” (Attachment 7). After each nominee’s AF Form 1206 has
      been scored, rank nominees by merit order one through X (number of packages) and
      ensure you break your own ties. After ranking the nominees, record rank only on the
      “Quarterly/Annual Awards Final Score Sheet” (Attachment 8).
 10                            WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI36-2800 21 FEBRUARY 2014


      8.3.3. FFB is worth a total of 20 points for quarterly/annual. Board Members will
      evaluate each nominee and score them using the (Quarter/Year Score Sheet). Nominees
      are required to physically appear before the FFB. Individual exceptions will be granted
      for deployments, TDYs, emergency leave, or similar circumstances. The request must be
      coordinated through the respective Group Chief to be excused by the Wing Command
      Chief. If excused, nominees will receive “average” interview score. Nominees that are
      not excused will receive zero points for interview score. Board Members will evaluate
      each nominee during the interview. After all nominees have met the board, each board
      member will rank nominees by merit order one through X (number of packages) and
      ensure you break your own ties. After ranking the nominees, record rank only on the
      “Quarterly/Annual Awards Score Sheet.”
   8.4. Recording Process:
      8.4.1. Board members will consolidate scores from the AF Form 1206 and FFB into the
      “Quarterly/Annual Awards Score Sheet.” Final scores will be given to the Board
      President and/or recorder when all records have been scored. The board president and/or
      recorder computes the total score of each eligible by adding the ranking order of all the
      voting members (i.e., a candidate ranked by the board as #1, #2, #1, #1 will receive a
      total score of 5). After computing the total scores they will determine an order-of-merit
      by ranking the lowest score first and the highest score last on the “Quarterly/Annual
      Awards Final Score Sheet.” In the event, two or more members have the same overall
      score, the board president; score will be used to break the tie. Additionally, all nominees
      will be completely ranked in order of merit in case an elected becomes disqualified.
   8.5. TWP Quarterly/Annual Awards Ceremony and Memento Procurement. An appropriate
   ceremony will be organized to recognize and present award recipients with mementos on a
   quarterly and annual basis.
      8.5.1. Appropriate mementos will be purchased and presented with approval of the 88
      ABW/CCC.
   8.6. Approval Authority. The 88 ABW/CC or designated representative is the final
   approving authority for all board results and will make the public release.
9. Award Recognition.
   9.1. Winners will be announced at the Team Wright-Patt Quarterly/Annual Recognition
   Ceremony. The POC for these events will be Installation Command Chief or designee.
   9.2. The 88 ABW Public Affairs Office will ensure award winners are given maximum
   publicity through Wright-Patterson Public Website and the SkyWrighter.
