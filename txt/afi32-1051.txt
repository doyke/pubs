This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities, and provides guidance for
establishing and maintaining a roof management program. It also specifies use of the Manual for
Inspection and Maintenance of various roofing systems, which is published by The National
Roofing Contractors Association. This publication applies to all Air Force, Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) units and personnel. This publication may be
supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) of this publication for coordination prior to certification approval. The
authorities to waive wing/unit level requirement in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-
0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications
and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver
approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the addition of Tier wavier authority requirements, updated office symbols, and updated
references.
1. Program Objective. The objective of a roof management program is to optimally manage
roof systems over their life cycles to meet the required levels of service for Air Force real
property. Roof management involves an asset management approach, taking into account
performance measures, periodic inspections, routine maintenance and repair, and correct
application of quality roofing products.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Air Force Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C):
        2.1.1. Establishes policies for roofing systems.
     2.2. Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC):
        2.2.1. Establishes standards and criteria for design, maintenance, repair, and
        management of roofing systems IAW mandatory requirements of UFC 3-110-3, Roofing
        and UFC 3-110-4, Roofing Maintenance and Repair. (T-0)
        2.2.2. Reviews emerging technologies and evaluates for applicability to the Air Force.
        2.2.3. Evaluates roofing training conducted internally by the Air Force.
        2.2.4. Assists major commands (MAJCOMs) and bases in troubleshooting roofing-
        related issues.
     2.3. MAJCOMs:
        2.3.1. Manage roofing programs within the command.
        2.3.2. Appoint a roof engineer to monitor command roofing programs.
     2.4. Base Civil Engineer Squadron:
        2.4.1. Manage the base roofing program as required by Executive Order 13327, Federal
        Real Property Asset Management (EO 13327) in accordance with asset management
        principles and as a component of the facilities Activity Management Plan (AMP). (T-0)
        2.4.2. Design and maintain roofs IAW mandatory requirements of UFC 3-110-3 Roofing
        and, UFC 3-110-4, Roofing Maintenance and Repair. (T-0)
3. Roof System Database. The purpose of the database is to help in effectively managing roof
system assets. BUILDER™ Sustainment Management System (SMS), a Government Off-the-
Shelf (GOTS) tool, is the primary Air Force SMS system. BUILDER™ must be utilized,
updated, and maintained by the installation. (T-0) It tracks information on the type and age of
roof and assigns a condition to the roof based on a fixed set of criteria. With this information, it
can provide a remaining service life prediction, and reveal when to execute corrective
maintenance or repair actions. Other Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and GOTS tools are
authorized, at the installation’s expense, as a secondary database to support BUILDER™ for
greater project-level details helpful to the base roof technicians and roof engineer.
AFI32-1051 17 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   3


4. Condition Assessment. Accomplish condition assessments in accordance with criteria in
BUILDER™ SMS. If a roof section is not inventoried in SMS, upload data as part of the annual
maintenance inspections. (T-1)
5. Maintenance Inspections. To promote the efficient and economical use of Air Force real
property assets as required by EO 13327, inspect all roofs at least once annually in accordance
with the inspection guidelines outlined in the BUILDER™ Condition Assessment Manual. (T-1)
