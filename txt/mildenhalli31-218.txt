   ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs; or (4) is commonly
   associated with gangs, extremist, and/or supremacist organizations, or organizations that
   advocate sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination. Vehicle operators will be cited
   and given 72 hours to remove offensive material.
5. Traffic Circulation Control.
   5.1. General. RAF Mildenhall is located in an area of normally light to moderate traffic on
   the roadways adjacent to and through the installation. The A1101 separates the AYA, Child
   Development Center and officers housing area from the main base. Lincoln Road runs east
   to west, between the fenced portions of the installation, separating the major arteries leading
   onto the installation. Lincoln Road is currently blocked off prior to Gate 1 and, therefore, is
   not an access route to the installation. RAFM is located in an area of normally light to heavy
   traffic on the roadways adjacent to and through the installation. Peak traffic hours occur
   Monday-Friday, 0700-0830, 1130-1300, and1600-1730. Note: Per AFI 91-207; Individuals
   are not authorized to jog, run or walk on roadways with high traffic density during peak
   traffic periods. Road guards or safety spotters will be utilized to safely control traffic for
   formation runs or group running events.
   5.2. Special Features of Traffic. The roadways both on and off the installation present three
   definite hazards: First, the roads are constructed for British automobiles and larger US
   manufactured vehicles have difficulty maneuvering. Second, British roads are constructed
   for right-hand drive vehicles and a large percentage of the vehicles driven by base personnel
   are left-hand drive. Third, limited parking on the installation compounds problems with
   traffic flow during peak periods.
   5.3. Responsibilities.
       5.3.1. The 100 MSG/CC
          5.3.1.1. Will ensure an effective and safe traffic program is maintained.
          5.3.1.2. Ensures the MSG/CD monitors the traffic circulation and parking plan.
          5.3.1.3. Is responsible for execution of this instruction. Implementation and operation
          is delegated to the DFC.
       5.3.2. DFC is responsible for coordinating on all traffic circulation and parking requests.
       5.3.3. Base Civil Engineering.
          5.3.3.1. Appoints a Traffic Management Working Group Coordinator.
          5.3.3.2. Prepares, coordinates, and monitors the traffic circulation and parking
          program.
26                                                   MILDENHALLI31-218 23 JULY 2013


        5.3.3.3. Provides long-range base project plans for proper traffic planning.
        5.3.3.4. Provides normal maintenance of streets and adjoining land.
     5.3.4. FSS or LRS will provide a wrecker service for emergency removal of POVs
     involved in accidents or that present significant traffic safety hazards. LRS will only tow
     GOVs (on or off base). The only exception is noted during the impoundment of a vehicle
     upon direction from SFS (requires liability release from SFS prior to LRS moving any
     vehicle).
     5.3.5. Traffic Management Working Group.
        5.3.5.1. Consists of a minimum of a CES, an SFS, a LRS and a Safety POCs.
        5.3.5.2. Reviews and recommends approval/disapproval for AF Form 332s, Base
        Civil Engineer Work Request, requiring 100 MSG/CD approval.
        5.3.5.3. Meets at least twice annually to review new AF Form 332s requiring TMWG
        coordination.
        5.3.5.4. Reviews Parking and Traffic Circulation plans.
        5.3.5.5. Recommendations by the TMWG will be submitted as approved work orders
        for CES/CEO action for minor works, or forwarded to the Facilities Board for
        ARW/CC approval.
  5.4. Adverse Road and Weather Conditions.
     5.4.1. Adverse road and weather conditions occur in and around RAFM, normally during
     winter months. Preplanning for fog, black ice, and flooding is recommended for all
     vehicle operators.
     5.4.2. RAFM experiences heavy fog conditions from October through February with
     early morning fog as the greatest threat during December and February. The Command
     Post (CP) will announce current fog conditions over the base public address system.
     5.4.3. During periods when visibility falls below a quarter of a mile, GOVs will not be
     operated off base unless the reason is mission-essential and privately owned vehicle
     operators should reduce speed and exercise extreme caution. Only essential vehicles are
     permitted to operate on the flightline IAW MILDENHALLI 13-202, Airfield Motor
     Vehicle Traffic Control, and then at a reduced speed commensurate with the conditions.
     During periods when visibility falls below 1/10 mile, only EMERGENCY GOVs will be
     permitted to depart the base or operate on the flightline and privately owned vehicle
     operators should consider postponing their journeys IAW MILDI 13-202. Flightline
     vehicle speed limits will be reduced to 5mph. The operation of POVs on the flightline
     will be discouraged by all supervisors and prohibited at the discretion of Airfield
     Management Operations during limited visibility.
     5.4.4. Use of low beam headlamps and rear fog lights are mandatory during periods of
     decreased visibility.
     5.4.5. The hazard of sheet ice (black ice) on the roadways is a serious problem occurring
     predominantly between 1900-0900, November through March. Historically, January and
     February are the most hazardous months due to the difficulty in detecting the presence of
MILDENHALLI31-218 23 JULY 2013                                                              27


     ice on the roadway. Caution should be utilized by vehicle operators when driving off
     base and should be curtailed. Vehicles operating on the flightline will be reduced to
     essential vehicles only when conditions for black ice are present.
     5.4.6. Flooding does occasionally occur during heavy rainstorms. When these conditions
     occur, individual actions will be taken to reroute traffic around flooded areas.
     5.4.7. Road Conditions. (See Attachment 4)
        5.4.7.1. When weather conditions dictate a change in driving conditions and/or
        school delays/closures, the CP will make the appropriate notifications (paragraph
        5.4.7.5.). In the event of road conditions red or black, the CP will initiate an
        information only recall. Commanders and directors can direct a recall or direct
        delayed reporting at their discretion based on mission needs, therefore reporting
        instructions will vary depending on unit, job, and place of residence.
            5.4.7.1.1. To find out the current driving condition and to check the status of
            DoDD school delays/closures, the first option should be to access
            http://www.Mildenhall.af.mil from a government computer or from home.
            Alternately, personnel can call the weather line at DSN 238-3541 (or commercial
            01638-543541). The information will also be broadcast on local radio stations.
        5.4.7.2. Weather Condition Change Process. The following outlines the process for
        changing weather conditions.
            5.4.7.2.1. The on-duty SF Flight Chief or designated representative will ensure:
            5.4.7.2.2. Contact is made with base weather to ascertain weather report and
            condition.
            5.4.7.2.3. Morning Weather Sweeps. SF patrols will check high volume morning
            traffic routes on base for severe road or weather conditions and report information
            to the BDOC no later than (NLT) 0430 daily. The BDOC will crosscheck with
            RAF Lakenheath BDOC and local civilian police to ascertain road conditions for
            Suffolk County.
            5.4.7.2.4. Whenever weather and road conditions make driving hazardous and
            increase the likelihood of accidents (i.e., excessive fog, snow, ice), the on-duty
            Flight Sergeant or designated representative (BDOC) will contact the DFC (100
            SFS/CC) to recommend a weather condition change. BDOC will also contact the
            Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC) at ext. 2763/2762 whenever there is
            a road condition change.
            5.4.7.2.5. An SF patrol will continue to verify road conditions throughout the day
            and ensure updates are immediately relayed if the weather continues to
            deteriorate.
        5.4.7.3. The DFC or designated representative will recommend road condition
        changes to the MSG/CC or designated representative.
        5.4.7.4. The MSG/CC or designated representative will then contact the CP with the
        appropriate road/weather condition and determine appropriate delayed reporting of
        Mission Essential Services Only (MESO).
28                                                   MILDENHALLI31-218 23 JULY 2013


         5.4.7.5. The CP will contact the following agencies when notified of a change in
         road/weather condition, MESO status, or school/bus delay/closure:
             5.4.7.5.1. 100 SFS/BDOC to confirm the official change in road/weather
             condition. SFS will make a blotter entry, change road condition sign at
             installation entry points, and brief personnel at entry points on driving
             conditions/speed limitations.
             5.4.7.5.2. 100 OSS/OSW (Weather Flight) will update the Weather Line
             information and school reporting procedures.
             5.4.7.5.3. 100 ARW/PA will update the Mildenhall intranet web page, update the
             public access webpage and the Commander’s Access Channel slides. PA will
             send out base-wide e-mail informing the base populace of the change in
             road/weather condition and any other pertinent safety information.
     5.4.8. Squadron commanders will individually make determination on selective recalls
     and notifications within their units.
     5.4.9. All MESO delays or cancellations still require Essential Service Personnel (ESP)
     to report for severe weather operations as determined by squadron commanders, and are
     instructed to proceed with care and caution.
  5.5. Special Event Contingencies. The planning, supervision and direction of traffic control
  procedures required for such events as “open days”, perimeter fun runs, bazaars, air shows,
  and base carnivals will be the responsibility of the Security Forces Police Services section
  (100 SFS/S3OP). Any agency or organization planning/hosting such an event must
  coordinate with 100 SFS/S3OP at least 60 days prior to the event date. 100 SFS/S3OP will
  ensure 100ARW/SE reviews all traffic control plans before implementation.
  5.6. Traffic Signs and Devices. When possible, traffic control signs and devices will be in
  compliance with British standards. Those where there are no equivalent British sign or
  device will be based on the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MOUTCD). The
  100 ARW/CES will be responsible for monitoring traffic control devices used on the
  installation. The Base Civil Engineer is responsible for the construction, procurement,
  placement and maintenance of the required control devices based on work orders submitted
  by their traffic Safety Engineers. The installation commander will be the approving authority
  for all major traffic projects and programs. Police Services (S3OP) and Safety will also
  ensure long-range base projects and plans are identified for proper traffic planning.
  5.7. Military Formations. You may not pass a marching/running formation until signaled by
  the person controlling the formation. The speed limit while passing formation is no faster
  than 5mph. Personnel conducting physical fitness training are present everywhere on base.
  Runners are required to yield to vehicles on all roadways, intersections, and crosswalks.
  Road guards or safety spotters will be utilized to safely control traffic.
  5.8. Off-Base Driving Restrictions. It is prohibited to pass any vehicle traveling on the
  following roads: the Al101 (between Bury St. Edmunds and Littleport); the A1065 (between
  Brandon and the five-ways roundabout); the C620 (also known as “Holywell Row,”
  connecting A1101 and B1112); the B1112 (between Methwold, Hythe and Icklingham); the
  B1107 (between Brandon and Thetford); Wangford Road (between A1065 and B1112) and
MILDENHALLI31-218 23 JULY 2013                                                               29


   “Sedge Fen Road” (connecting A1101 and B1112). Exception: Slow-moving vehicles –
   defined as any vehicle traveling less than 30 mph. When passing slow-moving vehicles,
   drivers have the responsibility to do so only where passing is safe and authorized by UK
   traffic laws. Any driver who violates the no- passing policy will face appropriate action
   under this instruction, Article 92 of the UCMJ, or other lawful authority. This specifically
   may include revocation of 3AF Form 435.
   5.9. Minor Vehicle Accidents: Security Forces will respond to minor vehicle accidents for
   the purpose of verifying the accident does not meet the criteria of a major accident. SF will
   encourage parties involved to exchange insurance information. All reported minor vehicle
   accidents will require a 100 SFS 1315A/Minor Vehicle Accident Worksheet and basic blotter
   entry that include time, date and location. Additionally, if the 100 SFS 1315A is generated
   the SF individual completing the document will reflect whether seat restraints were used and
   where applicable, if air bags were deployed. All GOV major and minor accidents will
   require a USAFE Form 281 Supervisors Report of Mishap and it be sent to the 100 ARW
   Safety Office. All information must be input into SFMIS by the patrolman. No matter where
   an individual is stationed at, if they are involved in a vehicle accident on RAF Mildenhall
   then SF will respond and accomplish the paperwork.
      5.9.1. On-base minor vehicle accidents do not require an investigation by SF, however
      does require an SF and base safety response if requested. Both parties will exchange
      information (i.e. insurance details, home address/phone numbers, sponsor/squadron
      information and commander/first sergeant contact numbers). Vehicles involved in the
      accident will not be removed unless they create a traffic hazard, endanger life, or are
      ordered moved by SF personnel.
      5.9.2. Off-base accidents must be reported to Security Forces BDOC if involving injuries
      to military personnel or damage to military property to Security Forces BDOC within 24
      hours of the accident.
   5.10. Sobriety Checkpoints. The DFC is authorized to publish a monthly letter directing SF
   patrolmen to conduct sobriety checkpoints at targeted dates and times.
      5.10.1. SF patrolmen will conduct sobriety checkpoints, stopping every vehicle passing
      through the checkpoint. Personal contact will be made with each driver and determination
      made as to his or her suitability to operate a motor vehicle.
      5.10.2. On-duty SF Flight Chief may cancel sobriety checkpoints due to safety
      considerations or adverse weather conditions.
6. Emergency Vehicles.
   6.1. Emergency Vehicle Lights. Only emergency vehicles will be equipped with blue or red
   emergency lights and must conform to the color specified for emergency services vehicles in
   the traffic code of the host country law. In accordance with United Kingdom law, only fire,
   police and ambulance vehicles may be equipped with blue lights. Fire service control,
   explosive ordnance disposal and base disaster mobile command post vehicles may be fitted
   with red warning beacons for use at the scene of an emergency. All other vehicles authorized
   to operate on the taxiways and runways (i.e. airfield management, maintenance vehicles,
   flight safety, and alert trucks) will be equipped with hazard warning lights (four-way
   flashers) or yellow warning beacons as required by the Department of Transportation. Other
 30                                                   MILDENHALLI31-218 23 JULY 2013


   organizations may equip and operate emergency vehicles if engaged in fire, police or
   lifesaving calls, after written coordination with LRS, 100 SFS/S3 and approval of the 100
   MSG/CC.
   6.2. Permissible Conduct For Emergency Vehicle Operators.
      6.2.1. When responding to an emergency call, pursuing an actual or suspected violator of
      the law and responding to but not returning from a fire, medical, or other emergency
      response, operators of authorized emergency vehicles may:
          6.2.1.1. Park or stand in any area the emergency responders deem beneficial to the
          response, irrespective of another provision of this instruction.
          6.2.1.2. Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, after slowing as necessary for
          safe operation.
          6.2.1.3. Will not exceed 10 MPH over the speed limit, for the operators safety and
          will not endanger life or property.
      6.2.2. Security Forces and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) personnel
      may operate an authorized vehicle without utilizing the audible or visual signals required
      if the operator is responding to an emergency call or pursuing a suspected violator when
      they reasonably believe that:
          6.2.2.1. Knowledge of the presence of the Security Force Member or AFOSI Agent
          will cause the suspect to:
              6.2.2.1.1. Destroy or lose evidence of a suspected felony.
              6.2.2.1.2. End a suspected continuing felony before the Security Force Member
              or Special Agent has obtained sufficient evidence to establish grounds for
              apprehension.
              6.2.2.1.3. Evade apprehension or prevent identification of the suspect or the
              suspect’s vehicle.
      6.2.3. Due to traffic conditions on a roadway, emergency vehicle operators must be
      aware that vehicles moving in response to the audible or visual signals may increase the
      potential for a collision or unreasonably extend the duration of the pursuit.
      6.2.4. Operators of authorized emergency vehicles are not relieved from the duty to
      operate their vehicle with appropriate regard for the safety of all persons or the
      consequences of reckless disregard for the safety of others.
