This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, by providing
guidance and procedures supervisors need to schedule civilian employees (except non-US citizen
employees employed outside the United States and the District of Columbia) for work and
holiday observances. It tells how to establish work schedules, rest and lunch periods, make
ready and clean-up time. It describes work subject to premium pay and shows how to get
approval for holiday work.

the 42d Air Base Wing (ABW), who work an 8-hour per day, 40-hour per week daytime work
schedule where the organization is not required to cover hours outside the 0730-1630 time frame
in order to meet mission requirements; it does not apply to AFRC, ANG, or tenant units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) as paragraph 2.3, (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2), and
authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA)
programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders
(para 3.3). Organization and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for
beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of
duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative workplace
arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations (para
3.2). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 which had previously
been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample AWA
agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.

1. Scope of Applicability. This instruction applies Air Force-wide, to appropriated fund
civilian employees, including US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard Title 5,
United States Code.
2. Terms and Definitions.    The following terms and definitions are used in this instruction.
   2.1. Administrative Workweek. The Air Force administrative workweek begins at 0001
   Sunday and ends at 2400 on the next following Saturday. The calendar day on which a shift
   begins is considered the day of duty for that day even though the day of duty extends into the
   next calendar day or into the following administrative workweek.
   2.2. Alternative Work Schedules (AWS).          Work schedules made up of flexible or
   compressed schedules.
   2.2. (AU) See Attachment 4 for guidance on Flexible Work Schedules.
   2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA).             Working under a flexiplace
   arrangement, either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center
   (See Attachment 2 for a sample agreement).
   2.4. Basic Workweek. The days and hours of an administrative workweek which make up a
   full-time employee’s regularly scheduled 40-hour workweek.
   2.5. Compressed Schedule. Compressed schedule means for a full-time employee, an 80-
   hour biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the
   case of a part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours
   which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays.
   2.6. First 40-Hours. The first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than
   six days of the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is
   impractical to prescribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday.
   2.7. Flexible Schedule. Flexible schedule is that portion of the work day during which the
   employee has the option to select and vary starting and stopping times within established
   limits set by installation level approving officials for AWS.
   2.7. (AU) See Attachment 4 for guidance on Flexible Work Schedules.
   2.8. Holiday Work. Work performed on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday.
   2.9. Observed Day. Observed day is a holiday in which employees are given time off on a
   day other than the date which the holiday actually falls on.
   2.10. Part Time. In some circumstances it is not possible to obtain or use an employee’s
   services for the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when
   service on a regular, repetitive basis is required at least one day during each administrative
   workweek, however, additional service may be required during the remainder of the
   administrative workweek.
   2.11. Regular Tour of Duty. The regular tour of duty for Air Force employees is five 8-hour
   days, Monday through Friday.
 4                                                         AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


     2.12. Special Tour of Duty for Educational Purposes. A special tour of duty of no less than
     40 hours in an administrative workweek which may be established by supervisors to permit
     employees to take courses at nearby educational institutions.
     2.13. Standby. Certain types of work require employees to remain at their duty stations for
     long periods of duty, a substantial part of which is standby time. For example, the tour of
     duty for firefighters generally is a 72-hour workweek of three 24-hour days. The tour is
     scheduled so that the employee is on duty three alternate 24-hour shifts during each
     administrative workweek, and deviations from this tour are kept to a minimum. The basic
     weekly tour of duty for fire chiefs, assistant fire chiefs, fire prevention inspectors, and similar
     fire protection personnel is 40-hour workweek of five 8-hour days unless the duties of the
     position require substantial amounts of standby time.
     2.14. Uncommon Tour of Duty. Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include
     Saturday and or Sunday, for four workdays or less but not more than six days of the
     administrative workweek. An uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary
     for efficient operations or when the cost of operations can thus be reduced without imposing
     undue hardship on employees.
3. Basic Authority:
     3.1. Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders establish the hours for opening and
     closing the installation.
     3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish
     by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of
     duty including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and
     location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods
     for their respective organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated
     representative should set work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance
     mission requirements, efficiency and economy of operations, and employee needs. These
     determinations are subject to approval by the installation commander or his or her designated
     representative who has authority for operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant
     commanders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs
     approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to installation
     commanders as provided in 3.3.
        3.2.1. Organization and tenant commanders may also establish regularly scheduled tours
        of duty of more than 40 hours within the administrative workweek when such action is
        essential to mission accomplishment, and when other administrative action such as
        changes in authorized staffing or detail of personnel is neither feasible or desirable.
        Except under extraordinary circumstances, a tour of duty which includes regular overtime
        should not extend beyond 48 hours in an administrative workweek. Organization and
        tenant commanders may extend the regularly scheduled administrative workweek to any
        length exceeding 40 hours when emergency conditions exist and it is necessary for
        mission accomplishment. The extension of the tour of duty will be subject to the
        requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
     3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major
     Commands (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU)
AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                5


   are authorized to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may
   delegate this authority to installation commanders
   3.4. Supervisors. Supervisors will generally schedule employee’s work on the same hours
   each day, and breaks in excess of one hour during a day will not be permitted. Supervisors
   must give a minimum of one week’s notice to employees when they are to be assigned to a
   different tour of duty or to different hours of duty except as provided under AWS or for
   educational purposes.
      3.4.1. Commanders may grant an exception to this requirement when circumstances
      preclude compliance, for example, when a change in shifts by a contractor requires
      immediate corresponding change in the tour of inspectors, or when normal operations are
      interrupted by events beyond the control of management, such as, fire, flood, breakdown
      of equipment. Commanders assure that changes in established work schedules are kept to
      a minimum and made only when necessary to resolve operational problems.
4. Tours of Duty:
   4.1. Tours of Duty for Educational Purposes. Supervisors may establish special tours of
   duty for educational purposes.
      4.1.1. Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes cannot be
      paid premium pay solely because the rescheduling of his or her tour of duty causes him or
      her to work on a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise
      be required.
      4.1.2. Supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly
      scheduled shift requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs
      are incurred. Supervisors must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is
      assigned to or changed from a special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of
      premium pay. Supervisors must maintain a record of these tours of duty for the purpose
      of responding to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) inquiries.
   4.2. Posting Work Schedules. Supervisors must post copies of work schedules for all tours
   of duty, except regular Monday through Friday tours, which include the names of assigned
   employees in the work area. Supervisors must maintain a copy of employee’s work
   schedules in their operating office. Supervisors:
      4.2.1. Post a written statement of actual work requirements for standby tours of duty.
      4.2.2. Give employees with regularly scheduled 60 or 72 hour standby tours of duty 30
      calendar days notice of any reduction in the percentage of premium pay resulting from a
      change in work requirements.
      4.2.3. Give employees with regularly scheduled 40-hour tours of duty plus scheduled
      standby time as much notice as possible when changing their duty schedule.
      4.2.4. Review work requirements periodically for changes which may affect the payment
      of premium compensation and revise work schedules where necessary.
   4.3. Scheduling Rest Periods. Supervisors may schedule short rest periods, not exceeding 15
   minutes during each four hours of continuous work, when the supervisor believes the rest
 6                                                      AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


     periods will be of benefit to the service. (NOTE: Supervisors must adhere to applicable
     labor management agreements if they contain provisions for the granting of rest periods.)
        4.3.1. Criteria to be followed by supervisors in determining the justification for granting
        rest periods are:
            4.3.1.1. Protection of employee’s health by relieving them from hazardous work or
            very physical work.
            4.3.1.2. Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential.
            4.3.1.3. Relieve those who work in confined spaces.
            4.3.1.4. Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production.
     4.4. Scheduling Lunch Periods. When supervisors schedule lunch (or other meal) periods,
     during which the employee is entirely free of the duties of his or her position, the period is
     not considered as duty time for which compensation is paid.
        4.4.1. Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty
        when one or two shifts are in operation.
        4.4.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an
        overlapping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible, supervisors may
        authorize an on-the-job lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch periods
        require that:
            4.4.2.1. Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations. Under
            these conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is
            compensable.
            4.4.2.2. Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work
            will not receive compensation for that time.
     4.5. Scheduling Make Ready and Clean-Up Time. Incidental duties that are directly
     connected with the performance of a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or
     materials, undergoing inspections, and similar tasks are considered part of the job
     requirements within the employee’s established tour of duty. Supervisors must arrange work
     shifts so that time required for incidental duties will be part of the 8-hour day.
        4.5.1. When incidental duties cannot be part of the regularly scheduled workday, the
        extra time for which overtime may be paid to an employee, will not exceed 30 minutes a
        day.
5. Holiday Observances:
     5.1. Holiday Duty. Supervisors must not require employees to work on holidays or days
     designated as observed days, unless the work is justified by unusual circumstances or if the
     maintenance of usual essential services is involved.
        5.1.1. Supervisors will order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing
        by an official designated to authorize holiday work. Supervisors must obtain this
        approval before work is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it
        constitutes authority for expenditure of funds and certification that funds are available to
        pay the employee. Supervisors ordering work on a holiday or employees required to
AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               7


     remain on duty during an emergency will not require advance approval for the work.
     Supervisors must record the reasons for the holiday and the hours worked by the
     employees no later than the following workday. This requirement does not apply to tours
     of duty regularly scheduled on a holiday or observed day for employees engaged in
     essential services such as firefighters, police, hospital employees, or other service
     personnel. The supervisor will record holiday work on an AF Form 428, Request for
     Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time.
  5.2. Observed Day. When a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, observe that
  day as the holiday. If a holiday falls on Sunday and the employee has a regularly scheduled
  40-hour basic workweek of Monday through Friday, the employee will observe the following
  Monday as the holiday. When the holiday falls on Saturday, the employee will observe the
  holiday on the proceeding Friday.
     5.2.1. When a holiday falls on a Sunday and that Sunday is a nonworkday for employees
     with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek of other than Monday through
     Friday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday.
         5.2.1.1. When a holiday falls on the nonworkday designated as the day in-lieu-of
         Sunday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. When a holiday
         or a designated observed day falls on an employee’s nonworkday (Monday through
         Saturday), the workday immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday.
     5.2.2. Deleted
  5.3. Deleted
  5.4. When full-time employees on a compressed work schedule are relieved or prevented
  from working on a day designated as a holiday, they are entitled to basic pay for the number
  of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
  5.5. Holiday observances for employees who work a flexible schedule are the same as those
  for full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek.
  5.6. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee’s regularly scheduled workday, the
  employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to
  work on the actual day of the holiday.
     5.6.1. If full-time employees observe an "in-lieu-of" day instead of the actual holiday and
     that "in-lieu-of" day falls within a part-time employee’s work schedule, the part-time
     employee will not get that day off with pay.
     5.6.2. When a holiday is observed by full-time employees on a day within the part-time
     employee’s regularly scheduled workweek and the part-time employee is prevented from
     working that day, the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours
     he or she is scheduled to work on that day.
     5.6.3. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee’s nonworkday and is observed by
     full-time employees that day, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.
     5.6.4. When a part-time employee is on a flexible schedule and is relieved or prevented
     from working on a day designated as a holiday by a Federal statute or Executive Order
8                                                       AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


       (E.O.), the employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the
       employee would have worked on that holiday up to eight hours.
       5.6.5. When a holiday falls on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu
       of" day for that holiday.
       5.6.6. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and is relieved or
       prevented from working on a day within the employee’s scheduled tour of duty that is
       designated as a holiday by Federal statute or E.O., the employee is entitled to basic pay
       for the number of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
       5.6.7. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls
       on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday.
    5.7. Duration of Holiday. The full 24-hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the
    duration of a holiday. However, when an employee’s regular workday begins on a holiday
    and extends into the next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine
    the employee’s entitlement to holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday.
    If an employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty includes two shifts beginning on a holiday,

                ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS (AWA)

A2.1. REASONS FOR AWA. Employers offer alternative workplace arrangements for many
reasons. Such arrangements may:
   A2.1.1. Improve the quality of work life and job performance and increases productivity,
   e.g., reduce office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading,
   analyzing and writing;
   A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance
   work and family demands;
   A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;
   A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
   A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees
   who have partially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site
   location;
   A2.1.6. Accommodate employees who have temporary or continuing health problems or
   who might otherwise have to retire on disability;
   A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic
   recruitment pool; and
   A2.1.8. Decrease traffic and parking congestion, energy consumption and air pollution.
A2.2. Organizations planning to use AWA should address issues such as the following: work
assignment/performance requirements, time and attendance, work schedule and tour of duty,
duty station, leave, equipment/supplies, labor relations issues, and other related work
arrangement requirements.
A2.3. Sample Agreement Between Organization, Supervisor, And Employee Approved For
An Alternative Workplace Arrangement On A Continuing Basis: The supervisor and
employee should each keep a copy of the agreement for reference.
Organization_______________________          Employee____________________________

Voluntary Participation. (Name)____________________________, the employee, voluntarily
agrees to work at the approved alternative workplace indicated below and to follow all applicable
work-related policies and procedures. The employee recognizes that the flexiplace arrangement
is not an employee benefit or entitlement, but an additional method the organization may
approve to accomplish work.

Trial Period. The employee and organization agree to try out the arrangement for at least
(specify number) months unless unforeseeable difficulties require earlier cancellation.

Salary and Benefits. Unless there is a change in the actual number of hours worked, a
flexiplace arrangement in itself is not a basis for changing the employee’s salary or benefits.

Leave. Employee agrees to follow established organization/office procedures for requesting and
obtaining approval of leave.

Overtime. Employee agrees to work overtime only when ordered and approved by the
supervisor in advance, and understands that working overtime without such approval may result
in termination of the flexiplace privilege and/or other appropriate action.

the employee with all necessary office supplies and also reimburse the employee for business-
related long-distance telephone calls (see AFI 33-111, paragraph 7.2. regarding
telecommunication service, and AFI 33-112, paragraph 19.5. regarding computer equipment in
the alternative worksite).

employee agrees to the following security provisions: (insert organization-specific language).

Liability. The employee understands that the Government will not be liable for damages to an
employee’s personal or real property while the employee is working at the approved alternative
workplace, except to the extent the Government is held liable by the Federal Tort Claims Act or
the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act.

Work Area. The employee agrees to provide a work area adequate for performance of official
duties.
AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               13


Worksite Inspection. The employee agrees to permit the Government to inspect the alternative
work place during the employee’s normal working hours to ensure proper maintenance of
Government-owned property and conformance with safety standards. (Organizations may
require employees to complete a self-certification safety checklist).

Alternative Workplace Costs. The employee understands that the Government will not be
responsible for any operating costs that are associated with the employee using his or her home
as an alternative worksite, e.g., home maintenance, insurance or utilities. The employee
understands he or she does not relinquish any entitlement to reimbursement for authorized
expenses incurred while conducting business for the Government, as provided for by statute and
regulations.

Injury Compensation. The employee understands that he or she is covered under the Federal
Employees Compensation Act if injured in the course of actually performing official duties at the
regular office or the alternative worksite. The employee agrees to notify the supervisor
immediately of any accident or injury that occurs at the alternative workplace and to complete
any required forms. The supervisor agrees to investigate such a report immediately.

the employee and supervisor, but the supervisor makes the final decision about requirements.
The employee agrees to complete all assigned work according to procedures established by the
supervisor and according to guidelines and standards in the employee’s performance plan. The

disclosure or damage and will comply with requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.
552a.

Standards of Conduct. Employee agrees he or she is bound by Government/organization
standards of conduct while working at the alternative worksite.

the regular office after notice to the supervisor. Employee understands that the organization may
cancel the flexiplace arrangement and instruct the employee to resume working at the regular
office. The organization agrees to follow any applicable administrative or negotiated procedures.

Other Action. Nothing in this agreement precludes the organization from taking any
appropriate disciplinary or adverse action against an employee who fails to comply with the
provisions of this agreement.

                                       TEXT OF IC 99-1

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of
alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) as paragraph 2.3, (re-numbering the remaining terms
and definitions in paragraph 2.), and authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish
alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate
this authority to installation commanders (para 3.3). Organization and tenant commanders
establish by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour
tour of duty, including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and
location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for
their respective organizations (para 3.2). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2,
4.3, and 4.4 which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with
information and a sample AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised
material is indicated by a bar (|). The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.
2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement,
either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2
for a sample agreement).
3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by
written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty
including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for
alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective
organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set
work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency
and economy of operations, and employee needs. These determinations are subject to approval
by the installation commander or his or her designated representative who has authority for
operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant commanders set the hours and locations
for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they
delegate this authority to installation commanders as provided in 3.3
3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major
Commands (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are
authorized to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this
authority to installation commanders.

                                 Attachment 4 (Added-AU)
      AIR UNIVERSITY AND 42D AIR BASE WING FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES

A4.1. (Added-AU) Applicability. This Flexible Work Schedule (FWS) guidance is
implemented for all appropriated fund civilian employees assigned to AU and 42 ABW, who
work an 8-hour per day, 40-hour per week daytime work schedule where the organization is not
required to cover hours outside the 0730-1630 time frame in order to meet mission requirements.
Prior to approving an employee’s request to work a FWS, the employee’s supervisor must ensure
that mission requirements will be met if the employee’s request is approved.
   A4.1.1. (Added-AU) The FWS described herein is the only Alternate Work Schedule
   authorized for AU and 42 ABW employees; therefore, use of any other Alternate Work
   Schedules, i.e., Compressed Work Schedules (four ten-hour days, eight nine-hour days with
   one eight-hour day and a day off every pay period, etc.), Maxiflex Schedule, Gliding
   Schedule, etc., is prohibited.
   A4.1.2. (Added-AU) Forty-hour work week with an arrival time between 0600 and 0900.
   A4.1.3. (Added-AU) Core hours are 0900 to 1500. All full-time employees must be
   present for duty during core hours except for during the employee’s lunch break.
   A4.1.4. (Added-AU) Lunch breaks may be either 30 minutes or one hour as long as mission
   requirements are met.
   A4.1.5. (Added-AU) Once an employee’s FWS is approved, the schedule will be the same
   each day of the pay period and will not change from day to day or week to week or pay
   period to pay period. The only time the employee’s FWS may change is if the employee
   submits another request and the supervisor approves a new FWS, the supervisor determines
   it is necessary to change the employee’s work schedule in order to meet mission
   requirements or the employee has conduct or performance issues.
   A4.1.6. (Added-AU) Under this FWS, hours worked in excess of eight hours per day may
   be requested and approved as credit hours, but must be approved by the supervisor prior
   to the employee working the hours.
   A4.1.7. (Added-AU) Credit hours may be used the pay period following the one in which
   credit hours are earned; however, a maximum of 24 credit hours may be carried over per pay
   period. Once 24 credit hours have been earned, the employee must use a portion of the credit
   hours before additional credit hours may be earned; however, the total credit hours may not
   exceed 24 credit hours at any given time. Once earned, employees must request and receive
   approval prior to using credit hours for time off.
   A4.1.8. (Added-AU) The employee will be given a two-week notice if the supervisor
   determines it is necessary to change the employee’s work schedule for reasons stated in
   A4.1.5.
A4.2. (Added-AU) Employees must request the schedule that he/she wants to work by
submitting a written request to his/her first-level supervisor using a Request for Flexible Work
Schedule memorandum; see Figure A4.1. If approved, the employee’s request must be effective
at the beginning of a pay period. The original letter requesting the FWS, that includes the
AFI36-807_AUSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                     21


supervisor’s decision, will be given to the employee and a copy of the same letter will be filed in
the employee’s AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, file.
