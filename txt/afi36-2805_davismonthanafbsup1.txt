                                               Chapter 1

       GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS

1.1. Nominating Procedures. Commanders at all levels actively advertise the nomination procedures
for trophies and awards. Commanders verify achievements and nominate those qualified for appropriate
awards. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders, vice commanders, or executive directors indorse nom-
inations on their personnel. When nominating persons or units assigned to other commands, commanders
acquire by letter, the coordination of the commander or vice commander of the owning MAJCOM, FOA,
or DRU. Submit nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS, with the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU com-
mander's coordination.

1.2. Air Force-level Awards. Air Force functional activities or private organizations establish Air
Force-level awards. The designated OPR and HQ USAF/DPXPQ approve implementing instructions.
Notify HQ USAF/DPXPQ when the award is terminated.
   1.2.1. The experts in a given function will manage functional awards. Functional managers will
   ensure nomination write-ups are limited to two pages, using the Air Force Form 1206, Nomination
   for Award. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by HQ USAF/DPX. Functional areas
   requiring the use of base visits to determine award winners will limit such visits to one visit per base
   per award.

1.3. Wartime Guidance. Programs governed by this instruction will continue during conflicts below
the level of declared war. In the event of a national emergency declared by Congress or the President of
the United States, programs sponsored by Headquarters (HQ) USAF may be suspended. The Air Force
will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored by private organizations.

1.4. Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. Commanders at any level may establish
special trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and units or organiza-
tions. Include such recognition programs in appropriate base supplements.
   1.4.1. Awards may be named in honor of living or deceased Air Force military members and Depart-
   ment of the Air Force (DAF) civilians who had honorable records and made significant contributions
   to the Air Force or to the functional area in which the award is being established. Consider individu-
   als of prominence or those whose careers or actions were important and meaningful to the function in
   which the award will be established. Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the indi-
   vidual to ensure the individual is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When
   establishing an award, the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the appro-
   priate commander or vice commander, to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS notifying of the establishment of the
   award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or instruction. Process all supple-
   ments and instructions in accordance with AFI 37-160V1, The Air Force Publications and Forms
   Management Programs – Developing and Processing Publications. Commanders at all levels are
   responsible for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of special trophies and awards programs. All
   awards named for individuals will be established only in accordance with this instruction. The
   requirements of this instruction are mandatory when considering memorial-type awards. List what
   sources were reviewed to perform the background check and that verification has been made that no

    derogatory information was found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their
    honor.
    1.4.2. Possible sources to review when determining individuals' suitability for memorialization are:
       1.4.2.1. Military personnel records (retired or deceased military members), which are located at
       the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), Air Force Reference Branch, 9700 Page Boule-
       vard, St. Louis MO 63132-5100.
       1.4.2.2. Civilian personnel records (retired or deceased DAF civilians), which are located at the
       National Archives and Records Administration, NPRC (Civilian Personnel Records), 111 Win-
       nebago Street, St. Louis MO 63118.
       1.4.2.3. Public libraries for archived newspaper articles.
       1.4.2.4. Local newspapers.
       1.4.2.5. Local courthouse records.
       1.4.2.6. Local Air Force Office of Special Investigations or Security Police.
       1.4.2.7. Interview family, friends, acquaintances, and coworkers.
    1.4.3. Do not duplicate existing trophies and awards programs in either name or criteria. (Recogniz-
    ing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports or a citation to accompany an award is
    not considered duplication or dual recognition.) Award elements will not duplicate elements of exist-
    ing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601, volume 1, USAF Budget Guidance and Procedures,
    for further guidance regarding funding for award elements. Awards must be of nominal value. Awards
    may not be redeemable for cash, merchandise, or services. The cost of awards will be commensurate
    with the significance of the achievement being recognized.
    1.4.4. A one-time unique trophy or award may be given to an individual or unit whose achievements
    make a significant contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air Force.
    1.4.5. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Recognition and Appreciation Award: The Twelfth Air Force
    Commander, Command Chief Master Sergeant and/or the 355th Wing Commander, Command Chief
    Master Sergeant will present recognition and appreciation awards to military and civilian personnel
    who, by their dedicated individual efforts, have facilitated the successful accomplishment of a partic-
    ular program, function, or mission. This award provides senior leadership with an informal means to
    show special recognition of, and appreciation for, a job well done. The recognition and appreciation
    award may be a coin, pen, or other memento. Group Commanders are also authorized to use coins,
    plaques, pens, or similar items as a form of recognition for presentation to assigned members.

3.4. 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY) Award. Established by the Air Force, this program
recognizes 12 enlisted members in a range of grades representing a cross section of career fields. The
AFA honors the 12 OAY and their spouses at its annual convention in Washington DC each year. HQ
AFI36-2805_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP1_I 1 APRIL 2003                                                             21


AFPC/DPPP sends a message outlining nomination procedures to the MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs each
year. Send nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS by 30 April.
   3.4.1. There are three categories of competition: Airman (airman through senior airman); NCO (ser-
   geant and technical sergeant); and Senior NCO (master sergeant through chief master sergeant).
   3.4.2. Base nominations only on achievements that occurred during the current calendar year. For
   example, the nominees' achievements for the 1998 program should cite achievements occurring from
   1 January 1997 through 31 December 1997. Since nominees are representatives of the Air Force
   enlisted force, they must also stand the test of a "whole life/whole career" scrutiny, although the obser-
   vation period for the award is 1 year.
   3.4.3. All nominees must sign a statement of intent agreeing if selected as a MAJCOM, FOA, or
   DRU nominee, they will obtain the required retainability in order to compete at Air Force level. All
   nominees who meet the Air Force selection board must have sufficient retainability so that, if selected
   as a 12 OAY, they can serve on the AFA Enlisted Advisory Council for a 12-month period which com-
   mences the month of their induction (September) as a 12 OAY. For example, the 1998 12 OAY serve
   from September 1998 through September 1999. Therefore, the 1998 MAJCOM and DRU nominees
   would need retainability through 30 September 1999. The annual HQ AFPC/DPP nomination mes-
   sage outlines procedures to follow to obtain retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU nominees
   who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Personnel Procurement Division, Reenlist-
   ment Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE), for assistance regarding retainability. Failure on the part of the
   MAJCOM or DRU to meet retainability requirements on their nominee will result in the nominee
   being withdrawn from the Air Force-level competition. If an individual is not selected as a 12 OAY,
   cancel the extension.
   3.4.4. Send statement of intent, signed and dated by the nominee, which includes the following state-
   ments verbatim:
      3.4.4.1. “I have not applied for a commissioning program and, if selected as a 12 OAY, will not
      apply for a commissioning program at any time during my tenure as a 12 OAY.”
      3.4.4.2. “If selected as a 12 OAY, I agree to serve in the capacity as an enlisted ambassador rep-
      resenting and assisting the Air Force in enlisted recruiting and retention efforts and matters. I
      understand I may be called upon by my MAJCOM commander and MAJCOM/CCC to publicize
      and promote ‘the Air Force way of life’ and attend events or other venues deemed appropriate
      which may positively impact upon recruiting and retention.”
      3.4.4.3. “I attest that the facts I have provided for this nomination are true and correct to the best
      of my knowledge.”
   3.4.5. If the MAJCOM or DRU will not submit nominations, send a letter or message to HQ AFPC/
   DPPPRS advising of this.
   3.4.6. Nomination packages will include:
      3.4.6.1. A general information page formatted as shown in Attachment 5.
      3.4.6.2. A write-up, limited to two single-spaced typewritten pages, using the AF Form 1206 for

                                   BOARD MEMBER’S GUIDANCE

A17.1. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Quarterly/Annual Board Members are under orders from the
355th Wing Commander not to discuss their scored packages. Winners’ names are only to be released at
the official Awards Ceremonies.

A17.2. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Members must be fair and impartial. Set aside any bias (positive
or negative) and evaluate the packages based only on the substance of the package before you. No outside
influence or prior personal knowledge will be used when scoring the packages. You will not be scoring
packages from your organization. Quality and impact of the accomplishments are important, not the
quantity. White space should not be a negative factor. However, please keep in mind it is not the “impor-
tance” of one’s job you’re rating, but what the individual did within their job. For example:
SSgt Doe dropped 50 bombs on Baghdad and TSgt Shmoe flipped fifty burgers at the dining facility.
These are their jobs----one is not better than the other. What did they do in their jobs that set them apart
from the person on the next shift? Did SSgt Doe have a bomb on target accuracy rating of 90% when the
squadron average was 60%? Did TSgt Shmoe flip 75 burgers an hour when the average cook flipped on
50? Did Shmoe invent a new BBQ sauce that 90% of the customers liked better than the old one? What
did the individual do to make a difference and improve his/her niche in the Air Force? This is the type of
thing we need to evaluate.
You should compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly. Pay careful atten-
tion to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count for anything. They actually detract from the
write-up. A category could have five bullets and still get a zero if none of them meet the category criteria.
Within the range of points, 6-10 point system using half point increments, you must differentiate between
nominees. You should evaluate them on the “whole person” concept relative to each other. Things to look
for in each category are listed below .

A17.3. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY
DUTY
The member’s leadership and job performance in their primary duty, including the development of new
techniques, must have contributed significantly to improve mission effectiveness during the calendar
year. You should be looking for individual accomplishments-not unit accomplishments .

A17.4. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
The member must have contributed tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian community’s welfare,
morale, or status during the calendar year. This includes base/squadron/community involvement such as
Top-3, booster club, coach of a youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an
organization is not as strong as being in a leadership position (president, secretary, coach, team leader,
head organizer, etc.).

A17.5. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT
The member must have shown this improvement through off-duty education, achievements in profes-
sional or cultural societies or associations, development of creative abilities, and so on during the calendar

year. Includes military and civilian classes, professional development, self-development, etc. In general,
self-improvement that is voluntary carries more weight than just attending a mandatory class the indi-
vidual was scheduled for.
This is an important program for our people. Give the packages the time and effort they deserve. When
you’re finished, set them aside. If you have time, take another look later and adjust as necessary .
Once you have an established score for each nominee, identify the highest rated nominee with a “1,” the
second with a “2,” etc. No ties are allowed; if you have two packages that are very close you must decide
which to rate higher. (Remember this is a “whole person” program and you are selecting who you think
will best represent the wing using the aforementioned scoring criteria.)
Relative rankings from each board member will be added together to determine the winner.

                                    BOARD PRESIDENT’S GUIDE

A18.1. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) This guide is to assist the president in ensuring the board runs
smoothly and professionally.

A18.2. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Quarterly/Annual Board Members are under orders from the
355th Wing Commander not to discuss their scored packages until after the awards luncheon. Win-
ners’ names are only to be released at the official Quarterly Awards Luncheon.
Ensure you know the ranks, names, and units of your fellow board members.
Explain the criteria for review of packages. Members are to focus on the information listed on the AF
Form 1206 and grade packages accordingly. The amount of information provided is not the determining
factor, but the quality of information provided for the period being considered is paramount. Remind
members that in order to be fair and consistent in their scoring, they MUST set aside all prejudices and
evaluate the packages in accordance with the provided guidelines. This honest and unbiased review will
give our program the integrity and fairness it deserves.

A18.3. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Ensure each nominee’s rank and name are written on the score
sheets that are provided in your board’s packages.

A18.4. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Total the raw scores and order of merit rankings for each nomi-
nee’s packages.

A18.5. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Once the board is finished scoring their packages, board mem-
bers must date and sign score sheets and turn in their folders along with the score sheets to the president.

A18.6. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Thank members for their participation and efforts in making our
recognition program a meaningful and successful one.

A18.7. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Ensure all score sheets, packages, pencils, and calculators are
turned back in to the Command Chief Master Sergeant’s Assistant.

A19.1. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) . INSTRUCTIONS:
Do not score your own group package. If you have any ties you must break those ties prior to finalizing
your evaluation. When scoring:


Consider the whole person concept.                          Be consistent in your process.
Score: 6-10 in half point increments, i.e. 6, 6.5           Rank: #1, #2, etc.

Things to look for in each category:



A19.2. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) Leadership and Job performance in primary duty
Significant leadership accomplishments and how well the member performed assigned primary and addi-
tional duties. Scope and level of responsibilities and the impact on the mission and unit. New initiative or
techniques developed by the member that positively impact the unit and/or the mission. Results of Air
Force, MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force-level inspections and/or evaluations. Awards received; e.g., NCO
of the Quarter, Maintenance Professional of the Year, and so forth. You should be looking for individual
accomplishments, not unit accomplishments.

A19.3. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Impact of the member's positive leadership and involvement in both the military and civilian community.
Leadership, membership, or participation in unit advisory councils, professional military organizations,
associations, and events; e.g., president of the Top 3, enlisted dining-out committee, member of Air Force
Sergeants Association, Sunday school teacher, and so forth .

A19.4. (Added-DAVIS MONTHAN) SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT
Developed or improved skills related to primary duties; e.g., formal training, career development course
enrollment or completion, on-the-job training, certifications, off-duty education related to primary duties,
and so forth. Including completion of any professional military education (PME) as well as awards earned
during in-residence attendance. Including any off-duty education not directly related to primary duties;
e.g., class, course, degree enrollment and/or completion, grade point average. Any other relevant training
or activity that significantly enhanced the member's value as a military citizen. Includes military and civil-
ian classes, professional development, self-development, etc. In general, self-improvement that is volun-
tary carries more weight than just attending a mandatory class the individual was scheduled for.
