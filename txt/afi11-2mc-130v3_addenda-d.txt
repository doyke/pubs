                                                Chapter 1

                                                POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations are
available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encountered
day-to-day.

1.2. Responsibilities. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most appropriate con-
figuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and man-hours to
change. Units performing services on the MC-130W aircraft (e.g., maintenance, life support) are respon-
sible for configuring the aircraft in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and as outlined in mission
directives to include the stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipment tables
outlined herein.

1.3. Codes. Use the following codes when referring to MC-130W cargo compartment configuration. The
letter code will be followed by a number identifying configuration capability.
    1.3.1. AE – Aeromedical Evacuation
    1.3.2. C – Cargo
    1.3.3. CP – Cargo and Passengers
    1.3.4. LP – Psychological Operations
    1.3.5. P – Passenger
    1.3.6. RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel
    1.3.7. TAC – Tactical Airdrop Cargo
    1.3.8. TAP – Tactical Airdrop Personnel

1.4. Modifications. The coded configurations of this regulation may require modification for a specific
mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission execution to ensure maximum
flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the basic con-
figuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy mission requirements. For example, a
cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-cargo con-
figuration. Indicate the mission directive configuration C (number as applicable) and modification, e.g.,
two additional seats and bulldog winch required.

1.5. Weight and Balance.
    1.5.1. Configuration and necessary equipment changes to conduct special operations missions affect
    the weight and balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the location of equipment, items
    shown in Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft
    except for maintenance, inspection and when removal is directed by this Air Force Instruction (AFI)
    Equipment listed in Table 2.2. will be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and
    Balance Clearance Form F, reference 5, 6, or 7. For simplicity the loadmaster will (when preparing
    the DD Form 365-4 Form F) enter the weight contained in the equipment tables for the applicable con-
AFI11-2MC-130V3_ADDENDA-D 7 JULY 2008                                                                     5


   figuration. Adjustments will be made when the actual on-board weight of an item varies from data
   shown. DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.
   1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1. is accomplished at a For-
   ward Operating Location and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority is
   deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A, Main-
   tenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment of any
   equipment added or removed. The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from
   the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record. Annotate the new
   weight and moment in Block 1 of DD 365-4. Configuration changes accomplished at home station
   require a QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changes after
   crew reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the loadmaster.
NOTE: Operations Group Stan/Eval assisted by Quality Assurance will develop a list of items removed
when configuring the aircraft for RAPID 1 and 2. Stan/Eval will provide what items will be removed,
Quality Assurance will provide the weights, fuselage station, and moment for each item. File the list
behind the DD form 365-3. This list will be used when making corrections at a forward operating location
IAW paragraph 1.5.2.

1.6. Distribution. Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all
affected personnel. At least one copy will be maintained in the unit operations section. It will be readily
accessible to operations and aircrew personnel. Additional distribution will be as follows:
   1.6.1. Staff operations, all levels.
   1.6.2. All levels of aircrew standardization offices.
   1.6.3. Command posts/operations centers.
   1.6.4. Air terminal operations centers (ATOC).
   1.6.5. Aerial Delivery Support Branch (ADSB)/Aerial Delivery Flight (ADF).
   1.6.6. Aircraft maintenance squadrons/units, Dash 21 equipment sections, Quality Assurance sec-
   tions.
   1.6.7. Aircrew Life Support sections.
   1.6.8. One located in the supplemental weight and balance handbook binder on each aircraft.
   1.6.9. One copy to each MC-130W loadmaster.

1.7. Revisions. All revisions will consist of electronic interim change or new publication. Personnel at all
echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction. Direct proposed changes
to AFSOC/A3V in accordance with AFI 11-202 Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and
AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program. Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publica-
tion.

1.8. Supplements. Subordinate unit supplements to this instruction that change the basic policies, proce-
dures, or formats prescribed herein are prohibited. Exception: Groups may supplement Table 2.2. with
additional items. They may also supplement Chapter 3 with specified configuration modifications to
accommodate theater unique requirements. Forward supplements to HQ AFSOC/A3V for approval.

NOTE:
1. Minimum equipment required. Units may add more equipment to meet specific mission or theater
requirements. At all times the amount of tiedown equipment required will include enough equipment to
secure the landing gear in an emergency as well as secure all cargo and loose equipment. When
additional equipment is added, QA will update the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. (See exception in
paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.).
2. Minimum number of ground loading ramps required. More ramps will be added for RAPID
configurations. Generation IV ramps are the only type authorized for RAPID configurations. A full set
of Canary Slides may be used in lieu of ground loading ramps.
3. Minimum life support equipment required IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1, AFSOC Sup 1, Aircrew Life
Support (ALS) Program.
4. The number of raft spaces dictates the total number of personnel (crew and passengers) that may be
on the aircraft for over-water missions. In other words, if you have three 20 man rafts installed you can
only have 60 personnel, including crew, on board for over-water missions.
5. All two-gallon emergency water containers will be stored empty. If mission dictates, containers will
be sanitized and filled with water by support personnel. Annotate in 781K emergency water containers
are full. After the mission, sanitize and dry containers then reinstall. When the water containers are
filled the DD Form 365-3, Chart C will be updated to reflect the added weight. (See exception in
paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.)
6. Roller conveyors may be removed dependent on aircraft configuration. DD form 365-3, Chart C, will
be updated accordingly (see exception in Para 1.5.). Unless mission necessity dictates otherwise, aircraft
will depart home-station with all roller conveyors

                            CARGO COMPARTMENT CONFIGURATION

3.1. Configuration. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configurations for the MC-130W
Aircraft. Although modifications to the basic configuration are authorized to meet special requirements,
the following factors should be considered:
     3.1.1. Side-wall and wheel-well seats should be installed/stowed on all missions unless otherwise
     depicted by this instruction. One-man side-wall seats will not be used unless connected to a two-man
     seat (except AE-2 configuration). Note: One-man seat at FS 457 right side removed for strap stowage,
     If mission requirements dictate seat may be installed All following figures and seat counts do not
     reflect this seat being removed.
     3.1.2. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches. Aircraft without accommodations for 24 inch
     spacing will be configured for 20 inch spacing, it may be necessary to skip every fifth seat for para-
     troopers using 20 inch spacing.
     3.1.3. Pallet position six is limited to 4,527 pounds when dual rails, rollers, and ramp air deflectors
     are installed. With only dual rails and ramp air deflectors installed, (rollers removed) pallet position
     six is limited to 4,687 lbs. See T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Manual, for other restrictions.
     3.1.4. Drawings in this volume are not drawn to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.
     3.1.5. Safety aisle requirements are depicted in paragraph 4.2. and Figure 4.1.
     3.1.6. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, maintain a 30-inch
     space between cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or nuclear cargo. When cargo, either
     palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, 30-inch spacing is not required.
     EXCEPTION: Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.

                                                 Chapter 4

                                           REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.

4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following emergency
exits and safety aisles are available.
   4.2.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
   4.2.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops. This does
   not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress. Litters and
   seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an obstruction.
   4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in the wheel
   well (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits. In
   the wheel well area the aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the
   cargo and the aircraft and will begin at the cargo floor (Figure 4.1. A). Tiedown equipment (463L
   nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction. The aisle way
   should normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the air-
   craft, then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained. The dual rail outboard frame
   provides 8 inches of the 14 inch requirement on the main cargo floor. In the ramp area the aisle way
   will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the dual rail frame. Access to aft
   latrine facilities requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward right side of the cargo loaded on the
   ramp.
   4.2.4. If safety aisle requirements in 4.2.3. can not be achieved on missions carrying crew only or
   mission essential personnel authorized by operations order/plan or COMAFSOF, then a safety aisle
   will be maintained in the wheel well area to provide the following minimum clearance (Figure
   4.1.B.).
       4.2.4.1. At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no
       higher than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
       4.2.4.2. Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning
       no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
   4.2.5. During airdrop missions, loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to accomplish
   tactical checklists.
   4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of
   the aircraft. The aircraft commander will be the final authority for determining if safety aisles and/or
   access aft of cargo is adequate. Cargo loads in Chapter 6 of T.O.1C-130A-9 are specific and do not
   require a waiver.

                                  DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD Form 365-4
Form F. The Form F will be computed using simplified moments or with the approved C-130 Automated
Form F (AFF) program. All entries and signatures must be legible.

5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft
will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition. Consideration must
be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.

5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments, entries on the
form may be either typed, handwritten, or computer entered (See C-130 AFF training guide for detailed
instructions).
   5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number, departure
   and destination station (name or International Civil Aviation Organization) identifier), aircraft’s home
   station and pilot's rank and last name.
   5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter appropriate weight and C/G limits for the planned mission using the
   following criteria: The maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified in T.O.
   1C-130(M)W-1, Flight Manual MC-130W will not be exceeded. Gross weight may also be limited by
   operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude, runway/taxi-
   way bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions. The pilot/flight engineer will inform the
   loadmaster of any gross weight restrictions prior to the mission so an accurate allowable cabin load
   (ACL) may be obtained.
       5.3.2.1. Takeoff ACL. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 allowable gross weight
       for MC-130W aircraft, and subtract the total aircraft weight (Reference 12).
       5.3.2.2. Landing ACL. Unless other landing restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 for C/MC-130
       aircraft, and subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (References 9 and 23).
       5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. Compute IAW limiting wing fuel charts in Table 5.1. of this instruc-
       tion or the charts in section V of T.O. 1C-130(M)W-1 for takeoff and landing. The most restrictive
       weight will be used.

NOTES:
The limiting wing fuel chart in this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated air-
speed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limiting wing fuel charts. When specific mis-
sion requirements exceed the limitations outlined in area "C" of the limiting wing fuel charts, the
loadmaster must compute limitations using the appropriate flight manual limiting wing fuel chart in sec-
tion V of T.O. 1C-130(M)W-1.
Enter the allowable gross weight for limiting wing fuel and subtract the operating weight (Reference 9) to
determine limiting wing fuel allowable cabin load (ACL).

        5.3.2.4. Permissible C/G Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity lim-
        itations using the center of gravity table in T.O. 1C-130(M)H-5. The permissible center of gravity
        (CG) zero fuel weight blocks will be left blank.
     5.3.3. Signature Block:
        5.3.3.1. Computed by: Signature, rank, and organization.

and Loading Data and Chart E.
     5.4.1. Remarks section.
        5.4.1.1. Enter a breakdown of ramp fuel weight for each tank to the nearest 100 pounds and
        moments using the fuel moment tables contained in T.O. 1C-130(M)H-5. An alternate method of
        computing fuel moments is accomplished by multiplying the total fuel by 0.552. In this instance
        show only the total fuel weight and moment for takeoff and landing.
        5.4.1.2. Enter estimated fuel burn off (FBO) below the total takeoff fuel. Subtract anticipated fuel
        burn off from total take off fuel. If no HAR or Air Refueling (AR) is anticipated, this is your esti-
        mated landing fuel (ELF). Enter the break down of ELF and total ELF in the remarks block.
NOTE: Use the following criteria to compute in-flight fuel consumption. Subtract 500 pounds per hour
(PPH) when refueling pods are removed.
First hour of flight (climb-out)               8,000 PPH
Normal flight at altitude                      6,000 PPH
Low altitude flight (low level)                7,000 PPH
        5.4.1.3. Enter anticipated fuel on load for AR (label it as AR) and anticipated fuel offload HAR
        (label it as HAR) below the anticipated FBO. Add and subtract as appropriate AR, HAR and FBO
        to arrive at ELF. Enter the break down of ELF and total ELF in the remarks block.

5.5. Limiting Wing Fuel. Table 5.1. may be used to determine maximum limiting wing fuel ACL for a
given fuel load when in primary fuel management. Comply with the requirements outlined in paragraph
5.5.1. when using Table 5.1. Fuel weights are expressed in thousands. For fuel weights between chart
weights, go to nearest fuel weight to determine base weight. Both takeoff and landing conditions must be
calculated. The most restrictive will be placed on the DD-365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F -
Transport.
   5.5.1. Instructions for primary fuel management. Table 5.1. is based on the recommended areas
   (Areas A, B, and C) of the Weight Limitations Chart (Primary Fuel Management) (Non Air Refueling
   Mission, Non MCARS aircraft) With Foam In Fuel Tanks. For Operations that do not meet these cri-
   teria, use the appropriate chart in T.O. 1C-130(M)W-1, Section V, to determine ACL.
