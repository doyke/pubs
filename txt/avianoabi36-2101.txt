1. General.
     1.1. Commanders require new personnel to be ready to dedicate their full attention to unit
     mission accomplishment: be "mission-ready” at the earliest possible time. Effective
     sponsorship initiates the mission-ready process before a member departs the losing base and
     continues the process until the member is settled and on-duty at Aviano Air Base.
     1.2. The Aviano Sponsorship Program is a commander's program. The commander's
     emphasis on the importance of sponsorship, both at the wing- and unit-level, establishes the
     benchmark of effort dedicated to a successful unit sponsorship program.
     1.3. It is mandatory to appoint a sponsor for all inbound military personnel and civilians.
2. Assignment Notification.
     2.1. Initial two-way communication between the sponsor and newcomer will begin within 2
     duty days of the unit generating information for sponsor assignment.
3. Diversions.
     3.1. When a newcomer is diverted to another base, all sponsorship activities stop.
     3.2. When a newcomer is diverted to another unit at Aviano, the unit to which the individual
     is currently assigned continues the sponsorship process until the Military Personal Data
     System (MiLPDS) has been updated to reflect the new unit. A new sponsor from the
     reassigned unit is assigned and updated in MiLPDS and a hand over from sponsor to sponsor
     is accomplished.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. Installation Commander (Commander, 31st Fighter Wing):
        4.1.1. Establishes, publishes, and monitors Aviano sponsorship requirements.
        4.1.2. Responds to feedback/questions/challenges from Groups.
AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013                                                                   3


     4.1.3. Presents Achieving Top Levels at Sponsorship (ATLAS) Award.
  4.2. Squadron Commander:
     4.2.1. Establishes and oversees the unit INTRO program according to AFI 36-2103 and
     this instruction.
     4.2.2. Appoints a Unit INTRO Manager (UIM), usually a member of the unit’s CSS.
     4.2.3. Select individuals for sponsorship duties who can best provide assistance, extend
     welcome, orient newcomers, have transportation, and knows the local Aviano area (for
     example, matching officers with officers, Senior Non Commissioned Officers (SNCO)s
     with SNCOs, Airman (Amn) with Amn, married with married, pet owners with pet
     owners, etc.).
  4.2.4. Ensures sponsors are given time away from their duty section from newcomer arrival
  through the first 14 days after the first day of Right Start to execute their official sponsor
  duties and not on leave, Temporary Duty (TDY), or deployed. Sponsor duties are official
  duties and will be considered very high priority by commanders and supervisors when
  allocating tasks during the first two weeks after a newcomer’s arrival. Sponsors are expected
  to be able to drive the newcomer around the local area for house hunting and inprocessing
  appointments during the first several weeks at Aviano since the newcomer will likely not
  have transportation available. Sponsors are eligible to buy 100 extra liters of gas above their
  normal ration to facilitate house hunting for the newcomer. Contact Pass and Registration
  for information on this additional gas ration.
     4.2.5. Ensure all supervisors of inbound newcomers are engaged in sponsoring the
     newcomer and fulfill their supervisory responsibilities to welcome the new
     Airman/civilian and his/her family, and get them settled at Aviano and ready for duty.
     Ensures supervisors work closely with sponsors to include backing up sponsors in case
     sponsors are unable to fill some sponsor duties. In essence, in addition to supervisory
     duties, all supervisors are “back-up sponsors” and should be engaged with the sponsors
     and the newcomer throughout the PCS process.
     4.2.6. Ensures spouses are afforded the benefits of the sponsorship process through
     implementation of a voluntary spouse-to-spouse sponsorship program.
     4.2.7. If the sponsor does not have a spouse, or the sponsor's spouse is unable/unwilling
     to sponsor the incoming spouse, Commander identifies volunteer spouse sponsors in the
     unit and/or utilizes the Key Spouse to sponsor the inbound spouse. Ensures unit Key
     Spouses are empowered to obtain newcomer spouse contact information to initiate
     spouse-to-spouse contact well in advance of arrival. Attachment 5 is a Sample Spouse
     Welcome Letter.
     4.2.8. Writes a personalized welcome letter for all newcomers that contains all essential
     elements as per Attachment 3 (Sample Unit Commander’s Welcome Letter). This letter
     will be addressed to the newcomer by name (not “Dear Newcomer”) and will include the
     sponsor’s name and contact information (phone and e-mail address as a minimum).
     Additionally, the letter will ask the newcomer to reply via e-mail or phone to ensure good
     connectivity, and will also ask the newcomer to provide their spouse’s contact
     information (if married) so that the sponsor’s spouse or Key Spouse can initiate contact
4                                                         AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013


       and welcome the inbound spouse to the unit. Bottom line – this letter should be
       personalized, comprehensive, and proactive in pulling information from the newcomer
       and ensuring good connectivity. The importance of this initial contact from the unit
       commander, and establishment of good two-way communications, cannot be overstated.
       4.2.9. Allocates time for Unit Sponsorship Training for sponsors.
       4.2.10. Provides recognition within the unit (one-day pass, etc.) for sponsors who excel
       in their sponsorship duties.
    4.3. Military Personnel Section (MPS) Chief:
       4.3.1. Manages INTRO according to AFI 36-2103; and this publication.
    4.4. Base INTRO Manager/Military Personnel Section:
       4.4.1. Manages INTRO according to AFI 36-2103; and this publication.
       4.4.2. Sends the inbound allocation notice and/or other documentation to the UIM and/or
       CSS to notify the unit of inbound personnel.
       4.4.3. Utilizes email or telephone calls to assist or resolve individual problems in cases
       where a relocating member is within 30 days of departure and sponsorship actions are not
       completed.
       4.4.4. If the member is not within 150 days of the Projected Departure Date (PDD),
       holds sponsor MiLPDS update until the 150th day before the PDD.
       4.4.5. Notifications for members with more than 150 days out are sent a letter/email
       notifying them of their sponsor assignment at 150 days out. Attachment 5 is Sample

Note: Your duties as a sponsor are much more than simply meeting
the newcomer at the airport/Pax Terminal and taking them to their
lodging/dorm room. Your duties start at initial contact months in
advance of arrival and continue until the newcomer and family is
moved in their house/dorm at Aviano, has a vehicle, HHGs are
delivered, and are functioning on their own with no assistance needed.
Your role in making this happen is critical so please do everything
possible to be a great sponsor. Thanks!

         SPONSOR’S WELCOME LETTER AND NEWCOMER’S CHECKLIST

Dear (personalize with Newcomer’s Name),


Congratulations on your assignment to Aviano AB, Italy! As your sponsor, I will play a key role
in assisting you during your PCS. By working together, we can ensure you have a smooth
transition to your new home in Italy.


If possible, schedule your flight to arrive Wed-Sat so you will begin base in-processing (“Right
Start”) on Monday. You must complete the Checklist Items below before your arrival – some of
the items are “showstoppers” and failing to complete them will cause major problems and
possibly even cause you to incur additional expenses. Also, please review the helpful tips in the
Notes Section below the checklist. These notes provide important information on frequently
asked questions about housing, transportation, family members, pets, and other important PCS
considerations.


The most important thing you can do to prepare for your PCS is to be proactive and to keep a
positive attitude. PCSing to Aviano is tougher than most other bases, but it is not that difficult to
do with preparation and a good attitude. You have lots of people and resources at Aviano that
will help you during your PCS, but only you can ensure a successful, smooth move. Get smart
on the requirements, handle the big things early (no-fee passports/visas, pet travel, etc.), and let’s
start communicating regularly so I can assist you as you transition to Aviano. Also, the best
website to start learning about Aviano is our official website (www.aviano.af.mil). This website
has an excellent Newcomers link that is the authoritative source for PCS information about
Aviano. Check it out ASAP.


Please let me know that you got this letter by sending me an e-mail at (sponsor.e-
mailaddress@us.af.mil). In that e-mail, please include your contact information (work e-mail,
personal e-mail, work phone, and home/mobile phone). Also, please include e-mail and phone
contact info for your spouse as our Key Spouse would like to contact her to welcome her to
Aviano. (remove the line about spouse info if not married) You can also call me at DSN: 314-
632-XXXX, Commercial: 0039-0434-30-XXXX. I know you have a lot of questions so let’s
start talking! I’ll be here to support you from now until you get established at Aviano (normally
about 60 days after arrival).


Again, welcome to Aviano and I look forward to hearing from you soon that you received this
letter. Thanks!
 16                                                       AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013

Note 1: It is absolutely essential that each family member obtains a no-fee passport and visa
prior to leaving your current assignment. It is a mandatory requirement and failure to complete
AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013                                                                    17


this subjects your family to risk of deportation. Please report to your losing MPS Customer
Service and inquire about procedures from the passport agent for processing a no-fee passports
and Italian "Missione" Visas. Process could take months. This cannot be accomplished while in
Italy; therefore, as soon as orders are received start the process. Contact the Aviano Passport
Office for any questions/problems (DSN 314-632-4802 // 31fss.passports@us.af.mil). More
passport info is available at: http://www.31fss.com/passport.shtml


Note 2: When you have your confirmed flight reservation, contact your sponsor and provide the
information. The sponsor will reserve your lodging based on family and pet requirements you
provide. There is limited availability for pet rooms so do keep your sponsor up to date with your
travel information. If you need to contact lodging, Mountain View Lodge, they can be reached
by calling DSN: 314-632-4040 or by e-mail 31svs.fsvl@us.af.mil. If you will be residing in the
dorms, provide your sponsor a copy of orders, so your sponsor can notify the dorm manager.


Note 3: Ship your personally owned vehicle (POV) 6-8 weeks before your departure. Military
members are authorized to import one tax-free vehicle. Military married to military are
authorized two tax-free vehicles registered in their names. All other vehicles are subject to
Italian road tax which is based on engine size.
Aviano Air Base facilities are not located in one contiguous area and are located in several
different areas. You will be required to do business in different locations and a POV is essential.
Since there is no base housing, you will be free to house-hunt with your own POV. Taxis are not
allowed on base and are very expensive, and it is expensive to rent cars in Europe and Italy is no
exception, so having your POV available as soon as possible after arrival will significantly help
you during the transition to Aviano.


Note 4: All personnel must have a valid stateside license and be 18 years of age in order to
receive an AFI license, which is required to drive any vehicle registered at Aviano AB. Military
members must be assigned to an Aviano unit. Civilian employees and all family members must
be command sponsored or have logistical support in order to receive an AFI.
International Driver's License (obtainable from AAA) may be required whenever traveling
outside of Italy so it is recommended to obtain one prior to leaving the U. S.



       NOTE TO MOTORCYLE OPERATORS: All motorcycle operators need to have
       stateside endorsements prior to arrival. Italian law prohibits those under 21 from driving
       a motorcycle higher than 25KW or 33HP.



       NOTE REGARDING VISITING FAMILY MEMBERS: If a visiting family member
       completes AFI process for authorization letter, they can operate an AFI plated vehicle,
 18                                                        AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013


       only with an AFI privileged person/family member in the vehicle at all times (in
       accordance with NAVSUPPACT Naples Instruction 11240.19G.).


Note 5: It is important to accomplish your AFI test and print the certificate before you arrive.
Members are not allowed to pick up or register personal vehicles until they have obtained their
AFI license.        To complete your AFI License Test, go to the A&FRC web
sitehttp://31fss.com/afrc_AFI_tests_signs.shtml . At the top of the home page, click on Inbound,
then Driving in Italy. To prepare for the test, review the Aviano AB Driver’s Study Guide and
the European Road Signs guides. When you have learned the information at these links, click on
the AFI TEST MODULE and follow the instructions on the screen. To pass you must receive
100% on both sections; print each certificate and bring with you to Right Start.


Note 6: Your spouse is highly encouraged to attend Right Start with you. If you require child
care, you can contact CDC Front desk at DSN 314-632-8247 or 314-632-5117 to scan and/or
email an advance application (DD Form 2606) with a copy of your orders. You can also email
the CDC at: 31fss.cdc@us.af.mil. Visit the 31st Force Support Squadron web site
(www.31fss.com) to complete the application and check out the child and youth programs. A
copy of your Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders is required. Special slots are reserved at
the CDC for those attending Right Start, so make this request by contacting the CDC now.


When you arrive on base, contact or drop by the CDC or Youth School Age Program (SAP) to
activate your application. Applications are required for all individuals who want to register for
the waiting lists, to include military married to military and single parents. If child care is
required upon arrival to the base, call the CDC directly and/or work closely with your sponsor
who can assist you in making child care reservations and check your current status on the waiting
list.


Priority Care
Aviano AB has established priorities for child care in the CDC and Youth SAP based on the
Department of Defense (DoD) mandated requirements per AFI 34-248 and AFI 34-249.
Additionally, for full-time or before and after school child care in child development or school
age programs, the highest priority for care goes to active duty military and DoD civilian
employed parents who are either single parents or whose spouse is employed full time, is a
military member on active duty, or a full-time student.


      Priority 1: Single and Dual Military Families (military married to military) and
       Reservists on active duty (with a family status Single Parent/Dual Military)
      Priority 2: Single and Dual Military or Command Sponsored DoD Civilians with a full
       time working nonmilitary spouse (working 20 hours per week or is a full time student)
       Priority 3: Families with an unemployed spouse
AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013                                                                      19



Child care resources at Aviano are limited as the facilities and staff are sized/funded to meet
Priority 1 requirements only. Aviano’ s CDC has found creative ways to extend some child care
to Priority 2 and Priority 3 parents, but it is limited due to resource constraints. As such, parents
in Priority 2 and 3 can expected limited routine child care availability at the CDC.


Note 7: Housing at Aviano is unique in that there is no on-base family housing. As such,
newcomers should expect to live in economy housing. For a list of available community houses,
visit the housing website: www.AHRN.com to start your search.


Italian housing is very different than housing in the states. A wide range of housing is available
throughout the area so you are encouraged to discuss housing with your sponsor, and your
spouse is highly encouraged to discuss housing with the unit Key Spouse. You’ll want to ask
questions about location, size, internet availability, commute cost, yards for kids/pets,
appliances, etc. as you do your house hunting after arrival.


At: www.housing.af.mil/aviano home page, there is an in-processing link which provides a lot
of information about community housing here at Aviano. You will receive Temporary Lodging
Allowances (TLA) to offset temporary accommodations, lodging after your arrival, but it is not
automatic. For more information on TLA, please visit the housing office’s referral and
relocation website at: http://www.housing.af.mil/aviano/referralandrelocation/index.asp. You
must check in with the Housing Office when you arrive. The Housing Office offers voluntary
Thursday afternoon briefing at Jump Start, which you are encouraged to attend. The Housing
Office also briefs at Right Start the following week.


Unaccompanied Housing: Regardless of branch of service, unaccompanied personnel from E1
to E3 and E4s with fewer than 3 years of service will be housed at our dormitories and will be
instructed to report to our dorm manager upon arrival. All other personnel assigned to Aviano
will live in economy housing. It is mandatory for personnel to attend the Right Start briefing.


If you are accompanied or Mil to Mil and wish to live in government housing, you may complete
an advance application for government housing, DD1746, at your current housing office in order
to place your name on the wait list. The Housing Office will send your application to Aviano
with a copy of your orders.


Note 8: If you have school-age children, you may review the DODDS websites to learn how to
register your children and other important information. For elementary children go to
www.avia-es.eu.dodea.edu/registration.htm and for high school children www.avia-

3.     Again, go to the Aviano Newcomer site
       (http://www.aviano.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-120316-003.pdf) for detailed
       instructions on shipping your pet to Italy.


Ensure your flight and all connecting flights accept pets & have pet slots space available. Pet
travel during summer months can be restrictive due to heat danger to pets – contact your air
carrier for details. Pets must be registered at the Aviano Vet Clinic upon arrival and will need
their health certificate and vaccination report. After arriving in Italy, pets should also get a “pet
passport” from the Aviano Vet Clinic to facilitate travel to other countries in Europe.
Government housing at Aviano permits two pets per residence although most people live on the
economy where pet limits/restrictions are based on the landlord/residence. If you have any
questions about shipping pets or living in Italy with pets, please contact the Aviano Vet Clinic at
DSN 314-632-8485 or email them at aviano.vetclinic@us.af.mil.


Note 10: Please be advised that your cell phones may not work here in Italy upon arrival. Some
US mobile phone service providers allow military members to put their US accounts in an
inactive status for the duration of their overseas assignment. Some US phones will function with
an Italian SIM chip. Recommend that you contact your mobile provider in the US prior to
departure to discuss options. Your sponsor may be able to help with mobile phone options and
recommendations also. There are multiple options for mobile phones and mobile internet (pay as
you go, contracts, etc.) and there are several phone stores, both on- and off-base, that can answer
questions regarding connections and purchase options. They can also provide information on
home carriers for cable/SKY television options and provide a few referrals depending on the
areas you may find housing. The Furniture Management Office (FMO) will provide you with
one free AFN decoder box for regular AFN satellite channels and additional decoders can be
purchased at the Base Exchange.


Note 11: Due to high cost of lodging and travel costs for PCS to an overseas assignment, it is
imperative you have a Government Travel Card (GTC) current through arrival plus 60 days. If
you don’t, please contact your unit Agency Program Coordinator (APC) to troubleshoot the
closed card or to start the new card application process. Use of GTC is mandatory for costs
associated with official government travel (including PCS).

                 SAMPLE UNIT COMMANDER’S WELCOME LETTER

Congratulations on your upcoming assignment at Aviano AB and welcome to the [XYZ unit]!


We look forward to including you on our team of professionals who are responsible for
___________________. In [name of squadron], we want to make sure you get all the
information and assistance you (and your family) need to make this the best move you've ever
had and to help you feel at home as soon as possible. Your sponsor, (name of sponsor), is a part
of a team, and (his/her) job is to find information for you, help solve your problems, meet you
when you arrive, and make it easier for you to inprocess and get settled. (He/She can be reached
at (sponsor e-mail address) so please keep (him/her) advised of your plans and relocation needs.


If this is your first trip to the Aviano area, you'll find it [make some mention about the weather,
environment, community activities, etc.].


Aviano has no on-base family housing, so the majority of the Aviano AB population lives in
privately leased housing in the communities around the base. Only single Airmen live on the
base (in dormitories). It takes time to find and move into a privately leased house, have the
utilities turned on, and have furniture delivered. You will be given approximately 14 days to
begin in-processing and begin house hunting. These 14 days begin on the Monday of Right
Start. You will need to work closely with the Housing Office -- they are here to help you.
Remember, your sponsor is here to assist you through the first few weeks, and (he/she) has my
support in doing that. In fact, I’m giving (him/her) time away from the duty section for the first
two weeks after you arrive specifically to help you -- be sure to use (him/her).


Aviano’ s INTRO Program is called “Right Start” and is designed to help you and your spouse
become familiar and comfortable with our military community around Aviano and our host
nation. Right Start begins the Monday after you arrive and the uniform is blues for that Monday
IAW USAF policy. In Right Start, you will receive information about financial choices while
stationed in Italy, gas coupons, and cultural orientation. The Airman & Family Readiness Center
will help you and your spouse navigate the military and local support system by providing
information about employment, child care, medical services, and area activities. Your first week
will include two days of Right Start (Mon/Tue), two days of house hunting and/or in-processing,
and on Fri the week concludes with a cultural orientation called “Benvenuti” – you don’t want to
miss this fun event! The second week after you arrive is dedicated to house hunting for those
living off-base. My goal is for you to begin reporting to your duty section regularly no sooner
than 14 days after you began Right Start, but your supervisor should allow adjustments to your
schedule to accommodate the many in-processing requirements at Aviano during your first two
months here.
AVIANOABI36-2101 8 JULY 2013                                                                   23


(Include any special requirements or emphasis areas here.. PRP, security req’ts, etc…anything
you want to add to get them to focus on before arrival.)


As an incoming Airman, you are responsible for helping us ensure you have a smooth transition
to your new duty station. You are responsible for keeping your sponsor informed about your
exact itinerary and relocation needs. Please provide your sponsor any information that is
requested and take time to do research and ask necessary questions. If you have delays or
problems en route, contact your sponsor and/or the first sergeant immediately.


Finally, there’s a wealth of information on the internet to assist you in your PCS to Aviano. The
best place to start is at our official Aviano AB website (link below) which is the authoritative
source for information about PCSing to Aviano. Check out the Newcomers link. Additionally,
there are many other sources of information about Aviano. Links to them are below:

(list your Facebook page here, spouses’ group website/Facebook page, militaryonesource, or any
other sites you want to link them to)


Again, let me welcome you to Aviano AB (or [XYZ] squadron). Please send me an e-mail at
(sq/cc e-mail address) to let me know that you’ve received this letter. In your reply, please send
me your contact info (work e-mail, personal e-mail, work phone, mobile phone) as well as e-
mail/phone info for your spouse so I can ensure your sponsor and my staff have this important
information. Do not hesitate to contact me directly if there is anything I can do to make your
move better. DSN __________, Commercial ( ) __________, Fax __________, E-Mail

forward to having you on our team!

Note for commanders: This letter should be personalized to each and every inbound – “Dear
Newcomer” won’t cut it…you need to use their name. You might want to have two versions –
one for married/with dependents and one for single Airmen (or have sections that you modify
based on marital status) to make it easier to personalize each. Additionally, you need to include
their sponsor’s name and contact information to ensure it gets through (redundancy is OK
here…I know the sponsor should have already contacted the newcomer, but more contact is
better than less). Feel free to add your own personal touch to this letter, but please include the
essential elements above (i.e. don’t cut out any of the parts about housing, direction for them to
contact you in reply, info about 14 days after Right Start begins to in-process/househunt, etc.).
Specifically, don’t make this a “passive” letter – be aggressive about soliciting information from

the newcomer and put the onus on the inbound Airmen. If you say, “Let me know if you need
anything…” you know he/she will never ask for your assistance. If, however, you specifically
ask for the newcomer to write you back with contact info for him/her and his/her spouse (if
applicable), you’ll know that your message got through AND you’ll get critical info for the
newcomer and his/her spouse that will make it easier to welcome well in advance of their arrival
and get them on the team as quickly as possible. It’s better to include more info in this letter
than less so it’s OK to have a two-page letter from the SQ/CC. Bottom line – use this letter as a
way to communicate directly to your inbound Airmen and family, and use that communication to
prepare them for the transition.

                          SAMPLE SPOUSE WELCOME LETTER

Dear (name of spouse),


Welcome to Aviano Air Base, Italy! I hope you are excited about your upcoming move to Italy
and Aviano Air Base. I know your stay here will be one of the best of your military experiences.


As one of the [XYZ Unit] Key Spouses, I’m here to answer questions and assist you and your
family as you prepare to transition to your new home in Italy. Moving to Italy can be more
difficult than moving to most other bases, so please use me and the other Key Spouses. The Key
Spouse Program is a great way to stay in touch with unit, base, and community happenings.
There are Key Spouses spread throughout the squadron and they are available to assist you as
well, both before and after your arrival.


As a spouse, I know you are concerned about making sure your family transition is smooth. Let
me reassure you that there are resources here for you to utilize. Below you will find useful
websites that have information about Aviano AB, Italy. Start with the Newcomers link on the
Aviano AB Official Website (www.aviano.af.mil) which is the authoritative source of base and
PCS information. When you arrive, there will be a [XYZ Unit] Spouse Start which will
introduce you to your new unit and base from a spouse perspective. Your military sponsor will
receive more information regarding the [XYZ Unit] Spouse Start upon arriving here. This will
give you the opportunity to ask questions and meet with the [XYZ Unit] Spouses Group to learn
more about the community and living in Italy.


After you arrive, you’ll see that the first few days and weeks can be hectic, so feel free to call me
if you need anything, or would just like to visit with someone who’s been here a while. The
[XYZ Unit} Spouses Group email address is: [xyzspousesgroup@hotmail.com] and the [XYZ
Unit] office number is xxxx-xx-xxxx. Italy is an absolutely beautiful country! There are so
many great opportunities for traveling throughout the country and even other European
countries.


Please reply to my e-mail (Key Spouse e-mail) so I know you got this letter. I want to connect
you to our community and other spouses as soon as possible, so please reply with your contact
information (e-mail address, cell phone number, etc.) One of our other Key Spouses will stay in
touch with you prior to your arrival and we’ll be available to answer any questions you might
have. Don’t hesitate to ask! After you arrive, we’ll get in touch to welcome you to Aviano and
to help you transition to your new home.


I look forward to hearing from you that you received this letter, and I look forward to meeting
