This instruction extends the guidance of AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Materiel Command
Technical Order System Procedures, Chapter 5, establishing the OO-ALC standard procedure
for requesting and providing technical direction for procedures and repairs beyond published
authority using the AFMC Form 202, Non-Conforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply,
or AFMC approved system. This instruction covers the creation, evaluation, disposition, return,
implementation, and archival of technical assistance requests from depot maintenance
organizations. It applies to Ogden Air Logistics Center organizations and the Air Force Global
Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) tenant at Hill AFB. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at.
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to OO-ALC/EN using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. This publication may be supplemented at the wing level, but all direct
supplements must be routed to OO-ALC/EN for coordination prior to certification and approval.

1. Background.
   1.1. In accordance with AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force (AF) organic depot maintenance
   activities shall use AFMC Form 202, or an HQ AFMC/A4 approved equivalent, to request
   and receive technical direction for procedures and repairs beyond existing technical order
   (TO) authority. The use of any informal method (e.g., telephone, email, or other similar
   unofficial correspondence) to request or provide technical assistance for AF organic depot
   maintenance is prohibited. Often situations arise in which approved documentation does not
   adequately address the needs of depot maintenance personnel. For example, a TO may
 2                                                      HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012


     inadequately explain the process to fix a part or a drawing may cite a part that is no longer
     available. When such a situation arises a request for technical assistance will be submitted
     via an AFMC Form 202 or through an AFMC approved system.
     1.2. The process for requesting and providing technical assistance shall (a) meet the intent of
     both AFMCMAN 21-1 and this instruction and (b) be required in the contract, or other
     similar performance requirement document, for depot maintenance activities other than AF
     organic (e.g., industry or other DoD branches of service).
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Maintenance Squadron, Group and Wing Management shall:
        2.1.1. Ensure personnel understand the policy and required process to generate an AFMC
        Form 202 when published authority is not adequate to complete the task at hand.
        2.1.2. Ensure a maintenance Quality Assurance (QA) representative and process
        engineering representative are present at any organically caused or suspected organically
        caused problem review meetings between maintenance personnel and the engineer with
        Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E) authority.
        2.1.3. Ensure that all requests for deviation or waiver from AFMCMAN 21-1 are
        distributed to OO-ALC/EN for review and approval.
        2.1.4. In accordance with AFMCMAN 21-1 paragraph 5.5.3.7., report AFMC Form 202
        metrics to OO-ALC/EN quarterly. Metrics shall include the total number of AFMC Form
        202s pending, overdue, associated with work stoppage, maintenance-induced, repeated,
        rejected and reissued more than four times without a TO update. These metrics will be
        for all AFMC Form 202s including those routed to Engineering Approval Authority
        (EAA) located external to Hill AFB.
     2.2. The First/Second Line Supervisor in the maintenance organization shall:
        2.2.1. Ensure that an AFMC Form 202 is generated when published authority is not
        adequate to complete the task at hand.
        2.2.2. Notify maintenance QA and group process engineering when a nonstandard
        deficient condition is organically caused by maintenance procedures/processes, tooling or
        fixtures.
        2.2.3. Notify maintenance group process engineering and workload planner when an
        AFMC Form 202 disposition conflicts with instructions provided in the Process Order
        (PO.)
        2.2.4. Report any problems encountered during the accomplishment of the AFMC Form
        202 instructions to the responsible planner, to the group process engineering
        representative, and to the engineer that signed block 26a.

     notification from planning that an AFMC Form 202 and PO reference the same repair
     operation(s). Note: The process engineer may assist in preparation of the AFMC Form
     202 Part B instructions, but may not approve or sign the AFMC Form 202.
  2.5. The Planner shall:
     2.5.1. Notify group process engineering of AFMC Form 202s that may affect POs.
         2.5.1.1. Notify process engineering when an AFMC Form 202 disposition may
         require development of a new PO. The planner may identify and note related AFMC
         Form 202 control numbers for reissues and repeats. Note: A control number log may
         be kept manually or in a computer database.
     2.5.2. Review the AFMC Form 202 package returned by the EAA for completeness (all
     required part B blocks are filled and cited attachments are available with AFMC Form
     202 control number annotated on all attachments). Return incomplete forms to the
     responsible engineer for correction as required.
     2.5.3. Coordinate with the maintenance function, the responsible engineer, the QA
     representative, and the group process engineering representative to resolve any problems
     with implementation of AFMC Form 202 or Special Handling AFTO Form 252,
     Technical Order Publication Change Request, instructions.
     2.5.4. Ensure that when a new AFMC Form 202 is related to a previous AFMC Form
     202, that all previous AFMC Form 202 control numbers are referenced in block 14.
     2.5.5. Request escalation support by notifying EAA leadership chain when EAA support
     (Hill AFB and external) is non-responsive in meeting work stoppage requirements. If this
     does not resolve non-response, notify OO-ALC/EN AFMC Form 202 point of contact.
  2.6. The Program Manager (PM), Systems Support Manager (SSM), or Supply Chain
  Manager (SCM) Designated Contact Point shall:
     2.6.1. Unless an automatic system is used which has inherent record keeping and
     archiving functions, maintain an AFMC Form 202 control log and maintain a file copy of
     AFMC Form 202s and attachments. Whether kept in an automatic system or by the
     SPM/SCM point of contact, maintain these records for the life of the system or end item.
     2.6.2. Ensure that all requests for deviation or waiver from AFMCMAN 21-1 are
     distributed to OO-ALC/EN for review and approval.

    2.7. The Directors of Engineering for all organizations that answer AFMC Form 202
    requests shall: Conduct quarterly AFMC Form 202 reviews to identify systemic issues or
    adverse trends.
    2.8. The Chief Engineer/EAA shall:
       2.8.1. Delegate engineering approval authority for specific areas of responsibility (in
       writing) to one or more individuals, (except when elevation of approval authority is
       required due to the level of safety risk, (see paragraph 2.8.2.)). Ensure the delegated
       EAA signing an AFMC Form 202 is not the same engineer who developed the
       procedures on that form.
       2.8.2. Review and elevate for approval all AFMC Form 202s classified as major or
       critical deviations or determined to increase the current safety risk associated with non-
       conformance of the item under repair to medium level or higher, per paragraph 4.2.5.1.
       2.8.3. Verify and approve instructions in AFMC Form 202 Part B, verify special
       classifications were considered and identified, verify that required coordination (e.g.,
       Safety, Bio-Environmental, and TO Manager) has been obtained, enter an expiration date
       in block 23A for an extended use AFMC Form 202, and sign block 26E. Invoke
       additional reviews of an AFMC Form 202 for Critical Safety Items (CSIs), Hardness
       Critical Items (HCIs), Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE), etc., if deemed necessary.
       2.8.4. Review AFMC Form 202s for trends, repeats and correlation to DRs, field
       requests for technical assistance, Materiel Safety Task Group (MSTG), and integrity
       programs. Develop corrective action plans when negative trends found.
    2.9. The Responsible Engineer shall:
       2.9.1. Complete AFMC Form 202 instructions with any necessary supporting analysis
       documentation. Supporting documentation includes Mishap Risk Assessment with
       annotations for CSIs, HCIs, NCE, or other categories requiring special attention and
       handling.
       2.9.2. Review the problem with maintenance (and if needed, QA and group process
       engineering) within 2 hours of receipt for work stoppage or within 5 workdays for
       anticipated work stoppage, if more clarification is needed.
       2.9.3. Review AFMC Form 202 classifications (organically caused, repeat, reissue) for
       accuracy, and submit for correction if necessary.
       2.9.4. Coordinate required TO changes with the Equipment Specialist.
       2.9.5. Coordinate Engineering Orders (EOs) through established processes IAW AFI 21-
       402 Engineering Drawing Systems. If the AFMC Form 202 disposition is such that both
       a TO change and an EO are warranted, ensure the TO change and EO agree.
       2.9.6. Coordinate with the EAA for approval signature by providing a copy of the AFMC
       Form 202 with all attachments. Ensure the AFMC Form 202 control number is annotated
       on all physical attachments.
    2.10. The Equipment Specialist (ES) shall:
HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              5


       2.10.1. As necessary, prepare and process a Special Handling AFTO Form 252 or
       Interim Operational Supplement (IOS). The ES may assist in preparation of the AFMC
       Form 202 Part B instructions, but may not approve or sign the AFMC Form 202.
       2.10.2. Ensure the SH252 is routed to the applicable TO Manager for processing, the
       SH252 is stamped and/or typed “Special Handling” on the top of the 252 or in block
       17/18 and if applicable all attachments, block 5 has a project number assigned (if
       applicable, project number shall be annotated on all physical attachments), all required
       signatures are on the SH252, and if applicable, an approved and completed AFMC Form
       202 is attached to the SH252.

       2.12.7. Mediate elevated disagreements that exist between the program office and
       maintenance wing regarding AFMC Form 202s.
3. Policies.
   3.1. Engineering Approval Authority.
       3.1.1. The system Chief Engineer (CE) is the EAA responsible for approving all AFMC
       Form 202 responses, except when elevation of approval authority is required due to the
       level of safety risk (per paragraph 4.2.5.1.).
       3.1.2. Delegation of EAA for specific areas of technical authority may be granted by the
       CE, in writing, to one or more individuals.
6                                                      HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012


           3.1.2.1. Equipment specialists and depot maintenance personnel (such as 309th
           maintenance personnel) shall not be designated or delegated designation of any level
           of engineering approval authority, and may not accept such.
           3.1.2.2. Delegation selection shall be based on the CE’s determination that the
           designee has the requisite knowledge, skill, and ability to autonomously perform the
           delegated activity in an acceptable manner. Delegation of engineering approval
           authority shall be in memorandum form, indicating the name, function, and
           organization of the individual, as well as a description of the specific area of authority
           that is being delegated. The CE shall maintain copies of the current delegation letters
           for auditing purposes.
           3.1.2.3. The CE may modify, rescind, or replace an existing delegation letter with a
           new delegation letter as the CE determines is necessary.
           3.1.2.4. The delegation of authority goes into effect when the individual receiving
           delegation acknowledges and accepts the delegation in writing.
       3.1.3. The approval authority who signs an AFMC Form 202 (in block 26 E) must not be
       the same engineer who developed the response or the procedures for that specific AFMC
       Form 202 (in block 26 A).
    3.2. Implementing Repair Dispositions.
       3.2.1. Depot personnel shall not implement repair disposition actions until the AFMC
       Form 202 is approved by the EAA in writing; including reviewed, signed, and dated by
       the IET/planner and production supervisor.
    3.3. Work Stoppages and Anticipated Work Stoppages.
       3.3.1. Work stoppages are to be viewed as urgent, extraordinary conditions which
       prevent the flow of needed components to the war fighter. The routine, common use of
       the work stoppage designation is to be avoided in order to preserve the importance and
       urgency of the designation.
       3.3.2. A work stoppage is the inability to proceed with production on a repair or
       modification of an end item or commodity, or where a given process stops due to
       nonconforming material, inadequate technical data, or lack of proper parts, materials
       components, tooling, or facilities. A work stoppage condition exists when the AFMC
       Form 202 resolution is impeding the progress of the end item and scheduled completion
       dates are jeopardized. Inadequate technical data and lack of proper parts, materials,
       components, tooling, or facilities are considered process issues and work stoppage
       generally apply unless other work can be accomplished on the asset while awaiting
       disposition without impact to production.
       3.3.3. All work stoppage AFMC Form 202s shall include supporting text that justifies
       the work stoppage claim.
       3.3.4. An anticipated work stoppage exists when spare assets are available and the
       discrepancy or deficiency will not halt production or delay the schedule or delivery of the
       end item (other work can be accomplished on the asset while awaiting disposition
       without impact to production). An “end item” is the part associated to the Job Order
HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              7


     Number (JON) currently in production. Anticipated work stoppage situations will
     become work stoppage when not resolved in time to prevent schedule delays.
  3.4. Reissue and Repeat AFMC Form 202s.
     3.4.1. Reissue: If the instructions on an AFMC Form 202 are still required after the
     form’s rescission date, then a new AFMC Form 202 may be issued to replace the expired
     one. It shall reference the previous AFMC Form 202 by its control number.
     3.4.2. Repeat: Repeat AFMC Form 202s require permanent updates to technical data.
     EAA determines if a 202 is a repeat 202 and whether a TO change is necessary. The
     initiating activity and the responsible engineer must use good judgment in identifying
     repeat AFMC Form 202s.
     3.4.3. Every reissued or repeat AFMC Form 202 shall be annotated as such on the
     AFMC Form 202 in block 14 or in the notes section. The EAA may challenge the repeat
     annotation by providing an explanation in the disposition, block 22. Prior to a reissue,
     the responsible engineer shall first consider updating the pertinent technical data.
  3.5. Modification/Configuration Change.
     3.5.1. An AFMC Form 202 shall not be used in lieu of a Time Compliance Technical
     Order (TCTO) to implement a modification (i.e., change the item’s configuration
     baseline). Note that the type of funding to be used is not a factor in the definition of a
     modification. Refer to MIL-HDBK-61A and AFI 63-131, Modification Program
     Management, for guidance on accomplishing configuration changes.
  3.6. Process Orders.
     3.6.1. Disposition of an AFMC Form 202 and any subsequent Special Handling AFTO
     Form 252 or EO may drive a change to AFMC Form 561s, Process Order.
     3.6.2. Process Orders facilitate the execution of TO and drawing requirements.
     Appropriate use of a PO constitutes where there is a unique requirement to describe
     specific applications, procedures, techniques, shop practices, and methods to complement
     approved technical data.
     3.6.3. Process Orders are created in accordance with AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP_1, Chapter
     19. The “responsible” or “cognizant” engineer for PO approval is the maintenance wing
     group-level engineer.
     3.6.4. The CE may review or baseline POs on CSIs and special interest items, as part of
     their qualification and sustainment of that item. The maintenance activity shall ensure
     the most current version of the applicable CSI list is used for reference. If a PO is
     developed for a CSI or other special interest category (NCE, HCI, etc), maintenance
     process engineering will route the PO to the Weapon System EAA for review and
     approval.
     3.6.5. The intent of a PO must not be its use in lieu of official technical data that is
     available and can be used. Refer to AFI 21-101 AFMC Sup 1, Chapter 19, on conditions
     that allow a PO to be developed.
     3.6.6. Process Orders shall not be used in place of non-existent or incomplete technical
     data.

     3.7. AFMC Form 202 Process Reviews.
        3.7.1. The OO-ALC/GH Director of Engineering (DoE) or a similar level designee shall
        conduct quarterly reviews of the AFMC Form 202 (or similar depot assistance request)
        engineering instructions, and provide documentation to OO-ALC/EN. OO-ALC/EN
        shall conduct independent annual reviews of the results of the DoE’s quarterly reviews.
        Note: AFGLSC at Hill AFB is subject to the GH DoE’s and OO-ALC/EN’s reviews, in
        accordance with AFMCI 63-1202, Air Force Materiel Command Center Engineering
        Support for Air Force Global Logistics Support Center Operations. AFGLSC shall
        conduct quarterly reviews of AFMC Form 202s and furnish the results to OO-ALC/EN
        and to the CE who delegated technical authority.
        3.7.2. The reviews shall use the latest version of the HQ AFMC/IG UCI 202 Process
        Checklist and be performed in accordance with AFMCI 90-202, Command Level
        Inspector General Activities.
        3.7.3. Reviews shall evaluate a statistically relevant sample size of the AFMC Form 202s
        or similar depot assistance requests executed over the review period (usually 1%).
        3.7.4. The reviews shall also assess the adequacy of supporting documents, such as
        engineering analyses, AFTO Form 252s, and EOs.
        3.7.5. OO-ALC/EN shall document its annual reviews and provide them to the pertinent
        management activities (i.e., SPM, SSM, and SCM). Its reviews and associated reports
        shall include: AFMC Form 202 process and use trends, best practices, areas of
        discrepancy or concern, and recommended corrective actions.
     3.8. Education.
        3.8.1. The course “Our Technical Data, Our Business,” Course #2997, is mandatory for
        all engineers, planners, and equipment specialists. Other employees that deal with non-
        conforming technical assistance requests would also benefit from the training.
     3.9. Plans/Agreements/Contracts.
        3.9.1. Depot repair technical assistance processes shall be addressed in Systems
        Engineering Plans, Service Level Agreements, and repair contracts. This shall
        encompass organic, nonorganic, and contractor depot assistance, including EAA-specific
        processes, practices, and systems.
4. Procedures.
     4.1. Maintenance Activities.
        4.1.1. When submitting an AFMC Form 202, the initiating activity shall appropriately
        mark all organically caused non-conforming issues, reissues, and repeats, and notify
        maintenance QA, group process engineering, and planning. Note: The EAA may
        challenge a repeat or cause annotation by providing an explanation in the disposition. QA
        will resolve any disputes between engineering and maintenance regarding cause.
        4.1.2. When submitting an AFMC Form 202, the initiating activity is encouraged to
        attach or provide photographs when they will aid understanding of the deficiency. The
        initiating activity shall ensure the 202 control number is referenced on all physical
        attachments.
HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                9


     4.1.3. The maintenance activity shall accomplish any EAA approved interim instructions
     required by engineering on an AFMC Form 202 and respond in a new AFMC Form 202
     with the results of the interim instructions, referencing the original AFMC Form 202
     control number in block 14.
     4.1.4. The maintenance activity shall not accept the AFMC Form 202 unless the
     appropriate TO and drawing changes are attached, and the AFMC Form 202 control
     number is properly annotated on all physical attachments.
     4.1.5. Any approved “rescind on date” (i.e., blanket AFMC Form 202) repair instructions
     shall be authorized for use only until the reported deficiency is corrected, not to exceed
     120 days. “Rescind on completion of event” (i.e., one-time AFMC Form 202) repair
     instructions may exceed 120 days.
  4.2. Engineering Approval Authority Process.
     4.2.1. If more information is needed, the responsible engineer shall make arrangements
     to contact the maintenance activity and review the problem within 2 hours of receiving a
     work stoppage AFMC Form 202, and within 5 workdays of receiving an anticipated work
     stoppage AFMC Form 202.
     4.2.2. After planner approval in block 3, engineering shall complete AFMC Form 202
     request and return it to the initiating organization within 5 workdays for work stoppages
     and within 15 workdays for anticipated work stoppages.
         4.2.2.1. If the responsible engineer cannot complete the request within the designated
         time, then he or she shall contact the originator within the designated time and
         provide the intended course of action to solve the discrepancy and the expected
         resolution date. Engineering shall document the content of the contact in the notes of
         the AFMC Form 202.
         4.2.2.2. If interim actions are required to resolve the discrepancy, engineering shall
         provide interim directions in block 22 on the AFMC Form 202.
     4.2.3. Upon engineering assessment, if engineering has reason to believe the non-
     conforming issue was organically caused, but not appropriately marked in block 12 of the
     form, then the classification may be challenged. To challenge the cause, engineering may
     annotate the AFMC Form 202 with supporting justification and route it back to the
     initiating organization for correction, or in the case of a dispute, determination by
     maintenance QA.
     4.2.4. The responsible engineer shall first consider updating the pertinent technical data
     before reissuing an AFMC Form 202 on a new AFMC Form 202.
     4.2.5. Special Classifications.
         4.2.5.1. Engineering shall assess if the AFMC Form 202-directed maintenance action
         increases the safety risk associated with the item. If the risk associated with failure
         for the item or weapon system under repair increases to medium level or higher, then
         a risk analysis, along with the technical assistance developed, shall be provided to the
         CE for review and potential elevation for approval in accordance with AFI 91-202,
         The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, section 9.2.4., MIL-STD-882,
         Standard Practice for System Safety, and AFI 91-202_AFMCSUP_1. Note: An
10                                                  HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012


         example of a Risk Assessment Matrix that defines “medium” risk is contained in
         MIL-STD-882.
         4.2.5.2. Engineering will review all AFMC Form 202s for possible classification as
         minor or major/critical deviations of MIL-HDBK-61A, Configuration Management
         Guidance, and follow appropriate configuration management procedures.
         4.2.5.3. Engineering shall ensure AFMC Form 202 dispositions clearly identify items
         that are CSI, HCI, NCE, or other special interest category and any associated changes
         to features or processes.
     4.2.6. Engineering shall coordinate any new or revised procedures that might affect the
     environment or safety and health of personnel, cause damage or destruction of
     equipment, or affect TO warnings or cautions, with the appropriate Environment, Safety
     and Occupational Health (ESOH) offices (e.g., Center Safety, Bio-environmental
     Engineering, Environmental Management) and the Technical Content Manager (TCM)
     for the affected TO.
     4.2.7. When AFMC Form 202s become repeat AFMC Form 202s per AFMCMAN 21-1,
     paragraph 5.6.5., the responsible engineer shall initiate a TO update, submit a drawing
     change on an EO, or submit other applicable documentation to permanently update other
     technical data.
     4.2.8. When a drawing change is required as part of the AFMC Form 202 response,
     engineering shall attach a copy of the EO, including any AF Form 3925, Engineering
     Order, or other AF EO form to the AFMC Form 202, noting all attachments with AFMC
     Form 202 control number in the upper right corner to maintain package integrity. If the
     drawing change results in the need for a TO change, then the responsible engineer shall
     implement the instructions in block 22. See AFI 21-402 Engineering Drawing Systems
     for engineering drawing change requirements.
     4.2.9. The responsible engineer shall attach a copy of the request for drafting services to
     the AFMC Form 202 when creating a drawing.
     4.2.10. When a change to a TO is required as part of the AFMC Form 202 response, the
     responsible engineer shall coordinate with the equipment specialist to forward a copy of
     the completed Special Handling AFTO Form 252 to the Technical Order Management
     Activity (TOMA) for a depot-only TO update, including the approved and completed
     AFMC Form 202, or to issue an IOS for a depot and field TO update.
     4.2.11. The responsible engineer shall not sign the AFMC Form 202 unless the
     associated TO and drawing changes are attached and the AFMC Form 202 control
     number is annotated on all physical attachments.
     4.2.12. The responsible engineer shall archive all written engineering analyses completed
     to support the technical assistance for each instance of assistance provided and clearly
     linked to the technical assistance in an easily retrievable fashion. This may be as simple
     as noting the AFMC Form 202 control number at the top of the analysis and archiving it
     in the item’s files managed by the responsible engineer.
  4.3. Equipment Specialists.
HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        11


     4.3.1. Investigate depot assistance requests and provide assistance in developing
     dispositions as needed or desired.
     4.3.2. When a work stoppage AFMC Form 202 response requires an associated change
     to a TO that is applicable to both depot and field maintenance units, an IOS shall be
     issued in accordance with T.O. 00-5-3, Air Force Technical Order Life Cycle
     Management. Note: On this point, TO 00-5-3, AFMCI 21-302, Processing Interim
     Technical Orders (ITO) and Rapid Action Changes (RAC), and AFMCMAN 21-1
     conflict, but TO 00-5-3 takes precedence by rule of document hierarchy.

Terms
Anticipated Work Stoppage— An anticipated work stoppage exists when spare assets are
available and the discrepancy or deficiency will not halt production or delay the schedule or
delivery of the end item. The “end item” is the part associated with the Job Order Number
(JON) currently in production. (Anticipated work stoppage situations will become work
stoppage when not resolved in time to prevent schedule delays.)
 14                                                    HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012


Chief Engineer (CE)— Refers to the senior Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness
advisor to the System Program Manager or System Support Manager; i.e., the responsible
engineer for operational weapon systems and end items. These positions are designated on the
Unit Manning Document (UMD) per AFMCI 62-202.
Cognizant Engineer— A term that must be taken in context. It should not be used generically
or interpreted as the Engineering Approval Authority. The cognizant engineer may also be
referred to as the responsible engineer. This term is not a position title, but a duty based on the
activity being executed. Typically, the cognizant engineer for an AFMC Form 202 is a program
office or a supply chain engineer.
Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS)— The Air Force system for
managing TO libraries, managing the distribution and printing of paper TOs, and managing,
storing and distributing electronic TOs (eTO). It is a near real-time, web-based, single point of
access to eTOs, with managed configuration and controlled access to authorized users only.
Process Engineer— The cognizant engineer of POs and the authority over MXW industrial
processes.
Reissue— If the instructions on an AFMC Form 202 are still required after the form’s rescission
date, then a new AFMC Form 202 may be issued to replace the expired one. It shall reference
the previous AFMC Form 202 by its control number.
Repeat— Repeat AFMC Form 202s require permanent updates to technical data. EAA
determines if a 202 is a repeat 202 and whether a TO change is necessary. The initiating activity
and the responsible engineer must use good judgment in identifying repeat AFMC Form 202s.
Responsible Engineer— A term that must be taken in context. It should not be used generically
or interpreted as the Engineering Approval Authority. The responsible engineer may also be
referred to as the cognizant engineer. This term is not a position title, but a duty based on the
activity being executed. Typically, the responsible engineer for an AFMC Form 202 is a
program office or a supply chain engineer.
Special Handling AFTO Form 252— A type of technical order change form used at depot
facilities that may be attached to the AFMC Form 202 when a change is required to the
Technical Order as the result of the analysis. A Special Handling AFTO Form 252 allows the
maintenance facility to perform maintenance in accordance with the AFTO Form 252 after the
AFMC Form 202 has expired. See AFMC Manual 21-1, Chapter 5.
System Program Manager (SPM)— Has ultimate OSS&E responsibility for the system, sub-
systems, or end item throughout all phases of the lifecycle and may delegate authority to the
Chief Engineer.
Technical Content Manager (TCM)— The individual, usually an Equipment Specialist or
Engineer, responsible for maintaining the accuracy, adequacy, modification, classification,
review and currency of the technical content of TOs and TCTOs supporting assigned systems,
commodities or processes. TCMs are not generally responsible for style and format or other non-
technical aspects of manuals.
TO Manager— The individual or organization responsible for managing TOs related to systems
and commodities assigned in the D086, Mission Workload Assignments System. TO
management encompasses all activities (except content management) from acquisition through
HILLAFBI21-303 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 15


disposal of TOs after the systems or commodities supported leave the Air Force inventory. TO
Managers are generally responsible for style, format and other non-technical aspects of manuals.
Work Stoppage— The inability to proceed with production on a repair or modification of an
end item or commodity; or where a given process stops due to nonconforming material;
inadequate technical data; or lack of proper parts, materials components, tooling, or facilities. A
work stoppage condition exists when the AFMC Form 202 resolution is impeding the progress of
the end item and scheduled completion dates are jeopardized. Inadequate technical data and lack
of proper parts, materials, components, tooling, or facilities are considered process issues and
work stoppage generally apply unless other work can be accomplished on the asset while
awaiting disposition without impact to production.
Workday— Normal day of work excluding weekends and holidays.
