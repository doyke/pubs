SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been completely revised to implement new AFI directives for AF drug
testing as well as explaining Osan AB specific procedures and responsibilities. Deleted;
paragraphs 2.2., 2.2.1., 3.3. thru 3.4.1.2. , 4.1.1., 4.1.3., 6.2.1. thru 6.2.10. , 6.4., and 6.5.
1. General Purposes:
     1.1. All military personnel assigned or attached to Osan AB, including geographically
     separated units and all civilians occupying a TDP are subject to random drug testing.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Installation Commander
        2.1.1. The 51st Fighter Wing (51 FW) Commander ensures the drug testing program is
        executed in a manner consistent with Air Force standards and directives. 51 FW/CC or
        51 FW/CV will chair the Cross Functional Oversight Committee (CFOC). The CFOC
        will convene no less than on a quarterly basis, more frequently if deemed appropriate, to
        assess status and effectiveness of drug testing program operations and to monitor the drug
        threat to Osan AB. The CFOC at Osan is subsumed under the Community Action
        Information Board (CAIB).
        2.1.2. All instances of failure to report for testing or refusal to provide a specimen will be

        2.2.2. Ensures all members are tested on day of selection unless member is in an

        return dates. Members are to be tested upon their return to duty.
        2.2.3. First Sergeants will bear the responsibility of escorting members who report
        without their military ID card and/or order letter to retrieve documents to complete
        testing. First Sergeants may, at their discretion, appoint someone to escort member to
        retrieve documents.

      personnel. In the DDRPM’s absence, the DTPAM will be responsible for making
      notifications as outlined.

      2.4.1. Strictly follows established local Operating Instructions (OI) and utilizes
      checklists to eliminate untestable specimens. Enforces all DoD, Air Force, and local

      3.1.1. Command-directed testing should be used as a last resort, and commanders should
      consult with 51 FW/JA prior to directing a member for urinalysis. Results obtained
      through commander-directed testing cannot be used to take action under the Uniform
      Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (e.g., court-martial or Article 15), nor can results
      obtained through commander-directed testing be used to adversely characterize
      administrative discharges (e.g., under honorable conditions, under other than honorable
      conditions). However, results from commander-directed testing may be used to support
      administrative actions (e.g., letter of reprimand) and promotion propriety actions.

      Separation of Airmen, and paragraph 5.54.
