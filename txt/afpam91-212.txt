                                    BASH REDUCTION PROGRAM

1.1. General Background:
    1.1.1. Aircraft collisions with birds and other wildlife annually cause millions of dollars in aircraft
    damage and may result in loss of aircraft and aircrews. However, procedures to reduce these losses are
    available. Reduction of strike hazards may be divided into four categories: Awareness, Control,
    Avoidance and Aircraft design. Wildlife strike hazards to aircrew and aircraft may be significantly
    reduced using a combination of the methods listed above. This may result in substantial savings of Air
    Force resources.
    1.1.2. The Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Team was formed to coordinate efforts in all
    areas. The BASH Team assists Air Force organizations worldwide to reduce the risk of bird strikes
    and collisions with other animals, such as deer. The BASH Team is located at Headquarters Air Force
    Safety Center (HQ AFSC/SEFW; 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 266; Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670).
    More information about the BASH Team and related topics can be found at the following website:
    http://safety.kirtland.af.mil/afsc/bash/home.html

1.2. Basics for a Program:
    1.2.1. Local conditions that enhance the potential for wildlife/aircraft strikes vary at each installation.
    Birds may flock to airfields or cause hazards en route; hazards may be seasonal or year round. Wild-
    life activity varies as local conditions change from crop selection, land use choices such as a landfill
    operation, or creation of a wildlife refuge. Base-level personnel must remain vigilant of such attracta-
    nts and be aware of proper wildlife control techniques. Installations experiencing these problems
    should first contact their respective MAJCOM for assistance. The base may also contact the jurisdic-
    tional agency for proper coordination to assure compliance with state or federal regulations. Where
    appropriate, AFSC/SEFW may provide additional assistance to resolve or reduce these potential haz-
    ards. The contacts mentioned above may suggest proven methods for wildlife dispersal, avoidance
    procedures, or recommend land management techniques that discourage wildlife activity from the air-
    field.
    1.2.2. Required time and effort necessary to maintain a safe airdrome will depend upon the severity
    of the wildlife strike hazard and how well base personnel are prepared to reduce these hazards. The
    key to a successful BASH reduction program is participation by well-trained individuals assigned spe-
    cific tasks. Wildlife strikes can never be eliminated; but, an aggressive, well-planned program devel-
    oped on the basis of wildlife habits, the environment, and the base mission may limit the potential for
    these strikes to occur. The following are guidelines for BASH reduction programs.

1.3. Developing a Program:
    1.3.1. Bird/Wildlife Hazard Reduction Plans. A well written, workable BASH plan is the key to
    reducing strike hazards and ensures continuity of knowledge with personnel turnover. If needed, a
    sample BASH plan may be obtained from MAJCOM Flight Safety offices. Plans should be tailored to
    meet the specific hazards encountered locally. Integrate all habitat modification procedures making
    sure natural resource plans are compatible with base BASH program plans. As a minimum this plan
    should: inform new personnel of local hazards; identify local conditions on the airfield attractive to
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                 5


   wildlife and cite measures to reduce these attractions (e.g., long grass, insect reduction, water drain-
   age); outline bird dispersal procedures and OPR; and specify base bird watch condition codes (see
   Attachment 1), location where daily code will be displayed, implementation procedures, authoriza-
   tion for declaring codes and flight operations under specified bird watch condition codes.
   1.3.2. Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG). The BHWG normally consists of representatives from
   flight safety, airfield management, base operations, air traffic control, civil engineering, aircraft main-
   tenance, public affairs, and base legal. The base Natural Resource Manager and base Wildlife Biolo-
   gist should also attend. Other representatives such as the golf course manager, munitions or civilian
   operations personnel may be included based on BHWG issues. The group's purpose is to assist the
   safety office in drafting and implementing the Bird/Wildlife Hazard Reduction Plan. Meetings are
   held IAW AFI 91-202, The Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, but may be called more frequently
   or as conditions dictate. BHWG meeting topics should include but are not limited to: USAF reported
   wildlife mishaps and incidents; USAF BASH Team information updates; locally observed/reported
   wildlife activity, to include LL ranges/routes, airfield inspections/surveys, recovered wildlife remains,
   wildlife strikes; local wildlife habitat management/modifications, to include dispersal/depredation
   activity, environmental/land management activity, land uses (landfills, agriculture crop seasons);
   BASH-related budgeting issues; annual bird migrations; local BASH plan procedures and responsibil-
   ities, to include observed effectiveness/deficiencies; BASH awareness training/education, to include
   BWC code definitions and communications; flying schedule and wildlife activity conflicts; BASH
   self-inspection checklist; status of bird dispersal supplies; and/or a review of FliP documents for wild-
   life advisories (Phase I / II designations).
   1.3.3. Base Self-Inspection Checklist. A BASH self-inspection checklist is a useful tool in identifying
   deficiencies in BASH reduction plans. A sample checklist is provided as Attachment 2.

1.4. Documenting Bird Hazards:
   1.4.1. Evaluating an airfield for wildlife hazards involves the identification of local wildlife activity
   periods, species causing hazards, locations of favorable habitat, and documenting this information
   into daily activity surveys. When information is compiled over several seasons or years, to include
   night and day surveys, development of a more effective wildlife hazard reduction program is possible.
   The wildlife surveys should include: date and time; weather conditions; wildlife species of concern;
   favorable habitat locations on the airfield; wildlife movement corridors (soaring to and from roosts,
   feeding, etc.); wildlife activities (loafing, feeding, drinking, etc.); potential attractions; wildlife
   responses to mowing; and/or land uses adjacent to base property (planting/plowing etc.).
   1.4.2. Documenting the local wildlife problem, technical assistance received, and the successes of
   solutions tried are essential parts of any wildlife hazard reduction program. Complete documentation
   is necessary to acquaint new personnel with the problem and may be required in any civil litigation
   regarding the resolution of a wildlife hazard. Documenting the use of non-lethal techniques may also
   be necessary to obtain permits to take lethal action, if needed, to resolve an extreme hazard.
   1.4.3. Photograph and summarize all hazardous situations wildlife create on base. For example, pic-
   tures of gulls loafing on the airfield accompanied by observations showing the birds using a nearby
   sanitary landfill can provide a strong case against future expansion of the landfill. Good documenta-
   tion gives credence to the problem and shows solutions are being considered.

    1.4.4. Report all wildlife strikes, both damaging and non-damaging, on the Air Force Safety Auto-
    mated System (AFSAS) IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The unit owning the
    mishap aircraft’s flying hours must file the report. Additionally, any wildlife remains found on the
    runway and believed to have been involved in a strike must be documented via AFSAS. AFSAS can
    be accessed online through the Air Force Safety Center’s homepage. This automated system will walk
    the reporting individual through the necessary steps to file a report.
    1.4.5. Proper species identification of wildlife is an integral part of a BASH program. Feather remains
    from every bird strike, if available, must be sent to the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of
    Natural History for identification IAW AFI 91-204.

                           AIRFIELD HAZARD CONTROL METHODS

2.1. Introduction to Airfield Wildlife Control. Active and passive techniques can successfully reduce
threats from hazardous wildlife populations. These techniques vary in cost and effectiveness depending
on the situation. Active control involves causing wildlife to disperse from an airfield to give short-term
relief from an immediate safety hazard. Passive techniques are more long-term in nature. They involve
managing the airdrome to eliminate or reduce those conditions birds and other wildlife find attractive.

2.2. Active Controls. Birds and other hazardous wildlife on runways, taxiways, or infields create a
potential safety hazard and should be dispersed before flying operations can safely continue. Birds move
quickly and unpredictably. Even when left in a "safe" portion of the airfield, they can move and create an
immediate hazard. They may also act as decoys attracting additional birds. No single method of dispersal
works for all problems. Using a combination of different dispersal tools, also known as integrated pest
management, provides the best line of defense for immediate hazards. Pyrotechnics, bioacoustics, depre-
dation, and other methods have been effective in dispersing wildlife from airfields. When used together,
or in an alternating manner, these techniques remain more effective over a longer period. A depredation
permit is not required for non-lethal harassment of migratory birds on the airfield IAW 50 CFR 21.41
Migratory Bird Depredation Permits. Authorized BASH equipment is listed in Attachment 5.
NOTE: The key to active wildlife dispersal is perseverance. When birds or other wildlife are strongly
attracted to an airfield, several teams may be required to provide continual harassment. Usually, a single
trip around the airfield will not remove all the birds.
   2.2.1. Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnics are noise-producing devices, which are effective in bird dispersal.
   Scare cartridges, a commercially available pyrotechnic, fired from a 12-gauge shotgun or an NJ-8
   Very Pistol [with a locally manufactured steel sleeve insert (technical order (TO) 11W2-9-2-31)], are
   authorized. The 12-ga scare cartridge is an explosive charge fired 50 to 100 meters. At this distance, it
   detonates producing a loud noise. Two types of 15mm scare cartridges are also authorized, bangers
   and screamers. The bangers do not have the range of the 12-ga cartridges but it and the screamer are
   fired from a 15mm launcher, which is not considered a weapon. The 15mm banger provides a loud
   report, whereas the screamer makes a shrill whistle. Both are effective and inexpensive bird dispersal
   tools at moderate distances. Pyrotechnics can be used to flush and direct flocks of birds in a desired
   direction. For example, if a flock of gulls is feeding near an active runway, a scare cartridge exploded
   between the birds and the runway will usually cause the birds to fly away from the source of the noise
   and not pass over the runway. Close coordination with the control tower is essential so birds are not
   directed into the path of arriving or departing aircraft. Always advise base security forces before pyro-
   technics are used. The base agency storing and using pyrotechnics must follow guidelines outlined in
   AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Munitions and AFMAN 91-201, Explo-
   sives Safety Standards. Since harassment constitutes a "taking" for purposes of the Endangered Spe-
   cies Act, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) must be consulted prior to the use of
   pyrotechnics if their use will affect any such Federal threatened/endangered species.
       2.2.1.1. Authorized BASH munitions fall into two categories, centrally managed and commer-
       cial-off-the- shelf (COTS). Centrally managed items are ordered through the base supply system.

    2.2.2. Bioacoustics. This dispersal technique uses broadcasts of recorded bird distress calls. Depend-
    ing on the species, the calls may create differing responses; some will come to the calls while others
    may depart the area. For this reason, the sound source must be properly placed so the birds fly away
    from the runway. As with pyrotechnics, if the use of bioacoustics will have an impact upon a federally
    listed threatened or endangered species, the USFWS must be consulted prior to use.
       2.2.2.1. Broadcast distress calls may be used with a vehicle equipped with a sound system produc-
       ing 30 to 50 watts of distortion-free sound in 90 to 100 decibel (db) with a frequency response
       between 12,000 and 14,000 Hertz (Hz). A speaker is mounted on the vehicle. The operator identi-
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                 9


       fies the birds to be dispersed and selects the appropriate distress call tape. The vehicle is driven as
       close as possible to the birds. Depending on physical factors such as terrain, trees, and structures
       on the airfield, the distance from the problem birds will vary. Employ bioacoustics 100 to 200
       meters as the maximum distance from birds to achieve the desired results. The distress call is then
       played for 15 to 20 seconds. If the birds have not moved within 20 seconds, play the call again. If
       they have not moved by the third attempt, other methods are required.
          2.2.2.1.1. There are four important points to remember when using bioacoustics. 1) Try to
          identify the bird species you wish to disperse and use that species’ distress call. However, a
          variety of calls may be tried to determine the most effective selection for a particular pest.
          Some bird species do not respond to distress calls. 2) Make sure the vehicle is stopped when
          the distress calls are played. Birds need to identify the source of the disturbance before they
          can react. 3) Do not allow the distress calls to play indefinitely because birds can become
          accustomed (habituate) to them. 4) The effectiveness of distress calls is dramatically increased
          when combined with other frightening techniques, especially pyrotechnics.
       2.2.2.2. Distress calls have limited use in many situations. Not all birds are affected by bioacous-
       tics. Birds often react to the calls by flying toward the source, circling it, and gradually moving
       away. This takes time and may create a momentary hazard. Combining bioacoustics with pyro-
       technics can best disperse these birds. The distress call is played to get the birds in the air, then,
       pyrotechnics are used to disperse them. Hazards to flying operations can be alleviated by using
       these techniques before flying begins or during breaks in flight activities.
       2.2.2.3. Gulls, starlings, blackbirds, and crows can be effectively dispersed with distress tapes.
       Occasionally, recorded distress calls of different bird species will frighten a variety of birds; how-
       ever, species-specific distress calls are the most effective.
       2.2.2.4. Tapes or digital recordings of distress calls are difficult to find and therefore bioacoustics
       may be of limited usefulness. Distress calls are now being incorporated into multi-functional bird
       scare systems
   2.2.3. Depredation. Bioacoustics and pyrotechnics provide good wildlife control in most situations.
   Yet, some species may grow accustomed to these techniques, and a few individuals may have to be
   taken via lethal means to reinforce the idea that a significant danger exists. A federal depredation per-
   mit, available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), is required before killing any pro-
   tected birds. The application for the depredation permit is a USFWS Form 3-200-13, Federal Fish and
   Wildlife License/Permit Application Form, and must be accompanied by the information requested by
   the USFWS information sheet 50 CFR 21.41. A copy of the permit must be carried whenever exercis-
   ing its authority. Birds may only be killed in conjunction with a continuing non-lethal control pro-
   gram. Unless otherwise directed, carcasses, nests, and eggs shall be completely destroyed or
   incinerated. No federally listed threatened or endangered species, Bald or Golden Eagles, or their
   nests and/or eggs are authorized. European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), House Sparrows (Passer
   domesticus), and Rock Doves/domestic pigeons (Columba livia) are not federally protected in the
   United States and require no federal depredation permit. When granted, the permit will specify the
   species, the numbers of birds that can be taken, and the technique to be used.
NOTE: Anyone participating in the base depredation program should attend and receive certification
through a hunter's safety or gun handling safety course. Contact the base rod and gun club or MWR for
10                                                                   AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


information on base organized hunter safety programs, or contact the local game agency and their admin-
istrator for hunter safety courses in the area.
        2.2.3.1. Airport Permits. The USFWS is adding an additional clause on depredation permits for
        airports in some regions. This clause would allow airports to kill, capture, or relocate up to ten
        (10) migratory bird species on an emergency basis. An emergency is defined as an immediate dan-
        ger to public safety and/or an immediate hazard to aircraft. Any emergency activity must be
        reported to the depredation permit issuing office within 24 hours. This emergency clause is only
        approved in certain regions, so contact the depredation permit issuing office before taking any
        actions.
NOTE: Some states may require additional permits for the take of State protected species. These may be
coordinated with the USFWS as well. Coordinate with the base environmental flight and legal offices
when obtaining permits.
     2.2.4. Other Wildlife Control Methods. Other active control methods listed on the next page may
     be effective.
        2.2.4.1. Propane Gas Cannons. These devices should be operated, especially at dawn and dusk,
        as birds come in to feed or roost. Cannons must be relocated frequently to avoid habituation prob-
        lems. Continuously operating cannons quickly leads to habituation, rendering the cannons ineffec-
        tive. These devices may be effective on gulls, blackbirds, waterfowl, pheasants, and other game
        birds when used in conjunction with other harassment techniques or depredation.
        2.2.4.2. Falconry. A falconry program is not limited to the use of falcons only but can incorpo-
        rate several species of birds of prey. Falcons trained for airfield bird dispersal may be effective
        when used in combination with other frightening techniques. Deploying birds of prey usually dis-
        perses birds immediately from the airfield and these birds are likely to remain away from the air-
        field for longer periods. Birds of prey inherently scare other birds so there is little habituation of
        the “prey” to the threat. In adding this tool to your harassment arsenal, you also get the benefit of
        the bird handlers’ knowledge of birds and their behavior. However, there are limitations to fal-
        conry. A falconry program can be very expensive, labor intensive, and there is some potential for
        bird strikes with the falconry birds. Falcons can be flown only during daylight hours in good
        weather, and they cannot be flown when molting or after feeding. In order to adequately cover all
        flying operations at an airfield, multiple handlers and birds will have to be employed, hence the
        high expense. Also, most birds of prey typically used in falconry programs are ineffective in dis-
        persing large waterfowl, particularly geese, and other birds of prey from an airfield.
        2.2.4.3. Dogs. The use of Border Collies or other breeds of dogs to disperse geese has been effec-
        tive under certain circumstances. A dog demands full-time attention, especially Border Collies,
        making it more advantageous to contract the services of a dog and its handler rather than purchas-
        ing a dog. While a dog may be very effective at dispersing geese from an airfield it may prove
        ineffective at removing geese from bodies of water or other species of birds from the airfield,
        especially gulls.
        2.2.4.4. Radio Controlled Crafts. Use of radio controlled aircraft, dune buggies, or boats to dis-
        perse birds have shown significant results. The airplane can guide the birds in a flight path away
        from the airfield and offers continued harassment while the birds are in flight. Radio controlled
        boats can harass birds on large ponds where pyrotechnics cannot reach out and touch the birds.
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                               11


       Cars can effectively disperse birds from grassy areas; particularly office buildings or housing
       where the use of pyrotechnics or gas cannons is not desirable.
       2.2.4.5. All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV). Use of all terrain vehicles in the airfield environment has
       proven useful in dispersing birds and other wildlife from the aircraft operating area. Many air-
       fields have areas, which are difficult to navigate, even with 4x4 vehicles. The ATV can operate in
       any area to get the birds in the air and supplementing with pyrotechnics once airborne can further
       disperse them. However, before operating an ATV, personnel must complete an ATV rider safety
       course IAW with AFI 91-207 which requires that ATV training will be acquired by a certified Spe-
       cialty Vehicle Institute of America (SVIA) before operating an ATV.
   2.2.5. Ineffective Methods of Control :
       2.2.5.1. Stuffed owls and rubber snakes have been advertised to rid hangars and buildings of
       birds. They are usually a waste of money and effort.
       2.2.5.2. Rotating lights have brought conflicting results; but are generally considered ineffective.
       Birds quickly habituate to these devices, and the problem remains unsolved.
       2.2.5.3. Eyespots on aircraft components are being studied in the United States and other coun-
       tries. Early results suggest the addition of eyespots does not significantly reduce the BASH poten-
       tial.
       2.2.5.4. Ultra-sonic devices have thus far proven unsuccessful in deterring wildlife from colliding
       with aircraft. Very few bird species can hear ultra-sonic sound. Of the bird species most often
       struck on airfields, most cannot detect the presence of ultra-sonic sound, therefore rendering these
       devices useless for dispersing birds on an airfield.
   2.2.6. Personnel and Equipment. Each installation with a BASH program should designate and
   train personnel in wildlife dispersal regardless of the severity of the hazard present on the airfield. In
   many instances, the presence of hazardous wildlife is a transient condition and may only require
   active dispersal for short periods throughout the year. Dispersal equipment should be located in the
   same area as the personnel tasked with wildlife control so it is readily available when hazards arise. If
   a 15 mm launcher is used, no storage problems should arise. If a Very Pistol with a 12 gauge sleeve is
   used, the pistol will most likely have to be stored in the armory or in a licensed storage area. AFI
   91-201 provides guidance on licensing requirements. Installations subject to deployment should
   include bird dispersal equipment for such contingencies (see Attachment 7). Each installation should
   designate individuals responsible for wildlife dispersal during deployments and properly train these
   personnel. Additionally, installations should document the training of the aforementioned personnel.

2.3. Passive Controls. The most permanent methods of discouraging birds from using airfields involve
removing attractive habitat features. Methods to reduce bird attractants include:
   2.3.1. Grass Management. As a minimum, address the following factors:
       2.3.1.1. Grass Height. Maintain airfield vegetation IAW AFI 91-202. Coordinate mowing with
       periods of low flight activity. While maintaining the grass height at 7-14 inches, make sure faster
       growing weeds are cut before they go to seed to discourage seed eating birds from using the air-
       field. Primary focus should be on the grass height and weed seed heads. Grass between 7-14
       inches discourages flocking species from foraging on the airfield because reduced visibility dis-
       rupts inter-flock communication and flock integrity by reducing the ability to detect predators.
12                                                                   AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


        Grass exceeding 14 inches (36 cm) will attract some bird species and rodents, which in turn attract
        raptors. Airfields with a variety of grass species should be mowed when the average grass height,
        not including seed heads, exceeds tolerances. Most grass seeds found on the airfield are less desir-
        able as food than available weed seeds. Although Bahiagrass and some other turf grasses produce
        prominent seed stalks, the height of these seed heads should not be the sole reason for mowing. As
        turf grass will eventually go to seed, mowing to eliminate seeding will increase mowing cycles.
        Eliminating weeds and cultivating a uniform monoculture of grasses can be more effective in dis-
        couraging seed-eating birds from feeding on the airfield than mowing grass seed stalks. Begin
        mowing adjacent to runways and finish in the infield or outer most grass areas. This causes insects
        and other animals to move away from aircraft takeoff and landing areas. Also, avoid mowing grass
        shorter next to the runway than in other areas, as much as possible.
        2.3.1.2. Herbicides and Growth Retardants. Keep broad-leafed weeds to a minimum on the
        airfield. Apply herbicides as practical to control weeds and comply with AFI 32-1053, Pest Man-
        agement Program. Broad-leafed weeds attract a variety of birds, may produce seeds or berries,
        and may limit grass growth. Growth retardants should be tested on small test plots before use on
        areas in general.
        2.3.1.3. Planting Bare Areas. Reduce bare areas as birds frequently use them to pick up grit and
        as resting sites on the airfield. Birds need grit, or very small rocks, to crush seeds, allowing diges-
        tion of the seeds. Eliminating bare areas on the airfield denies access to grit and forces birds seek
        sources elsewhere. Plant grass adapted to the area, add fertilizer and lime as necessary, and irrigate
        only until new grass is established.
        2.3.1.4. Fertilizing. Fertilize as needed to stimulate grasses and promote a uniform cover. Rate
        and frequency of application may vary from that of other semi-improved grass areas and should be
        based on soil test results.
        2.3.1.5. Native Vegetation. In geographic locations where conditions do not support turf growth,
        such as in desert environments, it may be advisable to allow native vegetation to remain in a natu-
        ral state (above or below the prescribed height of 7 – 14 inches) as disturbance may provide exotic
        conditions attractive to some forms of wildlife. The natural state must not supply attractive habitat
        for wildlife or obstruct views of the airfield from the tower. Another consideration for airfields in
        low-moisture environments is to consider de-vegetation as an option.
     2.3.2. Managing Reforested Areas : Site commercial forest areas so as not to contribute to the
     installation BASH problem. The types of trees planted for forest production are often different than
     those in the surrounding community and may serve as bird roosting sites. For example, the dense can-
     opy of a planted pine forest in a hardwood region may provide ideal roosting sites. Thinning the roost-
     ing area can usually discourage the roosting behavior (removing certain trees to produce an open stand
     canopy). If necessary, remove all trees from the site and grass and maintain the area with other airfield
     turf areas. Should a stand of trees contain birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald
     and Golden Eagle Protection Act or any other species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the
     USFWS should be contacted to determine whether an incidental-taking permit is required prior to any
     tree removal. Federal law clearly indicates that the destruction of wildlife habitat can be tantamount to
     a taking of protected species and, in some instances, may not be allowed.
     2.3.3. Landscaping. Shrubs, ornamental trees, shelterbelts, hedgerows, and noise suppression barri-
     ers are important plantings on a base. However, the airfield and clear zones are not proper places for
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                13


  landscape plantings. These types of vegetation can influence wildlife populations and their move-
  ments around the base. Trees often intermingle as they mature, forming a continuous canopy. This
  close, dense foliage attracts birds and is ideal for providing shelter, food, and nesting. Proper planning
  can reduce these potential attractants. When planting shrubs, select those species that do not produce
  fruit, especially during the winter. Ripe berries attract birds for short periods each year. Blackbird and
  starling roosts are particularly hazardous because of the large number of birds (often numbering in the
  millions) that may be present in a single roost. Birds can usually be stimulated to move by pruning and
  thinning trees and shrubs to open the canopy. In some situations, it may be necessary to remove all the
  plants. Trees and shrubs should not be allowed to grow in the infield areas.
  2.3.4. Removal of Edge Effects. The greatest numbers of species are found where vegetation types
  change from forests to brush, or brush to grass (edge effects). To reduce wildlife problems, keep edge
  effects to a minimum, or as far from the active runway as possible. If an airfield has clumps of brush
  and shrubs around the grass, more diverse habitat is available. Remove brush and weeds to maintain
  the airfield in the most uniform condition possible. This eliminates the cover many birds and rodents
  require. Single trees or snags on an airfield may provide perches for hawks, owls, or other bird spe-
  cies. Biodiversity practices should not be implemented on airfields.
  2.3.5. Controlling Drainage. Fresh water is one of the most important airfield wildlife attractants,
  especially in arid regions and near the seacoast. Standing water creates a source of drinking water and
  a breeding place for insects, amphibians and other food sources for birds. Mark areas of the airfield
  with chronic standing water after heavy rains. Coordinate with CE or EM to fill, level, and re-seed
  these areas with grass to match the rest of the airfield. Since federal and state laws strictly control wet-
  lands, coordination with CE or EM is a must before making any modifications to airfield drainage.
  However, non-tidal drainage and irrigation ditches excavated on dry land are not generally considered
  to be “waters of the United States” (51 FR 41206, Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps of
  Engineers) and therefore are not considered wetlands. Make airfield drainage ditches as deep as pos-
  sible to limit the surface area of the water and still allow proper drainage according to civil engineer-
  ing requirements. Wading birds, such as herons, egrets, and shorebirds, are less likely to use deep
  drainage ditches. Grade the banks of the drainage ditches to allow mowing up to the edge of the ditch.
  Keep drainpipes, culverts, and screens clear of debris so drainage is not impeded.
  2.3.6. Locating Wastewater Treatment Facilities. Waterfowl and shorebirds are often attracted to
  wastewater holding ponds. Birds use the water for resting and sometimes as a food source. Wastewa-
  ter lagoons are most attractive in arid climates. Ponds designed with steep sides, little surface area,
  and no vegetation reduces the attraction to birds. Locate ponds as far from the runway and associated
  traffic patterns as possible and place them so birds moving from off-base areas to the ponds do not
  cross the runways.
  2.3.7. Managing Sanitary Landfills :
     2.3.7.1. On-Base Landfills. Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are the most significant
     attractant to hazardous bird species. Operate disposal sites according to FAA guidelines and state
     and federal laws. Relocate landfills that do not meet FAA guidelines criteria. If landfill relocation
     is not feasible, make the site as unattractive to birds as possible. Consider the following methods:
     Maintain a small working face to minimize exposed wastes; incinerate waste; operate the landfill
     as a pit or trench to limit access to birds; dump waste at night or during non-flying periods; cover
     waste material immediately; discourage gulls and other birds with overhead wire barriers; relocate
14                                                                   AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


        putrescible wastes to a more remote landfill; and use bioacoustics and pyrotechnics to frighten
        birds away.
        2.3.7.2. Off-Base Landfills. The Air Force cannot control land use off-base; however, before
        landfills can be opened, the operator must obtain a state permit. A hearing is held about the poten-
        tial environmental impact. Air Force concerns about potential bird hazards should be expertly pre-
        sented at these hearings. Flight safety, environmental planning, public affairs, and the staff judge
        advocate should work jointly to present Air Force interests. HQ AFSC/SEFW will assist by pro-
        viding consultation and expert testimony as needed.
     2.3.8. Managing Agricultural Outleases. Many bases have agricultural programs on their airfields
     to reduce maintenance costs. These programs range from crop and hay outleases to grazing and refor-
     estation. The types of crops grown and the agricultural methods used have important effects on local
     bird populations.
        2.3.8.1. Grain crops within 1,000 feet of the runways are not recommended because harvest meth-
        ods expose a ready food supply. Hay, cotton, and flax are the least attractive crops. Airfield crops
        should not be radically different from crops found in the surrounding community. Anything that
        makes the airfield unique can attract birds and other wildlife. Cultivation may attract birds by
        exposing large numbers of insects and earthworms.
        2.3.8.2. Harvesting and planting schedules can also affect the numbers of birds the airfield
        attracts. For example, if an airfield hay crop is harvested before or after other hay crops in the
        region, large numbers of invertebrates may be exposed on the airfield that are not exposed in other
        fields. This might provide a more intense bird attractant than would usually exist.
        2.3.8.3. Agricultural activities should also consider the local flying schedule. Planting, cultivat-
        ing, harvesting, or burning may temporarily increase airfield bird attractants, therefore should be
        done on weekends or other periods of reduced flying. Both airfield management and civil engi-
        neering personnel (AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management) should closely
        monitor agricultural practices used in base agricultural outleases.
        2.3.8.4. Grazing animals can be a serious hazard. Ensure the use of strict animal control and
        proper fencing.
     2.3.9. Fencing. Proper fencing can reduce airfield incursions by wildlife other than birds. An 8-foot
     chain-link fence topped with outward-facing outriggers and 3 strands of barbed wire will normally be
     enough to deter most encroachments by deer, coyotes, and other such large animals. The bottom of the
     fence must be properly secured at or underneath the ground to prevent animals from digging or push-
     ing under the fence. Another option is an electric fence. Though cheaper than a chain-link fence, an
     electric fence requires more maintenance and management over the long-term. Ensure that all fences
     are properly closed when not in use and they do not violate the airfield clear zones and frangibility
     rules.

2.4. Hangars. Hangars provide a good environment for birds to nest and roost. Without much threat from
predators and a relatively quiet habitat at night, certain species of birds will take up residency in hangars.
In addition to health risks resulting from bird scat and bird mites, the close proximity of hangars to the air-
field environment requires attention be given to any birds making a hangar their home. Hangars are easily
accessible to birds since the doors are usually left open for long periods, particularly in the evenings when
birds are roosting. Denying birds access to the hangar by keeping the doors closed is the best prevention
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                 15


method but is not practical so either exclusion devices or full-time bird control are necessary inside the
hangar.
   2.4.1. Netting. Though expensive, provides an excellent long-term defense against birds returning to
   hangars. Netting will prevent birds from roosting inside the hangar while allowing the doors to be
   open during hangar operations.
   2.4.2. Air Rifles. Use of air rifles to disperse birds in hangars has proven successful in removing
   birds. When dealing with a roosting flock of pigeons, starlings or House Sparrows, an air rifle is prob-
   ably the least expensive control technique. These species are common nuisances in hangars and are
   not afforded any Federal legal status because they are non-native or “introduced species.” But this
   does not mean there are no state or local restrictions. Before shooting any bird, it is wise to check for
   any applicable state or local laws that may prohibit shooting them. At all times, be certain of the target
   species.
   2.4.3. Brush Weatherseals. Using brush weatherseals on the edge of the doors or around windows
   will remove gaps and seal any open spaces, thereby restricting entry points to birds.
   2.4.4. Strip Curtains. Strip curtains, or vertical blinds, allows the hangar doors to remain open for
   ventilation while limiting access to birds.
   2.4.5. PVC Pipes. Lining the hangar rafters with PVC pipes have proven successful in keeping birds
   out of hangers. By reducing the amount of surface available for nesting or roosting, the birds are
   annoyed enough to look for other structures upon which they can build.
   2.4.6. Falconry. Some birds of prey, Harris Hawks for example, can be very effective at ridding han-
   gars of roosting birds. Consider the feasibility of including hangars in existing airfield bird control fal-
   conry contracts or establishing a falconry contract for hangars (reference Section 2.2.4.2.).

2.5. Flight Operation Considerations:
   2.5.1. When environmental modifications and active control measures do not satisfactorily reduce
   wildlife hazards on the airfield, flying operations may have to be altered to reduce the risk of bird
   strikes. As defined in AFI 91-202, Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Codes (see Attachment 1) may be a
   valuable tool for supervisors to make operational changes. These operational changes are dictated by
   the severity of the problem, the performance capability of the aircraft, and training or readiness
   requirements. Bird hazards, like any other safety hazards, must be assessed with respect to operational
   requirements. During contingency operations or advanced stages of readiness, bird hazards may have
   minimal safety priority. During training to maintain operational readiness; however, certain changes
   can be made to improve safety, reduce costly repairs, and protect aircrews.
   2.5.2. Flying one hour before and after dawn and dusk should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
   The highest levels of bird activity normally occur during these hours as birds leave and return to their
   roosts. Avoiding flight operations during these periods can significantly reduce the chance of a bird
   strike.
   2.5.3. Knowledge of unit operational and training requirements, combined with an understanding of
   local flying restrictions, is necessary to properly evaluate possible modifications to local procedures.
   2.5.4. The key to reducing bird strikes by changing flight operations is to avoid known locations, con-
   centrations or movements of birds. The following recommendations can help reduce bird hazards by
   modifying operational procedures.
16                                                                AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


     2.5.4.1. Takeoff and Departure. Aircraft making formation departures increase the risk of dam-
     aging bird strikes when birds are feeding or loafing on or near the runway. Formation and sin-
     gle-ship interval takeoffs often result in birds being scared up by the lead aircraft, causing the
     wingman to hit the birds.
        2.5.4.1.1. When the lead aircraft scares up large flocks of birds, the wingman should delay
        departure until the birds are clear of the runway. Pilots of lead aircraft must be alert to warn the
        wingman of bird hazards during takeoff. This is especially important as the wingman’s atten-
        tion is focused on the lead aircraft.
        2.5.4.1.2. When flocks of migratory birds are a problem, formation takeoffs and single-ship
        interval takeoffs with minimum spacing involving rejoins, increase the risk of serious bird
        strikes. All rejoins require greater attention by pilots to the lead aircraft’s position. The
        increased speed required catching the lead aircraft after takeoff increases the risk of damaging
        bird strikes. When birds are known to be flying in the area, departures under visual meteoro-
        logical conditions (VMC) may be modified to reduce the risks. Departures should be made in
        trail, with the rejoin beginning after the aircraft passes 2,000 to 3,000 feet above ground level
        (AGL). If aircraft are to enter a low-level route immediately or stay at an intermediate altitude
        for a prolonged period, tactical formation provides enough aircraft clearance to allow wing-
        men to stay clear of birds.
     2.5.4.2. Enroute Bird Strikes. Aircrews experiencing enroute bird strikes should abort the mis-
     sion when practicable. While some engine ingestions or a windscreen strike may be readily appar-
     ent from the flight deck, the damage from many engine, fuselage, wing, tail, or radome strikes
     cannot be adequately assessed. Continuing a mission may cause greater structural damage and
     lead to a serious in-flight emergency later.
     2.5.4.3. Low-Level Operations. When flying low-level routes or operating in special use air-
     space, higher aircraft speeds and greater exposure within bird flight environments lead to many
     damaging bird strikes. During these flights, aircrews are involved in cockpit duties, allowing little
     time to monitor bird activity. "Heads-up" flying should be stressed as much as possible during
     these critical operations. Attachment 3, "Low-Level Flight Considerations," provides general
     guidance for bird avoidance during low-level flight operations.
     2.5.4.4. Low-Level Bird Avoidance Model (BAM). The BAM is a predictive model using Geo-
     graphic Information System (GIS) technology as a key tool for analysis and correlation of bird
     habitat, migration, and breeding characteristics, combined with key environmental, and man-made
     geospatial data. The value for each cell (or pixel) of the model is equivalent to the sum of the mean
     bird mass (in ounces), for all bird species present during a particular daily time period, for one of
     26 two-week periods in a year. The bird species data set was derived from discrete geographic
     information for observations of 60 key BASH bird species, over a 30-year period. The species data
     was acquired from several key datasets, including the Audubon Societies' Christmas Bird Count
     (CBC), the US Biologic Survey's Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), bird refuge arrival and departure
     data for the conterminous US, and many additional data specific to a particular bird species.
        2.5.4.4.1. The risk levels describe three predicted risk classes - Low, Moderate, and Severe,
        which are based upon the bird mass in ounces per square kilometer. In other words, the risk
        levels represent the amount of birds (bird mass) in a kilometer squared spatial area. The "Mod-
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                            17


        erate Zone" indicates a risk ratio that is 57-708 times the risk of the "Low Zone", while the
        "Severe Zone" indicates a risk ratio that is 2,503-38,647 times the risk of the "Low Zone".
        2.5.4.4.2. The model uses the best available data for historical modeling of bird migratory pat-
        terns to provide the user with an effective decision making tool. Because birds are dynamic
        creatures whose migratory behavior is initiated by weather events in any given year, the model
        cannot be said to predict the exact movement of bird species through space and time beyond
        the biweekly timeframe. Spatial zones indicating a severe risk according to the model should
        not be ignored and should be avoided. It is not suggested that pilots fly within the "Severe
        Zone" unless it is absolutely mission essential.
        2.5.4.4.3. The BAM is internet accessible at http://usahas.com/bam/. A link to the BAM is
        on the AFSC BASH website.
     2.5.4.5. AVIAN HAZARD ADVISORY SYSTEM (AHAS). Like the Bird Avoidance Model
     (BAM), AHAS provides information on bird activity through the flight route. The distinction
     between the two is that on the planned flight route or MOA, BAM uses historical data to provide
     a depiction of what one might expect, whereas AHAS uses the BAM as a foundation and
     NEXRAD weather radar to provide a near real-time description of bird activity.
        2.5.4.5.1. AHAS functions on the principle of assessing bird strike risk. Bird strike risk is the
        likelihood of a catastrophic event. This is a function of the mass of a bird: the larger the bird,
        the higher the risk of a catastrophic event. AHAS provides pilots and commanders with a stan-
        dardized measurement of bird strike risk. This risk is rated as Low, Moderate, and Severe. The
        risk management decisions that are made for each category of bird strike risk depend on the
        type of aircraft you are flying. T-38s are much more vulnerable to serious damage from small
        birds than C-130s, for example. In a moderate condition, therefore, you would not expect to
        impose as significant risk management measures on C-130s as would be placed on T-38s. For
        this reason, AHAS does not make recommendations on the restrictions that should be imposed
        for any category of bird strike risk. These decisions should be made at the local level based on
        the airframe, the nature of the mission and the mission priority.
        2.5.4.5.2. AHAS continuously monitors the current bird strike risk using the network of
        NEXRAD weather radars to look for bird activity on low-level routes, ranges, MOAs, or in the
        vicinity of military airfields. When bird activity is detected, in an area where the existing
        records indicate hazardous bird activity should be expected, a warning is generated. Predictive
        models are used for monitoring soaring bird activity that is not visible to NEXRAD. AHAS
        forecasts the bird strike risk for the next 24 hours using the weather observations and forecast-
        ing models of the National Weather Service. These forecast models predict the bird activity
        expected on low-level routes, ranges, MOAs, or in the vicinity of military airfields.
        2.5.4.5.3. AHAS is internet accessible at http://www.ahas.com. Also, a link to AHAS is on
        the AFSC BASH website.
     2.5.4.6. Phase I and Phase II. BHWG's should establish Phase I and Phase II periods in addition
     to the normal BWC codes. As discussed earlier, the BWC codes are the current condition on the
     airfield. As described in AFI 91-202, the Phase I/II determination alerts aircrews to expected haz-
     ards when traveling to an airfield or through a particular area. Phase I and II determinations are
     largely based on bird migration but may also be based on seasonal agricultural practices in the
     local area. During migration, when bird activity is heavy, the period should be determined to be
18                                                                 AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


       Phase II. After the migration has passed through, the airfield may return to Phase I. However, if
       migrating birds remain in the local area throughout the winter, Phase II should remain in effect
       until the birds leave during the spring migration. Northern tier bases may find themselves in Phase
       II during the summer breeding season and in Phase I during the winter when most of the birds
       move south. The BAM may be helpful in determining Phase I/II at a particular CONUS location.
       Phase II declarations may warrant increased bird dispersal activities, more frequent airfield
       checks, and/or changes to flight operations. The base BASH plan should detail any required
       changes to BASH responsibilities or flight operations during Phase II.
       2.5.4.7. Aircrew Preparations :
          2.5.4.7.1. Wildlife hazards should be considered and incorporated into the mission planning
          process IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. This would include applicable bird advisories and hazard
          information, available through Internet sources, Automated Terminal Information System
          (ATIS), or as disseminated locally.
          2.5.4.7.2. Briefings on bird strikes and other wildlife hazards are much like briefings on take-
          off emergencies when urgency dictates a pre-planned course of action. As a minimum, aircrew
          briefings should include the following: Potential bird hazards along their proposed route of
          flight; use of the double helmet visors or sunglasses during daylight hours, the clear visor at
          night or during low-level operations; avoidance maneuvers at low altitude; actions if flocks of
          birds are encountered (for example, initiate a climb since the majority of birds dive to avoid a
          potential collision; and mission abort due to bird/wildlife strike
          2.5.4.7.3. The aircrew's ability to react to a bird strike situation is further enhanced by period-
          ically reviewing bird strike procedures during continuation training and safety briefings.
       2.5.4.8. Informing Transient Aircrews of Local Bird Hazards. Transient aircrews are often
       unfamiliar with airfield hazards, including birds. At some bases, the most damaging bird strike
       incidents happen to transient aircraft. Information in the Flight Information Publications (FLiP)
       (IFR-Enroute Supplement, VFR-Enroute Supplement, and Area Planning/1B), and broadcasts of
       information on either Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) or on initial radio contact
       can alert the aircrew of potential bird hazards. Advisory reports can inform aircrews of the timing
       and location of transient birds. AFI 91-202 requires publishing Phase I/II periods in FLiP.
       2.5.4.9. Aircrew Responsibility. Aircrews are essential to detecting bird hazards on the airfield
       and in the local flying area. When aircrews sight birds, they should notify other aircrews and the
       controlling agency. Aircrews may also help Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel remain aware of
       bird hazards by requesting bird hazard information before takeoff and landing. These requests
       remind air traffic controllers to be alert for birds when authorizing aircraft movements.
       2.5.4.10. Bird Hazard Identification. Bird populations, both in the local area and in regions
       where low-level sorties are flown, should be monitored. Aircrews should be made aware of the
       potential bird hazards they face. In addition to the USAF BAM and AHAS, information on bird
       concentrations and movements can be obtained from local universities, state and federal wildlife
       agencies, and private organizations such as the National Audubon Society.

2.6. Technical Assistance. Up to date information on wildlife control and hazard reduction methods is
available from several sources.

  2.6.1. USAF BASH Team. The BASH Team assists in bird hazard reduction Air Force-wide. BASH
  Team personnel are trained in bird control and have experience in wildlife ecology, land management,
  and flight operations. They also have current information on authorized control equipment and tech-
  niques. A great deal of BASH information can be found on the USAF BASH website:
  http://safety.kirtland.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/home.html
  2.6.2. Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA). The BASH Team works closely with
  AFCESA personnel both to control pest birds in structures and for vegetation control requiring agron-
  omy or entomology expertise.
  2.6.3. Federal and State Agencies. Often, bases employ professional wildlife biologists, foresters,
  or agronomists who have valuable insights into base problems. Local expertise and assistance is avail-
  able through the USDA Wildlife Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or state natural resources
  department. Attachment 4 contains a listing of agencies that can assist your BASH efforts.
  2.6.4. Private consultants. In addition to Federal and state wildlife specialists, private consultants
  are available, via contract, to assist bases in resolving wildlife hazards. Private wildlife consultants
  possessing the proper wildlife hazard management background would be acceptable to provide assis-
  tance with the base BASH effort.

                                  AIRFIELD WILDLIFE HAZARDS

3.1. Overview of Airfield Wildlife Hazards. Although it would be impossible to site an example of all
potential wildlife hazards found on airfields, the following are brief descriptions of general types of wild-
life found on or around airfields and effective management techniques that may be used. It is very impor-
tant to know which species is present before management techniques are applied. An appropriate field
guide should be used to aid in identification. Additional information on management techniques may be
found on the AFSC/SEFW website.
NOTE: Application of the management techniques suggested below may require coordination with
state and Federal authorities and compliance with AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis
Process (EIAP), as promulgated by 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 989, 1999 (Amended,
March 2001), the Air Force's supplement to the CEQ NEPA implementing regulations. For
instance, filling in a swamp or wetland may require a state or Federal Clean Water Act section 404
permit. Similarly, action affecting flood plains or wetlands will require a Finding of No Practical
Alternative (FONPA) in compliance with Executive Orders (EO) 11990 and 11988 (see AFIs
32-7061 and 32-7064). The direct or indirect taking of protected birds may require state or Federal
permits or may not be permitted under any circumstances. Moreover, actions resulting in the
destruction of protected wildlife habitat, or even certain harassment techniques, may similarly be
absolutely prohibited. In all cases, if an endangered species or a protected species may be present,
base authorities should consult with the USFWS and obtain any necessary permits before taking
any actions to control wildlife hazards. Consult the base environmental flight to ensure compliance
with state and Federal statutes and regulations.

3.2. Loons, Grebes, Pelicans, Cormorants, Mergansers. These are fish-eating birds. Control is best
accomplished by removing fish-producing ponds near the airfield. Since removal of the food source is not
always possible, pyrotechnics are effective in frightening birds from the area. A gridwire system on a
pond may also be effective in discouraging these birds. Avoid flying at sunrise and sunset when large
flocks, often in formation, can be found flying to and from feeding areas.

3.3. Pelagic Birds (Albatross, Petrels, Shearwaters, Auks, etc.). Control of these birds is nearly
impossible since natural predators are rare and the birds exhibit little fear of man or aircraft. Avoid flying
near nesting areas during the brief summer nesting period. These huge nesting colonies are located on
steep, rocky coastlines or on islands where many thousands of birds may concentrate.

3.4. Long-Legged Waders (Herons, Egrets, Ibises, Storks). Most of these species are attracted to
water where they feed on fish, amphibians, reptiles, and arthropods. Control is best accomplished by elim-
inating the food sources. Steepening the sides of ditches and ponds and removing emergent vegetation
will drastically reduce accessibility to food sources. Use pyrotechnics to disperse any birds occurring after
habitat modification.

3.5. Cattle Egrets. These birds have different feeding habits than their relatives, preferring open fields
where they primarily feed on insects. Cattle Egrets will commonly follow mowers for the invertebrates
and other small animals stirred up or maimed and left behind by the mowing operation. When Cattle
Egrets are present, mow during non-flying hours. Maintain grass between 7 to 14 inches. Periodic pesti-
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                 21


cide application may be necessary for insect control. Eliminate roost sites on or near base by removing or
thinning roost trees and brush and dispersing the birds each evening with pyrotechnics.

3.6. Waterfowl (Ducks, Geese, Swans). A distinction must be made between resident and migrating
populations.
   3.6.1. Resident waterfowl are attracted to an area to breed or feed. Ponds, lakes, ditches, etc., may
   attract these birds, particularly if these areas contain emergent or submerged vegetation for feeding,
   nesting, or shelter. Steepening ditch and pond banks and removing vegetation will reduce waterfowl
   numbers. When possible, drain water sources after ensuring compliance with wetlands laws and regu-
   lations. Wetland areas should be relocated as far from the runways and traffic patterns as possible.
   Grain fields may also attract waterfowl in large numbers and should be eliminated. Pyrotechnics along
   with gas cannons are somewhat effective control techniques for waterfowl. Use of live ammunition or
   opening base areas to waterfowl hunting are excellent methods of control. Resident waterfowl act as
   live decoys for migrating waterfowl and should not be allowed to linger on or near the airfield. Resi-
   dent birds are most active at dawn and dusk, moving at low altitudes to and from feeding areas. Avoid
   flying near wildlife refuges or any ponds, lakes, or rivers with known waterfowl concentrations during
   these periods of the day.
   3.6.2. Migrating waterfowl are particularly dangerous to aviation due to the large numbers and gen-
   erally higher altitude of the birds. Large flocks of waterfowl travel along traditional flyways to their
   breeding and wintering grounds during spring and fall, respectively. Huge flocks may stop along the
   route awaiting favorable weather conditions to continue. Migrating birds are most active from sunset
   through midnight, with numbers decreasing in the early morning hours. October and November are
   most hazardous. Avoid flying during the evening hours if possible. Reference the online BAM and
   AHAS for bird hazard information associated with waterfowl migration and low-level routes. Winter-
   ing concentration areas should be avoided.

3.7. Raptors (Hawks, Falcons, Kites, Eagles, Vultures). These birds can be particularly hazardous to
aircraft because of their size and widespread distribution. Raptors (particularly vultures) use thermals to
their advantage in search of prey. These birds become active during mid-morning and remain aloft until
late afternoon. Avoid areas with thermal generating terrain such as ridgelines, rolling hills, and near large
bodies of water. Landfills are particularly attractive to soaring vultures. In the fall, raptors migrate by day
to areas of heavy winter concentrations in the southern states and through Central America. Removing
dead animals on the airfield, proper management of landfills, rodent control on airfields, and removal of
dead trees and restricting access to other perching sites on the airfield can control these birds. Use pyro-
technics to frighten raptors from the airfield. Radio controlled airplanes can be effective in dispersing rap-
tors from an airfield.

3.8. Grouse, Quail, and Pheasants. These game birds are most effectively controlled through proper
grass-height management. Do not allow grass to exceed 14 inches and eliminate all brush, weed patches,
and areas of bare ground on the field. Pyrotechnics, gas cannons, live ammunition or periodic hunts can
effectively disperse these birds. The killing of these birds outside the normal hunting season requires dep-
redation permits from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies.
22                                                                   AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004


3.9. Cranes. These large birds are most hazardous during migration, particularly in the fall when many
thousands of birds may be concentrated in a small area. Avoid flying at dawn and dusk in areas of known
concentrations. Use pyrotechnics on the airfield to disperse these birds.

3.10. Sandpipers and Shorebirds. The most significant hazard from these birds occurs when large
numbers, flocking in tight groups, are present, particularly during migration and along coastlines. Many
of the upland species such as Upland Sandpipers and Buff-Breasted Sandpipers may nest on airfields in
spring and early summer. Other species such a Killdeer are quite adept at avoiding aircraft and do not pose
a significant hazard. Flocks in coastal areas can be hazardous and should be avoided. To control these
birds, observe proper grass height management, eliminate water in puddles, and steepen ditch banks to
limit access to the water. Use pyrotechnics for all species. Some of these birds respond well to bioacous-
tics.

3.11. Gulls. When including both commercial and military bird strikes, gulls represent the most signifi-
cant hazard to aircraft worldwide. Due to their omnivorous feeding habits and preference for flat, open
areas to rest, they are commonly found on airfields. Gulls are most active just after sunrise and before sun-
set as they move to and from feeding areas. Improperly operated landfills are a significant source of
attraction for gulls and should not be allowed in the airfield vicinity. Maintain grass height between 7 and
14 inches. This is critical in reducing gull numbers. Even with this in effect, gulls may inhabit the airfield,
particularly during inclement weather. Persistent harassment using pyrotechnics and bioacoustics is nec-
essary to discourage these birds. Gulls respond very well to falconry as a control technique. Occasionally,
use live ammunition to reinforce these techniques (permits required). Control of earthworms and insects
(especially grasshoppers) may need to be accomplished if these invertebrates are attracting gulls to the
airfield. Do not allow these birds to establish a habit of using the airfield to feed, breed, or rest.

3.12. Terns. These are fish eating, gull-like birds common in coastal areas and on some major river sys-
tems and lakes. Avoid flying near areas where these birds may be active, such as nesting colonies or piers
in coastal areas. Remove the food source or eliminate the fish-containing ponds if these birds pose a sig-
nificant hazard.

3.13. Pigeons and Doves. These birds are seedeaters and are attracted to seed-producing weeds, grasses,
and shrubs. Open areas or bare spots are attractive as resting or feeding sites. Pyrotechnics can be effec-
tive in frightening these birds. Proper turf management can limit the number of pigeons and doves on the
field. A falconry program may effectively control pigeons and dove on the airfield. Pigeons frequently
occur in structures such as hangars. Netting, shooting, trapping, use of falcons or hawks, and poison bait-
ing can drastically reduce their numbers in these structures.

3.14. Owls. Most owls are nocturnal and attracted to rodents as a food source. Remove perch sites such
as unnecessary fence posts and dead trees or use exclusion devices on airfield structures to limit the num-
ber of owls. Rodent control may be necessary if owls or other raptors are the most significant bird hazard
at an airfield. However, managing airfield grass for rodent control can cause new bird hazards to develop,
such as blackbirds, starlings, and gulls. Owls hunting inside hangars at night can drastically reduce pigeon
populations. Burrowing Owls are common airfield residents in the western US. These owls occupy exist-
ing ground squirrel and prairie dog burrows. Burrowing owls are most active in the early morning and late
evening hours, hunting insects, reptiles, and small rodents. They should not be allowed to establish resi-
dency on the airfield.
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                23


3.15. Goatsuckers (Nighthawks, Whip-poor-wills, etc.). These birds are active, particularly at sunset
when insects are abundant. Little can be done to limit their numbers other than insect control. Avoid fly-
ing at times when these birds are abundant, particularly near lakes, streams, or other areas with large
insect populations. Turning off all but necessary ramp lighting will reduce insect attraction after dark and
reduce this important food source for these species.

3.16. Woodpeckers. Woodpecker strikes should be extremely rare. These birds are common in forested
areas, but generally remain below canopy level. On the airfield, elimination of trees should eliminate
strikes with these birds. Migratory birds may be encountered, but are rarely struck.

3.17. Flycatchers. These birds are present on airfields, feeding on insects. Strikes are infrequent, but
should not be overlooked. Controlling insects and removing perch sites such as fence posts, tree limbs,
bushes, high spots on the airfield, etc., best accomplishes control.

3.18. Horned Larks. These birds are very difficult to control. They are attracted to bare spots, such as
those along runway edges, to eat weed seeds and insects. The best defense against these birds is thick, uni-
form grass with no bare spots. In the southwest, this may not be possible, as grass cannot be maintained
without intense irrigation. Consider coating bare spots, particularly along runways, with oil-base or
asphalt cover. Use pyrotechnics, but these birds will tend to fly only short distances and settle down. Per-
sistence with this specie is the key to success.

3.19. Swallows and Pratincoles. These birds eat insects in flight and are commonly found above air-
fields. Fortunately, swallows are adept at avoiding aircraft, but if they do present a problem, measures can
be taken for their dispersal. Insect control will reduce swallow numbers and discouragement of nesting
will further decrease numbers. Wash mud nests from eaves, culverts, etc., with a hose as the birds begin to
build, but prior to eggs being laid. Harassing the birds as they work on building nests can discourage nest-
ing in banks. If swallows are noted resting on runways or taxiways, use pyrotechnics to disperse them.
Fogging methylanthranilate is occasionally successful in dispersing swallows from an airfield but the
birds will often return the next day so persistence is the key to success.

3.20. Crows and Ravens. These omnivorous birds are common in open areas and around landfills.
These birds may occur in large flocks, particularly at sunset as they return to roost sites. Proper
grass-height management will reduce population numbers. Remove any known roost sites or thin individ-
ual trees. Operate landfills in a manner to discourage these birds. Use bioacoustics and pyrotechnics to
frighten these birds if they occur on the field.

3.21. Blackbirds, Grackles, Cowbirds, and Starlings. These birds can be particularly hazardous
because they frequently occur in huge flocks, sometimes in the millions. Blackbirds and starlings are
attracted to flat, open areas to feed, rest, or stage/pre-roost. Maintain grass height between 7 and 14 inches
to best reduce airfield blackbird and starling numbers. Do not allow seed-producing weeds to grow on the
airfield nor outlease grain crops in areas where these birds are known to occur. Eliminate roost sites near
the flight line. Selectively prune or remove roost trees, brush, or cattails if blackbirds and starlings are
roosting on base. Blackbirds and starlings respond well to an intense frightening program using bioacous-
tics and pyrotechnics. Use other methods to supplement this program as necessary. Starlings are not fed-
erally protected and may be killed without permits. Permits are required for other species. Occasional
shooting of birds will reinforce other frightening techniques. Consider poisoning or trapping, with US

Fish and Wildlife Service or USDA/ Wildlife Services assistance. Avoid at all costs flying near known
blackbird and starling roosts, especially at sunrise and sunset and during spring and fall migration. Huge
roosting colonies may also be present during winter months in southern states.

3.22. Meadowlarks. These birds occur on nearly every airfield and are attracted to grasslands and low
weeds. Eliminate broad-leaf weeds and maintain grass height at 7 to 14 inches. Elimination of suitable
perching sites, such as fence posts and brush, will also aid in reduction. Use pyrotechnics, but remember
meadowlarks usually fly only a short distance before settling down again. Persistence is the key to suc-
cess.

3.23. House Sparrows. Aircraft do not frequently strike these birds, but they are common pests around
structures. House Sparrows often nest in hangars and dense shrubs and trees. These birds are not protected
by law and may be killed without permits. Frightening techniques are usually ineffective against these
birds.

3.24. Warblers. The wide range of species of warblers thrives in a variety of habitats. Most prefer
shrubs, trees, or riparian habitats where they feed, breed, or rest. Do not allow these habitat types on the
airfield and warbler strikes will be rare as a result. Migrating warblers may be struck at night, especially
as they fly south in the fall. Fortunately, these birds are very small and rarely cause damage.

3.25. Fringillids (Sparrows, Finches, Grosbeaks, and Buntings). Most Fringillids are not hazardous
to aircraft operations, but occasional large flocks can be encountered, particularly during migration. These
birds are seedeaters as a rule, and most prefer weedy, brushy, or forested areas. Proper grass height man-
agement is the best means of control. Grass exceeding 14 inches will attract many of these birds and
should not be allowed. Use pyrotechnics to frighten many of these birds; success may be limited with oth-
ers.

3.26. Other Wildlife. While concern is mostly centered on birds, several mammalian species also pose a
threat to flight operations and must be considered. Close coordination with the Integrated Natural
Resources Management Plan is necessary to reduce this type of hazard.
     3.26.1. Deer. Members of the deer family (including moose, elk and caribou) occasionally occur on
     airfields. These species are generally browsers, preferring broad-leaf weeds, shrubs, and trees. Do not
     allow growth of these plants on the airfield. The presence of these plants in surrounding areas will
     serve to draw these animals from the airfield. Tall fences (reference section 2.3.9. of this document)
     can discourage these animals from entering airfields. Fencing should be secured to the ground as deer
     will often push under a fence with little more than an 8 – 10 inch opening. Long term maintenance and
     management costs of electric fences may offset any short term cost savings. On-base hunting will also
     discourage the presence of deer species. Use pyrotechnics to frighten these animals when they do
     occur on the airfield.
NOTE: During hunting season, local hunting pressure may cause an increase in the on-base population
as deer seek refuge.
     3.26.2. Coyotes and Foxes. These animals are attracted to airfields by rodents, rabbits, and other
     food sources. Dens may be found in banks, culverts, or other suitable areas. Chain link fencing used
     for deer control will also be effective in excluding coyotes from entering the airfield. Rodent control
     may reduce the numbers of these animals. Use pyrotechnics to frighten these species. Occasional
AFPAM91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                                25


   shooting of individual animals or recurrent pests will also reduce the hazard. Coordinate with base
   natural resources personnel on permit requirements.
   3.26.3. Rabbits and Hares. In addition to direct hazards to aircraft, these animals often attract rap-
   tors. Proper grass management will reduce the numbers of these animals on airfields. Occasional
   extensive rabbit hunts on the field can reduce populations for several subsequent years. Trapping or
   poisoning can also be effective for reduction of populations. Permits may be required.
   3.26.4. Rodents. These animals attract raptors, coyotes, and foxes. The base civil engineer pest man-
   ager or USDA Wildlife Services may use rodenticides in some cases.
   3.26.5. Bats. Similar to birds only in that they are capable of flight, these winged mammals may pose
   a threat to aircraft operations, particularly at dusk. In addition, they may carry diseases such as rabies.
   Although generally beneficial, bats may pose hazards if roosts develop in specific locations. Base
   environmental initiatives to support bat colonies should consider flying activity as well as base hous-
   ing prior to establishing habitat for bats.

                         LOW-LEVEL FLIGHT BASH CONSIDERATIONS

A3.1. Flying routes under the following conditions should be avoided:
   A3.1.1. Areas with known raptor (birds of prey) concentrations during summer, especially during
   1000-1700 hours, due to increased thermals. Generally, a maximum altitude of 3,000-4,000’ AGL is
   reached by all raptor species, though soaring can occur at considerably higher altitudes.
   A3.1.2. Areas with ideal terrain for creating thermals during summer months, such as ridgelines, roll-
   ing hills and areas near large bodies of water. This applies to southern Florida and Texas during winter.

A3.2. Should avoid flying one hour before and after sunrise/sunset when there is a known increase in bird
activity to reduce potential hazards, or when in the following areas: All coastal areas, Great Lakes region,
and Great Salt Lake to avoid gulls and shorebirds; areas of known blackbird and starling roosts. Informa-
tion is available from the USFWS and local experts; and Known local concentrations of waterfowl
(ducks, geese, pelicans and swans).

A3.3. Potential bird strike hazards increase at altitudes with most favorable wind speed and direction for
migrating birds (particularly near shear altitudes) up to 48 hours prior to and 24 hours after frontal pas-
sage; especially during October and November. Weather is a prime stimulus for migratory bird move-
ments.

A3.4. Flying near wildlife refuges, landfills, stockyards, and food processing plants should be avoided, as
these all attract birds.

A3.5. The following should be obtained from the Internet to best assess low-level and special use air-
space bird hazards: Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) bird hazard risk predictions. The BAM may be
accessed at www.usahas.com or through the USAF BASH web page (safety.Kirtland.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/
home.html); and Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) near real time bird risk predictions. AHAS can
be accessed at www.usahas.com or through a link from the USAF BASH web page (safety.Kirt-
land.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/home.html).

A3.6. The following may be obtained from HQ AFSC/SEFW, Kirtland AFB to best assess low-level
route hazards: Specific guidance when unusual bird movements are noted and guidance in specific geo-
graphical areas.

A3.7. Consider the following operational changes to reduce threats from bird strikes, mission require-
ments permitting: Reduce low-level flight time; reduce formation flying; reduce airspeed at low-levels;
and increase altitudes during low-level flights.
