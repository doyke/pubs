1. GENERAL.
     1.1. Control of personnel and vehicles entering and exiting Youngstown Air Reserve Station
     (YARS) is necessary to provide a safe environment in which to work and to provide for the
     protection of government property and operational resources. The Defense Biometric
     Identification System (DBIDS) is an access control system designed to enhance force
     protection and identification management by capturing and storing biometric data of
     personnel that access the installation.
     1.2. The system is capable of reading all existing Department of Defense (DoD)-issued
     identification credentials, to include dependent and retiree identifications cards. DBIDS is
     also capable of generating an identification card that stores a digital photograph and
     biometric fingerprints for contractors, students, or other personnel who do not have
     independent access to the installation, but have a valid and recurring need to enter the
     installation.
     1.3. All Active Duty military personnel, military Reserve members, military Dependents,
     military Retirees, DoD civilian employees, and contractor personnel who require routine
     access to the installation must register their current identification (ID) in the DBIDS
     database. Installation access for all visitors, contractors, and vendors will be initiated by an
     OHLEG, National Crime and Information Check (NCIC) or Law Enforcement Automated
     Data System (LEADS) data check as applicable. DBIDS issued IDs will be restricted by date
     and Force Protection Condition (FPCON).
        1.3.1. DBIDS will be used as an access control system specifically for enhancing force
        protection and security measures pertaining to access to the Youngstown Air Reserve
        Station. DBIDS is not intended to, and will not be used as a tool to monitor employee's
        performance. Information gathered through DBIDS will not be used to generate adverse
        actions against employees unless directly related to a security violation.
        1.3.2. All civilian and military personnel assigned to YARS will have full access to the
        installation through FPCON Charlie. This access level also includes all Base Operating
        System (BOS) contract personnel (i.e., EAST Inc).
        1.3.3. All assigned personnel that are identified by position as “MISSION ESSENTIAL”
        will have access through FPCON Delta.
        1.3.4. Only those personnel identified by the installation commander will have access
        during FPCON Delta/POTUS.
     1.4. Entry Controllers will scan ID cards utilizing the card scanner or manual validation. The
     on duty Entry Controller will then verify the picture and information to display on the screen
     against the ID card and the person presenting the ID.

        two years past the expiration of the DAC issued against it.
        2.3.14. Coordinate/report all DBIDS major issues covered and not covered within this
        instruction with HQ AFRC/A7S.
     2.4. Registrar:
        2.4.1. The registrar is responsible for registering individuals into the DBIDS system. The
        registrar enters personal data, determines the correct authorization profile, captures a
        photo and fingerprint for each user (depending upon category), and produces DACs when
        required.
        2.4.2. The Registrar can also make changes to existing user records, register and flag
        vehicles, edit the barment roster, edit the access areas, and any other function determined

        2.5.2. Verify equipment is operable upon assuming post by conducting a scan of own
        CAC. Report any system issues to the SSM.
3. DBIDS Recognized ID Cards.
     3.1. DBIDS accepts and recognizes three different types of ID cards. The following sections
     describe the characteristics of each ID card type.
910AWI31-502 10 MAY 2013                                                                       5


      3.1.1. Teslin cards are produced through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting
      System (DEERS) for DoD affiliated members such as Active Duty, Dependent, Retiree,
      Civil Service, and Contractors. DBIDS reads all Teslin cards.
      3.1.2. A Common Access Card (CAC), the new Teslin card with an embedded computer
      chip, contains the cardholder‘s personal information in the Portable Data File (PDF) 417
      barcode and is fully supported by DBIDS. Barcode identification information is
      crosschecked with Biometric Fingerprint Authentication technology and personal
      information from the DBIDS database system.
      3.1.3. DBIDS cards are produced on-site through the DBIDS application for non-DoD
      ID cardholders and are installation passes not DoD ID privileges card. Barcode
      identification information is cross-checked with Biometric Fingerprint Authentication
      technology and Person information from the DBIDS database system. Do not issue a
      DBIDS card to individuals authorized a DoD ID card.
4. DBIDS Registration Process.
   4.1. All personnel requiring recurring and unescorted access to YARS, to include those
   issued CACs and other credentials outlined in AFI 36-3026, must enroll in DBIDS and
   provide digitized fingerprint minutia data (DFMD) during registration. This may be obtained
   during in-processing or initial pass issue or can be pulled down from DEERs provided they
   are on file in the DEERs system. All DoD ID-card holders assigned to YARS and YARS-
   pass applicants must be registered. The Installation Commanders will determine
   requirements for DoD-card holders who are TDY to or visiting YARS for 29 days or less and
   document the requirements in the IDP. Personnel TDY to YARS for more than 30 days or
   more must register in DBIDS. * NOTE: DoD ID card holders can utilize fingerprints and
   photos stored in DEERS and those assigned to YARS may register for the first time at the
   main gate.
   4.2. Unique Circumstances/Special Events. The Installation Commander may grant the use
   of other measures including, but not limited to, Entry Access List (EAL) or access
   memoranda for specific special events or unique circumstances. In these cases, driver‘s
   licenses, passports, or other means of photo identification may be used in concert with the
   EAL for access. Names on these documents must be vetted against authoritative government
   databases for potential derogatory fitness information. Commanders must minimize the use
   of these measures and use DBIDS credentials, AF Forms 75, or other credentials when
   applicable. For initial access of official foreign visitors or others who require the eventual
   issuance of a CAC, an EAL, AF Form 75, or DBIDS credential will be used following access
   need determination/sponsorship, ID proofing and vetting.
   4.3. All personnel requiring recurring and unescorted access to YARS must:
      4.3.1. Enroll in the DBIDS and provide DFMD. This may be obtained during in-
      processing or initial pass issue and must be completed at the visitor center in building
      102. Fingerprint-data policy is as follows:
          4.3.1.1. In-processing. Personnel who possess an authorized DoD ID card and access
          credential pass applicants will provide DFMD during registration process unless they
          can be pulled down from DEERs. If a DoD ID-card holder has a manually-produced
 6                                                                 910AWI31-502 10 MAY 2013


            DoD ID card, the individual must obtain a machine-produced bar-coded DoD ID card
            according to the appropriate military regulations and personnel systems.
        4.3.2. Issuance personnel must brief the recipient on requirements listed in paragraphs
        through 4.3.6, this publication.
        4.3.3. Carry their DoD ID card or IP (for non-DoD card holders) on their person while in
        duty status or when on a United States Air Force (USAF) installation. On request, they
        will present their DoD ID card or access credential to security forces personnel.
        Individuals who refuse to present their DoD ID card or IP are subject to immediate
        surrender of the credential and may be grounds for further administrative or punitive
        action.
        4.3.4. Immediately report a lost or stolen DoD ID card or access credential to the local
        security forces (SF) or issuance office so the card can be deregistered.
        4.3.5. Inform the sponsoring organization of any change to the official relationship that
        served as the basis for access.
        4.3.6. Turn in access credentials to the issuance office or sponsoring organization when
        the credential expires or when the basis for obtaining the credential no longer exists.
     4.4. Types of credentials. USAF installations currently employ a variety of temporary access
     credentials. The USAF goal is to employ a standard credential which is capable of electronic
     interrogation and interoperable among all DoD Services. Currently, the format being
     employed across the Services in this capacity is DMDC‘s DBIDS. Once fully implemented at
     YARS, the DBIDS credential will be used as the primary means for allowing non-CAC
     eligible populations physical access to installations. Installation visitor passes will only be
     issued in person to the applicant or a sponsoring CAC holder.
        4.4.1. DBIDS Credential. Once issued, these credentials are approved for physical access
        to YARS.
        4.4.2. AF Form 75, Visitor Pass/Vehicle Pass. 910 SFS may continue to use the AF75 as
        an access credential to YARS in the event DBIDS is temporarily inoperative or as
        prescribed by S3O.
5. Registration Categories.
     5.1. The following are categories of personnel to be used during the registration process:
        5.1.1. DoD ID-Card Holder: An individual authorized to possess a DoD ID card to
        include children 10 years and older. The status of a DoD ID-card holder will supersede
        other person categories. For example, an LN employee, married to a service member and
        entitled to a DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card, will
        be treated as a DoD ID card holder for the purpose of this regulation and will not be
        issued an IP nor require sponsoring.
        5.1.2. Contractor: A person contracted to work for DoD, but is not a DoD ID-card
        holder.
        5.1.3. Delivery Personnel: Individuals who need recurring access to YARS to make
        deliveries or perform a similar service related to their employment (i.e., pizza delivery,
        taxi driver) in a service authorized to conduct business on the installation.
910AWI31-502 10 MAY 2013                                                                           7


      5.1.4. Vendor or Commercial Solicitor: Individuals authorized to sell merchandise or
      provide services on USAF installations.
      5.1.5. Base Services User: Personnel with limited access to an installation to attend
      courses or other services as authorized by the Installation Commander.
      5.1.6. Member of Private Organization: A member of an approved private organization
      who has no other reason to enter YARS other than to participate in private organization
      functions approved by the Installation Commander.
      5.1.7. Visitor (Friend or Family Member Not Included in Category Above): A visiting
      family member or friend of the requester who is not authorized a DoD Identification
      Card.
      5.1.8. Official Local Guest: A broad category designed for individuals requiring
      recurring access for official business or access based on an official relationship (for
      example, visits by local city officials such as the mayor, fire chief, or other civic leaders).
      Sponsoring organizations will not use this category when the applicant meets the
      definition of another, more restrictive person category. This category is specifically
      designed for personnel, who by their position or standing within the community, are
      considered trustworthy. The S5 section will coordinate with sponsoring agencies to verify
      need for access of all personnel identified under this category and forward those
      approved for access.
      5.1.9. Department of State, U.S. Embassy Personnel, or Other Federal Agencies: An
      individual assigned to or on duty with the United States Department of State, an
      American Embassy, U.S. diplomatic or consular posts, or other Agencies of the Federal
      government.
      5.1.10. Other: An individual who requires recurring and unescorted access, but does not
      meet the definition of any other category. Sponsoring organizations will not use this
      person category if the applicant meets the definition of another, more restrictive person
      category. This category is appropriate for a former spouse without base privileges whose
      children are military dependents with base privileges, but are not old enough to utilize
      base facilities without parental supervision.
      5.1.11. Dual-Category Individuals: A dual-category individual (for example, a military
      retiree who is also a contractor) will be registered in the person category with the greatest
      access privileges. The Official Guest and Other person categories will never be used as a
      dual-category qualifier.
6. Requesting Authority (RA) for DBIDS Access Card.
   6.1. The RA for DBIDS Access Cards for contractors is usually the contracting
   office/contracting officer or the contracting office/contracting officer representative. In cases
   where the contracting office is not involved it can also be the commander of the unit
   initiating the contract, and in certain cases, a US military member or US Government
   employee (i.e., General Schedule (GS)) requesting access for an individual not affiliated with
   a contract or company but has legitimate reason for access that conforms to all applicable
   policies, instructions, and regulations.
8                                                                  910AWI31-502 10 MAY 2013


    6.2. The requesting unit commander must delegate individuals in writing and forward
    delegation to 910 SFS/S5L to act on behalf of the unit as the RA.
    6.3. For contract modifications resulting in a reduction in the contract expiration date, the
    RA must notify the DBIDS office within 24 hours of the modification.
    6.4. If the contract date is extended the RA must ensure a memorandum is submitted to the
    Approving Authority, requesting an extension to the expiration date. The Approving
    Authority must approve, sign and date the memorandum and submit it to 910 SFS/S5L.
    6.5. New DACs will be reissued upon receipt of the memorandum. DACs will not be
    reissued if the extension time is 30 days or less, but new expiration dates will still be entered
    into the database and the SM will furnish SFS/S5L with a written list in the event the gate
    system becomes in-operational and the visual inspection of the DAC is used for access.
    6.6. Sponsor Responsibilities.
       6.6.1. Sponsors who are supervisors within a contracted company will identify
       individuals in their organization who require access on a regular basis, certify they are
       trustworthy, and pose no threat to the installation. Contract sponsors will initiate the
       application process with applicants, validating that all information is accurate, and submit
       completed applications to 910 SFS/S5L. Non-compliance and lack of enforcement of this
       policy without approved exception will result in termination of these positions and
       possible revocation of issued DACs. Sponsors who are US military members or US
       Government employees are responsible for the actions of any individual they sponsor for
       access and will assist the individual with the application process.
       6.6.2. Coordinate with PASS and REGISTRATION to get applicants onto the DBIDS
       enrollment schedule. The sponsor must ensure the applicant has a completed CDS and
       has all available identification, to include identification, employment contracts, driver’s
       licenses, vehicle registrations, military service documentation, birth certificates or
       National ID Card, and background check, paperwork forwarded from 910 SFS/S5L at the
       time of biometric enrollment and have not expired. Copies of this paperwork are required
       and will be retained and attached to the CDS.
       6.6.3. Individuals will pick up and activate their own DAC.
       6.6.4. If an applicant is fired or quits, the sponsor retrieves all access cards, credentials
       and/or vehicle passes possessed by the applicant, notifies the PASS and
       REGISTRATION of the worker‘s status (i.e., escorted off the installation or worker
       transferred), and coordinates with the RA to furnish any discrepancies incurred with the
       return of access cards and any derogatory information on the applicant.
       6.6.5. If an individual is being barred from the base and it is feasible, bring the individual
       to the DBIDS office for a full biometric registration whereas the registrar will input into
       the Reason Fingerprinted field the comment: .ALERT ALERT – Barred from YARS.
       6.6.6. Coordinates with the RA for the return of all access cards, credentials and/or
