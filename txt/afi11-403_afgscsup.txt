              REDUCED OXYGEN BREATHING DEVICE OPERATIONS

13.1. (Added) General Overview.
13.1.1. (Added) Overview. The ROBD aircrew training system provides hypoxia recognition
and emergency recovery procedures training for a loss of aircraft cabin pressurization,
malfunctioning oxygen equipment and other emergencies that result in the need for supplemental
or emergency oxygen. The ROBD shall be used in conjunction with a flight simulator or ROBD
Hypoxia Familiarization Trainer (HFT) to train aircraft-specific hypoxia emergency recovery
procedures. The ROBD is an approved aircrew training system alternative to the low-pressure
chamber in AFI 11-403 Paragraphs 5.6 and 6.5.1.4 for Combat Air Force fighter and bomber
aircrew as part of refresher physiological training.
13.1.2. (Added) Description. The ROBD produces normobaric hypoxia by delivering a precise
mixture of nitrogen and reduced oxygen from attached pressurized cylinders or from an
oxygen/nitrogen extraction system. The reduced oxygen gas mixture is delivered to an aviator’s
oxygen mask to accurately simulate the equivalent oxygen concentration at altitudes from sea
level to 34,000 feet. The instructor controls the altitude and concentration of oxygen in the gas
mixture via the ROBD control interface by selecting the appropriate training profile. The
training profile is a pre-programmed menu that consists of desired altitudes and simulated ascent
rates. The instructor may start, change, or stop the training profile from the ROBD control
interface. For emergency hypoxia recovery, the instructor initiates 100% oxygen with positive
pressure from the control panel via the „Oxygen Dump‟ switch.
13.2. (Added) Objectives and Demonstrations. IAW AFI 11-403 Paragraph 6.5, all training
requirements must be fulfilled for fighter and bomber aircrew (with exception of paragraph
6.5.2) where the Type 4 low pressure chamber flight will be replaced with the ROBD. The
following objectives and demonstrations will be performed during ROBD training.
13.2.1. (Added) The following training objectives are required for ROBD hypoxia recognition
and recovery training:
13.2.1.1. (Added) Experience the symptoms of hypoxia while in a simulated flight/mission
environment.

Chronological Record of Medical Care.
13.5.3.3. (Added) An AF Form 361 must be completed and processed IAW AFI 11-403
Paragraph 11.2.
13.5.4. (Added) ROBD Reactions and Emergencies.
13.5.4.1. (Added) Apprehension and Claustrophobia. Apprehension and claustrophobia
should be minimal as training occurs in a familiar environment with experienced aircrew.
However, training is normally not accomplished while in a reduced oxygen environment, so
apprehension and claustrophobia are still possible. Professionalism and sensitivity by Aerospace
and Operational Physiology personnel can help alleviate problems and limit/minimize
hyperventilation reactions. If the student appears to be apprehensive, work with them prior to
accomplishing ROBD training by practice breathing off of the device before training event is to
begin. The student should not be rushed or crowded. If the student insists on leaving the ROBD
training site/simulator, the student should be allowed to leave and shall be referred to his/her
commander or FS as required. If ROBD is determined not appropriate for training then all efforts
will be made to schedule the student at a chamber location where the training requirement can be
achieved.
13.5.4.2. (Added) Hyperventilation. Hyperventilation can result from apprehension, positive
pressure breathing and/or hypoxia. If student exhibits signs of hyperventilation, the I/O will
activate the oxygen dump switch, monitor, and encourage the student to slow their breathing rate
and depth. If the reactor cannot control rate and depth of breathing adequately and or blood O2
saturation levels begin to drop after activation of 100% O2, the I/O will remove the student from
the ROBD training system and will notify the AOP. The AOP will refer the reactor to the FS for
further evaluation. If the reactor becomes unconscious or unresponsive for more than 30
seconds, place the student on the floor in a horizontal position (if practical) and follow
procedures listed under loss of consciousness IAW Paragraph 13.5.4.5.
AFI 11-403_AFGSCSUP 1 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 11

13.5.4.3. (Added) Suffocation. When a reactor reports the feeling of suffocation, have the
reactor immediately lower his/her mask and check connections. If connections-check is good,
check ROBD system state for correct mode of operation and remedy if required IAW ROBD
Operations Checklist. If the ROBD passes ops test then inspect reactor’s mask and have him/her
exchange equipment life support or provide student with a properly fitted training mask if
available.
13.5.4.4. (Added) Hypoxia. If during the non-hypoxia stage of the training the student becomes
hypoxic, immediately activate the oxygen dump switch on the ROBD. Monitor O2 sensor and
heart rate to ensure appropriate recovery. If hypoxia symptoms do not subside, instruct the
student to disconnect the mask from the right side of his/her helmet and allow them to recover
breathing ambient air; however, recovery from hypoxia will be delayed without 100% oxygen
under pressure. Continue to monitor for recovery and ensure no further degradation of
consciousness occurs. If reactor becomes unresponsive or unconscious, follow procedures under
loss of consciousness IAW Paragraph 13.5.4.5.
13.5.4.5. (Added) Loss of Consciousness. Loss of consciousness is considered a medical
emergency and the EMS system should be activated immediately by calling 911 and then calling
the on-call FS. Ensure the student is on 100% Oxygen (ROBD Oxygen Dump Switch activated)
and place the reactor in a supine position on the floor and monitor respiration, pulse, and O2
levels via the student’s pulse oximeter until directed otherwise by emergency response
personnel. Vital signs must be taken initially and at least every two minutes thereafter unless
otherwise directed by emergency response personnel. Continue to provide basic emergency life
saving skills and AED if available until relieved by emergency response personnel.
13.5.5. (Added) Mechanical/Electrical Emergencies.
13.5.5.1. (Added) Power Loss. If electrical power is lost during hypoxia portion of ROBD
training, I/O will instruct the student to disconnect the mask from the right side of his/her helmet
and allow them to recover breathing ambient air. If electrical power is lost during non-hypoxia
portion of ROBD training, student will disconnect mask and wait for instructions from I/O.
Training can be restarted once electrical power is restored and the I/O has performed an ROBD
self-test IAW ROBD operations checklist. Training will commence from the beginning of the
profile following an equipment check/retest.
13.5.5.2. (Added) Electrical Fire. If an electrical fire is detected, cease all training activities and
follow local emergency fire procedures. If not the source of the electrical fire, turn off the ROBD
power switch and close all cylinder valves but do not disconnect any hoses.
13.5.5.3. (Added) Loss of Oxygen, Nitrogen, or Air. If Oxygen source is inadequate during
hypoxia recovery portion of ROBD training, the ROBD Oxygen alarm will sound. Disconnect
student from ROBD by instructing the student to disconnect the mask from the right side of
his/her helmet and allow them to recover breathing ambient air; however, recovery from hypoxia
will be delayed without 100% oxygen under pressure. If air and nitrogen sources are inadequate,
the ROBD will disable hypoxia training and automatically activate 100% oxygen. Discontinue
training until bottles are professionally serviced.
