                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. The 12th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (12 OSS/OSW), commonly
     referred to as the Weather Flight (WF), and 26th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS),
     located at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, are the primary agencies for providing or arranging
     weather support and services to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW), Headquarters Air
     Education and Training Command (HQ AETC), 19th Air Force (19 AF), and other associate
     units assigned to Randolph AFB, Texas. Fundamental concepts, guidance and procedures
     are outlined in applicable Air Force (AF) and AETC directives, this instruction and
     corresponding Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the 12 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS.
     1.1.2. This instruction establishes weather operations and support requirements and
     procedures for Randolph AFB, which must be coordinated to ensure local mission needs are
     identified and met. It consolidates requirements and procedures for peacetime operations
     (only), obviating the need for separate agreements between the WF and supported units. It
     does not cover emergency wartime or other special operations, which are covered in other
     plans and guidance.
1.2. Designators. ―KRND‖ is the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) location
indicator identifying, and used for all weather products disseminated by or for, Randolph AFB.
The corresponding World Meteorological Organization (WMO) index number is 722536.
1.3. Assumptions,      Shortfalls    and     Limitations. Adequate         resources,   including
communications, will be available to execute this instruction, and sufficient weather intelligence
will be available, from various military and non-military sources, on which to base weather
operations and production.
1.4. Duty Priorities. Duty priorities are required and established to ensure tasks are
accomplished in order of importance and promote understanding among supported agencies.
Duty priorities help ensure timelier response under routine conditions; however, the list does not
replace good judgment. The weather provider may deviate in the interest of flight safety or
protection of personnel or property. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 detail respective duty priorities for the
WF and 26 OWS:

12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                9


1.9. Meteorological Equipment. The WF relies on a range of systems to determine current and
forecast future weather and weather impacts. These critical weather sensing, production and
communications systems are used and required to provide customers timely, accurate and
relevant weather intelligence. Principal WF weather and communications systems are outlined
in Chapter 7.
1.10. Release of Information to Non-DoD Agencies or Individuals. Weather information will
not be released to non-DoD agencies, individuals or the public without approval from 502
ABW/PA Public Affairs and 902 MSG/JA (Legal). Any related issues should be coordinated
through the WF Chief or Supervisor.
1.11. Additional Weather Support. Requests for additional weather support or changes to
support outlined in this instruction should be directed to the WF (Chief or Supervisor).

                                            Chapter 2

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions and areas that affect the Randolph
aerodrome or base as a whole. Services include weather observing and reporting, resource
protection (detailed in Chapter 6) and pilot-to-metro service (PMSV), as outlined further below.
2.2. Airfield Services Element (ASE). The ASE is comprised of the Airfield Service Provider
(ASP) and any WF members conducting airfield services. ASE responsibilities and tasks pertain
to the following areas: (1) airfield observations, (2) weather watch, (3) backup dissemination of
weather products, (4) terminal aerodrome forecasts, (6) cooperative weather watch, and (8)
meteorological watch.
2.3. Airfield Weather Observations. The WF takes, records and disseminates observations
IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. The FMQ-19, Automatic Meteorological
Station (AMS), is the AF standard system and the primary means of taking observations, with
WF technicians providing backup to and augmenting the system (only) when required. In the
automated mode, the system continually senses and reports the following weather elements:
wind, visibility, precipitation/obstructions to visibility, cloud amounts and heights, temperature,
dewpoint, altimeter and lightning. (Key notes: Automated systems, including the FMQ-19,
report weather elements over a more limited area, typically take-off/touch-down end of the active
runway, vice the entire celestial dome (horizon to horizon). These systems, which can generate
observations every minute, also use time-weighted averaging of elements for more consistent
observations.)
   2.3.1. Types of Observations. The WF provides three basic types of weather observations:
   aviation routine weather report (METAR), special (SPECI) and local (LOCAL) observations.
   All observations are taken from the official observing points (paragraph 2.3.2).
       2.3.1.1. METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report). A METAR is a regularly
       scheduled observation taken and disseminated every hour at 55-59 minutes after the hour.
       A METAR observation may also indicate any special criteria met during the given
       observing period. METAR observations are disseminated locally and longline.
       2.3.1.2. SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report). A SPECI is an unscheduled
       observation taken and disseminated when any special criteria in AFMAN 15-111 (see
       Attachment 2) is sensed or observed. SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as
       soon as possible after the given criteria is observed. SPECI observations are
       disseminated locally and longline.
       2.3.1.3. LOCAL (Aviation Selected Local Weather Report). A LOCAL is an
       unscheduled observation, taken and reported to the nearest minute, for elements not
       meeting SPECI criteria. For Randolph, the only LOCAL taken is for altimeter and only
       when the airfield and WF are open and backing up the FMQ-19 pressure sensor. (The
       FMQ-19 is not designed to take local observations.)
   2.3.2. Official Points of Observation. The official points of observation for Randolph are at
   the FMQ-19‘s Primary Sensor Group instrumentation site (by Runway 14L) and
   Discontinuity Sensor Groups‘ instrumentation sites (by Runways 32R, 14R and 32L);
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                   11


  Attachment 16 depicts sensor sites. When FMQ-19 augmentation is required, WF
  technicians will use the red brick area on the flightline side of Bldg 8, or, for alternate
  location operations, the parking lot adjacent to the East Tower, as the official observing
  point.
     2.3.2.1. Backup Observation Site Limitations. The view from both observation points is
     restricted by flightline facilities, shelters and trees from south to northwest and parked
     aircraft. High intensity security lights severely limit the ability to determine nighttime
     visibility and cloud amounts or heights. The west runway is not visible from either
     observation point.
  2.3.3. FMQ-19 Operations. IAW AFMAN 15-111, the WF will operate the FMQ-19 in full
  automated mode to provide the official METAR and SPECI observations for Randolph,
  except when augmentation is required.
     2.3.3.1. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having qualified WF technicians
     manually add or edit data to observations generated by the FMQ-19. The two principal
     augmentation processes involved are supplementing and backup.
         2.3.3.1.1. Supplementing is manually adding to the automated observation weather
         data beyond the capability of the FMQ-19 to detect or report. WF technicians will
         supplement observations whenever the WF is open and the following conditions are
         observed:
            2.3.3.1.1.1. Tornado, Funnel Cloud or Water Spout (+FC) (see Note)
            2.3.3.1.1.2. Hail (GS and GR) (any size)
            2.3.3.1.1.3. Volcanic Ash (VA)
            2.3.3.1.1.4. Sandstorm (SS) or Duststorm (DS)
            2.3.3.1.1.5. Snow Depth (only reported during airfield operating hours when
            heavy snow warning has been issued and snowfall is occurring.)
            2.3.3.1.1.6. Visibility < 1/4 mile (local requirement for visibility > 300 and 100
            feet).
            (Note: Immediate reporting of a tornado, funnel cloud or water spout takes
            precedence over any other phenomena.)
         2.3.3.1.2. Backup is manually providing weather data and/or disseminating an FMQ-
         19 generated observation when the primary automated method is not operational or
         unavailable due to individual sensor(s), system or communications failure.
            2.3.3.1.2.1. When an FMQ-19 sensor is no longer working properly, the WF
            (typically ASP) will report the outage and, until fixed, perform backup, inputting
            the corrected or missing element in the METAR/SPECI observation.
     2.3.3.2. The WF will maintain situational awareness of local weather conditions and
     FMQ-19 observations during airfield and WF hours. WF technicians will also monitor
     area observation and forecast products to keep abreast of changes expected to affect the
     Randolph AoR.
 12                                                           12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


       2.3.3.3. Backup for Operationally Significant Weather: WF technicians will perform a
       basic weather watch (BWW) and be prepared to backup observations for the following
       conditions:
          2.3.3.3.1. Any ceiling layer reported below 3,500 AGL over airfield
          2.3.3.3.2. Visibility at or below 5 SM
          2.3.3.3.3. Any present weather to include thunderstorms, any precipitation or
          obscurations
          2.3.3.3.4. Thunderstorms/lightning observed within 10 NM (of Randolph AFB)
          2.3.3.3.5. Any other meteorological condition deemed critical by WF technician
          2.3.3.3.6. If, in the WF technician‘s judgment , the FMQ-19 observation is deemed
          unrepresentative of current conditions and pose a potential threat to flight/ground
          safety (i.e., dynamic changes in cloud coverage or visibility not being reported by the
          FMQ-19 due to the delay in the sensor processing software, etc,) the WF technician
          will:
              2.3.3.3.6.1. Immediately contact the Supervisors of Flying (SOFs).
              2.3.3.3.6.2. Intervene by immediately augmenting (backing up) the FMQ-19
              observation to modify (i.e., add, change, etc.,) the necessary meteorological data.
              2.3.3.3.6.3. Allow 20 minutes for the FMQ-19 to report representative
              observations. If the FMQ-19 begins to report representative observations within
              that allotted time, the WF technician will suspend backup procedures. However,
              if FMQ-19 still does not reflect observations that are representative after the
              elapsed time, the WF technician will log the sensor/system out and continue to
              augment observations IAW AFMAN 15-111.
2.4. Weather Watch. The (automated) FMQ-19 system performs a continuous weather watch
(CWW). When the FMQ-19 requires augmentation, WF personnel will conduct a BWW.
   2.4.1. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). In a BWW, WF personnel will monitor and visually
   check weather conditions every 20 minutes (min) and be ready to supplement observations if
   conditions in paragraph 2.3.3.1.1 are forecasted within 2 hours. WF personnel will also log
   on to and be prepared to supplement the FMQ-19 whenever a watch or warning is issued for
   tornadoes or hail.
2.5. Backup Dissemination Procedures. In the event of ADS or other communications
outages, the WF will disseminate weather observations/resource protection products locally to
agencies in Table 2.1 (in priority order), and record dissemination on a Local Dissemination
Log.

   2.6.1. TAFs for Randolph AFB are routinely produced and disseminated by 26 OWS for
   Randolph based on 12 FTW operational requirements. Forecasts are valid for a 24-hour
   period and issued at a frequency no to exceed every 8 hours while the airfield is open. The
   WF will coordinate any other TAF requirements (e.g., for extended hours) with 26 OWS as
   soon as possible. TAF specification, amendment criteria and formats are outlined in
   Attachment 4.
   2.6.2. 26 OWS will amend the TAF as outlined (in Attachment 4) for all watch/warning
   conditions, and any other conditions described in AFMAN 15-129.
   2.6.3. During local airfield/flying hours, the WF produced mission execution forecast
   (MEF), derived from and expanding on the TAF, will be considered the official forecast for
   Randolph. The (OWS produced) TAF will serve as the official forecast at all other times.
2.7. Cooperative Weather Watch. IAW this instruction, RAFBI 13-204 and MOU, the WF
maintains a cooperative weather watch (CWW) with 12 OSS/OSA and the SOFs, as outlined
below:
   2.7.1. Both 12 OSS/OSA air traffic control (ATC) personnel and SOFs should notify the WF
   when any of the following unreported conditions are observed to occur at Randolph AFB:
      2.7.1.1. Tornado or funnel cloud.
      2.7.1.2. Thunderstorms or lightning.
      2.7.1.3. Visibility changes of one or more reportable values, when the prevailing
      visibility at the tower or the surface is less than 4 statute miles (SM).
      2.7.1.4. Precipitation (any type) beginning or ending.
      2.7.1.5. Any other significant meteorological condition.
   2.7.2. Both 12 OSS/OSA tower personnel and SOFs, as applicable, should also:
      2.7.2.1. Notify the WF of and pass along any PIREPs received.
      2.7.2.2. Notify the WF of any ADS outages or other weather equipment problems noted.
      2.7.2.3. Notify the WF of any changes or imminent changes to the active runway and
      runway light settings.
14                                                           12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


     2.7.2.4. Provide operational checks (daily at min) of the Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV)
     radio.
     2.7.2.5. Provide ATC tower and SOF orientation for all newly-assigned weather
     technicians.
     2.7.2.6. Ensure newly assigned ATC personnel receive local weather phenomena and
     prevailing visibility training, and newly appointed SOFs receive a local weather
     orientation.
  2.7.3. 12 OSS/OSAB (Airfield Management) will:
     2.7.3.1. Notify the WF of any changes in runway conditions (e.g., RCR, RSC), aircraft
     mishaps and aircraft in-flight or ground emergencies.
     2.7.3.2. Forward the WF changes initiated to flight information publications (FLIPs) and
     chart orders to the appropriate agencies for action.
     2.7.3.3. Disseminate weather warnings received for Randolph AFB over Secondary
     Crash Net.
  2.7.4. 12 OSS/OSW (WF) will:
     2.7.4.1. Reevaluate weather conditions and ensure airfield weather equipment (FMQ-19)
     is working properly when a reliable source (e.g., ATC, SOF, aircrew) reports conditions
     differing from those in the last reported observation (e.g., different cloud ceiling,
     visibility, weather).
     2.7.4.2. Accomplish the following when/if FMQ-19 augmentation (supplementation or
     backup) is required, based on reevaluation of the differing weather conditions reported
     and local policy:
        2.7.4.2.1. As soon as possible, notify the East and West Towers whenever prevailing
        visibility at the official weather observation point decreases to less than, increases to
        or exceeds 4 SM.
        2.7.4.2.2. As soon as practical, reevaluate prevailing surface visibility, on receipt of a
        differing tower reported value, or on receipt of reportable changes from the tower
        level.
        2.7.4.2.3. Use tower reported prevailing visibility values as a guide in determining
        surface visibility when portions of the horizon are obstructed from view (by
        buildings, aircraft, etc).
        2.7.4.2.4. Generate a SPECI or LOCAL observation when/if the differing conditions
        warrant immediate dissemination. (Note: Unless stated otherwise, LOCALs are
        generated only for altimeter setting during airfield hours and backup of FMQ-19
        pressure sensors.)
        2.7.4.2.5. Backup the FMQ-19 for operationally significant weather as prescribed in
        paragraph 2.3.3.3.6.
     2.7.4.3. Provide limited weather observing training for newly assigned ATC personnel
     and weather orientation for newly appointed SOFs.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                         15


2.8. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH is the process of monitoring
observed and forecast weather conditions and notifying select agencies (e.g., ATC, SOF) when
specific weather conditions occur or are forecast. 26 OWS performs a continuous METWATCH
for Randolph, with the WF acting as ―eyes forward,‖ providing continuous, on-site feedback on
changing weather conditions to 26 OWS. Through the METWATCH process, changes in related
weather elements drive notification from the WF or 26 OWS to base agencies.
   2.8.1. Eyes Forward Function.
       2.8.1.1. The WF integrates visual, airfield sensor, radar, satellite, lightning detection, and
       non-standard weather data to form an integrated weather picture and near-term forecast
       for the OWS. The WF‘s ―eyes forward‖ function provides the OWS meaningful weather
       information not conveyed in coded observations and is an integral part of the
       METWATCH for Randolph.
       2.8.1.2. Performing the eyes forward function, the WF will contact and provide the OWS
       significant information on local weather patterns and unforecast weather changes, (esp)
       when:
          2.8.1.2.1. The OWS produced TAF is out of category or unrepresentative for
          Randolph.
          2.8.1.2.2. Severe weather signatures are noted on radar or satellite that could affect
          the Randolph area or local flying missions or significant PIREPS are received for
          within 50 NM.
          2.8.1.2.3. Weather meeting forecast warning criteria occurs or is expected and no
          warning is issued; or when a forecast warning is issued, but related conditions are no
          longer expected.
          2.8.1.2.4. Weather occurs or is expected (within 30 mins) that can affect 26 OWS
          and WF products (e.g., TAFs, hazard charts), or when significant elements forecast
          on OWS generated products are no longer expected.
          2.8.1.2.5. When Randolph AFB (KRND), Kelly/Lackland AFB (KSKF), Stinson
          Field(KSSF), New Braunfels (KBAZ), San Antonio (KSAT), or San Marcos (KHYI)
          surface observations would cause the OWS-issued TAF for KRND to be ―out of
          category‖ or weather information indicates 12 OSS/OSW-issued MEFs will cross
          operational thresholds.
          2.8.1.2.6. National Weather Service issues a watch or warning for the San Antonio
          area.
          2.8.1.2.7. Surface observations or other weather information (e.g., PIREPs) cause
          OWS-issued TAFs to be out of category or unrepresentative; or indicate WF-issued
          MEFs will cross aircraft weather sensitivity or MEFF amendment/specification
          thresholds, as outlined in Chapter 3.
 16                                                               12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012

                                      MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing the customers‘
daily missions (e.g., MEFs, SOF briefings, flight weather briefings). The MEF and weather
liaison are the primary tools used to accomplish these tasks.
3.2. Operational Hours. Mission services required outside operations hours identified (in
paragraph 1.8) will be coordinated with WF leadership.
3.3. Mission Services Element (MSE). The MSE consists of the Mission Services Provider
(MSP), Flight Weather Briefer and any WF members conducting mission services. The MSP is
the MSE focal point. The MSP performs MISSIONWATCH, focused primarily on off-station
missions, including any military operating areas (MOAs), low-level routes or alternate airfields
in the AoR. The MSE should have a full understanding of the mission limiting parameters for
each flying unit‘s aircraft and missions. The MSE will work closely with the ASE to ensure all
wing/base customers receive required support. MSE responsibilities and tasks include:
   3.3.1. Liaison Support.
       3.3.1.1. Subject to manning availability and IAW WF duty priorities (Table 1.1), a WF
       liaison will provide in-person briefs to the Operations Supervisors at the flying
       squadrons‘ duty desks. The liaison/briefer will also solicit feedback on current and past
       weather products.
       3.3.1.2. A WF liaison/briefer will also be available for mass briefs and any situation
       requiring weather support at squadron level (e.g., flying safety or continuation training).
       The liaison can also provide direct input to wing scheduling for future mission planning,
       on request.
3.4. Area of Responsibility (AoR). 12 FTW aircraft conduct local pattern flight training and
fly/operate in several MOAs and low-level routes across Texas. The WF prepares tailored MEF
products for operations in these areas. Figures A15.1 and A15.2 in Attachment 15 depict
common MOAs and low-level routes.
3.5. Weather Impacts on Supported Customers. The following tables, derived from AFI 11-2
series (aircraft type) publications and AETC and Randolph AFB Sups, provide guidance on
weather sensitivities for locally assigned aircraft and related programs. (Note: These Tables do
not include all-inclusive lists of the weather sensitivities for each aircraft. For complete lists, see
respective AFIs and Technical Orders (TO) for each aircraft.)
   3.5.1. T-6 Weather Sensitivities. Per AFI 11-2T-6 V3, T-6 Operations Procedures, the T-6
   operates at Randolph under the following weather restrictions:

       3.5.2.1. T-38 aircraft do not possess anti-icing equipment. T-38s will not climb/descend
       through forecast icing more severe than light rime icing and cannot cruise through any
       area of known or forecast icing.
       3.5.2.2. T-38 aircraft do not possess weather radar and, therefore, should maintain at
       least 10NM distance when below FL230, and 20NM distance when at or above FL230,
       from all verified or suspected thunderstorms.
   3.5.3. T-1 Weather Sensitivities. Per AFI 11-2T-1 V3, T-1A Operations Procedures, the T-1
   operates at Randolph under the following weather restrictions:

       3.5.3.1. The T-1A will not be flown in areas of forecast or reported severe icing, or in
       freezing rain or drizzle. Should not cruise or conduct multiple pattern operations in
       actual moderate icing conditions.
       3.5.3.2. The T-1A will not be flown in areas of forecast or known severe or extreme
       turbulence.
       3.5.3.3. T-1s should maintain at least 10NM distance when below FL230, and 20NM
       distance when at or above FL230, from all thunderstorms.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                          19


3.6. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The WF develops the MEF using the 12-step process
outlined in AFMAN 15-129, integrating and tailoring products from strategic and regional
weather centers, as well as information from local units and agencies. The final result is a
product designed to provide timely, accurate and relevant weather information to local
customers. MEFs should be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror)
corresponding products issued by the OWS and/or Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). During
rapidly changing conditions, the WF can amend the MEF to better reflect expected conditions,
brief the customer, then back-brief the OWS.
   3.6.1. MEF Flimsy (MEFF). The WF produces the MEFF, a tailored area forecast for
   Randolph airfields; MOAs, ranges and low-level routes flown by Randolph aircraft. It also
   contains flight level winds, flight hazard charts and links to space and alternate airfield
   weather information. The MEFF is considered a legal flight weather briefing for local sorties
   (take-off and land at KRND), out-and-back sorties (take-off KRND, land at one of locations
   on MEFF and return KRND). The MEFF is flexible and amended, as necessary, to meet the
   mission needs of 12 FTW and Randolph units. The MEFF can be viewed via the SharePoint
   on       any      computer        connected    to     the      Randolph       LAN         at:
   https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12OG/OSS/MEFF/WEBMEFF.htm.
       3.6.1.1. MEFF Issue. The WF normally issues and publishes the MEFF by 0515L, Mon-
       Fri. The MEFF is maintained and valid through the end of the flying day, and the WF
       amends the MEFF as conditions warrant. The WF does not issue a MEFF outside normal
       airfield hours, on declared down or no-fly days or on weekends, unless flying is
       scheduled.
       3.6.1.2. Weekend/No-fly Day MEF Support. The WF will provide MEF support to 12
       FTW units flying local missions weekends or no-fly days. The WF requests advance (24-
       hr) notice.
       3.6.1.3. MEFF Amendment Criteria. The MEFF is amendable though the landing of the
       last aircraft flying the local area. Scheduled first take-offs and last landings are typically
       published by Thu for the following week. The WF (IAW 12 OSS/OSAB) will check for
       modifications to last landing times for local flying. The WF will amend the MEFF for
       the following forecast or observed conditions at Randolph, the MOAs, low-level routes or
       other areas for which a MEFF forecast is issued. (Note: The following will also be
       MEFF specification criteria.)
          3.6.1.3.1. Ceiling. If the ceiling descends below, or if less than, rises to or above:

Table 3.4. Randolph MEFF Ceiling Amendment/Specification Criteria.

         3.6.1.3.3. Turbulence. If not forecast and reported (any intensity), or if forecast and
         reported not to exist, unless the forecast is still deemed representative.
         3.6.1.3.4. Icing. If not forecast and reported (any intensity), or if forecast and
         reported not to exist, unless the forecast is still deemed representative.
         3.6.1.3.5. Thunderstorms. If not forecast and occur (any intensity), or if forecast and
         do not occur, unless the forecast is still deemed representative.
         3.6.1.3.6. Freezing precipitation. If not forecast and occurs, or if forecast and not to
         occur.
         3.6.1.3.7. Wind Speed/Direction. If the difference between the predominant and
         forecast wind speed is 10 knots or greater and/or the difference between observed
         gusts is 10 knots or greater than forecast. The MEFF will be amended for wind
         direction when the forecast predominant direction changes 30 degrees or more and
         sustained wind speeds or gusts are expected to exceed 15 knots.
         3.6.1.3.8. Representativeness. The MEFF will be amended any other time the WF
         deems it unrepresentative of current or forecast conditions at Randolph or any other
         MEFF location.
      3.6.1.4. MEFF Dissemination. The WF will normally disseminate the MEFF via
      SharePoint by 0515L Mon-Fri. The MEFF will also be posted on SharePoint and
      accessible at: https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12OG/OSS/weather/default.aspx and 26
      OWS                                                                              website

3.7. Mission Watch (MISSIONWATCH). MISSIONWATCH is the monitoring of weather
for local flying missions at, and cross-country or transient missions briefed out of, Randolph by
the WF. Combined with METWATCH (paragraph 2.8.), MISSIONWATCH compels the WF to
monitor missions and weather and, as required, issue changes or amendments to respective
MEFs issued. As conditions dictate, the WF will amend the MEF, and contact the SOFs and
Operations Supervisors to pass on impacts to missions. The WF will MISSIONWATCH
transient flights briefed by the WF, and 26 OWS will MISSIONWATCH transient flights [from
Randolph] briefed by the OWS.
3.8. Off-station Support for 12 FTW Aircraft. IAW AFMAN 15-129, the WF is the primary
source for tailored weather information for 12 FTW units. When mission activities occur away
from the main operating location, WF leadership will determine the most effective means of
ensuring Randolph based units receive mission execution weather information.
   3.8.1. The WF will provide MEFs to Randolph units/assets transiting or conducting flying
   missions at other locations via reachback, or by arranging support through other weather
   units or the OWS servicing the off-station location.
3.9. Flight Weather Briefings. The WF will provide traditional (DD 175-1) or verbal flight
weather briefings to aircrews, as requested, IAW WF duty priorities (Table 1.1). Briefings will
be available at the WF (Bldg 8) and via the network, fax and/or phone. Aircrews should provide
the WF (652-3040/3538) as much lead-time as possible (1-hr min) to complete the request. 26
OWS also stands ready to provide briefings to 12 FTW or transient crews flying out of Randolph
during the WF‘s non-duty hours. In the flight planning room (Bldg 8) are instructions on
contacting the OWS for a briefing, and on browsing the OWS webpage for information.
Briefings can be requested from the 26 OWS Flight Weather Briefing Cell DSN 331-2651,
Comm             (318)        529-2651;         fax         -2609)         or         webpage:
https://26ows.barksdale.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?UID=&BW=H&UF=O&AOR=1.                    For
equipment or communications outages, the OWS will back up the WF for DD 175-1 briefings.
   3.9.1. Mass Weather Briefings. The WF will provide mass briefings for larger or special
   missions, on request (24-hrs notice desired) and subject to available manning.
   3.9.2. Transient Aircrew Services. The WF will provide traditional DD 175-1 or verbal
   flight weather briefings to aircrews, as requested, and IAW WF duty priorities (Table 1.1).
   If the WF is unable to provide a briefing or update in a timely manner, a transient aircrew
   may be directed to the aircrew briefing terminal in the flight planning room (Bldg 8)
   provided and maintained by the WF (IAW AFMAN 15-129). This terminal also allows
   aircrews to self-brief or secure a flight weather briefing from the 26 OWS, especially during
 22                                                            12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


   WF non-duty hours. The WF will provide transient crews sufficient information and supplies
   to help complete their briefings.
3.10. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). Randolph‘s assigned PMSV frequency is 239.8 MHz.
The WF will provide weather information to all aircrews who contact Randolph, regardless of
home station. The WF will also solicit PIREPs during PMSV contacts; PIREPs are a tool to help
enhance forecast accuracy and flying safety. During local PMSV outages, 802 OSS/OSW
(Lackland/Kelly) will monitor and respond to Randolph PMSV contacts; the Randolph WF will
likewise monitor and respond to Lackland/Kelly PMSV calls during local outages. Phone
patches (direct or via the 502 ABW/CP) can be directed to the WF at DSN 487-3040/3538,
Commercial (210) 652-3040/3538, or to the 26 OWS Flight Weather Briefing Cell, DSN 331-
2651, Commercial (318) 529-2651or toll free 1866-223-9328.
3.11. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Support. 12 OSS/OSAB will notify the WF of any
scheduled DV aircraft arrivals/departures, which may drive changes to published airfield open
hours. The WF, in turn, will adjust WF operating hours to support scheduled DV missions. If
unscheduled missions should occur during airfield closed hours, the 502 ABW/CC will notify the
Weather Standby Supervisor, who will recall the Standby Forecaster. The Standby Forecaster
will report to and open the WF as soon as possible and remain open until the airfield is closed or
the DV mission‘s complete.
3.12. Space Weather. The WF will monitor and brief space weather events and impacts, with
focus largely on communications. Space weather products are available via the Joint Air Force
and        Army     Weather       Information     Network         (JAAWIN)          webpage:
https://weather.afwa.af.mil/conus_space.html. The WF‘s webpage and MEFF also contain
links to these CONUS space weather.

designed to be flexible and tailored to meet customers‘ needs. Staff weather services are
available normal duty days/hours (paragraph 1.8.2), but can be extended, as required.
4.2. 12 FTW/MX Daily Standup/Staff Briefing. The WF will brief weather and related
impacts (see Figures A14.1-4. In Attachment 14) at the 12 FTW/CC staff meeting (‗standup‘),
held Mon-Thu. The weather briefing is flexible, but should include (at a minimum) forecasts for
the current and next day and outlook for the week, highlighting related impacts to wing missions
and threats to base. Other items, e.g., tropical storms posing threats, should also be briefed.
4.3. 12 FTW/MX Ops Flimsy. The WF will produce and post a 12 FTW/MX Ops flimsy (see
Figures     A13.1.      and       A13.2      in   Attachment      13)      to      SharePoint
(https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12OG/OSS/MEFF/WEBMEFF.htm) and/or e-mail it to the
maintenance schedulers, by 0600L Mon-Fri. The daily flimsy is used to plan (only) aircraft and
ground maintenance activities. It is not amended.
4.4. Randolph Mission Partner Team (MPT) Briefings. As noted above, the WF will provide
weather briefings and/or information, as required, when the MPT convenes. This includes real
world event, exercise and tropical storm/hurricane (Hurricane Evacuation Staff) support. MPT
briefings will be tailored to provide the weather intelligence required by wing/base leadership.
4.5. Mass Deployment Briefings. The WF will provide mass weather briefings, as required, for
mass aircraft deployments, such as hurricane evacuations (HUREVAC) (see paragraph 3.9.1).
Briefing format will depend on the mission. The WF requests advance (24-hrs) notice of such
briefings.
4.6. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Weather Briefings. The WF will brief weather to/at
IRCs, as requested. The IRC lead will provide the WF a schedule of upcoming IRCs and
coordinate (especially) any higher level IRC briefings required for flag officers. IRC weather
briefings will be tailored to seasonal and common flying weather threats and may include
overviews of WF services, capabilities, procedural changes and other items of interest.
4.7. Air Traffic Controller (ATC) Observer Training/Orientation. The WF provides limited
observer training to ATC controllers assigned to Randolph. On completing training, ATC
personnel will be given a short test and an orientation tour of the WF. The WF will maintain the
ATC training program and related records.
4.8. Quarterly Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Briefings. IAW AFI 11-418, AETC Sup 1, the
WF will present upcoming seasonal weather and weather challenges at quarterly SOF meetings.
This will also be the venue to solicit feedback and address SOF and other weather support issues.
4.9. SOF Orientation Briefings. The WF will provide orientation briefings to new SOFs, to
include CWW responsibilities and WF duties, hours, capabilities, limitations and equipment.
 24                                                          12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


4.10. Pre-Deployment Concept Briefings. On request, the WF will provide pre-deployment
weather briefings. These briefings will typically include local, point of embarkation and
debarkation and deployed location weather data. The WF requests advance (24-hrs) notice for
such requests.
4.11. Climatology Support. The WF tracks climate statistics for the base and leverages the
support of the 14th Weather Squadron (the Air Force‘s climatology center) for climate statistics
worldwide. On request from an authorized agency, the WF will provide climatology data for
Randolph or other locations. Requests may be made by phone, e-mail, letter or in person.
Monthly climatology is also presented at 12 FTW/CC staff meetings.
4.12. Flight Information Publications (FLIPs) Updates. The WF is responsible for ensuring
all weather information in the FLIP, such as WF operating hours and equipment limitations, is
current and accurate. The WF will review new FLIPs within 10 days of receipt for weather
information, and for changes to airfield take-off, landing, radar instrument approach minima,
NOTAMs and other key items which may drive changes to weather support. As applicable, the
Flight Supervisor or designee will route any weather updates to the Airfield Manager (12
OSS/OSAB) for processing. Updates can include revisions, changes or corrections. The WF
will implement any requisite changes to WF guidance and/or procedures as soon as possible.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                   25

       5.1.1.1. Perform a BWW and be prepared to augment FMQ-19 observations, as required.
       5.1.1.2. Continue to issue and update MEFs and the MEF/MEFF webpage, if possible. If
       the webpage is inaccessible, the WF will fax or email the MEF to the flying training
       squadrons.
       5.1.1.3. Continue METWATCH. If ADS is unavailable, weather warnings, watches and
       advisories will be disseminated by phone, fax or email.
       5.1.1.4. Provide aircrew briefings by phone or fax and continue MISSIONWATCH.
       5.1.1.5. PMSV is not available at the AOL. During AOL operations, the Lackland/Kelly
       WF will monitor and respond to Randolph PMSV calls.               (Likewise, during
       Lackland/Kelly AOL operations, the Randolph WF will monitor and respond to
       Lackland/Kelly PMSV calls.)
   5.1.2. AOL Limitations. The view from the AOL observation point is limited by flightline
   facilities, covers and trees southeast through northwest, and parked aircraft.
   Communications limitations prevent full capability to monitor automated sensors on the East
   and West runways.
 26                                                          12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


5.2. Aircraft Emergencies.
   5.2.1. In-flight emergency (IFE) or ground emergency (GE). When notified of an IFE or GE
   involving aircraft, WF technicians will maintain a heightened weather situational awareness
   until advised the emergency has been terminated. In the event an IFE or GE results in an
   accident or incident, the WF will immediately initiate the actions for an aircraft mishap (as
   specified below).
   5.2.2. Aircraft Mishap. When notified of an aircraft mishap, the WF will:
      5.2.2.1. If operating the FMQ-19 in backup mode, take and record a full element SPECI
      observation.
      5.2.2.2. Ensure all data and products used in developing any weather information,
      product or service provided to a customer (to include MEFs, forms, wind/hazard charts,
      etc) are saved.
      5.2.2.3. Save enough data before, during and after the mishap to fully reconstruct the
      weather conditions at the time of the mishap. Activate the FMQ-19 aircraft accident
      investigation (AAI) function as an added fail-safe measure.
      5.2.2.4. Coordinate with other units (OWS, AFWA, other WFs) to save any required
      data.
      5.2.2.5. Collect and save the following products, as applicable, until requested, or send
      them to the unit requesting the data save:
          5.2.2.5.1. Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) imagery (visible, infrared and water
          vapor, etc)
          5.2.2.5.2. Radar products (reflectivity, VAD winds, echo tops, base velocity, etc)

      5.2.2.6. Coordinate with the AFWA Operations Center (DSN 271-2586) to save any
      applicable data and products that cannot be saved locally, providing AFWA a specific list
      of data to be saved.
      5.2.2.7. Coordinate with 26 OWS to initiate a data save for any OWS provided products
      used in preparing the flight weather MEF. If other OWS products crossing OWS AoRs
      were used, the WF will coordinate data saves with all applicable OWSs. If an OWS
      provided the flight weather briefing, they will coordinate the data save with other units
      involved.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                      27


5.3. Severe Weather Action Plan/Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP ensures weather flight
leadership and/or the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT), consisting of senior, experienced
WF members, are notified and respond to potential and actual severe weather events in
Randolph‘s AoR. The 26 OWS routinely schedules adequate resources to respond to severe
weather situations within the AoR. The 26 OWS, in close coordination with the WF, will assess
and respond to any potential severe weather threat. Based on the assessment, a severe weather
watch or warning may be issued.
Note: During severe weather events, the WF may have to limit other support and services, IAW
duty priorities (Table 1.1.), due to increased workload and limited resources. WF limitations
may include: answering only hotlines, shortening/canceling weather briefings, extending
telephone hold periods and/or delaying updates to various products and services (e.g., MEFs).
   5.3.1. SWAP Initiation. The SWAP will be initiated if any of the following occur or are
   expected in Randolph‘s AoR:
       5.3.1.1. Tornadic activity, hail > 3/4 inch, winds > 50 knots, heavy precipitation (rain or
       snow) or freezing precipitation. (If the event poses imminent threat to life and/or
       property, the WF will ensure the appropriate warning is issued prior to calling the SWAT
       leader or OWS.)
       5.3.1.2. A severe weather event is observed at or in vicinity of Randolph.
       5.3.1.3. The WF determines the potential for severe weather exists at Randolph.
       5.3.1.4. The National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) includes
       the San Antonio area in a severe weather watch or warning area.
   5.3.2. SWAP Activation, Normal Duty Hours. When the WF is open, the 26 OWS and WF
   will collaborate; time permitting, prior to any watch/warning issuance. At minimum, the
   SWAT will consist of the Flight Chief, Supervisor and/or Duty Forecaster, as available. The
   SWAT leader will determine if additional WF personnel are required. The WF will remain
   open and SWAP continue until the threat subsides and/or related severe weather
   watches/warnings have ended.
   5.3.3. SWAT Activation, Non-Duty Hours. When the WF is closed, the 26 OWS will
   contact the 502 ABW/CP, who, in turn, will contact the WF Standby Supervisor (or, if
   unavailable, Flight Chief or Supervisor) when any severe watch or warning (for tornado,
   winds > 50 knots, hail > 3/4-inch, freezing precipitation or heavy precipitation (rain or
   snow)) is issued for Randolph. The WF Standby Forecaster will be recalled, contact 26
   OWS, discuss the situation and advise the WF SWAT leader. As required, the SWAT leader
   and additional SWAT members will be recalled to provide operational assistance.
   5.3.4. Augmenting Automated Observations During SWAP. The WF will supplement
   automated FMQ-19 observations for conditions prescribed in AFMAN 15-111 and this
   document (paragraph 2.3.3.1.1). The WF will also backup automated FMQ-19 sensors as
   conditions warrant. Flight safety and resource protection are paramount, and augmentation
   will help ensure ―eyes forward‖ support to the OWS and that all severe weather aspects are
   fully identified, reported and recorded.
 28                                                          12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


   5.3.5. Post-Event Procedures and SWAT Deactivation. Once the WF and 26 OWS
   determine the severe threat has ended, the SWAT leader will release the team and the WF
   return to normal operations. Post-event procedures will include, as applicable, OPREP or
   other required reporting, forecast review (good or bad) and data archiving.
   5.3.6. SWAT Exercises. IAW AFI 10-229, the WF and 26 OWS will jointly conduct semi-
   annual severe weather response exercises. Real world severe weather events can serve as
   suitable substitutes for this requirement.
5.4. Operational Reporting (OPREP). The WF will initiate reporting of severe weather
occurring at and impacting Randolph by contacting the 502 ABW/CP after the occurrence the
following:
   5.4.1. Tornado
   5.4.2. Winds > 50kts (to include gusts)
   5.4.3. Hail > 3/4 inch
   5.4.4. Anytime base resources suffer damage caused by weather (IAW AFI 10-229).
   5.4.5. Immediately after the severe weather event, the WF will provide a severe weather
   forecast worksheet, summarizing the event, to the 502 ABW/CP, 26 OWS and HQ
   AETC/A3OW. If email and fax are unavailable, the summary may be passed by phone.
   Within 24 hours of the event, the WF will ensure relevant weather information is provided to
   the 502 ABW/CP for OPREP-3 reporting.
5.5. Recalling Standby Personnel.
   5.5.1. The WF will provide the 502 ABW/CP a WF Standby Supervisor schedule and
   contact numbers and provide updates as necessary. During WF non-duty hours, the 26 OWS
   will pass all watches and warnings to the 502 ABW/CP, who, in turn, will contact/pass them
   to the WF Standby Supervisor. The Standby Supervisor will determine if the Standby
   Forecaster should be recalled. If recalled, the Standby Forecaster will report to the WF as
   soon as possible and notify the 26 OWS and 502 ABW/CP on arrival. The Standby
   Forecaster will assess the situation and perform METWATCH until the threat has ended. As
   required, the SWAT leader and other SWAT members will also be recalled.
   5.5.2. The SWAT will be activated and recalled if the 26 OWS issues a watch or warning for
   any severe weather conditions (see paragraph 5.3.3). When recalled, SWAT members will
   report to the WF as soon as possible and initiate contact with and advise 12 FTW leadership
   of the threat.
   5.5.3. If recalled, WF members will be prepared to augment FMQ-19 observations, as
   required, and continue to do so until the severe weather threat has ended.
   5.5.4. Recalled WF personnel must remain on duty as long as any of the following
   conditions are occurring or expected, unless released by the WF Standby Supervisor or
   SWAT Leader:
      5.5.4.1. Watch/warning for severe weather (paragraph 5.3.3) or hail (any)
      5.5.4.2. Airfield is required to open/remain open for MEDEVAC or DV mission support
      5.5.4.3. Airfield is required to open/remain open for any other reason
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              29


5.6. Backup Support to 26 OWS. If 26 OWS operations are interrupted (e.g., by power
outage, natural disaster), the OWS will advise the WF. As required, responsibility for the
Randolph TAF, weather watches, warnings and advisories may be transferred to the WF for up
to 72 hours. Responsibility for other 26 OWS products (e.g., graphics products) will be
transferred to other units/agencies, as necessary, to continue weather information flow to
Randolph customers.
5.7. Backup Power (for Bldg 8). WF members will receive annual training in operating the
backup generator (in Bldg 10) for Bldg 8. Once the generator startup is complete, or if
generator problems are encountered, the WF will notify 12 CES‘ Electrical Power Production
(652-3850) duty hours, or 24-hr Emergency Management Customer Support (EMCS) (652-3151)
after hours.

                                 RESOURCE PROTECTION

6.1. General. This section outlines actions taken to provide resource protection to Randolph
AFB. Resource protection is accomplished jointly by the WF and 26 OWS through the use of
weather watches, warnings and advisories, complemented by local observation and forecast
products.
6.2. Delineation of Duties. IAW AF guidance and MOA, the 26 OWS is responsible for
issuing forecast watches, warnings and advisories, and the WF is responsible for issuing
observed warnings and advisories, for Randolph. In the event of imminent threat to life or
property, the WF can and will issue forecast warnings and advisories normally issued by the 26
OWS, then advise the OWS as soon as time permits. The WF also acts as ―eyes forward‖ for
and coordinates with the 26 OWS on issuing, amending and canceling watches, warnings and
advisories.
6.3. Unit Requirements. Randolph units are responsible for coordinating added watch,
warning or advisory support or associated special notifications, not identified in this instruction,
with the WF. Units requesting such support should also validate the requirement by providing a
list of protective actions taken for each watch, warning or advisory. The WF will determine if
the requested support or criteria falls within the capabilities of the WF or 26 OWS and adjust
procedures, accordingly.
6.4. Weather Watches. A weather watch alerts units to the potential for weather conditions
that could threaten life or property. Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius from perimeter of
Randolph AFB. When a watch is issued, units should take, or prepare to take, protective actions.
Attachment 5 depicts watch formats, and Table 6.1 outlines watch criteria and lead times:

Table 6.1. Weather Watches for Randolph AFB.
  Criteria                                              Desired Lead-Time (DLT)

12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                            31


 **Denotes deviations from standard DLTs in AFMAN 15-129. Customers require stated lead
 times to properly posture manpower and take appropriate actions required for weather warning
 upgrades. This does not prevent earlier issuance of watches, if potential is clearly apparent and
 coordinated with WF.
6.5. Weather Warnings. A weather warning, observed or forecast, alerts units to weather
conditions occurring, imminent or expected that could threaten life and/or property. Warnings
are issued for a 5 NM radius from the perimeter of Randolph. When a warning is issued, all
units should take protective actions immediately. Attachment 5 depicts warning formats, and
Tables 6.2 and 6.3, respectively, outline forecast and observed weather warning criteria and
DLTs:

Table 6.2. Forecast Weather Warnings for Randolph AFB.
 Criteria                                              Desired Lead-Time (DLT)

 Dust/Sandstorm (Visibility < 5/8 SM / 1000 M)         90 minutes
 * Denotes deviations from standard criteria in AFMAN 15-129.
6.6. Observed Weather Warning. The WF will issue an observed weather warning (only) for
lightning associated with thunderstorms within 5 NM of the airfield. When the WF is closed or
unable to issue, 26 OWS will issue the observed weather warning.

Table 6.3. Observed Weather Warning for Randolph AFB.
 Criteria                                                                 Desired Lead Time
 Lightning associated with Thunderstorms within 5 NM of Airfield          NA (As Observed)
6.7. Weather Advisories.
   6.7.1. Observed Advisories. Weather advisories alert units to mission impacting weather
   criteria not covered by watches or warnings. The WF will typically issue observed
   advisories only during local flying hours, and advisories will end or be canceled when local
   flying is complete. When the WF is unable to issue, 26 OWS will issue the observed
   advisories. The WF will use observations, PIREPs, radar, satellite and other resources to
   determine if conditions warrant issuing or canceling an observed advisory. Attachment 5
   depicts advisory formats, and Table 6.4 outline advisory criteria.
 32                                                           12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012

   6.7.2. Forecast Advisories. Table 6.5 lists forecast advisories issued for Randolph by 26
   OWS.

Table 6.5. Forecast Weather Advisories for Randolph AFB.
Criteria                                                     Desired Lead Time
Winds > 25 knots to < 35 knots                               30 min
Temperature ≤ 32o F                                          240 min
6.8. Dissemination Procedures. Dissemination of weather watches, warnings and advisories,
to include their issuance, extension, upgrade/downgrade and/or cancellation, is accomplished via
ADS, with backup phone calls to ensure receipt by critical agencies (Table 5.1).
6.9. Base Siren Activation. During tornadic activity, the base siren system serves as the
primary notification system for Randolph. On receipt of a tornado warning from the 26 OWS or
WF identification of a tornado threat (visual or radar), the AETC Command Center will
immediately notify the 502 ABW/CP and activate the siren. The siren will sound until the
warning is canceled or ―all clear‖ received.
6.10. Tropical Weather Activity. The WF, in close coordination with the 802 OSS/OSW,
Lackland AFB Weather Flight will maintain awareness of tropical systems that may threaten the
Greater San Antonio Area and NAS Pensacola. Both units will routinely monitor National
Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts and advisories (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov) for Atlantic,
Caribbean or Gulf of Mexico tropical activity. Additionally, both units will also monitor the 26
OWS site (https://ows.barksdale.af.mil) for related products (e.g., Tropical Cyclone Threat
Assessment Product (TC-TAP)). NHC updates are issued every 6-hours (03, 09, 15 and 21Z)
and followed, in turn, by 26 OWS product updates.
   6.10.1. Tropical Cyclone Bulletins. Flight and base leadership will be notified anytime a
   tropical depression, storm, or hurricane develops, moves within, or is forecast to move within
   400nm of the Greater San Antonio Area and or NAS Pensacola, within a 96-hour period.
   802 OSS/OSW forecasters will use the NHC Tropical Cyclone Bulletins and 26 OWS TC-
   TAP products (as applicable) as well as coordinate with the 26 OWS to develop JBSA
   Tropical Cyclone Bulletin (see Attachment 8). The bulletins are designed to alert base and
   JBSA leadership, personnel and agencies of the storm‘s forecast track, intensity and
   associated impacts, focusing on the potential for winds > 50 knots within 96, 72, 48, 24 and
   12 hours of the Greater San Antonio Area and NAS Pensacola. (Note: Tropical cyclone
   outlooks, especially beyond 48-hours, contain a high degree of uncertainty and are subject to
   change.)
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                     33


   6.10.2. IAW AFMAN 15-129, the WF will not deviate from the official NHC forecast:
   position, track, movement, and maximum wind speed or intensity trend. The WF will use the
   MEFP to tailor the official tropical cyclone forecast into a local mission forecast product.
   6.10.3. The WF will also provide weather briefings, to include the latest tropical cyclone
   forecasts and related impacts for the Greater San Antonio Area and NAS Pensacola, to the 12
   FTW/CC, Randolph MPT, 12 OG/CC and Hurricane Evacuation Staff (HES), as conditions
   warrant.
   6.10.4. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON): HURCONs serve as incremental warnings of
   approaching tropical cyclones and related threats, assessed and focused on forecast arrival of
   damaging (> 50 knots sustained) winds. (Note: Other related weather hazards may arrive
   earlier.)
       6.10.4.1. HURCON IV: Winds > 50 knots are forecast/expected within 72 hours.
       6.10.4.2. HURCON III: Winds > 50 knots are forecast/expected within 48 hours.
       6.10.4.3. HURCON II: Winds > 50 knots are forecast/expected within 24 hours.
       6.10.4.4. HURCON I: Winds > 50 knots are occurring or forecast/expected within 12
       hours.
       6.10.4.5. ALL CLEAR: Hurricane conditions are terminated.
   6.10.5. The 12 FTW/CC will declare respective HURCONs for 12 FTW assets, as required.
   The WF will notify 26 OWS of HURCON changes, and, at HURCON III, consider 24-hr WF
   operations.
   6.10.6. In the event of aircraft hurricane evacuation (HUREVAC), the WF will provide
   mass, multi-ship and individual flight weather briefings IAW WF duty priorities (Table 1.1).
   The WF requests advance notice (24-hrs) of requested briefings and times to help ensure
   timely support.
6.11. Flash Flood Warnings. When the NWS (at New Braunfels) issues flash flood warnings
for areas including Randolph, the WF will relay those warnings to the 26 OWS and 502
ABW/CP.
6.12. Actions by Base Agencies. IAW JBSA 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management
Plan (CEMP), and 12 FTW Plan 32-4001, Aircraft Hurricane Evacuation, base agencies have
specific actions when notified of weather threats. Base agencies should review and perform
respective protective actions on notification of weather watches and/or warnings from the WF or
26 OWS. Attachment 11 outlines principal weather threats and protective actions.
 34                                                           12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


                                          Chapter 7

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

7.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of principal weather and
communications equipment used by the WF, including information on backup, maintenance and
restoral priorities.
7.2. Meteorological (Weather) Equipment. The WF uses a wide range of equipment to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to
provide customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   7.2.1. Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Open-Systems Principal User Processor (OPUP).
   The WF is a member of the Unit Radar Committee and linked to the NEXRAD Radar
   Product Generator located in New Braunfels (25 miles northeast of Randolph). The OPUP is
   a hardware-software system designed for ready access, display and analysis of Doppler radar
   imagery. The OPUP allows the WF to display, locate and interrogate severe thunderstorms,
   as well as other weather systems. If the OPUP fails, backup radar data and support is
   available via other sources, including the NWS, 26 OWS and AFWA (JAAWIN), as well as
   other internet sources.
   7.2.2. FMQ-19, Automatic Meteorological System (AMS). The FMQ-19 is an automated,
   integrated system of weather sensors, processors and communications and data automation
   components that continually measure weather conditions to provide reliable, real-time
   weather data in support of flying and other operations and resource protection. The FMQ-19
   measures or detects: wind speed and direction; temperature and dew point; pressure;
   prevailing visibility and present weather; cloud amounts and heights; precipitation; freezing
   rain and lightning strikes. There are four FMQ-19 sensor groups sited on Randolph
   (Attachment 16): Primary Sensor Group (near runway 14L) with wind, visibility, ambient
   light, freezing rain, precipitation (type and amount), temperature, dewpoint, pressure, cloud
   and lightning detection sensors; Discontinuity Sensor Group 1 (near runway 32R) with wind,
   visibility and cloud sensors; Discontinuity Sensor Group 2 (near runway 32L), with wind and
   visibility sensors; and Discontinuity Sensor Group 3 (near runway 14R) with wind, visibility
   and cloud sensors.
   7.2.3. Kestrel. The Kestrel is a hand-held, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) weather
   instrument that provides measurements of 10 different environmental conditions: wind
   speed, temperature, wind chill, humidity, heat index, dewpoint, wet bulb, barometric
   pressure, pressure altitude and density altitude. It serves as the primary back-up for most of
   the FMQ-19 sensors.
   7.2.4. Vaisala Digital Barometer. The Vaisala barometer is a fully compensated, COTS
   digital barometer designed to cover a wide range of environmental pressures and
   temperatures. It serves as a back-up for the FMQ-19 barometers.
   7.2.5. FMQ-13V2, Digital Wind Sensor. There are two FMQ-13V2 wind sensors at
   Randolph‘s Auxiliary Field (Seguin), one on each end of the runway. The digital readout
   displays are in the north and south runway supervisory unit (RSU).
   7.2.6. Limitations of Airfield Weather Sensors.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                   35


      7.2.6.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 is unable to observe hail (size), tornado activity,
      volcanic ash or visibility < 1/4 SM. In the event any of these phenomena occur within a
      reportable distance, the WF technician will supplement the Randolph observation with
      the appropriate details. In addition, the FMQ-19 is most accurate when weather is stable.
      In rapidly changing conditions of sky cover and visibility, observations may lag slightly
      behind actual weather.
      7.2.6.2. FMQ-13V2. The wind data readout is only available at the RSU which limits
      access to the information to times when the RSU is manned and ability to contact RSU
      SOF.
7.3. Communications Equipment.
   7.3.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is the AF Weather standard automated
   dissemination system (ADS) which replaced the legacy New Tactical Forecast System (N-
   TFS). It uses desktop computers to transmit and receive data and products from weather
   agencies worldwide via common-user communications. The WF and 26 OWS use ADS to
   disseminate observations, forecasts, advisories, watches and warnings for Randolph to the
   502 ABW/CP, towers, SOFs, MOC, and FTS duty desks. If any agency‘s ADS
   malfunctions, that office should immediately contact the WF for troubleshooting and repairs.
   Any repairs that cannot be performed by the WF will be referred to the AFWA Help Desk
   and tracked by the WF. In the event of an ADS outage, 26 OWS and the WF will pass
   watches, warnings and advisories to the 502 ABW/CP and applicable agencies by phone or
   fax. The WF will also pass observations to the tower/SOF by phone (paragraph 2.5).

Table 7.1. Primary ADS (e.g., JET) Users and Contact Numbers.
Primary                         Phone
MOC                             Hotline / 652-4428

West Tower (and SOF)            Hotline / 652-7255
FAA @ San Antonio Int‘l         Commercial 210-805-5508
   7.3.2. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) Radio. The WF PMSV is assigned frequency 239.8
   MHz. WF personnel can speak directly to aircrews to pass and receive weather information,
   e.g. PIREPs. Aircrews can also contact the WF via phone patch through the 502 ABW/CP
   (DSN 473-4225; Commercial (210) 671-4225). During PMSV outages, the 802 OSS/OSW at
   Lackland (DSN 945-5709; Comm (210) 925-5709) will monitor the [shared] PMSV
   frequency and respond to Randolph PMSV calls. (For Lackland outages, the Randolph WF
   will monitor and answer PMSV calls.)
   7.3.3. LAN. The Local Area Network (LAN) is an essential tool for receiving, transmitting
   and disseminating critical weather information. During LAN outages, WF services will be
   degraded. As needed, the 26 OWS will provide the WF needed products and support by
   alternate means (phone, fax). See paragraph 2.5 for specific backup procedures for services
   provided.
   7.3.4. Telephone. The WF has multiline phones used to receive and relay weather
   information. After advisories, watches and warnings are issued, modified and/or cancelled,
   the WF makes courtesy calls to critical agencies (Table 2.1) to ensure receipt.
 36                                                          12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


   7.3.5. Hotlines. Hotlines are installed between the WF and key agencies for the rapid
   dissemination and exchange of weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the event of
   a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the WF and the following agencies.

Table 7.2. Weather Flight Hotlines.

            WEATHER WATCH, WARNING AND ADVISORY FORMATS

A5.1. General. This tab explains formats and notification procedures for Randolph AFB‘s
weather watches, warnings and advisories.
   A5.1.1. The WF can have two watches valid at one time, which includes the watch issued
   for lightning within 5 NM. This is done so the lightning watch can be issued/cancelled based
   on the potential for lightning. All other criteria will be issued as part of one watch.
   A5.1.2. The WF can have two warnings valid at one time which include warnings issued for
   observed warnings for lightning within 5 NM. This is done so the warnings can be
   issued/cancelled based on when they are observed. All other criteria will be issued as part of
   one warning.
   A5.1.3. The WF can have more than one advisory issued at one time. This is done so each
   criteria can be issued/cancelled based on its potential of occurring or based on if they are
   actually occurring. Watches, forecast warnings and advisories will have an end valid time.
   The end time for observed warnings and advisories will be until further notice (UFN).
   A5.1.4. Anytime a watch, warning or advisory is upgraded, downgraded or extended, the
   weather technician will append the appropriate remarks.              Watches can be
   upgraded/downgraded by another watch or warning. Warnings can be upgraded/downgraded
   by another warning or downgraded to an advisory. Advisories can be upgraded/downgraded
   by another advisory or upgraded to a warning. Examples follow:
      A5.1.4.1. The current watch is for winds > 35 knots, but less than 50 knots. The
      technician now believes that the potential for 55 knots more accurately describes the
      conditions expected. So a new watch is issued with the remarks, ―This watch upgrades
      weather watch MM-NNN‖.
      A5.1.4.2. Adding hail > 1/2 inch to an existing warning for winds > 35 knots, the body
      of the new warning will include the remarks, ―This warning upgrades weather warning
      MM-NNN‖.
      A5.1.4.3. The weather technician does not believe the warning for winds of > 35 knots is
      accurate, but does believe winds of 30 knots will occur. In this case, an advisory will be
      issued with the remarks, ―This advisory downgrades weather warning MM-NNN‖.
      A5.1.4.4. An observed advisory is valid for light rime icing. Numerous reports of
      moderate icing have been passed to the weather technician. The technician will issue a
      new advisory with the remarks, ―This advisory upgrades weather advisory MM-NNN‖.
A5.2. Randolph AFB header for watch, warning or advisory format. Each watch, warning
and advisory will contain the following elements in order of transmission:
   A5.2.1. Header.    The Header will include location, type (watch/warning/advisory) and
   number.
 50                                                        12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012


      A5.2.1.1. Watches, warnings and advisories will have a separate numbering system and
      will be formatted as MM-NNN. The first two digits (MM) will signify the month, and
      the last 3 digits (NNN) will signify the watch, warning or advisory number. Example:
      The second advisory for the month of November would be 11-002.
      A5.2.1.2. It is possible to have a watch, warning or advisory out at the same time with
      the same number. The key in determining the difference is the header. See the headers
      in A5.2.1.1, A5.2.3.1, A5.2.3.2 and A5.2.4.1 for examples.
   A5.2.2. Valid time in UTC and local time.
   A5.2.3. Body of warning/watch.
   A5.2.4. Weather Watch Example. Here is an example of a weather watch:
      A5.2.4.1. RANDOLPH AFB WEATHER WATCH 09-002
      VALID 05/1100Z (05/0600L) TO 05/1500Z (05/1000L)
      THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AT RANDOLPH
      AFB. SEVERE STORMS CAN PRODUCE WINDS > 50KTS AND HAIL > 3/4 INCH
      DIAMETER. A WARNING WILL BE ISSUED IF CONDITIONS WARRANT.
   A5.2.5. Weather Warning Example. Here are examples of a forecast weather warning and
   an observed weather warning, respectively:
      A5.2.5.1. RANDOLPH AFB WEATHER WARNING 09-003
      VALID 05/1300Z (05/0800L) TO 05/1400Z (05/0900L)
      SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH WINDS > 50 KNOTS AND HAIL > ¾ INCH AT
      RANDOLPH AFB. THIS WEATHER WARNING SUPERCEDES WEATHER
      WARNING #09-002. WEATHER WARNING #09-001 AND WEATHER WATCHES
      #09-002 AND #09-004 REMAIN IN EFFECT. A TORNADO WARNING WILL BE
      ISSUED IF CONDITIONS WARRANT.
      A5.2.5.2. RANDOLPH AFB WEATHER WARNING 10-004
      VALID 19/1921Z (19/1421L) TO UFN (UFN)
      LIGHTNING OBSERVED WITHIN 5NM OF RANDOLPH AFB.
   A5.2.6. Weather Advisory Example. Here is an example of a weather advisory:
      A5.2.6.1. RANDOLPH AFB WEATHER ADVISORY 09-024
      VALID 18/1714Z (18/1214L) TO UFN (UFN)
      ITS CONDITION CAUTION IN EFFECT.
A5.3. Dissemination. The WF leverages a pyramid notification system to promptly disseminate
weather advisories, watches and warnings. The WF or 26 OWS initiate the process by issuing,
disseminating, canceling, or extending an advisory, watch, or warning over ADS. Upon
receiving the advisory, watch, or warning via ADS, the 502 ABW/CP will disseminate the
warning via the Emergency Notification System (ENS) to other agencies on Randolph AFB.
Each organization is responsible for internal dissemination.
12FTWI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                    51


When ADS is inoperable, the WF and 26 OWS will use a telephone line to transmit advisories,
watches and warnings. See Table A5.1. for backup voice dissemination list. See Attachments
9 and 10 for the dissemination pyramids.

A5.4. Backup Calls. To verify receipt of issues, extensions, or cancellations of watches,
warnings and advisories, the WF will courtesy call critical agencies for all advisories, watches
and warnings issued by the WF or 26 OWS. 26 OWS also calls the 502 ABW/CP to verify
receipt. Agencies called for verification of receipt are noted in Table A5.1

Instructions/Procedures. Using sustained wind speed and temperature, determine wind chill
and danger zone. Wind chill temperatures 0oC/32oF and below pose frostbite risk and fall in
CAUTION zone. More severe chill conditions with risk of frostbite in 30 minutes or less fall in
DANGER zone. WF determines/reports wind chill indices falling in Caution or Danger zone to
SOF; SOF determines applicability for aircrews. Aircrew members should monitor physical
condition and not exceed safe mission accomplishment thresholds. Charts provide only
recommended exposure limits.
