                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. The Privacy Act (PA).
   1.1.1. Regulates collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of PII.
1.2. The purpose of the PA is to:

   individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy.
   1.2.2. Limits unnecessary collection of information about individuals.
1.3. Personal Information:
   1.3.1. DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program defines Personal

   or describes him or her, e.g., a social security number; age; military rank; civilian grade;
   marital status; race; salary; home/office phone numbers; other demographic, biometric,
   personnel, medical, and financial information, etc. Such information is also known as
   personally identifiable information (i.e., information which can be used to distinguish or
   trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of
   birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, including any other personal information
   which is linked or linkable to a specified individual).‖
1.4. Non-Compliance Penalties:
   1.4.1. As a federal employee, you are entitled to full protection and rights established by the
   PA. In addition to being protected by this act, federal employees who work with government
   records containing PII are responsible for carrying out requirements of the PA.
       1.4.1.1. The importance of these responsibilities is evident from criminal penalties
       imposed on federal employees who violate certain sections of the law.
   1.4.2. An individual may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and fined no more than $5,000
   for:
       1.4.2.1. Maintaining a PA system of record that has not been published in the Federal
       Register.
       1.4.2.2. Making an unauthorized disclosure.
       1.4.2.3. Obtaining access to PA information under false pretenses.
   1.4.3. Injured parties may file a civil lawsuit against the AF for failing to comply with the
   PA.
