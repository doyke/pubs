                                             INTRODUCTION

1. This handbook has been prepared for the air traffic controller using the Programmable Indicator Data
Processor (PIDP). Included in this handbook are the necessary operating instructions for the system and
the effect on the air traffic control environment.

2. The increased performance of the AN/TPX-42, resulting from installation of the PIDP, will permit a
reduction in the amount of voice coordination required. The PIDP will increase system efficiency by
allowing a controller to spend more time sequencing the traffic flow and less time on repetitive ATC
communications.

3. The PIDP, when integrated with an ATC radar, provides a symbolic and alphanumeric display.

4. The PIDP provides:

         a. Synthetic alphanumeric data in addition to the display provided by the AN/TPX-42. The
alphanumeric data presented is of two types: a track format affixed to all beacon video replies and a
tabular presentation of auxiliary data. As a minimum, the track format consists of a position symbol
coincident with the beacon video. A full track format consists of a position symbol, leader, and a four-
line data block containing aircraft identification, reported beacon code or aircraft type, reported altitude,
aircraft class, ground speed, fixes, and a controller message. The tabular presentation of auxiliary data
consists of operating parameter information, arrival/departure/en route data, drop/suspend data, and
preview area data.

         b. Processing of target reports in response to Mode “1”, “2”, “3/A”, or “C”. Two hundred
targets can be tracked simultaneously with automatic or manual (controller-initiated) track acquisition.

WARNING: TPX-42 defruiter must be on to display targets replying on Mode “C” only.

        c. Receipt of abbreviated NAS flight plans.

        d. Recognition and identification of reflected targets.

        e. Intra- or inter-facility handoff of tracked aircraft.

        f. Special code detection and display of alarm features for all 7700 (emergency), 7600
(communications failure), and 7500 (hijack) target reports. This feature may be inhibited for targets
outside the facility auto-acquire area by master keyboard entry.

        g. Capability for controller to view the full track format of a specified target, or all tracked targets
at any other active indicator positions. This function is called “quick-look”.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                27

       h. Manual suppression of displayed data via controller-initiated keyboard entries as follows:
Non-select targets outside the facility conflict alert area, selected data categories within the Operational
Parameter List, display of Arrival/Departure/En Route and Drop/Suspend Lists, and selected data
elements within the target format.

        i. Automatic suppression or blanking of displayed data during data overload conditions.

        j. Off-centering of display sweep and cursor origin.

        k. Two keyboards per indicator which can function simultaneously. This provision enables one
controller to “work” active traffic and another controller to perform flight data entry/modification,
handoffs, etc.

       l. Assigned altitude monitoring of selected tracked targets for a deviation of 300 feet or more
from assigned or present altitude.

          m. Detection of “out-of-limits” conditions which result in an audible and visual alarm (associated
with the offending target format) when a tracked target is at or below a preset, site-adapted, minimum
altitude limit.

        n. Capability to display the bearing/range between any two positions on the indicator. If the first
point corresponds to the position of a track, time-to-fly to the second point is also displayed.

        o. Capability for the controller to accept or reject a beacon code change.

        p. Detection of conflict alert conditions between a tracked target and another target resulting in
audible and visual alarms for as many as ten scans or until the conflict is resolved.

        q. Send and receive local flight plans to FLIPS.

         r. Can receive secondary target messages from the ARTCC if the radar is not functioning. This
feature requires a “box” to generate the sweep and timing for the PIDP.

       s. Up to three uncontrolled emergency tracks will have their bearing and range displayed in the
OP List to aid controllers in locating them.

        t. Capability of a controller to inhibit the display of tracks owned by another indicator. This
function is called “quick-look inhibit”.

        u. Capability to rotate the leaders of targets individually to relieve data block overlaps.

        v. The PIDP version number can be displayed in the preview area if requested.
28                                                                             AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

       w. Local flight plans having duplicate ACID’s and/or beacon codes will be accepted under the
same guidelines used for NAS duplicates.

        x. A flight plan can be displayed as a data block over a satellite airport indicating the airport is in
use for an IFR operation.

        y. The indicator ID letter can be displayed in the preview area if requested.

        z. A satellite airport closed for IFR operations can have a special symbol displayed on the
indicator. Up to six airports can be designated at one time.

        aa. Trail dots can be displayed on all targets within the auto-acquire area or on tracked targets
only.

       bb Can check the MSAW altitude in a particular area of the display by keyboard command.
The value will be printed in the preview area.

        cc. Validation of the MSAW alarm function.

        dd. Position Sign On.

        a. The data processing group which consists of a computer, floppy disk drive, two 486
computers, and modems (when interfaced with the NAS or Japanese ACC). One of the 486 computers
is the system console, and the other one is to run the FLIPS program. The system console at the
Japanese sites, will have installed a Sync/Async Dual Channel Communication Card to interface the PIDP
and Japanese Centers. The computer will drive up to 16 indicators.

        b. OD-153/T indicator group which consists of a display, indicator control box, <PEM>, and
one or two keyboards.

AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                  33

SECTION II - CONFIGURATION

1-8     Single Processor System

PIDP facilities have a single MV-7800XP processor with up to 16 indicators.

1-9     External Interface

        a. Systems, interfaced with a FAA ARTCC, allow the controller to perform interfacility handoffs.
Flight plan information is received from the ARTCC. When a departure becomes airborne, a departure
message is automatically sent to the NAS system making manual entry on the FDS unnecessary.
CENRAP provides secondary targets from the Center’s radar to be displayed when the Air Force radar
is inoperative. The FAA is the circuit manager for the interface that connects PIDP to the NAS system.

        b. Systems, interfaces with a Japanese ACC, allow the controller to perform interfacility
handoffs. Flight plan information is received from the ACC. When a departure becomes airborne, a
departure message is automatically sent to the Japanese system making manual coordination
unnecessary.

1-10    Terminal Interface

Systems, interfaced with ARTS or other PIDP facilities, permit the controller to perform semi-automated
handoffs with those facilities. Up to four different PIDP/ARTS may be interfaced with one PIDP facility.
Each of these adjacent terminal facilities will be assigned a number for handoff identification purposes.
Each of these adjacent terminal facilities may have up to four different fix pairs, which will be assigned a
letter (A-D) for handoff identification purposes. Each PIDP facility interfaced with ARTS may handoff to
a specific sector of the ARTS. Each ARTS sector will be assigned a letter (A-Z) for handoff
identification purposes.

1-11    FLIPS Interface

The FLIPS interface allows facilities to enter local and training flight plans and print strips. Flight plans
and local tracks started on the PIDP will be forwarded to FLIPS for storage and a printed strip if
desired. Training strips created on the FLIPS and forwarded to PIDP will be assigned current time and
be sent only to displays designated as training. (If there are no training displays designated, the training
flight plans will be ignored.) Certain reports can be generated using the FLIPS. Flight plans initiated on
the PIDP may not be retained by PIDP. They will be forwarded to FLIPS, and FLIPS will send them
to PIDP at a set parameter before activation time. Flight plan information received by PIDP from
Japanese ACC will be forward to FLIPS for storage and strip printing.
34                                                                               AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

1-12       Facility Configuration

During installation of PIDP, the system’s hardware is configured according to the total number of displays
installed. These displays are identified by letter designators. The letter designators are used for the
following:

        a. As a position symbol for a controlled tracked target on non-controlling displays. If the
position symbol is A, indicator A controls the target.

         b. As a designator during a handoff sequence. The handoff message will specify a from/to
relationship using letter designators.

           c. For identifying the display for configuration of arrival, departure, en route, and the master
display.

           d. For special functions such as quick look and diagnostic testing.

1-13       Arrival-Departure-En Route-Training Designation

Flight plan data will be sent to all displays regardless of the type (arrival, departure, or en route) and
display AR, DE, or EN. “Training” will receive all training flight plans regardless of type. When the
program is loaded or restarted, all displays will be designated AR, DE, and EN. Indicators may then be
designated, with the reconfiguration command, to have any combination or none of these three functions.
The training designation overwrites the others.

1-14       Master Designation and Display Functions

The display that has supervisory control is the master. When the program is loaded or restarted, the first
active display will be designated as the master. The master has the following special features:

       a. Must enter the barometric pressure followed by the year, month, day, and time when the
program is first loaded or restarted.

           b. Can change the barometric pressure.

           c. Can change mode of operation to live or simulation.

           d. Can initiate a “master message” that is displayed on all indicator groups.

           e. Can modify A/D entry time.

           f. Can modify the day and time.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                35

        g. Can enter or delete up to eight arrival-departure display ID(s)/ beacon code blocks/call sign
prefixes for auto track functions.

        h. Can turn the auto track function on or off.

        i. Can reconfigure master, arrival, departure, and en route displays.

        j. Can enter, change or delete a code or code block to be exempted from MSAW processing.

        k. Can enter, change or delete a code or code block to be excluded from conflict alert
processing.

        l. Can enter, change or delete the altitude, range and number of sweeps for conflict alert limits.

        m. Can purge all NAS flight plans.

        n. Can modify NAS and PIDP IDs.

        o. Can restore the data base from FLIPS.

        p. Can inhibit the FLIPS interface so the FLIPS program can be loaded/ reloaded.

       q. Cannot be placed in diagnostic test mode until the master function is reassigned unless there is
no operational NAS interface and no other indicators active.

        r. Can put another display in diagnostic test mode.

      s. Is automatically reassigned to the first active non-training display when the master indicator
becomes inactive.

        t. If a display becomes inactive, the master can reassign control of all tracks o     wned by the
inactive display to any active display. Special local flight plans, which have been entered using the TRK
key, will also be reassigned by the master.

        u. Can inhibit emergency track start outside the auto-acquire limits.

        v. Cannot be designated as a training display.

        w. Can turn the CENRAP feature on or off. CENRAP not available on systems interfaced with
           Japanese ACC.

     x. Can turn the automatic code change feature on or off.

1-15    Keyboard Functions

The keyboard keys correspond to the types of functions:

       a. The first group, colored white, contains the alphabet and numeric block of keys. Some of the
alphabet keys have a dual purpose and are also used to specify tabular display areas. Certain keys in the
numeric block are also used to define leader/format direction.

        b. The second group, colored yellow, contains the format control keys, data entry identifiers,
track control, editing keys, entry and terminator keys, and track and special (SPEC) keys.

        c. A dimmer control is used to provide variable illumination of the keyboard keys.

1-16    Position Entry Module

The <PEM> trackball controls the movement of ⊕ or ° on the indicator screen. The ⊕ or ° moves in
the direction that the trackball is moved. The ⊕ or ° and the push buttons on the OD-153/T located
near the trackball are used to:

        a. Define a particular target when the ⊕ and HOOK key are used.

        b. If the <PEM> is not located directly over a target, HK will appear in the preview area.

      c. Specify a position on the indicator to which the sweep origin will be moved when the ⊕ and
the HOOK key are used.

      d. Specify a position on the indicator to which the cursor origin will be moved when the ⊕ and
the HOOK key are used.

    e. If cursor or sweep needs to be moved to a point where an aircraft is currently located, the
HOOK key can be pressed, while the ⊕ is away from the target, then moved to the needed position.

        f. Specify where one of the tabular areas is to be moved when the ° and the MOV keys are
used.

        g. On the OD-153/T only, change the bearing of the cursor when BEARING ON is illuminated.

        h. On the OD-153/T only, change the range of the range strobe on the cursor when STROBE
ON is illuminated.

1-17    Indicator Control
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                        37

The indicator control replaces the TPX-42 control indicator C-8625/T (commonly known as the “A-
BOX”). Since code filtering and altitude filtering are now done via the keyboard, the new control box
performs only the following functions:

       a. Selection of mode interface, “1C”, “2C”, or “3C”, and mode readback from the TPX-42.

       b. TPX-42 system performance, visual warning and audible alarm.

       c. Bracket and character (format) intensity controls.

      d. Computer engage/disengage to electrically connect or disconnect the display to/from the
computer.

       e. Bracket video ON/OFF switching.

       f. Lamp intensity control for the lamps of the control box and <PEM> push buttons.

       g. Lamp test for the lamps of the control box and <PEM> push buttons.

1-18   Indicators

Two types of indicators are used in the PIDP. The first is a modified version of the existing TPX-42,
OD-58A/T, and the OD-152A/T. The second is the OD- 153/T which replaces the existing OD-69/T
indicator used with the FPN-47/GPN- 20 radar.

1-19   Indicator Group OD-152A/T

The OD-152A/T has the same front panel controls and layout as the OD-58A/T and all the controls
function the same except:

      a. The sweep and cursor are now off-centered by means of the keyboard/ <PEM> when the
computer is engaged.

       b. Character size is fully adjustable.

1-20   Indicator Group OD-153/T

1. The OD-153/T has a front panel layout similar to the OD-152A/T and has the following special
features:

       a. Fully adjustable character size.
38                                                                         AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

       b. Cursor and sweep off-centering by means of the keyboard/<PEM> when in engaged or
disengaged mode.

       c. Cursor bearing and range strobe controlled by the <PEM> trackball.

2. Table 1-1 lists the controls of the OD-153/T and the functions they perform.

SECTION IV - DATA AREAS

1-21   Introduction

Data areas are used to display keyboard, system, and tabular data on the PIDP indicator and consist of:

       a. Preview Area.

       b. Operational Parameter (OP) List.

       c. Drop/Suspend (D/S) List.

       d. Arrival/Departure (A/D) List.

NOTE: Should any of the data areas be placed partially off screen, display off screen blanking will
remove every other line from view. At a dual keyboard indicator, the MOV function can only be
accomplished with one keyboard providing input. Simultaneous use of the keyboards prior to completing
the MOV function will result in the <PEM> symbol being displayed in a reversed format from that
described in paragraph 1-16 (circle displayed when square should be displayed). This can also result in
an erroneous <PEM> position being transmitted to the computer. Should this condition occur, it can be
corrected by disengaging and engaging the indicator control box.

1-22   Preview Area

The preview area (Figure 1-1) displays the keyboard messages entered by the air traffic controller and
permits editing of the data prior to entering it into its processor. Each keyboard may enter up to 39
characters into the preview area. A flight plan initiate key sequence may contain up to 45 characters.
(They will not all be displayed at the same time.) Though normally located at the bottom center of the
indicator, either preview area may be moved by the key sequences: MOV <PEM> P

       a. System time (day/hour/minute/second), barometric pressure, and altitude filter limits (lower
and upper) displayed on line one.

         b. Cursor and range strobe readouts for the OD-153/T only are displayed on line two.

         c. Codes or code blocks selected by the air traffic controller (and therefore becoming SEL class
targets) are displayed on line three.

        d. The next code of next code blocks which have been set up by the air traffic controller are
displayed on line four. Up to three uncontrolled, unacknowledged emergency’s bearings and ranges will
be displayed on the line instead of the next codes as applicable.

         e. A 20-character master message is displayed on line five. A 20-character indicator message is
displayed on line six. The current load number and site ID (a 15-character master message) is displayed
during initialization and remains until dropped by the master display. Airport data or emergency airport
data requested via keyboard from FLIPS will be displayed in place of the master and display messages
until cleared by keyboard action.

       f. Overload conditions (Tables 1-2 and 1-3) as well as operator indications such as quick look
and emergency status are displayed on lines seven and eight.

1-23-2            Altitude Filter Control

The altitude filter command allows the controller at a particular display to enter altitude limits for that
display. This will inhibit the display from receiving untracked targets (except for special reply codes) that
are outside the limits set. This feature is similar to that of the altitude filter on the TPX-42’s A-Box.

EXAMPLE:

Command           Limits          Execute         Remarks


OP                100 /\ 180      ENTER           Receive all tracked and special code targets plus
                                                  untracked targets between 10,000 and 18,000 feet.

Special Requirements:

1. When the system is first activated, the limits are automatically set for 000-999.

2. The lower altitude limit must be inserted first. All three digits for each limit must be used.

Results:

The altitude limits entered will appear in the display’s OP List (line one) after “A”. Now, the only targets
outside these set limits that will be displayed are those tracked or quick looked by this display, those
uncontrolled tracks for which this display is a possible owner, and those targets on special reply codes.
Those targets without Mode “C” will be forced through, and have a non-select or select symbol only if
untracked.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                     Preview

Altitude limits entered in the wrong order - upper limits entered first.    “INVALID!”

1-23-3            Override/Reinstate The Altitude Filter

The AA command allows the controller of an individual display to override the altitude filter limits for the
display and thereby view all targets regardless of altitude. To reinstate the filter limits, the AA command
is repeated. Those targets not reporting Mode “C” will have their non-select or select symbol only.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                   49

EXAMPLES:

Command          Remarks

AA               Override filter limits on controller’s display.

AA               Reinstate filter limits on controller’s display.

Special Requirements:

This command is a flip-flop (on-off, off-on) type command. The first time it is entered, it will override the
filter limits. The next time it is entered, it will reinstate the altitude filter limits.

Results:

The first time the command is entered, any altitude limits the controller has displayed will be replaced by
“AA” in line one of the OP List. The next time the command is entered, the controller’s display will
reinstate the set altitude filter limits. Then the only targets outside the set limits that will be displayed are
those tracked or quick looked by the display, those uncontrolled tracks for which the display is a possible
owner, and those targets on special reply codes.

Errors: None.

1-23-4           Select Code Control

The select code command allows the controller of a particular display to select codes or code blocks of
targets and to allow the control of formats, independent of the tracked and non-selected targets. Further
explanation of the selected target category is contained in paragraph 1-29. This feature is similar to the
code thumbwheels of the TPX-42’s A-Box.

                                                 display.

Special Requirements:

1. The code blocks entered must be beacon code values (0-7).

2. Only one code or code block at a time may be entered.

3. A maximum of five codes/code blocks may be selected.

Results:

If all the requirements have been met, the code/code block selected will appear in the controller’s OP
List. Targets with this code or within this code block will now be displayed in the general select format
currently set on the display. If the controller drops a code or code block from selected status, the value
entered will be dropped from the display’s Select Code List; and all targets of that code or code block
will now be in non-select format.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                 Preview

1-23-5          Message Control

The message control command allows each controller to display comments such as weather data and
NOTAMs in the message area of the display. It also allows the controller of the master display to place
messages on all PIDP displays. The 20-character master message is displayed on line 5 of the OP List
message area; the 20-character indicator message is displayed on the line following the master message.
The master and display messages can be overwritten by airport data requested from FLIPS. When the
airport data is removed, the master and display messages will be restored.

EXAMPLES:

Command         Message                          Execute          Remarks


SPEC MSG        WEATHER ADVISORY                 ENTER            To enter a master message.

SPEC MSG                                         DROP             To delete a master message.

OP MSG          ILS OUT                          ENTER            To enter a display message.

OP MSG                                           DROP             To delete a display message.

Special Requirements:

1. During initialization, the current load number is displayed as a 15- character master message. This
message may be dropped through normal master keyboard sequence. Messages entered before the load
message is dropped are displayed immediately following the load message.

2. If the controller enters a master message, this message will be displayed on all indicators.

3. A maximum of 20 characters is allowed for each message. If more than 20 are used, the message will
be cut short after 20 characters are in the message area. If the message area is full, no more messages
may be entered until the current message is deleted/dropped.

4. When the master message is dropped, it is deleted from all displays.

5. Messages (both master and display) must be dropped before they can be changed.

Results:

A message will appear in the message area of the OP List on the display. The master message will be in
the OP List of all displays. An indicator message will be displayed on the line following the master
message in the OP List of a single display. If the master message is dropped, the display message will

remain until dropped. New master or display messages entered while airport data is being displayed will
not be displayed until the airport data is removed.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                    Preview

Message line already contains 20 characters prior to this entry.          “NO ROOM!”

1-23-6          Set System Barometer

The barometric pressure command allows the controller of the master display to enter a new barometric
pressure. This will automatically correct all Mode “C” altitudes that are below the transition altitude and
has the same function as the switches on the TPX-42’s B-Box. To ensure the system starts with the
current setting, the barometric pressure must be entered prior to the date and time when the system is
initialized.

EXAMPLE:

                Set
Command         Barometer       Execute          Remarks


SPEC            29 /\ 83        ENTER            Set system barometer to 29.83

                29 /\ 96        ENTER            Enter barometric pressure at initialization.

Special Requirements:

Command must be entered at the master display.

Results:

         This command will change the system barometric pressure to the newly input one. The altitude
correction factor will be changed to the new value. The new barometric pressure will appear in the OP
List of all displays except those having the barometric readout inhibited.

1-23-7          Change System Time

This command allows the controller of the master display to change the day and time.

EXAMPLE:

Command         Set Time                 Execute         Remarks


SPEC            18 /\ 20 /\ 30           ENTER           Set day to 18; hour to 20; minute to 30.

Special Requirements:

1. Command must be entered at the master display.

2. Any change to the system time resets seconds to zero.

3. Care must be taken to consider the effect of large changes in system time on the handling of flight plans
and the A/D List entries with times near or between the new and old system times.

4. Where a time change will take the date to a new month due to a power failure, initialization of the
system must be accomplished (See paragraph 3-5).

Results:

The result is to set the clock in the system to the newly entered time. The new time immediately appears
in the OP List of all displays except for those displays currently inhibiting the time. The seconds are reset
to zero.

1-24      Drop/Suspend (D/S) List

1. The Drop/Suspend (D/S) List, shown on the left-hand side of Figure 1-3, consists of a list of tracked
targets which have been removed from the display by controller intervention (suspended) or which have
stopped reporting for more than four consecutive antenna scans (dropped). Up to ten dropped or
suspended targets may be displayed in the D/S List. The D/S List displays a numeric character (1-0) to
indicate the line number, the target’s <ACID>, the target’s beacon code, and a S or D to indicate
whether it is a suspended (S) or dropped (D) target. Though normally located at the left center of the
indicator, the D/S List may be moved about the display at the controller’s discretion by performing the
key sequence: MOV <PEM> D.

2. If a controller wishes to inhibit the display of the D/S List or redisplay it after it has been inhibited,
perform: D ENTER.

NOTE: When display of the D/S List is inhibited, the alarm “DS” will appear in the OP List.

3. Non current or unusable data may be deleted from the D/S List using any of the following methods:

1-25    Arrival/Departure (A/D) List

1. The Arrival/Departure (A/D) List shown on the right-hand side of Figure 1-3 consists of a listing of
aircraft scheduled to arrive or depart or proceed en route. Indicators which have been designated as
training displays will have only training flight plans in their A/D Lists, and non-training displays will not
have any training flight plans. The abbreviated flight plan appears in the A/D List five minutes prior to
arrival or departure. This amount of time may be changed by keyboard sequence (paragraph 1-25-7).
Up to ten arrivals, departures, or en routes may be displayed. The A/D List displays an alpha character
(A-J) to indicate the line number in the A/D List, the arrival or departure time, an A, D, or E to indicate
whether it’s an arrival (A), departure (D), or en route (E), the targets <ACID>, and the assigned beacon
code. The A/D List is normally located at the right center of the indicator screen. The A/D List may be
moved about the indicator at the controller’s discretion by performing the key sequence: MOV <PEM>
A.

2. The controller may, if so desired, suppress the A/D List. To do this, perform the key sequence: A
ENTER.

NOTE: When display of the A/D List is inhibited, the alarm “AD” will appear in the OP List.

3. To redisplay the A/D List, the above command is repeated.

4. Duplicate ACIDs and beacon codes are allowed under the following conditions:

         a. Beacon Codes: One flight plan and one track can be entered. When a duplicate situation
exists, a flashing virgule (/) will be displayed after the beacon code in the track data block and a steady
virgule immediately before the beacon code in the A/D List. Either the flight plan or the track must be an
arrival and the other a departure. They cannot be the same.
62                                                                               AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

         b. ACIDs: There can be one arrival track and up to two departure flight plans with duplicate
ACIDs. If there are two departures, the departure fixes must be different. When a duplicate situation
exists, a steady virgule will be displayed in the eighth character position of the call sign.

       c. A local flight plan or track can be a duplicate of another local flight plan or track only, and
NAS flight plans can duplicate only another NAS originated one.

5. Should a duplicate discrete beacon code or duplicate ACID condition exist, the flight plan entry will
automatically appear in the A/D List regardless of the anticipated activation time if there is room.

1-25-1           Flight Plan Data Entry Procedures

1. Four methods of flight plan entry exist. For those sites where the PIDP is interfaced with NAS, flight
plans are entered on the FDS if available and then sent to the PIDP via the ARTCC.

2. Local flight plans can be initiated on the FLIPS terminal. The flight plans will be sent to the PIDP via
the FLIPS interface. Training flight plans entered on FLIPS can be sent to PIDP. The flight plans will
have the activation time set to current system time by PIDP and will only be sent to displays designated as
training indicators. If no indicators are configured for training at the time training flight plans are received,
the flight plans will not be saved in PIDP.

3. The controller can initiate local flight plans in the system. Procedures paragraph 1-25-2-1 describe
the method a controller can use to initiate, readout, modify, or cancel a PIDP initiated flight plan. Tracks
originating from these local flight plans cannot be handed off to/from the ARTCC via automated means
except ARSA. Local flight plans and tracks initiated, modified, or canceled on the PIDP will be
forwarded to the FLIPS computer. Printed strips are optional.

4. The controller can enter a VFR NAS flight plan from the PIDP keyboard. The flight plan will be sent
to the ARTCC who will initiate a flight plan.. Procedures in paragraph 1-25-2-2 describe the method a
controller can use to initiate the VFR NAS flight plan.

1-25-2           Flight Plan Initiate

1-25-2-1         Local Flight Plan Initiate

The flight plan initiate command allows the controller of any display position to enter data concerning an
impending arrival, departure, or en route into the system. The new flight plan will be forwarded to FLIPS
but will not be retained in the PIDP until approximately fifteen minutes prior to activation time. If the
FLIPS interface is not operational, a maximum of 75 flight plans can be input. On flight plan initiate, a
controller may choose to “control” a flight plan by entering a special keyboard sequence, which uses the
<TRK> key for the terminator instead of the <ENTER> key. The flight plan will be displayed only on the
originating indicator regardless of the system configuration or activation time. When the flight plan auto-

acquires on a target, it will be a controlled track owned by the originating indicator instead of an
uncontrolled track.

Special Requirements:

1. If the <ACID> and/or <CODE> values assigned to the flight plan create a duplicate <ACID> and/or
<CODE>, the criteria in paragraph 1-25.4.a and b must be met.

2. The assigned <ACID> must be at least two characters and the first character alphabetical.

3. Flight plan type, aircraft type, class, time, fixes, and message are optional; and the command may be
terminated at any one of these steps.

4. The flight plan type will default to a departure, and a “D” will be displayed if no value is entered.

5. The flight plan aircraft type will default to no aircraft type if no character is entered.

6. The assigned aircraft type must be at least two characters.

7. The flight plan class (B, F, H, L, T, U, V, or W) will default to no class if no value is entered.

8. The flight plan activation time will default to the current system time if no activation time is entered.
The current time will be displayed in the preview area.

9. The flight plan fixes will default to no fixes if no characters are entered.

10. There must be fewer than 75 flight plans in the system (no FP in the OP List system alarm line). If
the FP is present in the OP List, the flight plan will be sent to FLIPS but will not be in the PIDP until there
is room. If the FLIPS interface is not operational, no more than 75 flight plans can be input.

11. Code 1236 must not be used when initiating a flight plan.

12. If the display has an assigned code block(s), the entering of the <FD> key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or
3) <FD> key will display the next available code of the appropriate code block. The controller may
either enter an <ACID> or a new <CODE>. If the display does not have an assigned code block(s), the
controller must enter the <CODE> first.

Results:

The new flight plan will be entered into the FLIPS system. If the flight plan activation time is close enough
to the system time to be forwarded to PIDP, the flight plan will be forwarded to the system. If the flight
plan activation time is close enough to the current system time, the flight plan will then appear in the A/D
Lists of those displays configured for arrival, departure, or en route sectors. (This assumes that there is
room in the A/D List of those displays.) If the print strips option is on, a strip will be printed.

1-25-2-2         VFR NAS Flight Plan Initiate

The VFR NAS flight plan initiate command allows the controller of any display position to enter a VFR
NAS flight plan from the PIDP keyboard. The new flight plan will be entered into the PIDP system and
sent to the ARTCC. The flight plan will appear in the A/D list with a beacon code of “0000”. The
ARTCC will acknowledge the receipt of the flight plan and will replace the “0000” with a beacon code of
“NNNN”. If a flight plan is not acknowledged by the ARTCC within 32 seconds the “0000” will be
replaced with “FAIL”.

Special Requirements:

1. The flight plan to be modified will appear in the preview area after RD key is entered, provided the
flight plan identifier matches a flight plan in the system, and no other controller is performing any function
on this flight plan.

2. If an A/D tab letter is entered, it must be an entry in the controller’s A/D List.

3. If <CODE> identifier is used, it must be a discrete beacon code.

4. If the activation time entered (new modified time) is more than one hour earlier than the current system
time, the flight plan is assumed for the next day. Example: If the current system time is 18 07:05 and the
new flight plan activation time is 06:04, the flight plan is assumed to be for the next day (19 06:04).

5. If the time is changed to be close enough to the activation time, and there is room in the A/D Lists, the
flight plan will appear in the appropriate A/D Lists. If the FP was already in the A/D Lists, and the time
was modified so it is no longer within the activation time, the flight plan will be deleted from all A/D lists.

6. If the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT keys are used, the next available discrete beacon
code from the appropriate block of codes assigned to the controller’s display will be used as the modified
code. This code will appear in the preview area. (See paragraph 1-57.)

7. If the flight plan type is modified and the flight plan was in the A/D Lists, it will be deleted from the old
lists immediately, and inserted into the new lists (arrival, departure or en route) at the next minute update
unless it is a training flight plan.

8. If the <ACID> or <CODE> is modified, the new value must meet the requirements for valid duplicate
if applicable.

9. Code 1236 must not be used.

10. To delete the class, fixes, message, or aircraft type, spaces will be entered for the field.

Results:

If all special requirements are met, the flight plan will be modified with the new information. Any A/D
Lists containing the flight plan will also reflect the modification. If the time has been modified and the flight
plan becomes activated, it will appear in the appropriate A/D Lists.

1-25-6          Flight Plan Cancellation

The flight plan cancellation command allows the controller of any display to delete a flight plan from the
system as necessary. If a NAS originated flight plan is accidentally canceled, you may use the FDS “RF”
message to have the flight plan transmitted again. If a local, non-training flight plan is accidentally
canceled, you may use the “FF” keyboard command to have the flight plan transmitted again (see
paragraph 1-25-9). You may also use the “SR” keyboard command to have the flight plan transmitted
again and a strip printed (see paragraph 1-25-10). All local and NAS flight plans will be automatically
deleted from the system two hours and five minutes after the flight plan activation time. Local flight plans,
except for training flight plans, that automatically delete will cause a flight plan cancel message to be sent
to the FLIPS.

NOTE: If the flight plan is NAS originated, the message “ARE YOU SURE? (Y/N)” will appear in the
preview area. Press the “Y” key to delete the flight plan. Press the “N” key to retain the flight plan in the
PIDP system.

Special Requirements:

1. The flight plan will appear in the preview area if the identifier entered matches a flight plan in the
system and no other controller is performing any function on this flight plan.

2. The A/D tab letter entered must correspond to one displayed in the controller’s A/D List.

3. The <CODE> identifier, if used, must be a discrete beacon code.

4. The controller MAY cancel an individual NAS initiated flight plan in the PIDP system. The NAS flight
plan must also be canceled via the FDS, if available. A NAS originated flight plan canceled in the PIDP
is not removed from the NAS computer. The flight plan in the NAS computer will remain active until
canceled via the FDS or other coordination with the NAS facility.

Results:

If all special requirements are met, the flight plan identified by the controller will be shown in the preview
area and then deleted from the PIDP system.

SECTION V - TARGET CATEGORIES

1-27    Introduction

1. The PIDP processes and displays four classes of targets:

        a. Non-selected.

        b. Selected.

        c. Tracked.

        d. VFR (1200 codes).

2. Display of two classes, selected (targets selected by beacon code) and non-selected (all other
targets), are similar to that of the TPX-42 in that they consist of beacon code and altitude only. The third
category, tracked, allows for the added capabilities of the PIDP which will be discussed in paragraph 1-
30. VFR aircraft consist of altitude only.

1-28    Non-Selected Targets

1. Non-selected targets are those targets not “selected” by keyboard action. In the basic TPX-42, these
targets were displayed by using the ALL A/C POSN, ALL A/C CODE, and ALL A/C ALT switches on
the A-Box. The symbol for a non- selected target at a particular indicator is a small circle or the letter
designator of the indicator that is tracking that particular target. A two- line data block is attached by a
leader to the non-select target symbol. For untracked targets, the first line is four digits representing the
aircraft’s reported beacon code. For tracked targets at non-controlling positions, the first line (TWA14
in Figure 1-4) contains up to seven alphanumerics representing the aircraft identity <ACID>. The second
line is three digits representing the Mode “C” altitude in hundreds of feet and corrected for local
barometric pressure. The altitude may be replaced with the word “NEG” should the altitude become
negative as a result of barometric discrepancies caused by mis-setting of related airborne altimeters, the
PIDP, or actual flight level below mean sea level. The second line of a tracked target will also contain the
class and ground speed of the track (Figure 1-4). If the target is tracked and is MSAW exempt, either
by code block or by track, the altitude will be followed by a caret “<“ at non-controlling positions. If the
caret is steady, the target is not violating MSAW. If the caret is flashing, the target is violating MSAW
but will not activate the audible alarm. If the target is tracked and is CA inhibited, the altitude will be
followed by a “C” at non-controlling positions. If the “C” is steady, the target is not in conflict alert. If
the “C” is flashing, the target is in conflict with another CA inhibited target. The audible alarm will not be
activated.

2. The altitude, code, class and ground speed may be displayed/inhibited using a keyboard sequence
described in paragraph 1-50. The entire non-select category may also be suppressed using a keyboard
sequence described in paragraph 1-52.

1-29    Selected Targets

1. Selected targets (Figure 1-4) are those targets that are code selected by the air traffic controller. The
controller of a particular indicator may select up to five discrete beacon codes and/or two-digit code
blocks to become selected targets. Codes or code blocks are selected through keyboard action similar
to the code thumb wheels of the TPX-42 A-Box. (See paragraph 1-23-4 for exact keyboard sequence.)

2. The symbol for a selected target is the letter “X”. The remaining portion of the format is the same as
described for the non-selected target in paragraph 1-27. The altitude, code, class and ground speed may
be displayed/ inhibited using a keyboard sequence described in paragraph 1-50. The entire selected
category may be suppressed using a keyboard sequence described in paragraph 1-52.

1-30    Tracked Targets

1. Beacon targets replying on Mode 3/A codes may be tracked, either by automatic acquisition (auto-
acquire) from previously entered flight plan data or through keyboard procedures. Only the track owner
may control track format, initiate track handoff, modify track elements and delete the track. Track
control as used in this sense should not be confused with procedural control of the aircraft. When a target
is auto-acquired by the system, it is displayed at all indicators of the same type (arrivals, departures, en
routes, or training) as an uncontrolled tracked target unless the local flight plan was initiated using the
TRK key as the terminator or there is only one display of the type to view the track. If one of these
conditions is true, the auto-acquired track will be displayed as a controlled track unless it is a training
flight plan auto-acquire. The symbol for an uncontrolled track is either a “P” or an “N,” with a four-line
data block attached to the symbol by a leader (Figure 1-4). Uncontrolled tracks may be a product of
auto-acquires of NAS or locally originated flight plans, special code reports (7700, 7600, 7500), or
auto-track. Uncontrolled arrival and en route tracks originating from a NAS flight plan will have an “N”
as the position symbol. All other uncontrolled tracks will have a “P” position symbol. The first line
(T1234 in Figure 1-4) contains up to seven alphanumerics (the first character must be a letter)
representing the aircraft identity <ACID>. The second line contains four digits representing the aircraft’s
beacon code, alternating with the aircraft type, followed by four character positions. The code may be
followed by a pound sign. The third line contains the aircraft altitude in hundreds of feet (three digits), a
blank space, a left caret, the aircraft class (B for heavy TCAS, F for Boeing 757, H for heavy IFR, L for
TCAS-equipped Boeing 757, T for TCAS, U for heavy OTP, V for VFR, or W for heavy VFR), a
blank space, and the aircraft ground speed (two digits representing ground speed in tens of knots). The
fourth line is an optional message line of up to eight alphanumerics alternating with the airport fixes.

NOTE: Ground speed readout inaccuracies can be expected under various conditions of aircraft position
and maneuvers. Readout should not be relied upon as an absolute value for purposes of traffic spacing.

2. Once the uncontrolled track is displayed, one of the indicators may take control of the track through
keyboard sequence. The controlled track format is now identical to the uncontrolled track format except
that the symbol changes to the letter designator of the indicator that is tracking the target on the non-
controlling displays. (That is indicator A in the format shown in Figure 1-4). The symbol on the
82                                                                            AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

controlling indicator will be a number designating the ID number assigned to the track for this display.
The ID number will be displayed as a value from one through nine (1-9). Track number 10 through 19
will be displayed as a number one through nine enclosed in a circle, i.e., a 2 inside a circle equals track
number 12. Numbers 20 through 29 will be displayed as a number with a box around it, i.e., 4 enclosed
in a box equals track number 24. If a display is controlling more than 29 tracks, the symbol for tracks
number 30 and up will be the letter identifier of the indicator. Individual elements of the four-line data
block may be displayed/inhibited using the keyboard sequence described in paragraph 1-50. The entire
tracked category cannot be inhibited.

3. For manual acquisition, the controller acquires the target by using the <PEM> or the aircraft’s discrete
beacon code. The controller now can enter the assigned <ACID> and any of the optional formats (class,
aircraft type, fix one, fix two, or message).

4. Tracked targets have the following special system features that selected and non-selected targets do
not have:

        a. A tracked target can have its reflections identified with a question mark.

       b. Tracked targets can be altitude monitored. If their altitude deviates by plus or minus 300 feet
from an assigned altitude, the system will initiate audible and visual alarms.

      c. You may handoff a tracked target to an indicator within the PIDP facility, to an adjacent
PIDP/ARTS facility, to a NAS ARTCC, or to a JACC (see paragraph 1-38).

        d. If tracked target reports cease, the track data block position will be automatically predicted
(Coast - see paragraph 1-44), or held at the last reported position (Hold - see paragraph 1-45).

       e. Audible and visual alarms will alert the controller if the track descends to an altitude at or
below the preset MSAW altitude unless the track is in MSAW exempt status (see paragraph 1-41-1).

       f. Audible and visual alarms will alert the controller when a tracked target is predicted to conflict
with another target unless the tracked targets involved are in conflict alert inhibit or exempt status (see
paragraph 1-49).

         g. If a tracked target’s beacon code changes and only one target with a discrete beacon code or
emergency is found at the track’s position, the track data block will coast for two scans. Then the new
code and original code will flash until the controller decides to accept or reject the code change
(Automatic Code Change - see paragraph 1-48). The automatic code change feature (ON at
initialization) can be turned OFF/ON by a keyboard entry at the master indicator.

        h. Trail dots for tracked targets can be initiated using the TRK D keyboard command.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                 83

5. Tracked targets that are within two miles of the antenna will be placed in dropped status when the
mode “C” altitude is below the minimum altitude for auto-acquire. If the track is within two miles and the
mode “C” is invalid, the track will be placed in dropped status when the ground speed is below 50 knots.
In each case, the track will reacquire if the mode “C” altitude is at or above the minimum altitude for auto
acquire, and if the target reappears between two and six miles from the antenna within 64 scans.

1-30-1           Track Initiate

In order to initiate a track on an aircraft, the controller has four options:

         a. Use of the <CODE> and the RD key, for discrete codes only.

         b. Use of <PEM> trackball and HOOK key for all codes.

         c. Auto-acquire through a PIDP, FLIPS, or NAS initiated flight plan.

         d. Auto track.

1-30-2           Manual Track Initiate

The purpose of the track initiate command is to allow the controller to manually identify a selected or non-
selected target and change it to a tracked target.

Special Requirements:

1. The system will not allow keyboard action (HOOK) on emergency codes (7700, 7600, 7500) that
are questionable (see paragraph 1-55b).

2. After target is captured, the preview area will be blank awaiting further controller inputs.

3. If a beacon code identifier is used, it must be a discrete beacon code.

4. The assigned <ACID> must have at least two characters with the first being an alpha (letter)
character.

5. The assigned aircraft type must have at least two characters.

6. If the controller uses an A/D tab letter as the flight identifier, that letter must appear in the A/D List.
The code for the target must match the code in the A/D List flight plan and must be non-discrete. The
controller cannot do a code read sequence but must use the <PEM> as shown in the second example
above.

7. If the controller uses an <ACID> as the flight identifier, that <ACID> must appear in the Flight Plan
Table. The code for the target must match the code in the flight plan and must be non-discrete. The
controller cannot do a code read sequence but must use the <PEM> as shown in the third example
above. If there is a matching non-discrete code and a different <ACID> is entered, a separate track will
be started leaving the non-discrete flight plan alone.

8. When a track is initiated, it will appear in the track format in use on the controller’s display. If the
controller has the code inhibited on all tracks, the new track will also have its code inhibited.

9. The PIDP can track only 15 targets of the same non-discrete code.

10. A manual track cannot be started with code 1236, 7500, 7600, or 7700.

11. A manual track cannot be started on a target that is already a controlled track in the system.

If all the requirements have been met, the target will become tracked and will appear on the controller’s
display in the current tracked target category format for that display. On non-discrete codes, if a flight
plan A/D letter or <ACID> was used, the flight plan information will be used to start the track; and the
flight plan will be deleted from the system. If the aircraft type and code are to be displayed, the aircraft
type will be time-shared with the beacon code every scan. If fixes and a message to be displayed, the
fixes will be time-shared with the message every scan.

1-30-3            Auto-Acquire Track

1. Auto-acquired (controlled) tracks occur for the following conditions:

          a. The local flight plan was initiated using the TRK key as the terminator.

          b. Only one display is a possible owner of the local flight plan.

          c. Auto track with only one display as a possible owner.

          d. Auto track with a designated owner (paragraph 1-30-4).

2. Auto-acquired (uncontrolled) tracks occur for the following conditions:

       a. A discrete beacon code departure with valid Mode “C” whose flight plan is stored in the
PIDP computer and whose altitude is within the auto-acquire limits.

       b. A discrete beacon code arrival or en route aircraft whose flight plan is stored in the PIDP
computer and whose range is within the auto-acquire limits.

       c. A discrete beacon code departure without Mode “C” which is more than two miles from the
antenna.

        d. An untracked emergency, communications failure, or hijack.

        e. Auto track.

3. Once a track is auto-acquired (uncontrolled), it is now possible for any eligible display to take control
under the following conditions:

        a. Only arrival configured displays may take control of tracks designated as arrivals in the flight
plan or auto tracks outside six miles.

         b. Only departure configured displays may take control of tracks designated as departures in the
flight plan or auto tracks inside six miles.

          c. Only en route configured displays may take control of tracks designated as en routes in the
flight plan.

        d. Displays configured as training displays are not checked for arrival, departure, or en route.
Only training configured displays may take control of tracks designated as training in the flight plan.
Training flight plans will not auto acquire if there are no training displays designated.

        e. If there are no active displays designated as arrival, departure, or en route for an auto-
acquired track of that type, the master display will be in control of the track.

        f. Any display may take control of an uncontrolled emergency, communications failure, or hijack
that does not have an ACID.

         g. Should the auto-acquired track coast out prior to a display assuming control, it will be
assigned to the master display and will appear in the master display’s D/S List. The track may be
repositioned or deleted only from the master display. If this track is repositioned either automatically or
manually (see paragraph 1-30-6), it will be displayed as an uncontrolled track at only the appropriately
configured display(s). Auto tracks will be deleted from the system.

1-30-4          Auto Track

The auto track feature allows controllers to select code blocks that they wish to have automatically
tracked without having to go through manual track start procedures. This is a master indicator function.

        a. To utilize the auto track start feature, a controller selects and enters a start and stop code for
the block desired, the call sign of two to five alpha characters, and/or a specified display ID(s). Up to
eight code blocks can be assigned. The first two digits of the start and end codes must match.

        b. Once the auto track feature is turned on, the system will start a track on all aircraft within the
selected code block as long as:

                (1) There is no track or flight plan with a duplicate code or ACID.

                (2) The aircraft is within the auto-acquire area.

                (3) The aircraft is on a discrete beacon code.

        c. If the aircraft is within six miles of the antenna, only indicators configured as departure scopes
will be able to take control of the auto track aircraft. Outside six miles, only arrival scopes can take
control. If there are no active displays assigned as arrival or departure, the master display will be in
control of the track. Controlled auto tracks will occur if only one display is a possible owner or if the
controller specified an active indicator as an arrival and/or departure owner when the auto track feature
was initiated.

       d. The system starts an auto track by displaying the selected characters with the last two digits of
the code as the aircraft’s call sign. Example: A controller selects code block 2640-2665 with a call sign
of DUKE. An aircraft squawks 2652. The system will display an uncontrolled track with a call sign of
DUKE52.

          e. If an operator deletes a controlled auto track target, the system will start a new track on the
aircraft immediately as long as it is still within the auto-acquire boundaries. The only way to prevent this is
to turn off the auto track function. The system will automatically delete uncontrolled auto tracks that are
in coast mode. (See paragraph 1-43.)

Special Requirements:

1. The system will not auto track start a target outside the auto-acquire area.

2. The system will not auto track start a target within two miles of the antenna that has no mode “C”.

3. The system will not allow a 7700, 7600, or 7500 code block to be entered for auto track.

4. The system will not auto track start a target if there is a track or flight plan with a duplicate code or
ACID.

5. The system will not auto track start code 1236.

6. Command must be entered at the master display.

7. If no arrival display is designated but a departure is, use SPACE to denote no indicator selected.

1-30-5          Track Modify

The purpose of the track modify command is to allow the controller to modify the contents (<ACID>,
<CODE>, aircraft type, class, fix one, fix two, message, or leader direction) of one of the tracked targets
owned by the display. Uncontrolled tracks cannot be modified.

Special Requirements:

1. A tracked target can be modified as long as the assistant controller is not performing any functions on
the target.

2. The beacon code entered must be a discrete beacon code.

3. The beacon code must not be 1236.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                            91

4. Only one type of aircraft identifier may be modified at a time; that is, <ACID> and <CODE> may not
be modified in the same command.

5. Uncontrolled tracks cannot be modified.

6. To delete the aircraft type in a key sequence, one SPACE key entry must be inserted after the SP2
key.

7. To delete the class and message in one key sequence, one SPACE key entry must be inserted after
the CLS and two SPACE key entries after the MSG key. To delete fix1, one SPACE key entry must be
inserted after the <ACID SPACE> key. To delete fix2, one SPACE key entry must be inserted after the
SP3 key.

8. If the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT key is used, the next available discrete beacon code
of a specified code block (except 1236) will be displayed in the preview area, and this value will be the
new code assigned (see paragraph 1-57).

Results:

Those format elements that were modified will be inserted into the track format and displayed on that
track even if previously inhibited.

1-30-7           Track Termination (Delete)

1. The purpose of the track termination command is to allow the controller owning a tracked target to
remove it from tracked status. Under the following conditions, the prompt “ARE YOU SURE?(Y/N)”
will appear in the preview area when attempting to manually delete a track:

          a. The track originated from a NAS departure or en route flight plan.

       b. The track originated from a NAS arrival flight plan, and a handoff to the PIDP has not been
completed.

2. This prompt alerts the controller that all inter-facility handoffs concerning this track have not been
completed. If the controller is sure the track is no longer needed, then the track can be deleted from the
PIDP system by entering a “Y”. Subsequent attempts by another facility to make a handoff to the PIDP
on this track will be automatically rejected. If the controller determines that the track is still needed for
inter-facility handoff purposes, an “N” should be entered; and the PIDP system will retain the track. If a
NAS track is deleted before a handoff is completed and it becomes necessary to restart the track with
the proper flight plan, use the “RF” message on the FDS to force the flight plan back into the PIDP
system. A local track in the D/S List will be automatically deleted from the system after 377 consecutive
antenna scans. A NAS track will not be automatically deleted until the NAS handoff has been
completed.

6. A track from a NAS originated flight plan should not be deleted until all NAS handoff actions are
completed.

Results:

The tracked target identified by the controller will lose its tracked status and become an untracked target.
If it was listed in the D/S List, that D/S entry will be deleted.

SECTION VI - SPECIAL REPLIES

1-32    Introduction

Figure 1-5 illustrates the display of the various special replies permitted by the system. Included are the
identification of position (IP) or special position identification (SPI) replies, emergency (7700 beacon
code) reply, communications failure (7600 beacon code) reply, hijack (7500 beacon code) reply, military
emergency reply, and suspect aircraft (1236 beacon code) reply. Descriptions of these special replies
are provided in the following paragraphs.

1-33    IP And SPI (IDENT)

The IP or SPI (IDENT) target symbol appears as a “shrinking circle”. For all categories of tracks and
targets, detection of an IDENT causes the position symbol to change to the shrinking circle at all indicator
positions at which the target is displayed.

1-34    Emergency, Communications Failure and Hijacks

1. Display of emergency, communications failure, and hijack beacon returns are processed in the same
manner. Detection of these replies for untracked targets (selected or non-selected) causes the system to
display the reply as an uncontrolled tracked target with a three-line data block. The first line is the four-
digit beacon code for the condition detected (7700, 7600, or 7500). The second line is aircraft altitude,
and the last line is a three-letter message specifying the condition detected (EMG, CMF, or HIJ). This
format is displayed at all indicators, the entire format flashes, and an audible alarm sounds. The bearing
and range of the target are displayed in the OP List in place of the next code line. When the emergency
condition is acknowledged or clears, the next code line will be redisplayed. Up the three bearing and
ranges can be displayed. The controller must acknowledge the condition by “hooking” the track and
assigning it an <ACID>. Once this is done, the format will stop flashing and will change to a controlled
track format on the indicator on which the emergency condition was acknowledged; and the audible
alarm will cease. The emergency indication in line four will continue to flash. At all other displays, the P
symbol is replaced with the letter designator of the controlling display, and the data block appears in a
non-selected format with the emergency indicator in line two (see Figure 1-5, sheets 1 and 2). The class
and ground speed will alternately display with the flashing emergency mnemonic. When uncontrolled
emergency track starts are being inhibited, emergency returns outside conflict alert boundaries will be
displayed as shown in Figure 1-5, sheet 3. Also, when the Track Table is full, new emergency returns
will be displayed as shown in Figure 1-5, sheet 3.

2. Detection of emergency, communications failure or hijack replies for a controlled tracked target
causes the system to display the track’s <ACID> with the new beacon code (7700, 7600, or 7500).
The track message line will be preempted by a three-letter message specifying the condition detected
(EMG, CMF, or HIJ) and the original beacon code of the track. This format is displayed only on the
controlling display; the entire full format flashes and the audible and visual alarms are activated on the
indicator control box. The controller may now acknowledge the condition by the sequences:

        <PEM> HOOK or <ACID> RD

3. Once the condition is acknowledged, the alarm is automatically silenced and the full format will stop
flashing, but the emergency message (EMG, CMF, HIJ) and the old and new codes will continue to flash.
At all the other displays, the flashing emergency message will be displayed in the right half of the altitude
line, time-shared with the class and ground speed. An emergency condition (EMG, CMF, HIJ) and code
change must be acknowledged before any handoff can be started. If a handoff is already in progress on
an aircraft that changes to an emergency code, the emergency condition is automatically acknowledged
when the handoff is either recalled or accepted. As long as the tracked target remains in the system, the
visual alarms in the OP List and the indicator control boxes will remain activated. Also see paragraph 1-
55b.

4. Any target exhibiting one of the emergency conditions which coasts into the D/S List will cause the
appropriate visual alarm(s) in the OP List and on the indicator control box to remain on until the target is
deleted from the D/S List. Also see paragraph 1-24.

1-35    Military Emergency

Military emergencies (Figure 1-5, sheet 3) are handled in a manner similar to a civil (code 7700)
emergency. Mode “1” and “2” military emergencies will be received only if an indicator control box in the
PIDP system is set for “2C” or “1C” modes. When a Mode “3” military emergency is detected, the
system will force the beacon code to be 7700. The audible alarm will sound and control procedures are
the same as for a code 7700 emergency. The only difference is that the controller will see four bracket
paints two miles apart. The bearing and range of the unacknowledged, uncontrolled emergency will be
displayed in the OP List.

1-36    Suspect Aircraft

When a suspect aircraft target (code 1236) is detected in the system, a flashing “SA” alarm is inserted in
the OP List. It is impossible to start a manual track on a suspect aircraft, but the PIDP will accept a
handoff from NAS on an aircraft code 1236. If the suspect aircraft is within the range being displayed,
the target will be forced through all filters.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                               101

SECTION VII - SYSTEM FEATURES

1-37    Introduction

This section contains a brief description of system features and applicable keyboard commands.

1-38    Handoffs

1. The purpose of a handoff is to allow the controller to select a track and transfer control responsibility
of that track to another controller at a display in the PIDP facility (intra-facility handoff), or to the
ARTCC or to a Japanese ACC, or an adjacent PIDP/ARTS facility (inter-facility handoff). Only
controlled tracks can be handed off.

2. Intra-facility handoffs can occur only on a tracked target within the PIDP facility, and are initiated by
the controlling display (Figure 1-6). When initiated, the target format will flash on the originating and
destination displays. The track message will be preempted and replaced by HO. The HO will be
followed by the letter designating the destination on the originator’s display and receiver’s display. When
the handoff is accepted, the symbol will change to the track ID number on the controlling display and the
new controlling display’s ID on all other indicators. The format will stop flashing, and the format on the
originator’s display will change to select/non-select. The track fixes and/or message will reappear at the
completion or recall of the handoff. If a track in handoff on point out status from/to the Japanese ACC
can be canceled by the ACC. When this occurs, the message “CANCELED” will appear in the fourth
line of the track data block.

3. Other messages can override the letters designating the handoff destination:

        CONFLICT

        MSAW

        ABV

        BLO

        OLD BEACON CODE DURING CODE CHANGE

4. Inter-facility handoffs with the ARTCC, Japanese ACC, or an adjacent ARTS/PIDP can occur only
with tracks having NAS/Japanese ACC originated flight plans except for ARSA handoffs. Facilities
having PIDP-to-PIDP direct interface must have a track to initiate a handoff to the other facility.

5. On a PIDP departure, the system will auto-acquire the flight plan and send a departure message to
NAS. The controller can take control via keyboard action (see paragraph 1-30-3). If the departure
message is not acknowledged by NAS, a flashing “DM” message will appear in line two following the
102                                                                                AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

beacon code (Figure 1-7, sheet 1). The departure message must then be forwarded by other means
(FDS/FDIO/voice) or the ensuing handoff to ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be rejected. Once the departure
message has been forwarded, “DM” can be cleared from the track’s code line message area via
keyboard action (see paragraph 1-38-7).

6. For examples of inter-facility handoff formats see Figure 1-7. Handing off to ARTCC/Japanese
ACC/ARTS/PIDP causes the track format to flash. The message line will be replaced by “HO AAA”
(AAA being three (3) alpha characters identifying the facility) for PIDP to ARTCC handoff or “HO
AAANN” (NN being two (2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID), if handing off to a specific
sector. The message line will be replaced by “HO AAA” when handing off to ARTS or “HO AAANA”
(NA being one (l) numeric character and one (1) alpha character identifying the sector ID) if handing off
to a specific sector. If the enhanced directed ARTCC/ARTS handoff is flashed other than where the
handoff was originally directed, the handoff message line will alternate flashing the message of where the
controller sent the handoff with where the computer designated the handoff sector. Handoffs to the
Japanese ACC message line will read “HO N/T NN” (N indicating Naha and T for Tokyo followed by
NN being two (2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID).

7. For ARSA handoffs, the message line will be replaced by “HO” “space” “*” “AAA”, (AAA being
three (3) alpha characters identifying the facility). Also, ARSA handoffs can be made to a specific ARTS
sector. For ARSA handoffs to a specific ARTS sector, the message line will be replaced by “HO”
“space” “*” “AAANA”, (NA being one (1) numeric character followed by an optional alpha character
identifying the sector ID). If the sector that you are handing off to does not take the handoff, the message
line will flash “HO *AAANA” indicating what sector you sent the handoff to, with “HO *AAANA”
indicating what sector actually took the handoff. ARSA handoffs cannot be made to a non-host
ARTS/PIDP.

8. When ARTCC/ACC accepts the handoff, the PIDP will change the position symbol to a “Z” and
display the track as far as the auto-acquire boundary before the track is automatically deleted. When
ARTS/PIDP accepts the handoff, the PIDP will change the position symbol to a “Y” and display the
track as far as the auto-acquire boundary before the track is automatically deleted. If the handoff is taken
by other than designated, the message line will display who actually took it in non-flashing format. If
enhanced, the directed ARTS handoff is accepted at a position other than where the handoff was
directed, the track message line will contain “H” “space” “terminal number” “original keyboard subset
number” “original sector identifier” “/” received keyboard subset number” “received sector identifier”.
The position symbol will change to a “N”, and the format will not be flashing. If during the delay an alarm
condition arises, the position symbol will remain an “N”, and the emergency, MSAW, or conflict alert
warning will flash in the data block. The alarm condition can be acknowledged without changing the
delay status. Tracks in inter-facility handoff status from the PIDP to ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be
automatically placed in hold mode (see paragraph 1-45) if beacon reports cease for more than four
consecutive scans. The frozen data block will continue to be displayed in handoff format. This is to alert
the controller that even though PIDP is not actively tracking the aircraft, the inter-facility handoff is still in
progress.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                   103

9. An “IF” appearing in the second line of the track data block after attempting an inter-facility handoff or
after accepting an inter-facility handoff indicates a NAS handoff failure (see Figure 1-7, sheet 1). If a
NAS handoff failure occurs, coordination with the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be required. The handoff to
the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP may be re-attempted. The “IF” can be cleared via keyboard action (see
paragraph 1-38-8).

10. In ARSA handoffs, the system will send a flight plan message to the receiving facility. When the flight
plan message has been acknowledged, the system will automatically send a handoff initiate message. If
the flight plan message has not been acknowledged, a “FP” will appear in the second line of the track
data block (Figure 1-7, sheet 1). The “FP” can be cleared via keyboard action (paragraph 1-38-9).
After the handoff has been accepted, the fixes will display on the message line of the track data block.

11. On an arrival or en route handoff (ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP to PIDP), NAS will send a flight plan (A or
E) prior to the handoff. Selected facilities not having a NAS interface will have handoff capability via a
direct PIDP/PIDP interface. Handoff procedures are the same as for adjacent ARTS/PIDP procedures
except that the receiving facility need not have a local track or flight plan before the handoff is initiated. If
a discrete code flight plan has been received, it will auto-acquire when the target is within the auto-acquire
limit. Controllers should not take track control of auto-acquired NAS arrival/en route tracks until the
automated facility controlling the aircraft initiates a handoff. When the ARTCC initiates a handoff, the
entire track format will flash (Figure 1-7 sheet 2), and the message line will be replaced with “HO AAA”
(AAA being three (3) alpha characters identifying the facility) or if enhanced “HO AAANN” (NN being
two (2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID) if handing off from a specific sector. When
ARTS/PIDP initiates a handoff, the entire track format will flash (Figure 1-7 sheet 2), and the message
line will be replaced with “HO AAA” or if enhanced “HO AAANA” (NA being one (1) numeric
character and one (1) alpha character identifying the sector ID) if handing off from a specific sector. The
controller can now accept the handoff using procedures in paragraph 1-38-3. The format will stop
flashing.

12. Three special designators are also used in the code line message area during an inter-facility handoff,
which are: NAT, OLD, and AMB. These will not be seen at units interfaced with non-FAA facilities.

13. A NAT (not a PIDP track) (Figure 1-7, sheet 2) in the code line message area of an
ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP to PIDP handoff signifies that the PIDP is not receiving a beacon report for that
target. A special situation can arise if an auto-acquired arrival or en route ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP track is
in a display’s D/S List when the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP initiates the automated handoff. In this case, the
track will be taken out of the D/S List and displayed as an uncontrolled NAT track in handoff format at
all arrival or en route displays as appropriate. The ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP will continue to update the
target position; and if the PIDP acquires the beacon target, the NAT will disappear from the code line
message area for a discrete code. If the ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP initiates a handoff and no PIDP target
matches the target being handed off giving rise to a NAT condition, and if the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP stops
updating its position, an OLD will replace the NAT in the target’s code line message area (Figure 1-7,
sheet 2). This will occur if the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP no longer has a valid beacon report on the target.
104                                                                                 AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

14. In an ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP to PIDP handoff, should the position of the target shown by the
receiving PIDP and the position shown by the initiating ARTCC/ ARTS/PIDP differ by more than two
miles, an AMB will be placed in the code line message area of the format (Figure 1-7, sheet 2). This can
indicate a possible problem in either system; and if it persists, maintenance action should be coordinated
with the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP.

15. Point Outs. This paragraph is for Japanese Only. The purpose of a point out is to allow the
controller to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft to another controller if the aircraft will or may
enter the airspace or protected airspace of another controller and radio communications will not be
transferred. Point outs with the Japanese ACC can occur only with tracks having Japanese ACC
originated flight plans. Point outs to/from Japanese ACC cause the track format to flash. The message
line will be replaced by “PO N/T NN" (N indicating Naha and T for Tokyo followed by NN being two
(2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID). When the point out is accepted, the position symbol
will remain the same. The format will stop flashing, except for “PO” which will continue to flash in the
message line right justified (Figure 1-7, sheet 2).

1-38-1          Handoff Initiate

The purpose of a handoff initiate is to allow the controller to identify a target currently being tracked by
that display and attempt to assign the tracking responsibility to another display, an ARTCC, or an
adjacent ARTS/ PIDP facility via the interface. Handoffs may be initiated on tracks in the D/S List.

Special Requirements:

1. A tracked target may be handed off as long as the assistant controller is not performing any function
on the target.

2. Any emergency, communications failure, hijack, MSAW, conflict alert, or altitude monitor violation
must be acknowledged before a handoff can be initiated.

3. If <CODE> is entered as the identifier, it must be a discrete beacon code.

4. A track handed off to the ARTCC or an adjacent NAS terminal facility must have been supported by
a NAS generated flight plan unless it is being handed off via ARSA.

5. The target handed off must be a tracked target owned by the initiator’s display.

6. The destination of the tracked target being handed off must be an active display, a host non-host
ARTCC, or an adjacent NAS terminal facility.

7. A track handed off to the JACC must have been supported by a Japanese generated flight plan.

Results:

The tracked target specified will now be in handoff mode. It will appear in full tracked format on the
destination display and will be flashing on both the originator’s display and the destination’s display. In the
message area of the track data block on the originator’s display will appear HO D (D = destination’s ID).

Errors:

data block, and the handoff is to an adjacent terminal facility, try to initiate the handoff again. The terminal
may not have received its flight plan.

1-38-2           Handoff Recall

The purpose of a handoff recall is to allow the controller to resume responsibility for a tracked target that
is owned by the display and is currently in handoff initiate status, thus canceling the handoff attempt.

EXAMPLES:

Target
Identifier     Capture         Remarks


TWA1234        RD              Identify tracked target by <ACID> and cancel handoff.

2460           RD              Identify tracked target by <CODE> and cancel handoff.

<PEM>          HOOK            Identify tracked target by <PEM> and cancel handoff.

3              RD              Identify tracked target by owner ID number and cancel handoff.

Special Requirements:

1. The <CODE> entered must be a discrete beacon code.

2. The target identified must be a tracked target currently in handoff status.

3. For NAS handoffs, the recall is completed when it is acknowledged by the receiving computer. If the
recall message is not acknowledged by the other computer, the track will remain in handoff status with
“IF” in the data block. The “IF” can be cleared via keyboard action (see paragraph 1-38-8).
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                             111

Results:

The target will stop flashing on both displays. The target will revert to tracked format on the owner’s
display and a non-select or select format on the former destination display.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                    Preview

1-38-3          Handoff Accept

The purpose of the handoff accept command is to identify a target and accept control responsibility either
from another PIDP display, the ARTCC, or an adjacent ARTS/PIDP facility.

EXAMPLES:

Target
Identifier     Capture        Remarks


TWA1234        RD             Identify target being handed off by <ACID> and accept it.

2460           RD             Identify target being handed off by <CODE> and accept it.

<PEM>          HOOK           Identify target being handed off by <PEM> and accept it.

Special Requirement:

1. The handoff will be completed if the target identifier matches a target in the system.

2. For NAS handoffs, the handoff is completed when acknowledged by the sending computer.

3. If <CODE> is entered as the target identifier, it must be a discrete beacon code.
112                                                                                AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

Results:

The destination display has now assumed control of the tracked target. The symbol on the new owner’s
display will be it’s target number. It will appear in tracked format on the new owner’s display and as a
non-select or select target on all others. The flashing will have ceased, and the handoff message will be
replaced by the tracked target’s message. If the target is MSAW exempt by track on the initiator’s
display, this MSAW exemption will be automatically canceled when the receiver accepts the handoff. If
still needed, the destination display must enter the MSAW exempt by track mode.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                       Preview

1-38-4           Point Outs

Paragraphs 1-38-4, 1-38-5 and 1-38-6 are for Japanese Only. The purpose of a point out is to allow
the controller to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft to another controller if the aircraft will or
may enter the airspace or protected airspace of another controller and radio communications will not be
transferred.

1-39      Reflection Discrimination

1. At many ATC sites, reflections of beacon (secondary) targets have become a major problem with
automated systems, such as the ARTS-III and non-PIDP TPX- 42s. Reflections are caused by high
buildings, hangars near the flight line, and other obstructions. These reflections cause the aircraft’s
120                                                                          AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

transponder to squawk when the radar antenna is not pointing at the aircraft. Thus, two targets are
created, one true and one false (see Figure 1-8).

EXAMPLES: The antenna in Figure 1-8 is pointing NW and the path of the radar signal is, hangar - true
target - hangar - antenna. The radar system will place a target at the position of the antenna (NW) and at
a range equal to the true target plus the distance to the reflector.

NOTE: Reflections should not be confused with so-called ring-around (three or more targets) which is
caused by misalignment of the TPX-42, operating on HIPOWER, or a defective airborne transponder.

2. The PIDP will identify only false targets of a true target that is tracked. Reflections will be flagged
provided reflection data has been submitted for your facility. Those targets that are identified as
reflections are displayed as a non-select target with a “?” after the altitude (Figure l- 8).

Special Requirements:

Targets must be tracked for related false targets to be identified.

Results:

False targets will be identified and displayed.

Errors: None.

1-40    Assigned Altitude

1. Each indicator position is capable of performing altitude monitoring by assigned altitude on controlled
tracked targets. By so selecting the target, the system will alert the controller when the target is 300 feet
above or below an assigned altitude level. If a value is not entered when setting the assigned altitude, the
current altitude of the target will be used as the altitude to monitor. When the altitude entered differs from
the current altitude displayed, the assigned altitude will be displayed by time sharing the class and ground
speed positions of the data block every scan. Until the tracked target reaches the assigned altitude, an
up-arrow or down-arrow will be displayed with the assigned altitude indicating whether the track should
be climbing or descending. When the tracked target comes within 300 feet of the assigned altitude, the
time sharing will stop; and an “A” will be displayed in the right half of line two of the data block. If an
invalid Mode C is received (///), the assigned altitude will be time shared on line three of the data block
preceded by an “A”. Should the target exceed the limit in either direction as shown in Figure 1-9, the full
track format begins to flash; and the audible alarm sounds. In addition, the message line in the format is
preempted and replaced with the message “ABV” or “BLO” depending on the direction which has been
exceeded; and the assigned altitude, preceded by an “A”, will time share with class and ground speed.
The three-character message “ABV” or “BLO” appears in the last three character positions. The
controller may now acknowledge the condition by the sequence: <PEM> HOOK, <ACID> RD, or
<Discrete Code> RD.

2. Once the condition is acknowledged, the alarm is automatically silenced and the full format will stop
flashing, but the message “ABV” or “BLO” will continue to flash. An assigned altitude violation must be
acknowledged before any handoff can be started. If a handoff is already in progress on an aircraft that
violates its assigned altitude, the handoff can either be recalled and the violation acknowledged, or
completed and the violation acknowledged by the receiving controller. If the track is deleted, the pilot
corrects the condition, or if the assigned altitude function is dropped, the computer will automatically drop
the visual and audible warning.

1-41      Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW)

1. A low altitude alerting called MSAW is built into the PIDP program. Anytime a tracked target is at or
below the altitude set for that sector, the full track format begins to flash and the audible alarm is sounded,
except for those codes or tracks exempted (paragraph 1-41-1). In addition, the message “MSAW” is
placed in the last four character positions of line four in the data block (Figure 1-9). The controller may
now acknowledge the condition by the sequence: <PEM> HOOK, <ACID> RD, or <Discrete Code>
RD.

2. Once the condition is acknowledged, the alarm is automatically silenced and the full format stops
flashing. The message “MSAW” will continue to flash. An MSAW violation must be acknowledged
before any handoff can be started. If a handoff is already in progress on an aircraft that violates MSAW,
the handoff can either be recalled and the violation acknowledged, or accepted and the violation
acknowledged. If the track is deleted or the pilot corrects the condition, the computer will automatically
drop the visual and audible warning.

Note: See paragraph 1-73 MSAW Readout.

Special Requirements:

Command must be associated with a valid tracked target on that display.

Results:

The result is to set a track exempt from MSAW alarming. A visual indication (a left caret (<) following
the altitude) will be displayed in the data block of the track(s) that are MSAW exempt.
NOTE: If the track in MSAW exemption, either by code block or by track, violates the altitude for
MSAW alarming, the left caret (<) will begin to flash; but no audible alarm will sound. The caret will
continue to flash until the altitude of the track is above the minimum altitude for that MSAW sector
(Figure 1-10). Also, if the target is exempt by track, the exemption will be cleared when a handoff is
accepted on that track. This places the responsibility of MSAW exemption by track on the receiving
display.

1-41-3          MSAW Alarm Verification

This feature will enable the controller to verify that the MSAW Alarm is working. To check the alarm
enter an altitude greater than the MSAW value, and depress ENTER. (If MSAW value for the area
being checked is unknown, move <PEM> to the area enter OP M, the MSAW value of the area
identified by the PEM will be displayed in the preview area of the requesting display.) A target with a
beacon code of 0001 with the input altitude and an ACID of “MSAW CK” appears on the scope
(Figure 1-10). The altitude will descend 100 feet per sweep until it reaches the MSAW altitude and will
alarm for three (3) sweeps, then start ascending until it reaches the input altitude, then it is deleted.

<PEM>         HOOK        253        ENTER      Start MSAW track with altitude of 25300 feet.

Special Requirements:

1. Target area must be within an MSAW zone.

2. Only one MSAW check track can be started in the system at a time.

3. Track should be started above MSAW altitude.

Results:

A target with a beacon code of 0001, the input altitude, and an ACID of “MSAW CK” will appear on
the scope. The track will start descending 100 feet per sweep until it reaches the MSAW value; the
track data block will start flashing with an alarm sounding for three (3) sweeps. The track will ascend to
the input altitude and then be deleted.

1-42       Quick-Look

1. The quick-look command allows a controller to view the full track format of targets that another
display is tracking.

2. The controller shall be able to display the symbol and data block of individual targets being tracked
by other control positions. The targets to be viewed will be designated one at a time.

EXAMPLES:

Command Display Execute Remarks
______________________________________________________________________________

QL             C                      Quick-look tracked targets from display C.

QL                         DROP       Revert to select/non-select format on display C’s tracked targets.

(DEF)                      QL         Quick-look a specific target which is not being controlled by
                                      that display.

Special Requirements:

1. A controller can quick-look only one display at a time.

2. A different indicator can be quick-looked by entering a new quick-look command. It is not necessary
to drop the existing quick-look first.

3. The indicator specified must be active when the command is entered.

4. If a position activates selective quick-look on a specific target and then activates quick-look of the
position owning that track, the track will become a part of the position quick-look.

5. The <DEF> QL command is a flip-flop (on-off, off-on) type.

6. A controller is not trying to quick-look the display that he/she is quick- look inhibiting.

Results:

1. The tracked targets of the indicator the controller is quick-looking will appear in full track format on
the initiating controller’s display. “QL D” will appear in the OP List of that indicator. (D = display ID of
the display being quick-looked). When quick look is dropped, the tracked targets from the indicator the
controller was quick-looking will resume select/non-select format and the QL message in the OP List will

disappear. Quick-looking will not affect the display being quick-looked. If the display being quick-
looked is disengaged, the quick-look status will remain the same until changed by keyboard entry.

2. The individual tracked target the controller is quick-looking will appear in full track format on the
initiating controller’s display. When individual quick-look is dropped, the individual tracked target from
the indicator the controller was quick-looking will resume select/non-select format.

3. A track that is being individually quick-looked by another display will remain in individual quick-look
even after it is handed off to another indicator.

1-43      Quick-Look Inhibit

The quick-look inhibit command allows a controller to inhibit display of the tracked targets controlled by
another indicator.

EXAMPLES:

Special Requirements:

1. A controller can quick-look inhibit only one display at a time.

2. A different indicator can be quick-look inhibited by entering a new quick- look inhibit command. It is
not necessary to drop the existing quick-look inhibit first.

3. The indicator specified must be active when the command is entered.

4. A controller is not trying to quick-look inhibit the display that is currently being quick-looked.

Results:

The tracked targets of the indicator the controller is quick-look inhibiting will not be displayed on the
initiating controller’s display. “QI D” will appear in the OP List of that indicator alternating with “QL D”.
(“D” equals the display ID of the display being quick-look inhibited.) When quick-look inhibit is
dropped, the tracked targets from the indicator the controller was quick-look inhibiting will be displayed;
and the QI message in the OP list will disappear. Quick-look inhibit will not affect the display being
inhibited.

1-44       Coast Mode

When a tracked target’s beacon report is not received for one scan or more, it is said to be coasting.
The position of a coasting track will automatically be predicted each scan using its past direction and
ground speed data; however, altitude data will not be updated. While coasting, the code line message
area of the data block will be replaced with the flashing letters “CST”. Should coasting continue for more
than four consecutive scans, the data block will be removed from the display (dropped), with the
<ACID> and beacon code appearing in the D/S List. If the discrete beacon report reappears within 15
scans from the time coasting began, the track will automatically associate on the target, even if the track
was in the D/S List. If the target reappears after 15 scans, the track can be manually repositioned, using
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                133

the procedures in paragraph 1-32-6. Tracks within two miles of the antenna which are placed in
dropped status due to Mode “C” altitude dropping below maximum auto-acquire altitude, Mode “C”
altitude invalid, or ground speed dropping below 50 knots, will automatically reacquire if the discrete
beacon report reappears at a range between two and six miles before 64 scans have elapsed. Tracks not
automatically acquiring may be manually repositioned. Tracked targets which are coasting will be
displayed at the owner display only. If this coasting target is involved in a quick- look or handoff, the
initiator and receiver displays will be the only displays to output the coasting target in full track format.

1-45    Hold Mode

1. The controller may place any tracked target into hold mode. When this is done, any loss of target
reports will cause the format to remain frozen in its last reported position. If beacon reports cease for
more than four consecutive scans, the target’s <ACID> and beacon code will appear in the D/S List but
the entire format will remain at the last reported position until the hold mode is dropped on the aircraft. If
discrete beacon reports are received before 15 scans have elapsed, the format will resume its normal
path.

2. The hold mode is useful when the system tracks emergencies or hijacks as the last known position will
remain on the controlling display. Tracks may be placed in hold mode even though they are already in
dropped status.

3. Tracks in inter-facility handoff status from the PIDP to ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be automatically
placed in hold mode if beacon reports cease for more than four consecutive scans. The frozen data block
will continue to be displayed in handoff format. This is to alert the controller that even though PIDP is not
actively tracking the aircraft, the inter-facility handoff is still in progress.

Special Requirements:

1. Target must be a tracked target owned by the controller’s display.

2. Dropped tracks may be placed in hold mode and the last reported position will be displayed.

Results:

A target placed in hold mode will have an “H” placed in the code line message area of the data block.
Should target reports cease, the data block will remain in its last known position; and a flashing “HLD”
will be placed in the code line message area of the data block.

1-46       Suspend Tracked Target

Suspend status is a way to eliminate the total format of a tracked target, thus reducing display clutter, yet
still maintain the advantages of a track (reflection discrimination, altitude monitoring, and MSAW). When
the controller suspends a target, the target’s <ACID> and beacon code will appear in the D/S List and
the format will disappear and appear as a number (1-0) corresponding to the number in the D/S List
where the target’s <ACID> and beacon code can be found. The symbol will change to the display ID
instead of the track owner ID number. If the D/S List is full, a suspended track entry will override a
dropped track entry.

Special Requirements:

1. To place a track in suspend status, the <ACID> identifier entered must match a target tracked on the
display.

2. The assistant controller must not be performing a function on that target.

3. The <CODE> identifier entered must be a discrete beacon code.

4. The target must be a tracked target owned by the controller and may not currently be in suspend or
dropped status.

5. There must be room in the controller’s D/S List for the new entry.

6. Emergency tracks (7500, 7600, 7700) cannot be placed in suspend status.

Results:

The track will appear in suspend status on the owner’s display and will be listed in its D/S List. The letter
identifier of the owning indicator will be displayed as the position symbol on suspended tracks.

1-48       Automatic Code Change

If the automatic code change feature has not been turned off and a tracked target changes its beacon
code, the new code will be displayed in place of the old one; and the old code will be displayed in the
right half of the message line. Both codes will be flashing.

1-48-1 Automatic Code Change Off/On

This command allows automatic code change feature to be turned off/on from the master indicator. At
initialization, the feature is turned on.

EXAMPLES:

SPEC X          DROP       Turn automatic code change feature off.

SPEC X          ENTER      Turn automatic code change feature on.

Special Requirements:

1. The automatic code change feature must be turned off/on from the master display.

2. The automatic code change feature must be on in order for automatic code changes to occur. (The
feature is ON when the system is initialized.)

Results:

If the automatic code change feature is turned off, code changes to tracked targets must be done
manually. If it is turned on, the code changes will be done automatically.

Error:

Error Condition                                                               Preview

Special Requirements:

1. If code changes to an emergency, communications failure, or hijack, the emergency must be
acknowledged first and then the code change acknowledged.

2. If a tracked target violates MSAW while a code change is in process, the MSAW alarm must be
acknowledged first and then the code change acknowledged.

3. If a tracked target is in conflict alert while a code change is in process, the conflict alert must be
acknowledged before the code change is acknowledged.

4. If a tracked target is in handoff status while a code change is in process, handoff procedures must be
accomplished, and then the code change acknowledgment must be done by the controller who has
control after the acknowledgment.

5. If code change is rejected and a matching discrete target on the old assigned code exists within the
auto-acquire area, the track will acquire on the matching target.

6. If code change is rejected and there is not a matching discrete target on the old assigned code, it will
immediately go into drop status.

7. If code change is rejected and the old assigned code was emergency, communications failure, or
hijack, it will immediately go into drop status.

8. If code changes to a non-discrete, the old assigned code will go to drop status.

9. If code change is not acknowledged and the beacon report ceases, the track will immediately go to
drop status on the old assigned code.

10. Automatic code change will occur only on tracked targets with discrete beacon codes within the
airspace boundary, and all tracked targets that change to emergency, communications failure, or hijack
code.

Results:

The new code on the code line and the old assigned code in the last four positions of the message line will
flash continuously until the controller does one of two options:

        a. Accepts the code change, which will clear the old assigned code from the message line and
cease the flashing of the new code on the code line.

       b. Rejects the code change, which will put the track with the old assigned code in the
Drop/Suspend List.

1-49       Conflict Alert

1. This feature will alert the controller when a tracked target is predicted to conflict with another tracked
target or when a tracked target inside the conflict alert area is predicted to conflict with another target
within the next ten sweeps. All targets within the conflict alert area are tracked by the system. The
conflict alert area is the auto-acquire area with a ten mile buffer added. If the conflicting targets have valid
altitudes, the audible alarm will sound and the data block will flash with the projected flight paths
displayed in flashing dots and the word “CONFLICT” in the data block. If one altitude is invalid, CA will
be displayed in the data blocks, the projected flight path dots will be steady instead of flashing and the
audible alarm will not sound. The controller may acknowledge the conflict alert by the following
sequence: <PEM> HOOK, <ACID> RD, or <DISCRETE CODE> RD.

2. When acknowledged, the audible alarm will silence. A conflict alert must be acknowledged before
any other keyboard action on the targets involved. When the conflict no longer exists, the visual and
audible alarms will stop.

Special Requirements:

1. Command must be entered at the master display.

2. Code or code block must be in valid range (0000-7477).

3. First two digits of the code block entries (1400-1435) must be the same.

4. Limit of one code and one code block.

Results:

The result is to identify a code and a code block that will be excluded from conflict alert processing. A
visual indicator (#) will be displayed in the data blocks of those targets that fall within the code/code
block, and the target will be excluded from conflict alert processing. Use of this feature should be
determined by the Chief Controller.

Special Requirements:

Command must be associated with an active tracked target on that display or a target inside the conflict
alert area.

Results:

The specified track or target will be inhibited only from conflict audible alarming. A “C” will be displayed
in the data block of all targets that are inhibited. If a track that is inhibited from conflict alert alarm is in
conflict with another inhibited track, the “C” will flash. If the inhibited track is in conflict with a track that
is not inhibited, the tracks will receive the conflict alert audible and visual alarms.

Errors: None.

1-49-2             Conflict Alert Limits

These commands will permit the definition of a special area around the antenna (one to ten-mile radius)
below an altitude (1000 to 3000 ft AGL) in which the tracks’ position will be predicted for a special
number of sweeps (zero to ten) for conflict.

EXAMPLES:

Command        Range       Execute         Remarks


SP3 R          10          ENTER           Set range to 10 miles. (Default = 0.)

SP3 A          30          ENTER           Set altitude to 3000. (Default = 0.)

SP3 S          6           ENTER           Sweeps to predict set to six. (Default = 10.)

SP3 R                      DROP            Set range to 0 miles.

SP3 A                      DROP            Set altitude to 0.

SP3 S                      DROP            Set sweeps to predict to 10.

Special Requirements:

Values for range, altitude and number of sweeps must be within the limits shown above.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                 143

Results:

In the above example, the number of sweeps to predict for conflict alert is set to six for tracks that are
within a ten mile radius of the antenna and below 3000 feet AGL.

NOTE: At an antenna RPM of 12 per minute, each sweep that the conflict alert is displayed provides an
additional five seconds warning. If the number of sweeps is set to six instead of the normal ten, the
warning time is reduced from 50 seconds to 30 seconds or less.

Errors:

Special Requirements:

1. All the format elements are flip-flop (on-off, off-on) types. If they are displayed prior to the
command, they will be inhibited after the command. If the element was inhibited prior to the command, it
will be displayed after the command.

2. The leader direction, if not specified, rotates 45 degrees clockwise.

3. Non-select or select target format elements are C (CODE), ALT, or LDR.

4. Track format elements are C (CODE), ALT, LDR, <ACID>, CLS, GSP, SP2 (aircraft type), MSG,
ACID SPACE (fix 1), or SP3 (fix 2).

5. First key entry of LDR rotates all tracked targets 45 degrees clockwise.

6. The leader cannot be manually inhibited.

7. The leader direction, if not specified, rotates 45 degrees clockwise.

8. Select or non-select controlled track format elements at non-controlling positions are C (code),
<ACID>, ALT, CLS, GSP, or LDR.

Results:

The elements will be inhibited/displayed after the command. If all the format elements are inhibited for the
category, the leader will be inhibited automatically. As soon as one of the format elements is displayed,
the leader will be displayed.

Errors: None.

1-51       Specific Tracked Target Element Control

2437          RD                               ENTER       Restore complete tracked target format.

Special Requirements:

1. The target identified will be captured providing it finds a match in the system and the assistant position
is not performing some function on the target.

2. If (CODE) is used as an identifier, it must be a discrete beacon code.

3. Track format elements are (ACID), C (CODE), GSP, ALT, LDR, CLS, SP2 (aircraft type), MSG,
ACID SPACE (fix 1), or SP3 (fix 2).

4. The leader is automatically inhibited if all of the items in the tracked targets data block are inhibited.
As soon as one is displayed, the leader will be displayed. The leader cannot be manually inhibited.

5. This command is a flip-flop (on-off, off-on) type. If the format element is displayed and then entered
in the command, it will be inhibited. If it was inhibited, it will be displayed.

6. The target identified must be a tracked target owned by that display.

7. If the target is MSAW exempt, the altitude cannot be inhibited.

Results:

When a specific data block is modified so the data block is not the same format as track category data
block format for that position, changes to the track category data block format will not affect the data
block(s) modified individually. A command entered without any elements listed will restore complete
tracked target format with all the data block items displayed. The leader will be displayed if any items in

code and only if at least one of the targets involved is being tracked. When potential format swapping
does occur, both targets are displayed with a non-select symbol, leader and a “?” in place of their target
data blocks. The tracked target or targets are put in the D/S List as dropped targets. When the
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                               151

possibility no longer exists for format swapping, the format may be repositioned using procedures in
paragraph 1-30-6.

2. Emergency Codes. When two or more emergency targets with the same code (7700, 7600, or 7500)
get so close together that they become questionable, the controlled tracks coast to the D/S List; and the
uncontrolled tracks are deleted after coasting. This is a type of format swapping, but the data blocks are
not replaced with a “?”. The audible alarm, if activated, is silenced; and the targets are displayed as non-
select until the questionable condition ends. The non-select formats are then changed to uncontrolled
emergency track formats, and the system alarm is activated. A dropped entry cannot be repositioned
from the D/S List. The system will not allow keyboard action (HOOK) on emergency codes that are still
questionable.

1-56    Altitude Replies

Four types of altitude replies may be displayed in the data block (tracked or untracked). If the Mode
“C” reply is between 0 - 99,900, the altitude will be displayed as three digits in hundreds of feet. If the
Mode “C” reply is less than zero, “NEG” will be displayed indicating the aircraft is below sea level. If the
Mode “C” reply is above 99,900, “---” will be displayed. If a garbled or no Mode “C” reply is being
received, “///” will be displayed. Any altitude replies not between 0 - 99,900 will be forced through the
altitude filter limits.

1-57    Multiple Next Code Assignment

1. Each display can sequentially assign a discrete code by use of the NXT key or (OPTION: 1, 2, or 3)
NXT keys. In flight plan initiate, each display may also sequentially assign a discrete beacon code by use
of the FD key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) FD keys. This code is set up as a code block by use of the
SPEC key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) SPEC keys (codes XXXX-YYYY) by keyboard action. The
codes must be in the same code block. However, code 1236 will not be assigned by use of the NXT
key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT keys. There may be up to four code blocks set up by keyboard
action. The code block cannot overlap any of the other three for the display.

2. After the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT keys are pressed, it is not necessary to press the
CLEAR key before entering a new keyboard command. To clear a code block, use the SPEC key or
(OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) SPEC 0000 SPACE 0000 ENTER.

EXAMPLES: If the code block entered is 1001-1077, the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT
keys indicates 1001 as the next available code of the specified code block. After 1001 is assigned and
the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT is pressed again, the next available code to be assigned
indicates 1002 and so on until 1077 is reached.
152                                                                            AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

SPEC         0000 /\ 0000     ENTER          Delete first code block.

Special Requirements:

1. Codes issued with the NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT keys will be discrete.

2. Codes will be sequentially assigned except for 1236.

3. Code blocks assigned to one indicator cannot overlap.

4. Codes must be in the same code block.

Results:

1. Up to four code blocks can be assigned to each display. Next available code can be viewed in the
preview area by pressing NXT key or (OPTIONS: 1, 2, or 3) NXT keys. If all the special requirements
have been met, the next code of each next code block will appear in the controller’s OP List. The next
code in the OP List will be updated as the code is used.

2. If all the codes in a block are in use, “FULL” will replace the next code value.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                     Preview

Special Requirements:

1. Only one display can be assigned as the master display, and it cannot be designated as training or be
in test.

2. If there is no change in master, arrival, departure, or en route designations entered (using the SPACE
key), the assigned displays will remain the same as prior to entering the command; and all A/D Lists
except on training indicators will be cleared and sent on the next minute update.
158                                                                           AT-E-09, 1 August 2000


3. Reminder - If the display’s configuration is changed, the Arrival/ Departure/En Route Lists on the
displays will be cleared and rewritten. The new master has control of the old master’s message.

Note: If there are more than ten displays, the configuration command must be done twice, i.e., change
departure and en route displays; then change master and arrivals.

Results:

The Arrival/Departure/En Route Lists of the displays will change to the type assigned to each display.
Displays designated as training will not show the new configuration in the OP List.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                  Preview

pattern has the following features:

           a. Full alphanumeric repertoire in the OP List.

           b. “Echo back” from the computer to allow testing of the keyboards.

           c. A/D List with target entries.

           d. D/S List with target entries.

           e. Blinking SPI to check the ident feature.

           f. Various target blocks used to check format elements.

2. The diagnostic may be displayed on any display except the master. The controller can put only his/her
own display in diagnostic, but the master indicator can put any other display into diagnostic.

3. To display the diagnostic test pattern at your indicator: SPEC T ENTER.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                 159

4. To display the diagnostic test pattern from the master indicator: SPEC T <Display ID> ENTER.

5. To remove the test pattern, simply disengage and reengage the indicator.

NOTE: In order to allow indicator alignment, the master indicator may be put in test mode (SPEC T
ENTER) when there is only one engaged indicator and there is no active inter-facility interface. When the
master is put in test, or the last indicator is disengaged, the program will continue to operate and the first
indicator to be engaged will be the master.

1-66      Master Reassignment of Tracks and Special Local Flight Plans

If an indicator fails, is disengaged, or is in test mode, the master display can assign control of the tracks of
a failed indicator to another display. The master display will also assign local flight plans which have been
entered by TRK key.

EXAMPLES:

1-68       Simulation Routine

WARNING: While the simulation routine is in use, NO live traffic may be controlled. If interfaced with
NAS, the interface must be disabled.

The PIDP operational program contains a simulation routine that may be used for familiarization and
keyboard proficiency training. The simulation routine operates as selected by a master keyboard
command. The letters “SM” will be displayed in the OP List of all indicators.

EXAMPLES:

Special
Function       Mode               Execute   Remarks


SPEC           S                  ENTER     Turn on simulated targets.

SPEC           S                  DROP      Return system to normal operations.

NOTE: When the master command “         SPEC S ENTER” is made, the simulation routine will internally
generate 12 beacon targets with fixed flight paths, transponder codes, and altitudes. Nine of these targets
164                                                                           AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

will fly clockwise, one counterclockwise, one north/south and one east/west. All PIDP functions (auto-
acquire, tracking, format control, etc.) apply to these simulated targets.

1-69       Keyboard Dump

If something unusual is occurring and the facility is too busy to turn off the PIDP to accomplish a regular
dump, a keyboard dump can be done without interfering with normal PIDP operation. (This dump will
not be a “snapshot” of the system because the targets, tracks, NAS and FLIPS messages, keyboards,
etc. are changing as the dump is being done.)

EXAMPLE:

Special
Function       Execute       Remarks


OP             X             The dump to the floppy disk will begin.

Special Requirements:

A dump disk must be in the floppy disk drive. CAUTION: If the program disk is left in the drive, the
dump (automatic, keyboard, or regular) will overwrite the program on the disk.

Results:

Memory will be recorded on the disk in the floppy disk drive.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                 Preview

1-70       Training Configuration

If training is desired, any non-master indicator can be designated as training display(s). Training flight
plans that are forwarded from FLIPS to PIDP will be assigned only to those displays that are configured
for training. If none are configured, the training flight plans from FLIPS will be discarded. To remove the
training designation, simply disengage and engage the indicator.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                   165

EXAMPLES:

Special
Function       Execute     Remarks


SPEC           G           AR DE EN in the OP area will be replaced with TG.

Special Requirements:

The master indicators cannot be configured for training.

Results:

1. A “TG” will appear in the OP List instead of “AR DE EN”. Any non-training flight plans in the A/D
List will be removed. Only training flight plans will be assigned to training displays except for flight plans
entered using the TRK key as the terminator.

2. If there are no training displays assigned when FLIPS transmits training flight plans, the flight plans will
be discarded. If the training display(s) is restored to normal operation, the training flight plans will remain
in the system until automatic deletion time or manual deletion. This allows a training exercise to be
interrupted and resumed without sending all the flight plans from FLIPS again.

Errors:

Error Condition                                                                     Preview

1-71       CENRAP (Center Radar Arts Presentation) Configuration

WARNING: In normal PIDP operations, target positions are updated every sweep (approximately 12 to
15 RPM). When using CENRAP, the target positions are updated approximately every 3-4 sweeps
because the ARTCC’s antenna rate is slower (approximately 8 RPM). This means that a target will
appear not to move for three or four sweeps, and then it will jump to its current position. This change will
be more visible on faster moving targets than on slower ones.

CENRAP is used as a back-up system when the terminal radar fails and/or is out-of-service. This
function provides a near normal radar environment without requiring use of non-radar procedures. There
are no primary radar targets available during CENRAP and only secondary radar targets are displayed.
All PIDP functions are available to the controllers except conflict alert (CA), minimum safe altitude
warning (MSAW), reflections data if used, and simulation.

SPEC           K         DROP       CN will be cleared from the OP area.

Special Requirements:

1. Only the master display can place PIDP in CENRAP mode.

2. There must be a working interface with ARTCC (i.e., no IF in OP area).

3. Requires the installation of a special box (see paragraph 2-25).

4. Simulation cannot be used.

Results:

A “CN” will appear in the OP area.

Results:

The MSAW value of the area identified by the PEM will be displayed in the preview area of the
requesting display.

Errors: None.

1-74       Position Sign On

The purpose of position sign on is to allow the controller to sign onto a particular position and FLIPS to
keep track of the times. It will also keep track of a trainee and trainer’s time. The controller will
automatically be logged off when someone else signs on the same position. Closing the position will use
the same keyboard command as signing on. A Log File has been added to FLIPS showing date, time,
event (SIGN IN/OUT), position, and controller’s initials listed as “PRI” for proficiency time and
“MON” for monitor time. If a controller forgets to sign in on a position, a manual update can be added
to their time in FLIPS and an entry will be made in the Log. If no time is input, when signing on a
position, current system time is used. The minute value only can be input if the hour is the same as that
in the system time. See FLIPS operator’s manual for additional information.

The following messages will be displayed in the OP area in place of the master and display messages
under the following conditions.

SECTION VIII - KEYBOARD COMMANDS

1-75   Introduction

The listing in paragraph 1-73 provides a quick reference of the valid keyboard sequences used in the
PIDP system. Care must be taken when entering the keyboard command sequences because errors may
change the meaning of the command entered. DO NOT omit SPACE key where it is specified because it
can also change the meaning of the sequence.

1-76   Keyboard Commands

The following is a list of all valid key sequences used in the PIDP system. For an explanation of the
abbreviations used, refer to the glossary.

CHAPTER 2 - SPECIAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

2-1    Introduction

1. Chapter 2 contains special operating procedures for the following system conditions:

       a. System overloads contained in Section I.

       b. Indicator overloads contained in Section II.

       c. Equipment failures contained in Section III.

2. All procedures described are suggested actions.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                              185

SECTION I - PIDP SYSTEM LIMITS

2-2     Introduction

Three system constraints are placed on the PIDP system. These are:

        a. Number of targets in the system.

        b. Number of targets that are tracked in the system.

        c. Number of flight plans that are stored in the system.

2-3     Overload of Targets

The PIDP can process up to 450 targets per antenna scan. When this occurs, an “IB” is placed in the
system alarm line of the OP List. The system will then begin to drop targets, and the controller will see a
wedge where targets are absent. Solution to a target overload: reduce the number of targets. This can
be accomplished by selecting a lower RANGE SELECT on the TPX-42’s B-Box until the “IB” alarm
disappears.

2-4     Overload of Tracked Targets

1. When 200 targets are tracked, the “TT” alarm will appear on the system alarm line of the OP List
indicating a track overload. If a controller attempts to track any additional targets, the “NO ROOM!”
warning will appear in the preview area. Also, no new auto-acquires will be allowed to take place.
Solution: Delete all dropped tracks (those tracks that coasted into the D/S List).

2. The PIDP can track only 15 non-discrete codes of the same code block. When this occurs and a
controller attempts to track an additional target with the same non-discrete code, an “INVALID!”
message will appear in the preview area.

2-5     Flight Plan Overload

The PIDP computer can store a maximum of 75 flight plans in the system. When an overload is reached,
an “FP” is placed on the system alarm line of the OP List. Should a controller attempt to enter any
additional flight plans, a “NO ROOM!” warning will appear in the preview area. Should NAS or FLIPS
attempt to send any additional flight plans, a data reject will be sent by the PIDP indicating no room.
186                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

SECTION II - PIDP INDICATOR LIMITS

2-6      Introduction

The PIDP displays have limits imposed on them that affect the air traffic controller. These are:

         a. The number of characters permitted on a display (data blanking).

         b. The number of flight plans displayed in the A/D List.

         c. The number of dropped or suspended targets displayed in the D/S List.

         d. The number of characters in the preview area.

         e. The number of characters in the master/display message area of the OP List.

         f. The number of select codes or code blocks in the OP List.

         g. The number of next code blocks in the OP List.

2-7      Data Blanking

1. When the maximum number of characters is reached on a display (approximately 1500), an “OB”
appears on the indicator alarm line of the OP List, indicating a display overload. This condition causes
the system to eliminate certain blocks of data in a predetermined sequence (trail dots, non- select codes,
select codes, non-select altitudes, and select altitudes). Solution: To eliminate data blanking, the
controller needs to reduce the number of characters on the display by any one of the following methods:

         a. Inhibit untracked targets outside CA area.

       b. If the display is on a range that is greater than 60 NM, and if operational requirements permit,
change the range select switch on the display to 60 NM or less.

         c. Use the altitude filter to eliminate all unnecessary traffic, or consider limiting the range on the
B-box.

         d. Limit the TPX-42 interrogator range to no greater range than needed to sustain operations.

2. When the overload ceases, reverse data blanking occurs. Restoration of data will occur; however, it
will take six antenna scans per format element blanked out. Trail dots will not automatically be restored
by reverse data blanking. Keyboard action must be taken.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                187

2-8     Arrival/Departure List Overload

The ten most current flight plans are displayed in the A/D List. As flight plans are deleted from the list by
means of auto-acquisition, automatic timeout, or manual deletion, flight plans are added to the List based
on activation time.

2-9     Drop/Suspend List Overload

The D/S List is full when ten targets are suspended and/or dropped, and any additional dropped targets
will not be displayed in the list until room is made. Should the controller attempt to suspend additional
targets, “NO ROOM!” will appear in the preview area.

2-10    Preview Area Limit

The preview area of a display can hold up to 38 characters for editing entries. Care should be taken not
to overwrite the preview area. This will lead to an “INVALID!” entry condition, and data will have to be
entered again. If a FP initiate is being done, 45 character can be held; however, when the message is
being input, the rest of the new flight plan is not displayed. You cannot backspace past the message field.

2-11    Message Area

The OP List can display two messages, the master (system) and display message with 20 characters
each. If 20 characters exist and an attempt is made to add to a message, a “NO ROOM!” error will be
displayed in the preview area. Satellite airport data requested from FLIPS will overwrite the two
message lines. If a new master or display message is entered while satellite airport data is being
displayed, it will not be displayed until the airport data is cleared.

2-12    Select Codes

Five select codes or code blocks may be used. If an additional code block selection is attempted after
the limit is reached, the controller will get a “NO ROOM!” indication in the preview area.

2-13    Next Codes

The first code of up to four next code blocks may be displayed. This line will be overwritten with the
bearing and range of up to three uncontrolled, unacknowledged emergency tracks. The next codes will
be redisplayed when the emergency is cleared or acknowledged.
188                                                                                AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

SECTION III - FAILURES

2-14    Introduction

This section provides special instructions for the air traffic controller in the event of a partial failure in the
PIDP system. The following failures are discussed in this section:

        a. Power failure.

        b. Indicator failure.

        c. Keyboard failure.

        d. <PEM> failure.

        e. NAS/JACC interface failure.

        f. Hard disk/floppy disk failure

        g. VDT failure.

        h. VSP failure.

        i. System failure.

        j. FLIPS interface failure.

2-15    Power Failure

The computer will detect a power failure and provide up to two minutes of operation from a battery
power source. If power is not restored in two minutes (commercial or back-up), the computer will halt;
and the program must be loaded when power is restored. (Also see paragraph 3-7.)

2-16    Indicator Failure

In the event of an indicator failure, set the 1C-2C-3C switch on the indicator control box for the faulty
indicator to one of the modes already in use. This permits the other indicator control boxes to select any
modes without being inhibited by the inoperative indicator.                     Also, set the COMPUTER
ENGAGE/DISENGAGE switch on the indicator control box to DISENGAGE to electrically disconnect
the indicator from the computer. All tracked targets controlled by the failed display can be reassigned to
another display by the master (see para 1-66). If the failed display was designated as the master position,
all master functions will be automatically reassigned to the first active display.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                 189

2-17    Keyboard Failure

1. If a keyboard fails and there are two keyboards at that position, have maintenance remove the
defective keyboard. If data from the defective keyboard remains in the preview area, perform the key
sequence:

        SPEC <Defective Keyboard Number (1 or 2)> ENTER

2. This should clear the data from the preview area. If only one keyboard is installed in the display
position and it fails, the indicator can be used to control traffic in a limited capacity. No other entries can
be made and the display will remain frozen as to the selected codes and formats being suppressed.
Putting the display into diagnostic test mode may clear the keyboard.

2-18    <PEM> Failure

If the position entry module <PEM> fails, maintenance personnel should be notified to arrange for its
replacement. The indicator can continue to operate in a reduced capacity with only keyboard acquisition
of targets possible, by use of a <CODE> RD sequence. It will not be possible to start a track on a target
with a non-discrete beacon code.

2-19    NAS/JACC Interface Failure

1. The indication of a NAS/JACC failure is the flashing characters “IF” (interface failure) on the system
alarm line of the OP List. If this happens, maintenance should be performed to correct the problem.

2. If the failure was sufficiently long, as judged by the chief controller, the NAS flight plans should be
purged per procedures in paragraph 1-64.

2-20 Hard Disk/Floppy Disk Drive Failure
If a hard disk/floppy disk drive fails, maintenance personnel should be notified immediately.

2-21    Video Display Terminal Failure

If the VDT fails, notify maintenance immediately.

2-22    Video Signal Processor (VSP) Failure

If the flashing characters “PC” appear on the system alarm line of the OP List, it indicates a failure in the
system, VSP, or in the T-4 simulator. All indicator control boxes should be placed in DISENGAGED
and maintenance personnel should be notified.

2-23    System Failure
190                                                                           AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

Loss of a system means loss of all PIDP capabilities. The displays should be placed in disengaged mode
to erase old alphanumerics. Bracket video can be displayed, along with primary radar, to aid in
identifying aircraft even with the display disengaged.

NOTE: After the hard disk drive has been initialized with the current program load, a dump disk should
be inserted in the floppy disk drive. Some program failures will result in a dump being written to the disk
automatically. A PIDP FAULT LOG should be accomplished. If the system did not do the dump and
time permits, a dump should be accomplished. Instructions for the manual dump and filling out the
FAULT LOG are on the FAULT LOG itself. The completed FAULT LOG and dump disk should be
mailed to ESC OL-D/E 3580 D Ave., TINKER AFB OK 73145-9155. A copy of the PIDP FAULT
LOG can be obtained from ESC OL-D/E, and the facility should make additional copies.

2-24    FLIPS Failure

The indication of a FLIPS failure is the flashing characters “FF” (FLIPS failure) on the system alarm line
of the OP List. If this happens, the FLIPS system should be rebooted.

2-25    ASR Failure

When the ASR fails, the PIDP program is still able to function in CENRAP mode (see paragraph 1-71).
However, CENRAP requires the installation of a special box that generates the necessary Azimuth
Reference Pulse (ARP) and Azimuth Change Pulse (ACP). These pulses are used to generate the sweep
on the indicators. Once installed and CENRAP is enabled, PIDP receives target information from
ARTCC via modem and displays these targets. Special requirements (i.e., increased separation) will
probably be in effect when using CENRAP. (See paragraph 1-71 for further explanation.)
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                               191

CHAPTER 3 - PROGRAM LOAD AND SYSTEM INITIALIZATION

3-1     Introduction

This chapter deals with the loading and initializing of the PIDP operational program. These steps must be
completed before the system can be used. The PIDP is designed for continuous operation. Once the
system is loaded and initialized as described in this chapter, it should not be reloaded or restarted unless
normal operation is interrupted. For example, a program load must be accomplished after a system
failure or computer maintenance.
192                                                                          AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

SECTION I - PROGRAM LOADING

3-2     Introduction

The PIDP operational program is contained on a floppy diskette and is used to update the hard disk with
any program changes via a floppy disk drive. The procedure to update the hard disk should only be done
when a new program revision is received. After updating the hard disk from the new floppy diskette, the
program is loaded via the hard disk (see paragraph 3-4). After the hard drive is updated, remove the
program floppy from the disk drive and insert a dump disk in the floppy disk drive. Initialization is done
from the master keyboard (see paragraph 3-5).

3-3     System Turn-On Procedure

Turn-on procedures are provided in Tables 3-1 through 3-2. These procedures allow the operator to
turn the system on from a completely de-energized status.

3-4     Program Loading Procedure

The following sequence provides instructions to update the hard drive with a new operational program
using the floppy disk drive.

         a. Turn on the system console. The floppy disk drive should be on. Place the PIDP program
disk in the floppy disk drive.

       b. Depress the system reset switch (RST). If nothing happens, the lock switch on the computer
from panel may be on and needs to be switched to off. (The switch should always be “OFF”.)

      c. On the system console, type B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER. The operating system load
menu will appear. When this happens you have approximately 45 seconds to enter 2 ENTER.

        d. The technical maintenance menu will appear. When this happens, enter 6 ENTER.

        e. When the pathname is asked, answer update.sys and press ENTER.

        f. When the “override default specs” appears, press ENTER.

        g. When the next question is asked, always press Y ENTER.

        h. Type RES and press ENTER.

       i. Then enter B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER. From this the program will automatically load.
To avoid the 45 second delay, press ENTER when the operating system load menu appears.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                           193

       j. Remove the load disk from the floppy disk drive and insert a dump disk in the drive.

2. The following instructions should be followed to load the PIDP program when power is on.

       a. Remove the dump disk from the floppy disk drive.

       b. Turn on the system console and the floppy disk drive. Depress system reset (RST) switch on
CPU front panel.

        c. Type B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER. The operating system load menu will appear, and
the program will load automatically. To avoid waiting 45 seconds for the program to load, press ENTER
when the operating system load menu appears.

       d. Insert a dump disk in the floppy disk drive.

3. To load the PIDP program when power is off, TURN POWER ON and floppy disk drive on.
   Remove the dump disk from the floppy disk drive. The program will automatically load. To avoid
   waiting 45 seconds at each of the prompts, press ENTER when they appear. Insert a dump disk in
   the floppy disk drive.
194                                                                         AT-E-09, 1 August 2000


SECTION II - INITIALIZATION

3-5    Program Initialization

1. This paragraph provides instructions to initialize the operational program. Initialization consists of
entering the barometer, followed by the date and time from the master display. Initialization must be
accomplished after the operational program has been loaded into the system (paragraph 3-4), or after
doing a program restart (paragraph 3-6).

2. When the program is loaded or restarted, the first active display will be designated as the master
display. The OP List will appear on all engaged displays in the following format:

       T 00 00:00:00 B 29.92 A 000-999
       C 000.0 S 000.0 (OD-153/T only)
       LOAD 62P0VPS1 (Current load # and Base ID)
       AR DE EN
       M=A (assuming display A is engaged)

3. The displayed time will now begin to update and the master display must now enter the barometer
setting followed by the year/month/day/hour/minute command (paragraph 1-23-8). An entry from any
other display or an entry other than to initialize barometer or time from the master will cause an error
condition.

4. Once the master has entered the barometer followed by the date and time, all engaged displays will
then be operational. The system is now ready for use with the following preset parameters:

       a. Mode of Operation - Live (paragraph 1-68).

       b. MSAW Exemption - None (paragraph 1-41-1).

       c. A/D Entry Time - 5 minutes (paragraph 1-25-7).

       d. Auto-Acquire Leader Direction - South (paragraph 1-54).

       e. NAS/PIDP Identifiers - As submitted by the facility (paragraph 1-65).

       f. System Configuration - All active displays are designated as arrival, departure, and en route.
Additionally, the first active display is also the master.

5. The master display can change any of the parameters by keyboard action without stopping the
program. However, if the year or month must be changed, a restart and initialization are required.

3-6    Power Fail Recovery

The PIDP computer will detect a power failure and provide up to two minutes of operation from a battery
power source. If power is not restored in two minutes (commercial or back-up), the computer will halt;
and the program must be loaded when power is restored.

CHAPTER 4 - PIDP FACILITY RESPONSIBILITIES

4-1     Introduction

The program design criteria for the new Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) shall provide air
traffic controllers the capability to furnish a safe terminal advisory and control service to aircraft arrivals,
departures and overflights in a military air traffic control environment. The following sections outline local
responsibilities for implementing and testing new program versions.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                201


SECTION I - PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

4-2     Introduction

1. PIDP operational program releases are made using FLOPPY DISKS. We refer to these as load
disks. Interim releases and changes to site unique data are made as required. Prior to release of load
disks for other than site unique data changes, the program is thoroughly tested at ESC OL-D/E and at
two designated field test sites. There are three reasons for releasing new load disks:

        a. To fix known problems (deficiencies).

        b. To improve the operational program (enhancements).

        c. To provide requested site unique data changes.

2. A release may contain any combination of these changes. A new release will consist of:

        a. Two current load disks.

        b. A Version Description Document (VDD).

        c. Cover letter.

3. Site unique data changes will be accompanied by a cover letter without a VDD. The VDD and cover
letter contain instructions on actions to be performed before, during, and after implementation as well as a
description of changes and identification of the new load disks.

4-3     Program Load Identification

Each floppy load disk is labeled for identification purposes. The label contains three numbers:

         a. The Computer Software Distribution Identifier (CSDI) is an ESC OL-D/E assigned number
that is made up of an equipment identifier, system name, and date of assembly. This number is for ESC
OL-D/E use only.

         b. The Load Number (Load) is the only number that really concerns you since it is the number
referred to by ESC OL-D/E in correspondence with you. The first two digits of this number identify the
load. If the load contains temporary corrections, a “P” will follow the load identifier along with a number
indicating how many corrections are included. Next is the three-letter site identifier for your facility, and
following that is a number indicating how many site unique data changes have been implemented for your
facility. A “1” indicates the original release. A “2” would indicate the first site unique data change after
202                                                                            AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

the original release, a “3” would indicate the second change, and so on. This number will be reset to “1”
each time the three-digit load identifier or one-digit “P” number is changed.

       c. The Computer Program Identification Number (CPIN) is a number assigned to programs of
embedded computer systems as required by AFR 800- series regulations. The last three digits identify
which revision is on the load disk and are the only numbers that change. This number is also for ESC
OL-D/E use only.

4-4     Facility Requirements

1. Each PIDP facility should always have on hand:

        a. Two floppy disks of the latest program version as the operational load.

        b. The latest VDD describing the difference between the operational load and the backup load.

        c. A copy of the most recent Performance Evaluation Test (PET) document.

        d. Floppy disks for dump purposes.

2. Dump disks can be any 3 ½-inch floppy that has been high density formatted.

4-5     Replacement Software

All disks, including backup disks, should be loaded and initialized upon receipt for verification of disk
quality. If for any reason a disk does not load, it should be returned to ESC OL-D/E immediately for
replacement. It is important that all superseded load disks be returned to ESC OL-D/E for use and to
assure that uniformity of software is maintained at all PIDP facilities. The VDD/cover letter tells you
which disk is the current load and which disk is the backup load. All other load disks must be returned.
In addition, it is important that you advise ESC OL-D/E by telephone or message when you receive any
new load disk or PET document, and the date you implement the new load.

4-6     Performance Evaluation Test Requirements

Validation testing using the PET document must be accomplished before each new version (indicated by a
change to the load identifier) is implemented. If a change is minor (only the “P” number changes) or if it is
a site unique data change only, validation testing may not be required. The VDD/cover letter will tell you
if a PET is required.
AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                  203


SECTION II - TEST FACILITY PROCEDURES

4-7     Introduction

Before any new version of the PIDP operational program is released for operational use at all facilities, it
must be thoroughly tested to ensure it operates correctly. This testing is accomplished in two phases:

       a. Phase 1 is a test conducted at ESC OL-D/E utilizing a PIDP mock-up system. This test
simply assures that the program responds correctly to input data.

        b. The second phase of the testing process is the operational verification. This test is used to
insure that an ATC facility can operate with the new program version. Many times this test will reveal
problems within the program which were not apparent at ESC OL-D/E simply because of the added
workload an actual operation can put on the system.

4-8     Test Sites

Due to the need to exercise the program under a full load and to insure that all portions of the program
are exercised, this operational verification test will be conducted at designated facilities having high density
air traffic. Direct coordination is authorized between ESC OL-D/E and the designated test facility. All
designated test sites must be aware of the requirements for operational verification in case they are tasked
to be the testing facility. The current list of test sites includes Sheppard, Tyndall, and Eglin AFBs. Two
facilities are used to field test each new version of the PIDP operational program. Field tests necessary
for deficiency corrections are conducted at one facility on an as required basis.

4-9     Field Test Procedures

The following procedures must be followed prior to implementing a new test version of the PIDP
program:

       a. Prior to the inclusion of any enhancement in the PIDP program, the Computer Configuration
Sub Board will determine that the change is acceptable for use in the program. Deficiency corrections are
approved by ESC OL-D/E.

        b. ESC OL-D/E will then include the change(s) in a test version of the new program and will
prepare and distribute to the designated test facilities a cover letter, two (2) new version program disks,
and Field Test Instructions.

       c. Within five days of the receipt of the new version disks, the designated test sites will put the
new version into use in accordance with the instructions.
204                                                                             AT-E-09, 1 August 2000

         d. The test sites will continue use of the new version for the time period specified. During this
period, it is imperative that the test facilities:

                (1) Document all discrepancies found. Be as specific and complete as possible.

               (2) If a program failure occurs during the testing period, the testing facility must complete
the PIDP Fault Log. This information and the program dump disk will then be provided to ESC OL-
D/E as soon as possible after the failure.

               (3) If failures or discrepancies are so numerous that the continued use of the test program
may cause a flying safety hazard, the new version will be replaced by the currently approved version.
ESC OL-D/E will immediately be notified so they can begin investigation of the problem.

          e. At the completion of the test period specified, each testing facility will provide the results to
ESC OL-D/E (DSN 884-7004) by telephone. This notification must be followed within 24 hours with a
written test report. The test report will include program discrepancies found during testing and a list of the
times and duration of all system outages occurring during the test period. This written report will be sent
to ESC OL-D/E. A copy of this test report may also be sent to the respective division, if required. Upon
telephone notification of the successful completion of program testing, ESC OL-D/E may allow the test
facilities to continue using the program version which was successfully tested.

        f. If the tested version includes any enhancements, HQ USAF will decide if the new version is to
be released to all other PIDP facilities. If the tested version contains only deficiency corrections, ESC
OL-D/E may approve release of the new version to all sites.

       g. Upon release approval, ESC OL-D/E will distribute the new program version disks and
Version Description Documents (VDDs) to all PIDP facilities.

NOTE: Prior to operational use of a new version, each site will ensure that they complete the verification
testing using the Performance Evaluation Test (PET) document.
