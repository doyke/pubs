                          CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

Part I
Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training
document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path
to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE: Civilians occupying
associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty
using both parts of the plan.

Part I    Section A   explains how everyone will use the plan
          Section B   identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training
                      strategies, and career field path
          Section     associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
          C           experience, training, and other)
          Section     indicates resource constraints, such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities
          D
          Section E   identifies transition training guidance requirements for SSgt through MSgt
Part II   Section A   identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks,
                      technical references to support training, AFJAGS conducted training, wartime
                      course and core task and correspondence course requirements
          Section B   contains the course objective list and training standards which supervisors will use
                      to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements
          Section     identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training
          C           Package (QTPs which may be developed to support proficiency training)
          Section     identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources
          D           available to support training. Included are both mandatory and optional courses.
          Section E   identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine
                      additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level,
                      supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
                      commensurate with the overall goals of this plan

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today’s work
force for tomorrow’s jobs.

The CFETP has several purposes, some are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Aids supervisors to identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends
education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field
training process.

2. Uses. The plan will be used by FMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AFJAGS training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable
training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.
They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to
provide the identified training.

2.2. FMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training and contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy
identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for
inclusion into this plan.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of
courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will initiate an
annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and
AFJAGS training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using
the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

5. Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the
superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is
essential that everyone involved in training must do his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an
effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual
receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.

5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge
provided in the 3-skill level resident course (MAF5J031PAC 00X, Paralegal Apprentice Course) and
results in the award of AFSC 5J031. Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS
at Part II, Sections A and B.

5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of:

5.2.1. Task and knowledge training provided in CDC 5J051; and

5.2.2. Completion of core tasks identified with a single asterisk ―*‖ in Attachment 2, column 2A of Part II
of the CFETP.

5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Begin UGT to 7-skill level when selected for promotion to SSgt but no sooner
than the first day of the promotion cycle, except for STEP promotees and retrainees. If the member is a
SSgt or above, begin 7-skill level upgrade upon award of the 5-skill level. UGT consists of:




                                                10
5.3.1. Completion of core tasks identified with a single asterisk―*‖ in Attachment 2, columns 2A and 2B of
Part II of the CFETP;

5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. Must hold the rank of senior master sergeant (SMSgt), meet mandatory
requirements listed in specialty description in AFECD and have supervisor’s and commander’s
recommendation for the award of the 9-skill level

6. Training Decisions. Core tasks were revised in the CFETP to eliminate the two track 5-level upgrade
training that focused solely on general law or military justice. Training decisions were made during the
March 2011 Utilization and Training Workshop/Specialty Training Requirements Team meeting. Distance
Education (DE) Courses were discussed with regard to prioritizing which tasks from the CFETP should be
augmented with DE courses. This item was tabled to discuss at a later date after the CFM, MFMs and
CPTM met with AFJAGS personnel to clarify resource requirements and capabilities.

6.1. Initial Skills. The initial skills MAF5J031PAC 00X Paralegal Apprentice Course was revised by
AFJAGS to provide training needed to prepare graduates for paralegal apprentice related positions.

6.2. 5-Level Upgrade Requirements. The CFETP will be revised to balance training requirements by
focusing on foundational paralegal skills in order to standardize 5-level skill-sets in all areas of practice.

6.3. 7-Level Upgrade Requirements. The MAF5J071PCC 00X Paralegal Craftsman Course was
revised to provide education and training skills, in addition to the required core tasks identified in the STS.

6.4. Training quality requirements resulting from this March 2011 STRT/U&TW may result in upgrade
training going beyond 24 months in some cases.

6.4.1. Air Force Reserve Annual Survey of the Law (ASOL). All ANG and USAFR paralegals will
attend the ASOL course within two years from accession. ANG paralegals will attend ASOL every other
year. USAFR paralegals will attend ASOL every four years thereafter.

7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs automatically upon
joining the United States Air Force. Note: Retrainees must request enrollment into the paralegal degree
program whereas non-prior service (NPS) are automatically enrolled. Additional off-duty education is a
personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals desiring to become an instructor must possess as
a minimum an associate degree or should be actively pursuing an associate degree. Special Duty
Assignment (SDA) requires an instructor candidate to have a CCAF degree or be within one year of
completion (45 semester hours). A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of
Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:

7.1. 3-Tier CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC). This revamped program replaces the existing CCAF
Occupational Instructor Certification (OIC) Program. It provides CCAF faculty a structured professional
development track and tangible recognition for advanced levels of knowledge, skills, education and
training, and instructional experience. The strengthened CCAF Instructor Certification program aligns
well with comparable state teacher certification requirements.

7.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is
awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment
process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman
(Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager). All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

7.3. Degree Requirements. Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-skill level must be awarded,
PCC must be successfully completed, and the following requirements must be met:

8.2. Paralegal Training Cycle. The Paralegal career field training cycle is different from most other
AFSCs due to being a primarily lateral career field. In addition to retraining personnel from different year
groups, recruiting and retraining within different grades compound the challenge of charting a by-year/by-
grade progression in this specialty. The chart below is provided only as an overview of a typical training
cycle with consideration for career field uniqueness.

8.3. Occupational Badges. The following guidance outlines requirements for, and heraldic significance
of, the Paralegal occupational badges. For additional information, see AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
Appearance of Air Force Personnel.



                   Basic – Worn upon completion of technical school




                   Senior – Worn after award of 7-skill level




                   Master – Worn as a master sergeant or above with 5 years in specialty from award of
                   7-skill level


                                         Heraldic Significance

The paralegal badge was approved in 1994. The insignia consists of the scales of justice with quills and
was taken from the Air Force judge advocate badge. The scales of justice represent the military legal
system, through which the Air Force maintains good order and discipline. Regardless of a paralegal’s
place of duty, the scales represent the commitment of the paralegal to the goal of justice in all adverse
actions. The scales also highlight the common critical link between the paralegal and the judge advocate.
The quill has long symbolized the scribe or tools by which the written word is produced. The quills are
crossed and rest under the base of the scales of justice to symbolize the essential support of the Air
Force legal system given by our paralegal force. The wreath encompassing the badge represents
excellence. The wreath surrounds all the other symbols to show that excellence is the standard of
performance for paralegals.

Section D - Resource Constraints
11. Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints which preclude optimal and desired
training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative
explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint
has on training are included. Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary
responsibility, and target completion dates. Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and
updated annually.

12. Apprentice 3-Skill Level Training.

12.1. Constraints. AFJAG School may be unable to teach STS performance tasks, such as AMJAMS
and AFCIMS, which requires hands-on computer training as new software is loaded and/or upgraded
unless computers are upgraded/replaced periodically.

12.1.1. Impact. Student computers require sufficient physical memory and processing speed to run
TJAGC mandated computer programs. TJAGC software upgrades with the potential to impact
compatibility with existing operating systems should be identified and coordinated between AFLOA/JAS
and AFJAGS well in advance of the actual release date. Inadequate computers or software compatibility
issues could limit hands-on student training and result in a training deficiency.

12.1.2. Resources Required. Purchase new computers and/or upgrade existing computers as needed
to meet mission requirements.

12.1.3. Action Required. Computers in classrooms at the AFJAGS should be replaced in same cycle as
the computers are replaced in base legal offices. This will ensure the AFJAG School and AFLOA/JAS
have the capability to provide instruction on and with the latest technology, computer software and
hardware utilized out in the field.

12.1.4. OPR/Target Completion Date. AFLOA/JAS and AFJAGS.

2011 and graduating on 22 November 2011.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge,
and Technical References (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level.
Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies by an asterisk ―*‖ specialty-wide training requirements.

NOTE: Tasks are functionally grouped by subject and/or job position to aid task selection and reduce
duplication. Supervisors may select tasks from any attachment to accurately define a job.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements.        Use automated training management systems to document technician
qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completed date. (As a minimum,
use the following column designators: Training Complete, Trainer Initials, Trainee Initials).

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to
be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the
career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements (Attachment 1) contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.5. Use to document task completion when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder
and used according to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6.

2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement
Squadron, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The test samples
knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate
for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based on study references listed in the WAPS catalog.
WAPS is not applicable to the Air Reserve Component.

2.7. Documentation. Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to
the task statement. Do not circle core tasks not related to the current duty position. As a minimum,
complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP: Training Completed, Trainee Initials, Trainer
Initials. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE:
The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed
necessary for their Career Field.

2.7.1. When completing the identification page, only the last 4 digits of the SSN are required.

2.7.2. Transcribing CFETP documentation. Transcribing CFETP documentation to a new CFETP is an
administrative function and not a re-evaluation of training. Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the
following procedures to transcribe. Use the new CFETP to identify current training requirements and
transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP. For tasks previously certified and required in the
current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current
date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or
supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column. For tasks previously certified but not required in the




                                                23
current duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials). Annotate
the AF Form 623a, (for example, ―I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was
transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.‖ signed, dated,
supervisor and trainee). After necessary actions are completed, post this sheet in the back of the
CFETP.

2.7.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously
certified for his or her assigned position, the supervisor lines through the previous certification or deletes
previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form
623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification. The
individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old entries or by using correction fluid (if the
entries were made in ink) and writing in the new entry over the previously certified date and initials.

2.7.4. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual
can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct
use of procedures.

2.8. This CFETP will be used during the initial evaluation of all newly assigned personnel.

3. Third Party Certification. Core tasks identified in this CFETP do not require third-party certification.

4. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to AFJAGS,
150 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6418. Reference specific STS paragraphs.

Section B--Course Objective List
1. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which
is measured using a written test, PC indicates required knowledge or task performance which is
measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both
knowledge and performance elements using a performance progress check and a written test. P
indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance test, while P/W indicates
separate measurement by a performance test and a written test. PC/P/W indicates separate
measurement by a progress check, performance test and a written test.

2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement
are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as allowed based on the STS proficiency code during the progress check, and students may be
required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. A student will
undergo academic review upon failing their second written examination or a written examination and two
performance tests or four performance tests. The range of actions includes probationary continuation,
special individualized assistance/re-test, or elimination.

3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the "2b" proficiency level which means the
student can do most parts of the tasks, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task
(partially proficient). The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.

4. Course Objectives: Course objectives for the Paralegal Apprentice and Paralegal Craftsman
Courses are under development and will be available prior to the CFETP publication date.
