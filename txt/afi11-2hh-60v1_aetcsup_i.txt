     1.2.4.11. Ensure assigned personnel involved in local/in unit training resulting in initial
     qualification, re-qualification, or instructor upgrade are advised of active duty service
     commitments. The unit-training officer will advise the servicing personnel office.
     1.2.4.12. Submit a training report to the appropriate MAJCOM/A3 (AFRC: 10 AF/A3T)
     (ANG: NGB/A3O) branch periodically during the training cycle as directed. Submit an
     out-of-cycle report anytime MAJCOM assistance is required to prepare for Designed
     Operational Capability (DOC) or Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) tasking.
     Units will adhere to guidance set forth by applicable MAJCOM RTM for submitting
     Training Health Reports, shortfalls, LIMFACs and deviations.
     1.2.4.12. (AETC) AETC units are exempt from shortfall report requirements. Notify 19
     AF/DO and HQ AETC/A3ZS anytime training shortfalls will impact HH-60 Programmed

        instruction to adequately prepare for and maintain proficiency in assigned flight-related
        activities.
        1.2.5.3. Participate only in sorties, events and tasks in which they are current and
        qualified, unless under direct supervision.
1.3. Processing Changes.
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume through command channels to
     MAJCOM/A3 on AF FORM 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to HQ ACC/A3.
     1.3.3. HQ ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic instruction with all MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Forward recommendations for changes to this volume to HQ USAF/A3OT for
        HQ USAF/A3 approval.
        1.3.3.3. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.4. Qualification Training. Training programs are designed to progress aircrew from Initial
and Mission Qualification Training (IQT/MQT) at a formal training course, to Local Mission
Qualification Training (LMQT) at the operational unit and finally to Continuation Training (CT)
throughout the normal training cycle. The following is an overview of qualification training:
     1.4.1. IQT provides aircrew the basic training necessary to initially qualify in flying duties
     without regard to any specific unit's mission. See Chapter 2. Upon completion of IQT, the
     aircrew member attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for
     all follow-on training, including MQT. Except for general officers above the wing level,
     BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any aircrew member other
     than general officers above the wing level to remain BAQ for longer than six months is
     MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3O).
     1.4.2. MQT begins at the Formal Training Unit (FTU) and is the advanced aircrew training
     necessary to qualify in flying duties that directly support a unit’s mission. See Chapter 3.
     1.4.3. LMQT continues the advanced mission training in the operationally assigned unit and
     consists of training in unit specific local tasks. Aircrew arriving from an FTU following
     IQT/MQT or requalification training will maintain BAQ status until complete with
     MQT/LMQT or the Instructor Training Theater Indoctrination (ITTI) course and earn
     subsequent designation as CMR/BMC. Personnel that are PCSing as a CMR or BMC
     aircrew member will maintain CMR/BMC status upon arrival at their next duty station.
     1.4.3. (AETC) LMQT. Accomplish theater indoctrination training IAW AFI 11-202,
     Volume 1, Aircrew Training. Each newly assigned or temporary duty aircrew member will
     complete a local indoctrination program prior to performing unsupervised primary aircrew
     duties. Each unit will publish outline specific ground and flight requirements. Design this
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                       9


  training to prepare aircrew members for theater operations and the unit’s operational mission.
  As a minimum, include ground training and a local flight to familiarize aircrew with the local
  flying area, available facilities and support agencies, theater or mission unique procedures,
  and theater unique instrument requirements. The instrument training portion will include
  theater unique procedures, the use of MAJCOM approved non-DoD instrument approach
  procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches, and theater weather conditions.
  Aircrews do not have to be at the controls to credit event. Aircrew administering training
  will be qualified in the same MDS. Formal Training Unit (FTU) students do not require this
  training as a separate folder if it is included in the formal courseware. Flight evaluations are
  not required for Unit / Theater indoctrination training.
  1.4.4. CT provides aircrew the training necessary to maintain flying proficiency and consists
  of two aspects. The first involves training in the basic flying skills necessary to ensure the
  safe operation of the aircraft (non RAP). The second consists of specific mission-related
  training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions (RAP). See Chapter 4.
  1.4.5. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is the CT program designed to focus training on
  capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core-tasked missions. Following completion of
  IQT and MQT/LMQT, units will assign aircrew to either a CMR position or a BMC position.
  CMR aircrew maintain combat readiness, while BMC aircrew may require additional training
  prior to combat. Each MAJCOM will publish a RAP Tasking memorandum to establish the
  CT requirements for CMR/BMC aircrew. Post the current RAP Tasking memo following
  this instruction.
     1.4.5.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) establishes the minimum training required for
     aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their
     assigned unit and weapons system. Designate and maintain CMR aircrew as follows:
         1.4.5.1.1. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1
         positions, flying squadron commander (SQ/CC) and squadron operations officers
         (SQ/DO) positions are designated CMR. Operations group commanders (OG/CCs)
         may designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR.
         EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line
         of their Unit Manning Personnel (UMPR) document API-1s to CMR and designate
         the overage BMC. (ANG/AFRC: Any aircrew member may be designated
         CMR/BMC at OG/CC discretion.)
         1.4.5.1.2. CMR aircrew members will maintain currency and qualification in all core
         missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR aircrew
         members will maintain currencies that affect CMR status and will accomplish all
         mission ground training and all core-designated flight training. Failure to complete
         this training or maintain these currencies will result in regression to non-CMR (N-
         CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, aircrew
         members may participate in missions, including exercise and contingency, in which
         they are current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
 10                                    AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


      1.4.5.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) establishes the minimum training required for
      aircrew members to be familiarized in all and may be qualified and proficient in some of
      the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit. Designate and maintain BMC aircrew
      members as follows:
          1.4.5.2.1. Active duty non-CMR aircrew member positions above squadron level are
          designated BMC. BMC positions are assigned to aircrew members who have a
          primary job performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the
          flying operation. FTU Instructor Aircrew members (IP/IF/IGs), United States Air
          Force Weapons School (USAFWS) IPs and operational test pilots are also designated
          BMC.
          1.4.5.2.2. BMC aircrew members will maintain familiarization with all unit core
          missions. They may also train for proficiency and qualification in some of those
          missions. For missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC aircrew
          members must be able to attain proficiency and qualification within 30 days. BMC
          aircrew members may be required to provide additional sortie generation capability,
          either in lieu of, or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons.
          1.4.5.2.3. BMC aircrew members will accomplish all mission-related ground training
          designated by their assigned SQ/CC. BMC aircrew members may deploy and
          participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified without
          additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC IAW paragraph 1.7.5 Failure to
          complete required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While
          N-BMC, the SQ/CC will determine which missions the aircrew members may
          perform and the supervision required.
      1.4.5.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrew members who regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status
      will accomplish the requirements in paragraph 4.7 in a timely manner to regain
      CMR/BMC status.
      1.4.5.4. Specialized Training. Units will qualify aircrew members in the special
      capabilities necessary to carry out assigned missions and DOC tasking. Specialized
      training consists of training programs such as Flight Lead Upgrade (FLUG), Instructor
      Upgrade, Functional Check Flight (FCF), shipboard ops and Night Vision Goggles
      (NVG) water operations. Specialized training is accomplished after an aircrew member
      is designated CMR/BMC and in addition to basic requirements. Unless otherwise
      specified, aircrew members in CMR/BMC positions may maintain special
      certifications/qualifications if they are able to accomplish the additional training
      requirements. See Chapter 5.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Units will design aircrew training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat
   readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the
   need for realism against the expected threat, individual capabilities and safety. This
   instruction provides training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures
   specified in applicable flying operations publications.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      11


   1.5.2. The AETC Bookstore CoP is the primary source for new courseware and/or syllabi
   (other than USAFWS formal products). When such products are not available, MAJCOM
   approved products may be used. ACC approved syllabi are posted at the ACC/A3TO CoP.
   When no MAJCOM approved courseware is published, units may develop in-unit training
   programs and syllabi. Submit these products through channels to MAJCOM/A3T or lead
   command (ACC/A3T) for approval prior to implementation.
   1.5.2. (AETC) For nonexistent formal school courseware applicable to only one unit, the
   unit training officer will develop local courseware to forward to 19 AF/DO for approval. For
   any events listed as requiring ―MAJCOM or Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) approved
   courseware‖ the OG/CC is delegated approval authority for unit-developed training
   programs. Forward copies of approved unit-developed training program to 19 AF/DOR.
   1.5.3. Units will design a training program to achieve combat capability in tasked missions,
   maintain aircrew proficiency and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, and intelligence
   briefing/debriefing). Tactical training should include use of inert and live ordnance, threat
   simulators, countermeasures and dissimilar aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   1.5.4. In-Flight Supervision.
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, SQ/CC or designated representative determine the
      level of supervision necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission
      objectives include introductory tasks or instruction to correct previous training
      discrepancies, then an Instructor is required.
   1.5.5. During all formal training, if a Break in Training (BIT) exceeds the time listed in the
   appropriate SOI/ Training Plan, an extra training sortie (X-ride) will either be awarded and
   flown (N/A AFRC and ANG) or the training section must document the reasons this
   additional training is not required (waiver authority is the unit operations officer). Complete
   all formal training programs within 120 calendar days. If training exceeds this limit, notify
   MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC: 10 AF/A3T). An extension of 120 days is granted automatically.
   Any additional extensions must be approved by MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC: 10 AF/A3T).
1.6. Experienced Aircrew Requirements.
   1.6.1. Aircrew members require a minimum number of flight hours to be considered
   experienced (EXP) in the aircraft IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. Inexperienced
   (INEXP) pilots/aircrew must train at a higher rate to maintain currencies and proficiencies.
   Training tables in the RAP tasking Memorandum define requirements for both EXP and
   INEXP levels.

1.7. RAP Training Management.
   1.7.1. The RAP Training cycle is equal in length to the AEF cycle, or a calendar year, based
   on the unit’s mission. For units tasked against the AS cycle, RAP tasking is aligned with
   current training cycle for HH-60s and executed IAW the current HH-60G RAP Tasking
   memorandum. This volume, along with the RAP Tasking Memo and MAJCOM
   supplements, will establish the RAP sortie requirements for each qualification and experience
   level. These levels form the basis for additional RAP tasking, including requirements for
   special capabilities, mission types, training events and weapons qualifications.
   1.7.2. The total number of RAP sorties for a qualification level is the primary factor for
   maintaining aircrew qualification levels. Units will follow guidelines for RAP sortie types to
   the maximum extent possible, with minor variances authorized. SQ/CCs may use variations
   in sortie types as a basis for aircrew regression. Qualification in a mission is determined by
   the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual aircrew member’s
   capabilities.
   1.7.3. Aircrew members must accomplish a tactical mission profile or a building block-type
   sortie that supports the unit’s mission to receive credit for an effective RAP training sortie.
   Each sortie profile requires successful completion of a significant portion of the events
   applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 3.
   1.7.4. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew members to CMR.
   1.7.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires the following:
         1.7.5.1. Completion of mission-related ground training, including verification.
         1.7.5.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
         1.7.5.3. Attaining one-month look back at the higher CMR sortie rate.
         1.7.5.4. Confirmation that the progressed aircrew member can complete the prorated
         number of sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
         1.7.5.5. SQ/CC certification.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                     13


   1.7.6. SQ/CCs will designate aircrew members to train for and maintain special certifications
   or qualifications. RAP training requirements for special certifications are accomplished in
   addition to baseline CMR/BMC requirements.
   1.7.7. Wing CMR/BMC aircrew members will fly the required monthly sortie rate.              If
   unable, refer to regression procedures, paragraph 4.7
   1.7.8. End-of-cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew member’s experience
   level on the last day of the current training cycle.
1.8. RAP Training Development.
   1.8.1. RAP sortie and event requirements defined in Attachment 3 apply to CMR/BMC
   aircrew members as well as those carrying special certifications or qualifications and are
   IAW the RAP Tasking memorandum. The standard sortie requirements are IAW the current
   RAP tasking message and this instruction. EXCEPTION: API-8/D personnel.
   1.8.2. Non-RAP requirements, such as Instrument and Aircraft Handling Characteristics
   (AHC), are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties and events, which are shown in
   RAP Tasking memo, ensure aircrews maintain basic skills.
   1.8.3. Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing RAP training and
   unit flying hour programs.
      1.8.3.1. Collateral sorties, such as Cost of Business sorties, are not directly related to
      combat employment training but are necessary in day-to-day squadron operations. These
      include flight evaluations, Functional Check Flights (FCF), ferry flights, deployments, air
      shows, etc. During the training cycle, MAJCOMs will allocate a block of sorties to each
      unit for these purposes.
   1.8.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training sorties. Aircrew members may log any training sortie as non-
   effective when a major portion of valid training for that type of mission cannot be
   accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts or other unexpected circumstances. In order to
   allocate the number of attrition sorties accurately, it is essential that aircrews log non-
   effective sorties appropriately.
1.9. Training Records and Reports.
   1.9.1. Units will maintain records for individual training and flight evaluations IAW the
   following AFIs and applicable MAJCOM instructions:
      1.9.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
      1.9.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
      1.9.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
      1.9.1.4. Flight Engineers (FEs) and Aerial Gunners (AGs) are exempt from maintaining
      AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, according to AFI 36-2201V3, Air
      Force Training Program on the Job Training Administration and Air Force Specialty
      Code (AFSC) 1A1X1/1A7X1, Career Field Education and Training Plan.
 14                                  AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


   1.9.2. Aircrew Permanent Training Folders. Units will maintain a permanent training folder
   on each crewmember: Unit-training officers will ensure folders are sent IAW paragraph
   6.2.3. to the gaining unit. Training folder minimum requirements are IAW Chapter 6
   1.9.3. Aircrew Flight Records. Track the following information for all aircrew members, as
   appropriate:
       1.9.3.1. Ground training.
       1.9.3.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie
       types and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.9.3.3. Total RAP sorties for one-month and three-month lookback.
       1.9.3.4. Currencies.
   1.9.4. Units will update Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) ―No Date‖ with
   either the date of the last FTU or USAFWS-equivalent training accomplished, or the unit
   mission certification date.
   1.9.5. In-Unit Specialized and Upgrade Training. The unit-training officer will prepare a
   Training Folder before beginning unit-level training. Units will use applicable formal
   school/MAJCOM approved courseware content as a minimum. Specialized training is added
   to reflect unique local requirements.
1.10. Aircrew Utilization Policy.
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group tactical crewmembers (API-1/6/A/Bs) fill
   authorized positions IAW unit manpower documents and that crewmember status is properly
   designated. The overall objective is that aircrew crewmembers perform combat related
   duties. Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying
   Evaluation Board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors
   involved, such as level of crewmember tasking, flying proficiency, currency and experience.
   Supervisors should limit the non-flying duties of inexperienced crewmembers during the first
   year of initial operational assignment.
   1.10.2. Various publications allow supervisors to assign duties to CAF API-1 crewmembers
   to include weapons and tactics officer/noncommissioned officer (NCO), programmer, flight
   safety officer, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except
   ARMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), squadron
   flight equipment officer and electronic combat officer. In some instances, squadrons may
   assign API 1 (flight safety officers, etc) to the wing. Units will not attach API-1s to wing
   staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1/6 manning is 100 percent or
   better (N/A AETC). CCs will ensure wing staff crewmembers (API-6s) perform duties
   justified in MAJCOM manpower standards and documented on the UMDs.
1.11. Sortie Allocation and Unit Manning Guidance.
   1.11.1. Inexperienced API-1 crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over

     6/B, BMC (to include API-5 pilot physicians).
     1.11.1.3. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by
     MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training
     requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions, API 5 crewmember
     physicians.
  1.11.2. Wing API-6/B authorizations are IAW unit manpower documents. Active duty
  wings converting to new Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) are authorized one SQ equivalent
  of additional API 6s during the conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new
  aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage.
  1.11.3. For FTU only wings, all API-6/B crewmembers will maintain instructor status
  (optional for WG/GP CC, FCF crewmembers, and one other). These wings will fly API-
  1/6/A/B crewmembers as required by program flying training (PFT) document.
  1.11.4. API-8/D (above wing level) rated personnel flying authorizations and Test Unit
  crewmembers will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. They will fly the BMC
  rate; however, they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events, or meet
  monthly lookback requirements. Units should provide assigned API-6/8/B/D flyers adequate
  resources to maintain minimum training requirements. Wings are allocated flying hours for
  attached API-8/Ds. API-6/8B/D flyers will accomplish Non-RAP requirements with allotted
  BMC sorties. However, API-6/8B/D flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying
  squadron’s primary mission. If units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must
  request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments
  for attached API-8/D and applicable API-6/B flyers must request program changes IAW
  MAJCOM directives.
  1.11.5. CMR crewmembers have no maximum sortie requirement. See Table 1.2 for
  minimum and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers. Unique operations may
  require crewmembers to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized.
  Document details of these events in the member’s permanent training folder.

                                            Chapter 2

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of aircrew into unit
aircraft.
   2.1.1. Formal Training. IQT includes Initial Qualification (IQ) training, Transition (TX)
   and Senior Officer Course (SOC) training, which will be conducted during formal syllabus
   courses at FTU squadrons whenever possible. Graduates of IQT will be proficient in mission
   tasks as indicated by the Course Training Standards (CTS) and Required Proficiency Levels
   (RPL) of the FTU syllabi.
   2.1.2. Local Training. In exceptional circumstances when FTU training is not available
   within a reasonable time period, or if required training qualifications remain unaccomplished,
   local IQT may be conducted at the unit IAW the provisions of this chapter. When local IQT
   is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this
   training. Conduct local IQT using MAJCOM approved courseware.
2.2. Approval and Waiver for Local IQT.
   2.2.1. Gaining MAJCOM/A3T (ANG: NGB/A3O) is approval authority to conduct local
   IQT. Info HQ ACC/A3T.
   2.2.2. Gaining MAJCOM/A3T (ANG: NGB/A3O) is waiver authority to change the
   requirements of the formal course syllabus for local IQT. Coordinate changes through HQ
   ACC/A3T.
   2.2.3. Gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG: NGB/CF) is the approval authority for local IQT for
   colonel-selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.4. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.4.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of FTU training.
       2.2.4.2. Summary of individual's flying experience.
       2.2.4.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.4.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus
and      USAF      Education    and      Training   Course    Announcements       (ETCA).
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
2.4. Ground Training. Conduct ground training IAW formal school courseware. FTU syllabi,
student guides, instructor guides and audiovisual programs will be used as supporting materials
to the maximum extent possible. If the FTU simulators are not available, complete the training
objectives in any MAJCOM-approved H-60 simulator or the actual aircraft. When completing
training in the aircraft, items that cannot be completed safely (e.g., high-speed shaft failure or
complete loss of tail rotor thrust) may be covered during table-talk discussion. Sequence of
training waivers may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the unit operations officer.
MAJCOM/A3T must approve all other modifications to formal school products.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      19


2.5. Flying Training.
   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course
   syllabus flow chart. The unit operations officer may approve out of sequence training on a
   case by case basis.
   2.5.1. (AETC) Out of sequence training approval authority will be IAW the applicable
   syllabus.
   2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved.
   Failure to complete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3T, or equivalent, (ANG: NGB/A3O) with individual’s name, rank, reason for
   delay, planned actions and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Crewmembers in IQT will fly under instructor supervision until completing the
   qualification evaluation.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and mission tasks are minimum
   requirements for IQT. The SQ/CC may authorize additional training events to the IQT
   program based on student proficiency and background. Additional training due to student
   non-progression is available within the constraints of the formal course syllabus and may
   also be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
   2.5.5. An instructor flight engineer (IF) can conduct initial and recurring training for aerial
   gunners in all tasks. An instructor aerial gunner (IG) can conduct initial and recurring
   training in like tasks. Reference Table 5.2 for like tasks.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training Requirements. Air
Force requirements do not currently dictate a formal differences training program for HH-60
variants (e.g., UH-60 A/L). However, IAW AFI 11-2HH-60 Vol 3 HH-60 Operations
Procedures, current/qualified H-60 crewmembers from other services may occupy a crew
position on the HH-60G after completing a differences familiarization. This training shall be
conducted by an Air Force HH-60G instructor and will cover the following minimum areas:
cockpit familiarization (emphasizing the differences between the HH-60G and the applicable
variant), Air Force remote techniques and Air Force CRM procedures (emphasizing the ―triangle
calls‖ between all four crewmembers during each approach). This training shall be documented
on an MFR and retained locally until the applicable inter-service training is complete.
2.7. Formal Training for Senior Officers. Conduct formal training for senior officers (colonel
selectees and above) IAW procedures outlined below.
   2.7.1. All formal training courses for senior officers will be completed at the FTU unless
   waived IAW para 2.2.1.
   2.7.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives and para 2.3
   2.7.3. Senior officers in training at the FTU are in formal training status. Arrangements
   must be made to ensure home station duties do not detract excessively from their primary
   responsibility to complete this training in a timely and efficient manner.

  2.7.4. Commanders and Key Staff Course. Commanders Key Staff Course is for approved
  senior officers/commanders who supervise/oversee flying operations of the HH-60G. Only
  rated pilots will occupy a seat with a set of flight controls. All non-rated crew members will
  receive required FAM training and observe operations from the cabin. This course provides
  basic orientation to senior officers who supervise/oversee flying operations for aircraft in
  which they are not qualified, IAW the ETCA. The primary method of course completion is
  at the FTU. Secondary method of training is in-unit (if primary method is not available)
  using formal school courseware adapted to local training resources. A waiver from
  MAJCOM/A3T is required for secondary method of training. Completion of this course does
  not establish a qualification or currency requirement, as the course is only an orientation of
  USAF helicopter operations and capabilities. Graduates of this course will not be designated
  in command and will fly with instructor pilots only.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                   21

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is conducted in two phases. The bulk of mission training is a formal
syllabus course, normally conducted at the FTU. A Local Mission Qualification Training
(LMQT) course is taught at each unit to complete training not provided at the FTU and train
crewmembers on unit-specific mission tasks. For the purposes of this chapter, ―MQT‖ refers to
the FTU syllabus portion of mission training, and ―LMQT‖ refers to unit-specific mission
training.
   3.1.1. Aircrew arriving from an FTU following IQT/MQT or requalification training will
   maintain BAQ status until complete with MQT/LMQT or the Instructor Training Theater
   Indoctrination (ITTI) course and earn subsequent designation as CMR/BMC. Personnel that
   are PCSing as a CMR or BMC aircrew member will maintain CMR/BMC status upon arrival
   at their next duty station. For these personnel, LMQT will be used to train aircrew members
   in unit specific local tasks but will not affect CMR/BMC status.
3.2. General Requirements.
   3.2.1. Approval/Waiver authority to change the formal requirements of MQT is
   MAJCOM/A3T, or equivalent.
   3.2.2. Use applicable formal school courseware for required training if available.
   Instructions and technical orders take precedence over courseware. Units are not required to
   use courseware material and examinations requiring resources available only at the formal
   school or material unique to the formal school flying area.
   3.2.3. Successful completion of MQT requires upgrading crewmembers to complete an
   aircraft  mission    qualification  evaluation  IAW    AFI   11-202V2,    Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-2HH-60V2, HH-60--Aircrew Evaluation
   Criteria.
   3.2.4. Crewmembers in MQT should be devoted exclusively to their formal training.
   However, with operations officer approval, they may fly on basic qualification/instrument
   sorties so long as the local area familiarization requirements of LMQT have been met IAW
   para 3.6.2.1 AETC crews, as defined in the formal course syllabi, are exempt from this
   requirement.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites for MQT will be IAW the appropriate AETC
formal course syllabus and the Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). Refer
to the ETCA web site at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp/. Course prerequisites for
LMQT will be IAW MAJCOM-developed syllabi and courseware.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the
appropriate formal course syllabus flow chart. Sequence of training waivers may be approved on
a case-by-case basis by the unit operations officer.
   3.4.1. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for
   MQT. Additional training events, based on student proficiency and background, may be
   incorporated into the MQT program with authorization of the unit commander. Additional
22                                   AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


  training due to student non-progression is also available within the constraints of the formal
  course syllabus at the discretion of the unit commander. NOTE: Crewmembers approved
  for in-unit initial mission qualification training with no prior NVG qualification are required
  to attend a Night Vision Device (NVD) lab prior to entering the night (NVG) phase of flight
  training.
  3.4.2. In addition to syllabus requirements, crewmembers may also receive some or all of the
  following mission ground training (as applicable):
     3.4.2.1. Chemical Warfare (CW) Training -Aircrew Chemical Defense Training
     (ACDT). This training is normally completed during LMQT. See para 3.6.2.8.3
     3.4.2.2. Combat Survival Training Initial. This training must be completed at the
     survival FTU IAW the ETCA. It is required prior to first operational assignment IAW
     AFI 16-1301.
     3.4.2.3. Egress Training with Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE).                This
     training is normally conducted during LMQT. See para 3.6.2.8.2
     3.4.2.4. Personnel/Equipment Delivery One-Time. Flight Engineers and Aerial Gunners
     required to perform personnel/equipment delivery by parachute on the HH-60 will
     accomplish one-time familiarization training of both static line and freefall procedures
     under the supervision of a current and qualified Jumpmaster (JM), instructor flight
     engineer (IF) or instructor gunner (IG). Training will consist of one ground training
     session; covering familiarization of ―safety man‖ procedures, hazards, and cabin
     preparation procedures, using FM 3-21.220/AFMAN 11-420, Static Line Parachuting
     Techniques and Tactics and AFMAN 11-411, Special Forces Military Free-Fall
     Operations. Crewmembers will be instructed in JM hand and arm signals. Training will
     also include hands-on orientation of static line rigging and aircraft configuration.
     Crewmembers will not participate in personnel or equipment parachute operations until
     training is received. Successful completion of certification will be annotated on an AF
     FORM 1381/AF Form 4348, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, and maintained in
     the individual's FEF and should be tracked in the unit letter of Xs unless otherwise noted.
     3.4.2.5. Pyrotechnic Familiarization Training. All crewmembers will receive initial
     pyrotechnic familiarization training covering the types of pyrotechnics carried aboard
     unit equipped aircraft, loading characteristics in accordance with T.O.’s 11A10-24-7,
     11A10-25-7, and 11A10-26-7, and types of pyrotechnics required for a given mission.
     Crewmembers shall not deploy any aircraft pyrotechnics until receiving this training.
         3.4.2.5.1. Conduct in-unit familiarization of new pyrotechnics received by the unit
         and for crewmembers who did not attend formal training. Commanders will select
         the most qualified instructor aircrew members to conduct the training. These
         instructors must be thoroughly familiar with AFOSH standards, applicable TOs, the
         formal school training syllabus and the applicable operational procedures-series
         publications. Accomplish required flight training IAW applicable training syllabus.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      23


          3.4.2.5.2. Document initial familiarization training as ―Pyrotechnic Familiarization
          Training.‖ Document subsequent familiarization training or training on new
          pyrotechnics by listing the type of pyrotechnic in the aircrew member’s permanent
          training folder (example--―Pyrotechnic Familiarization Training, M14 Grenade -
          Incendiary‖).
          3.4.2.5.3. In addition to the training listed above, flight engineers and aerial gunners
          will receive additional qualification training. This training will consist of the
          following minimum topics: ground storage, aircraft storage, vehicle loading, aircraft
          loading restrictions, manual launch procedures.
       3.4.2.6. Small Arms Qualification Training. All mission-qualified crewmembers will
       maintain weapons qualification IAW current RAP Tasking Memo. Unit commanders
       will determine additional proficiency requirements, such as formal off-site weapons
       training or home station weapons training through use of authorized proficiency
       munitions. When additional weapons are carried onboard the aircraft, the unit
       commander will designate in writing which crew positions will maintain qualification in
       those weapons. Individuals are considered qualified for the entire duration of the
       deployment regardless of length. Upon return, if the garrison standard qualification date
       has passed, an individual must re-accomplish live fire qualification and Use of Force
       training before being armed.
       3.4.2.7. Underwater Egress Training Initial (S-V84-A). In accordance with ETCA, this
       training is conducted at various locations. It is required for all HH-60 helicopter
       crewmembers and personnel receiving hazardous duty incentive pay for flying on USAF
       helicopters prior to over water operations beyond autorotational distance from land. This
       training also includes initial HEED training.
          3.4.2.7.1. Key Staff personnel are not considered HH-60 Crew Members and are not
          required to attend the Initial Underwater Egress course. Key Staff personnel that fly
          sorties over water should attend the local Underwater Egress/Helicopter Water
          Survival Refresher Courses.
       3.4.2.8. Water Survival Training (WST) Initial (S-V86-A/S-V90-A). This training is
       normally completed at the survival FTU IAW the ETCA. It is required prior to first
       operational assignment IAW AFI 16-1301.

be IAW the applicable syllabus.
3.6. Mission Specific Requirements. Local Mission Qualification Training (LMQT) is
designed to familiarize crewmembers with the local operating area, top off any training not
completed during IQT/MQT, and to train them on unique aspects of that unit’s mission. It is
required for all crewmembers upon PCS to a new base.
24                                   AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


  3.6.1. Complete LMQT within the time specified by the MAJCOM but no later than (NLT)
  90 calendar days after the crewmember’s first training day at the gaining operational unit
  (ARC: NLT 180 days from date of the first flight). In-unit training will begin no later than
  45 days [90 days for the Air Reserve Component (ARC)] after reporting to a new duty station
  or unit, unless waived by the MAJCOM. Training is complete upon unit commander
  certification to BMC or CMR. Personnel that are PCSing as a CMR or BMC aircrew
  member will maintain CMR/BMC status upon arrival at their next duty station. For these
  personnel, LMQT will be used to train in unit specific local tasks but will not affect
  CMR/BMC status. Failure to complete LMQT within the specified time interval requires
  notification of the MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC: 10 AF/A3T) with crewmember’s name, rank,
  reason for delay, planned actions and estimated completion date. EXCEPTION: ARC
  commanders may allow crewmembers to delay completion of non-aircraft related ground
  training for a maximum of 1 year from date of unit assignment as long as safety and mission
  capability are not degraded.
     3.6.1.1. Crewmembers in units North of 60 latitude who enter LMQT between 1 Apr and
     1 Aug have until 31 Oct to complete required night training events. Additionally,
     individuals who are unable to complete night LMQT prior to 1 Apr have until 31 Oct to
     complete training. The unit commander may report crewmembers that are not LMQT
     complete for night events as MR during this period for local area flight training only. If
     aircrew member is assigned TDY or deployed to an area south of 60º latitude, they must
     gain night currency prior to assuming CMR duties at the TDY or deployed location.
     NOTE: Units assigned to areas having limited availability to prosecute useful night
     sorties due to local flying restrictions may supplement para 3.6.1.1. as necessary. Under
     no circumstances will the time periods be less restrictive than those indicated in para
     3.6.1.1. MAJCOM A3T or equivalent is the approval authority.
  3.6.2. LMQT Requirements. An Instructor will conduct all LMQT instruction in the
  respective crew position unless otherwise noted. Conduct training IAW the MAJCOM
  approved LMQT syllabus. The unit may give credit for equivalent training completed during
  a previous assignment or during IQT/MQT. Units are authorized to tailor other portions of
  this program based on each individual’s qualification, experience, documented performance
  and amount of formal training. The unit operations officer will make an annotation in the
  crewmember’s training folder detailing any modifications to the LMQT program and the
  justification for these changes. Complete flying training lessons in the sequence prescribed
  in the MAJCOM approved SOI, unless waived by the unit operations officer. Syllabus
  flights may be combined as appropriate. Units may add additional ground and flight training
  as desired, but the program must include the following minimum events (except when
  waived IAW procedures above).
     3.6.2.1. Local Area Familiarization. This training will consist of at least one ground
     training session and one day flight in the local area. Emphasis will be placed on ATC
     procedures, arrival/departure requirements, local geography, topography and obstacles.
     This training may be completed by a highly experienced crewmember in the same crew
     position in lieu of an instructor with approval of the unit operations officer. The unit
     training officer must ensure this is annotated in the individual’s career training folder and
     all required documentation is completed. Crewmembers will not fly any unsupervised
     sorties in the local area until this training is complete. NOTE: Flyers transferring

     between overseas locations or from the CONUS to an overseas location require Theater
     Indoctrination Training before flying without a theater experienced instructor IAW AFI
     11-202 Vol 1.
     3.6.2.2. Emergency procedures sortie. Pilots and flight engineers must conduct airborne
     EP training during one of the LMQT sorties. Normally this should be the first sortie in
     the program. Local instrument training should also be conducted when practical.
     NOTE: This training sortie is also desired for newly arrived aerial gunners when
     feasible.
     3.6.2.3. Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT). This training consists of at least
     one ground training session and two flights. This training is designed to provide an
     orientation to the typical terrain, obstacles, hazards and landing zones that crewmembers
     will encounter in the unit’s low level training area. This training may be completed by a
     highly experienced crewmember in the same crew position in lieu of an instructor with
     approval of the unit operations officer. The unit training officer must ensure this is
     annotated in the individual’s career training folder and all required documentation is
     completed. Crewmembers will not fly unsupervised tactical sorties until this training is
     complete.
        3.6.2.3.1. LASDT 1. Fly a route in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
        Begin the training at a minimum altitude of 300 feet AHO, then step down to a
        minimum altitude of 100 feet AHO once familiarity is attained. At least one segment
        of the route must be flown down to 50 feet AHO (N/A AFRC).
        3.6.2.3.2. LASDT 2: Fly a route in night VMC conditions on NVGs at a minimum
        altitude of 100 feet AHO. At least one segment of the route must be flown down to 50
        feet AHO.
     3.6.2.4. Tactical Top-Off. This training is designed for first assignment crewmembers
     arriving direct from the FTU. The purpose is to complete instruction on tactical flying
     events not adequately addressed at the FTU. It shall consist of at least one ground
     training session and two tactical flights (one day and one night). Emphasis shall be
     placed on terminal operations, gunnery patterns and any other items deemed appropriate
     by the unit operations officer.
        3.6.2.4.1. . Verification Planning Exercise Initial. This training consists of an in-
        depth combat rescue mission planning scenario. It is designed to be the culmination
        of all tactical training where crewmembers have the opportunity to apply the
        knowledge they have gained. It is normally completed with a full crew complement.
        Refer to the Verification Guide for CSAR in Attachment 4 for specific guidelines on
        developing a verification planning exercise. NOTE: Initial Verification Planning
        Exercise must be completed within 120 days (ARC: 180 days) of being certified
        CMR or the crewmember will be regressed to N-CMR status until training is
        accomplished.

     3.6.2.5. Initial Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training (CDTQT). This a one-
     time event per ACDE type of equipment. This training reinforces the crewmember’s
     awareness of limitations and demonstrates physiological effects while wearing the
     aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE). All initial CDTQT training events may
     dual-credit recurring events for the cycle in which they are completed. Reference
     applicable MAJCOM RTM for recurring CDTQT flying requirements.
        3.6.2.5.1. Chemical Warfare Training -Aircrew Chemical Defense Training. This
        training is the ground training portion of CDTQT. This training must be completed
        before the initial aircraft CDTQT flight. Conduct initial ACDT IAW AFI 11-301 Vol
        1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program.
        3.6.2.5.2. Egress with ACDE. Conduct egress with ACDE training IAW AFI 11-301
        Vol 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. This training is normally
        completed at the same time as the initial CDTQT flight.
        3.6.2.5.3. Initial CDTQT. Conduct the initial CDTQT flight IAW the procedures
        outlined below.
           3.6.2.5.3.1. The initial CDTQT flight will not be conducted at night, over-water,
           or in the simulator.
           3.6.2.5.3.2. Do not conduct CDTQT flights when temperature/dew point
           conditions fall outside the ―normal‖ range of the fighter index of thermal stress
           (FITS) in AFPAM 48-151 Thermal Injury.               Commanders may certify
           crewmembers as LMQT complete for this task and carry them as CMR until they
           can comply with FITS chart restrictions.
           3.6.2.5.3.3. Crew members will wear the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble
           (ACDE), crewmembers will wear the ACDE above-the-shoulder equipment only
           (mask assembly and blower) with cotton gloves, butyl rubber gloves and NOMEX
           gloves. In either case, ACDE ensembles will come from unit training assets.
           3.6.2.5.3.4. Crewmembers will perform primary crew duty tasks while wearing
           the ACDE during a day tactical training flight. The required components must be
           worn for a minimum of one hour to earn credit for this training. At least one take-
           off and one landing will be performed. The remainder of the time should be
           devoted to a cross section of normal flight tasks. At least 50% of the total time
           must be actual flight time. The remaining portion may be comprised of ground
           tasks (e.g., preflight, engine start/shutdown, taxi, etc). NOTE: There is a
           substantial risk of degraded performance during operations conducted while
           wearing chemical defense components. Therefore, in the interests of operational
           risk management, it is imperative to build an acceptable margin of safety into this
           training. All crewmembers completing an initial CDTQT flight must have a
           dedicated instructor in their respective crew position not wearing chemical
           defense components who will act as a safety observer (this individual must be
           current and qualified in CDTQT). For pilots, this safety observer must occupy a
           seat with a set of controls. Observers must closely monitor crewmember actions
           during CDTQT. If a crewmember experiences difficulty, such as excessive
           thermal stress, hyperventilation, headaches, etc., and either the observer or
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                    27


             crewmember believes it is unsafe to continue, tactical training should be
             terminated and the ACDE removed.
   3.6.3. TDY Aircrew Members. Unit commanders will establish familiarization requirements
   for higher headquarters supervisory personnel and stan/eval personnel, as well as TDY
   aircrew members required to conduct specific operational missions or administer training or
   evaluation flights. These crewmembers must familiarize themselves with the local
   environment to the maximum extent practical before their first flight.
3.7. Flight Surgeon.
   3.7.1. Ground Training. Flight surgeons will comply with requirements IAW AFI 11-
   202V1. NOTE: For immediate SAR missions follow briefing requirements for passengers.
   3.7.2. Flight Training. Aircraft commanders will ensure flight surgeons receive adequate
   supervision/instruction when flying on unit assigned aircraft.
      3.7.2.1. The briefing and sortie will emphasize crew coordination, communications and
      aircraft equipment.
      3.7.2.2. The initial sortie may be flown in conjunction with other training sorties.
      3.7.2.3. Flight surgeons whose primary assigned aircraft is the HH-60G must attend
      Underwater Egress Training (UET) and Helicopter Emergency Escape Device (HEED)
      (N/A AETC).

       commanders may authorize their participation IAW their specific experience and
       qualification.

4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency.
   4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3) may authorize qualification in more than one MDS
   aircraft for crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission
   requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below
   MAJCOM level. Unless required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not
   permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in
   support aircraft. Individuals assigned to positions covered by paragraph 4.5.2 of this
   instruction have MAJCOM/A3 approval and do not need to submit specific requests.
      4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to
      MAJCOM/A3TV (or equivalent). All requests must contain full justification. Approval
      for multiple qualification requests must be provided to the appropriate host base flight
      management office; flight accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is
      updated into ARMS.
      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the
      crewmember is assigned to a specific position and aircraft identified in writing by
      MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).
   4.5.2. HH-60G, MH-60G and UH-60A/L are considered the same MDS.
   4.5.3. Multiple qualifications are not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft. Wing commanders will qualify in only one of the wing’s aircraft.
   Either the WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in another wing aircraft (not the same as the
   WG/CC).
   4.5.4. Multiple Requirements. Crewmembers will satisfy at least 50% of the sortie
   requirements of their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP
   sortie/event requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, crewmembers will fly an
   equitable distribution of EP sorties, non-precision approaches and precision approaches in
   each MDS to fill their Non-RAP requirements.
   4.5.5. Multiple Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft.
   Enlisted crewmembers will fly at least once each 60 days in each aircraft. They will comply
   with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.5.5. (AETC) Multiple Currencies. Aircrew members qualified in the Mi-17 may credit the
   following events flown in the Mi-17 for Table 4.2 and Table 4.3; however, if Mi-17
   currency is applied toward HH-60 currency, the subsequent event must be accomplished in
   the HH-60.
      4.5.5.1. (Added-AETC) Basic sortie (pilots).
      4.5.5.2. (Added-AETC) Contact sortie (pilots).
      4.5.5.3. (Added-AETC) Instrument approach (pilots).
      4.5.5.4. (Added-AETC) Proficiency sortie (pilots/FEs/AG).
      4.5.5.5. (Added-AETC) Remote sortie (pilots).
      4.5.5.6. (Added-AETC) Night/NVG sortie (pilots/FEs/AGs).
      4.5.5.7. (Added-AETC) Day tactical (pilots/FEs/AGs).
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      33


      4.5.5.8. (Added-AETC) NVG tactical (pilots/FEs/AGs).
      4.5.5.9. (Added-AETC) Alternate insertion/extraction (pilots/FEs/AGs).
   4.5.6. Aircrew members must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.
4.6. Currencies/Re-Currency/Re-Qualification.
   4.6.1. Currency. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 define currency requirements for all HH-60
   crewmembers. If a crewmember loses a particular currency, that sortie/event may not be
   performed except for the purpose of regaining currency as noted. Supervision requirements
   are defined in Table 4.2 and 4.3
   4.6.1. (AETC) Currency. If an individual is noncurrent for an event, the individual needs to
   demonstrate competency to an instructor to regain currency.
      4.6.1.1. Loss of Currency Up to 6 Months. Training as directed by the squadron
      commander and demonstrate proficiency in non-current event(s) IAW with Table 4.2 and
      Table 4.3 Events performed under squadron supervision may be credited toward the
      applicable currency period. Supervision may be reduced to an experienced aircraft
      commander, current in the delinquent event, for conducting recurring pilot training with
      SQ/CC or designated representative approval on a case by case basis. Reference Table
      4.2 ―notes‖ for applicable events. Supervision may be reduced to an experienced mission
      flight engineer (MF) or experienced mission aerial gunner (MG), current in the
      delinquent event, to conduct recurring training with SQ/CC or designated representative
      approval in like tasks for both flight engineers and aerial gunners on a case by case basis.
      Reference Table 4.3 ―notes‖ for applicable events. ―Like Tasks‖ are defined in Table
      5.2 An instructor aerial gunner (IG) can conduct initial and recurring training for aerial
      gunners and initial and recurring training in like tasks for flight engineers. ―Like Tasks‖
      are defined in Table 5.2 An instructor flight engineer can conduct initial and recurring
      training for both flight engineers and aerial gunners. SQ/CC will track experienced
      MP/MF/MG authorized to perform flight supervision duties on locally generated Letter
      of X’s (or equivalent). While performing flight supervision duties, second character duty
      code will be IAW AFI 11-401.
      4.6.1.2. Greater than 6 Months (Unqualified). IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V2.
      NOTE: Loss of currency for more than 6 months for instructor certified events does not
      result in loss of any aircrew qualification. In these cases, crewmembers will accomplish
      training as directed by the squadron commander and be re-certified by an instructor.
      NOTE: Regaining currency guidance is based upon the time elapsed from the date the
      individual became non-current.
   4.6.2. Loss of/Re-Qualification to Instructor Status. Instructors will be decertified if:
      4.6.2.1. They become non-current in an event/sortie which causes removal from
      CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance
      to require decertification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor
      becomes non-current in events/sorties, which do not require removal from CMR/BMC
      status, instructor status may be retained, but the instructor will not instruct in that
      event/sortie until the required currency is regained.
 34                                     AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


      4.6.2.2. They fail a ground/flight evaluation. To regain instructor status the instructor
      must successfully complete a ground/flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-
      2HH-60V2 at the discretion of the commander..
   4.6.3. Aircrew members assigned to units north of the 60° parallel handle night/NVG
   currency as follows: Day sorties/events update night sortie/event currencies from 1 Apr to 30
   Sep. Consider all inexperienced crewmembers non-current for all applicable night
   events/sorties on 1 Oct. Inexperienced crewmembers regain currency by demonstrating
   proficiency in delinquent events/sorties to an instructor. Unit commanders may consider
   other crewmembers non-current on 1 Oct. NOTE: Units assigned to areas having limited
   availability to prosecute useful night sorties due to local flying restrictions may supplement
   para 4.6.3. as necessary. Under no circumstances will the time periods be less restrictive
   than those indicated in para 4.6.3. MAJCOM A3T or equivalent is the approval authority.
      4.6.3.1. NVG Currency does not need to be maintained from 1 Apr through 30 Sep to
      remain CMR, however, NVG currency must be regained by 31 Oct. To regain NVG
      currency, the most appropriate instructors, as selected by the SQ/CC, will fly an NVG
      route.    Other non-current crewmembers will regain currency by demonstrating
      proficiency to an instructor.NOTE: Units assigned to areas having limited availability to
      prosecute useful night sorties due to local flying restrictions may supplement para 4.6.3.1.
      as necessary. Under no circumstances will the time periods be less restrictive than those
      indicated in para 4.6.3.1. MAJCOM A3T or equivalent is the approval authority.
   4.6.4. Aircrew members previously qualified as instructors or evaluators in the HH-60 may
   be re-qualified to instructor status. In this case, instructor training must be included in the re-
   qualification course and the re-qualification evaluation must check instructor performance as
   well as primary duty performance in the crew position.
4.7. Regression.
   4.7.1. Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and contingency operations missions
   may be used for lookback. If and aircrew member does not meet lookback requirements
   throughout the training cycle, the SQ/CC can either regress the crewmember to N-CMR/N-
   BMC, remove the pilot from a CMR/BMC manning position, or initiate action to remove the
   pilot from active flying status. For combat mission ready events, crewmembers will not fly
   on operational missions until these items are satisfied.
      4.7.1.1. Failure to meet one-month lookback of RAP mission requirements requires a
      review of the crewmember’s three-month lookback history. If the crewmember meets
      three-month lookback, the SQ/CC may maintain the crewmember as CMR/BMC. If the
      crewmember does not meet three-month lookback, the SQ/CC may either place the
      crewmember in probation status for one month or regress the crewmember to N-CMR/N-
      BMC. A crewmember on probation must reestablish a one-month lookback at the end of
      the probation period to regain CMR/BMC. See Table 4.1
      4.7.1.2. CMR/BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC must complete a
      SQ/CC-approved recertification program. Upon completion of the program, the
      crewmember must then meet one-month lookback prior to returning to CMR/BMC.
      Missions and events accomplished during the recertification program apply toward
      monthly and training-cycle RAP requirements.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      35


       4.7.1.3. RAP lookback computations begin following MQT completion. Until a three-
       month lookback is established, pilots must meet each monthly requirement; otherwise,
       SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.9
   4.7.2. AETC/34 WPS/H60 CTF(88 TES) RAP lookback is only required if crewmembers
   are deploying to augment an operational unit. Crewmembers must meet the 1-month
   lookback requirements for RAP sorties/events prior to deploying unless the requesting
   organization specifically directs otherwise.
4.8. End-of-Cycle Requirements. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie and or/event
requirements of this instruction by the end of the training cycle may require additional training
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9of this volume to
see if some of these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW
paragraph 1.2.4.16 of this volume.
   4.8.1. Crewmembers who fail to meet the total RAP training cycle sortie requirements may
   continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if
   additional training is required.
   4.8.2. Crewmembers who fail to meet Non-RAP training cycle sortie and/or event
   requirements may continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will
   determine if additional training is required.
   4.8.3. Failure to meet total RAP sortie type requirements will result in:
       4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type
       deficiency is significant. To regain CMR/BMC the crewmember will complete all
       deficient sortie types. These sorties may be counted against the total requirements for the
       new training cycle.
       4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained
       and the sortie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will
   result in loss of that certification/qualification.   The SQ/CC will determine re-
   certification/qualification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Training Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the
SQ/CC may prorate all training requirements when duties not involving flying (DNIFs),
emergency leaves, non-flying TDY/exercises, combat/contingency deployments, (ANG, AFRC:
and/or mandatory training required for civilian employment) preclude training for a portion of
the training period. Normal annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended
bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days, may be
considered as non-availability.
   4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training
   cycle. Use Table 4.1 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative
   calendar days of non-availability.
 36                                   AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


   4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a
   prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT.

    256-285                   9                  586-615                   20
    286-315                  10
   4.9.4. Example: Capt Jones was granted 19 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended SOS in residence from March through April for 57 consecutive calendar days. His
   SQ/CC authorized a total of 3 months proration from his training cycle (1 month for
   emergency leave and 2 months for SOS).
   4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
   lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
   4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted aircrew members and crewmembers achieving CMR/BMC
   after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month
   for proration purposes. The prorated share of RAP sorties must be completed in CT.
   4.9.7. Night, NVG and air refueling (AR) requirements accomplished during MQT may be
   credited toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the
   crewmember was declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by the MAJCOM.
   4.9.8. An aircrew member’s last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated
   provided 1-month’s proration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS may be considered
   CMR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss
   of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.
   4.9.9. CMR crewmembers who attend USAFWS courses in TDY status and/or who
   participate in actual flying contingency operations may be reported throughout the TDY as
   CMR. Upon return, those crewmembers will accomplish a prorated share of sortie/event
   requirements (see Table 4.1).
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      37


   4.9.10. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit’s CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing
   it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station.
   The following proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the
   unit’s CT program:
      4.9.10.1. Sorties and flying events completed during contingency operations may or may
      not count toward RAP training cycle requirements, update currencies and be used for
      lookback purposes. Squadron commanders must determine if sorties and events provide
      training which meets the intent of this instruction. If training is adequate, those sorties
      and events may be counted toward annual training requirements, currency and lookback.
      If flying opportunities do not afford adequate training, then units may prorate RAP sorties
      and events for the period of time each individual was deployed. In addition, proration is
      authorized for the deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where home
      station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM. (ANG/AFRC: Individuals deployed for more
      than a 7 day period may prorate a 1 month portion of RAP sorties and events).
      4.9.10.2. Proration will be completed in the same manner as any other non-flying duty
      IAW Table 4.1
4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status.
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle training event
   requirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.6of this volume.
   4.10.2. If N-CMR/N-BMC status is incurred due to failure to meet lookback, IAW
   paragraph 4.7, the following procedures will be used to regain status (timing starts from
   date the crewmember came off CMR/BMC):
      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days.         The aircrew member must meet 1-month lookback
      requirements.
      4.10.2.2. 91 Days and Beyond. The aircrew member must meet 1-month lookback
      requirements. Additional training tailored to the situation should be assigned at the
      discretion of the SQ/CC.

                          UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General Requirements. This chapter outlines the prerequisites and training requirements
for mission-qualified aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification or
receiving specialized training. Specialized training (both special certifications and instructor
qualifications) includes any specialized tactics or events above and beyond those in which all
crewmembers are trained (e.g., NVG water operations, sling load, Functional Check Flight
(FCF), shipboard ops, etc.). This training is normally conducted after a crewmember achieves
CMR status, but at the discretion of the unit commander, it may be conducted in conjunction
with MQT or LMQT.
   5.1.1. Training Time Limits. Aircrew members must complete SMT within 120 calendar
   days (ARC: 180 days) from the date of their first flight. Individuals unable to complete the
   training within these limits may continue training, however, their unit will notify
   MAJCOM/A3T with a description of the difficulty and an expected completion date (not to
   exceed an additional 120 days). If SMT is not completed by the later date, any further
   extension requires MAJCOM/A3T approval. Commanders will ensure aircrew personnel
   engaged in formal training complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
   Minimize duties not directly related to this training.
   5.1.2. Active and Reserve Duty Service Commitments. Comply with the requirements of
   AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC), AFRCI 36-2102 Air Force Reserve
   Service Commitment Date (RDSC), AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and para 1.12.4 of this instruction.
   5.1.3. When conducting training in-unit via secondary method, units will use formal school
   courseware and syllabi if available. When these products are not available, units will use any
   MAJCOM-approved equivalent. If neither product exists, units may develop courseware and
   syllabi for local use. These products will be submitted to MAJCOM/A3T or lead command
   (ACC/A3T), and upon approval, they will be posted on the ACC/A3TO CoP website.
   NOTE: Unit commanders may always add additional training to formal or MAJCOM-
   approved products.
5.2. Aircraft Commander (AC) Upgrade. Pilots who completed the initial MP course at the
FTU (MP-IQ) and received an INIT QUAL/INSTM or INIT MSN evaluation and subsequent
qualification are not required to complete the aircraft commander upgrade course. Upon meeting
minimum hour requirements, those pilots require only a flight evaluation at the unit
commander’s discretion. This qualification will be documented IAW AFI 11-202v2.
   5.2.1. Flying Time Requirements. The following minimum flying hours (Table 5.1) are
   required prior to entering AC upgrade training. AC candidates must achieve applicable total
   time, helicopter time, and aircraft primary time prior to entering upgrade training. The hours
   prescribed in Table 5.1 are minimums and not intended to be the standard.
   5.2.1. (AETC) Flying Time Requirements. Waiver authority for flying hour requirements
   for upgrades is delegated to the OG /CC.

6. Waivers to these totals will be IAW paragraph 1.12. of this instruction.

5.3. Instructor Upgrade.
   5.3.1. SQ/CCs will select only the most qualified aircrew members as instructors,
   considering ability, judgment, technical knowledge, skill and experience. Unit commanders
   will personally review each instructor candidate’s qualifications for the following minimum
   prerequisites:
       5.3.1.1. Instructional Ability. All initial instructor upgrade candidates will complete
       training on the principles of instruction during the appropriate formal school upgrade
       course.
       5.3.1.2. Judgment. The candidate must possess the judgment necessary to meet
       unexpected or induced emergencies and the ability to exercise sound judgment through
       mature realization of their own, their student’s and the aircraft’s limitations.
       5.3.1.3. Personal Qualities. The candidate must have patience, tact, understanding and a
       desire to instruct others.
       5.3.1.4. Technical Knowledge. The candidate must be thoroughly familiar with
       respective aircraft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures,
       as well as publications applicable to crew position and unit mission.
       5.3.1.5. Flying Proficiency.     Individuals selected must be qualified and current in
       specific design aircraft.
       5.3.1.6. Flying Experience. Candidates must possess a reasonable background of flying
       experience to have developed desired standard of knowledge, judgment and proficiency.
       Normally, these qualities progress together. However, flying hours alone cannot be
       accepted as criteria for any one or all qualities.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                     43


   5.3.2. Instructor Pilot. 100 hours primary/secondary time after upgrade to AC, of which 50
   hours must be primary time in design and series aircraft prior to beginning instructor upgrade
   training. Instructor candidates must be Flight Lead Upgrade (FLUG) complete and AC
   qualified in the mission, event and maneuver before instructor upgrade in the same mission,
   event and maneuver.
   5.3.3. Instructor Flight Engineers/Aerial Gunners must have a minimum of 1-year flight
   experience in assigned aircraft or 300 hours helicopter time, to include 100 hours NVG time.
   Instructor candidates must be qualified in the mission, event and maneuver before instructing
   in the same mission, event and maneuver.
   5.3.4. AETC: The AETC FTU WG/CC will determine the minimum flight hours required
   for upgrade of permanent party exchange officer instructor candidates.
   5.3.5. Instructor Training Requirements. The primary method of course completion is at the
   FTU. Secondary method of training is in-unit (if primary method is not available) using
   formal school courseware adapted to local training resources. A waiver is required from
   MAJCOM/A3T for secondary method of training. Any aircrew member who has previously
   unsuccessfully completed the formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a
   secondary method training waiver.
   5.3.6. Previous HH-60G instructors may requalify directly to instructor status provided the
   requirements of Chapter 4 (Loss of Currency/Qualification) are met.
5.4. Flight Examiner Upgrade. Flight examiner upgrades and certification will be
accomplished per AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2HH-60V2 and applicable MAJCOM supplements.

Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented, is the source reference for certification
of AETC aircrew members to flight examiner status.
5.5. Instructor Certified Events. These items consist of any specialized tactics or events above
and beyond those in which all crewmembers are trained which require only an instructor
certification. The unit commander may select any appropriate crewmembers to receive special
certifications. Certifications earned in a lower crew position are carried to the next level when
completing an upgrade (to include instructor upgrade) unless specifically restricted in the event
description. Conduct additional certifications for these events IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, AFI 11-
2HH-60 Vol 1, and applicable MAJCOM supplements. A complete listing of instructor
certifications can be found in Table 5.2.
   5.5.1. Documentation. Certification training will be documented using applicable forms
   discussed in Chapter 6 of this Instruction, and maintained in the members’ active training
   record until completion. Successful completion of each certification listed below will be
   annotated on an AF Form 1381/ AF Form 4348, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training in
   the individual’s FEF and should be tracked in the unit letter of Xs unless otherwise noted.
   5.5.2. Instructor Certification Listing.      The following section includes all training
   requirements and other pertinent information for all currently approved instructor
   certifications. Units will use syllabi and training products posted on the ACC/A3TO CoP
   website to train and certify individuals on these events. When such products are not
   available, units may develop courseware and syllabi for local use. These products will be

5.6. Miscellaneous Training. This section covers periodic training requirements that do not fall
in the category of BAQ, MQT, LMQT, CT, upgrade or specialized training. These training
requirements are performed on an irregular basis as needed or desired.
   5.6.1. Pre-Deployment Spin-up Training. Pre-Deployment Spin-up Training. This training is
   unit commander designed and will be conducted prior to deployments in support of
   contingency operations. OG/CC is the approval authority for Pre-Deployment Spin-up
   syllabi. Units are responsible for contacting the appropriate command or agency to determine
   expected mission requirements. (e.g. Concept of Operations, Rules of Engagement, etc.)
   Units will tailor training to meet tasking requirements and emphasis will be placed on
   tasks/procedures/equipment not accomplished or utilized during daily operations. When
   training is required for a system not available to crewmembers, the unit commander will use
   all available resources (e.g., Formal Training Unit courseware, Computer Based Training,
   etc.) to accomplish required training. This training will be conducted IAW applicable
   directives and publications. Consideration should be given to a ―bundled‖ academic and
   flying training program incorporating refresher weapons and tactics training, aircrew
   intelligence training, verification planning exercise, and a CSAR.
       5.6.1.1. Ground Training.      Ground Training. Accomplish ground training IAW
       Attachment 2 of this Instruction and Ground Training Requirements Table located in the
       current RAP Tasking memo. Units may credit ground training accomplished during
       IQT/MQT toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                 51


     5.6.1.2. Flying Training. Flight training will be tailored to ensure all deploying
     crewmembers are current, qualified, and proficient in expected mission taskings. Special
     consideration should be given to actual CSAR employment. This will provide the
     opportunity to practice/simulate requirements/procedures associated with planning,
     flying, and debriefing a mission within a specific AOR. This mission should be executed
     utilizing current planning, briefing, and employment procedures within the AOR.

                                           Chapter 6

                             AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS

6.1. General. The purpose of this chapter is to detail procedures for documenting student
training and maintenance of training records. Training completed at any AETC or ACC-owned
FTU will be documented IAW MAJCOM procedures. Training completed at any other FTU or
in-unit will be documented IAW this instruction.
   6.1.1. When formal school syllabi and/or courseware are available (either AETC or other
   MAJCOM SOI), this material will be used for training. MAJCOM approved substitutes to
   these products may be authorized on a case-by-case basis. All approved syllabi and
   courseware will be posted on the ACC/A3TO CoP.
6.2. Career Training Folder. Units will maintain a career training folder for all assigned or
attached crewmembers. Records from any graduate-level training programs completed after the
implementation date of 1 Jul 04 must be included in this folder. Earlier training records should
be included to the maximum extent possible if these records are still available. This is intended
to provide an accurate representation of an individual’s long term progression and any positive or
negative trends related to his training. NOTE: During inspections, career training folders may
be reviewed to ensure compliance with this chapter. Individual training records contained within
section three of the career training folder will not be open to inspection during these visits.
   6.2.1. One folder will be maintained for each crewmember. It should consist of a hard
   binder of appropriate size for the amount of information it holds. The name of the
   crewmember will be clearly posted on both the spine and front cover. The front and back
   cover must also prominently display the following statement; ―PRIVACY ACT
   INFORMATION - The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL USE
   ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖ Each
   training record within the binder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between programs.
   The binder will be divided into sections as follows. NOTE: Open or active training records
   will not be maintained within the career training folder. These individual products should be
   kept in a separate location until training is complete and they are archived IAW para 6.8
       6.2.1.1. The first section will be a table of contents. This should clearly list each item
       contained within the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be kept as current as
       possible to ensure accuracy and clearly display the date of the last update.
       6.2.1.2. The second section will be a record of annual review. The folder shall be
       reviewed for accuracy and completeness annually by the training section. The record of
       annual review will clearly indicate the date of this review and the name and office
       symbol of the reviewing official. There should also be a space for comments or
       discrepancies to be annotated. If an expanded explanation is necessary, an MFR should
       be written and signed by the unit training officer. File these documents behind the record
       of annual review in chronological order with the most recent on the bottom.
           6.2.1.2.1. For crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions, no annual review is
           required. Annotate the timeframe during which the individual was in non-flying
           status in appropriate chronological space in the record of annual review (e.g., May
           2002-Jun 2005 Inactive/ACC Staff).
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          53


       6.2.1.3. The third section will contain all completed training records (qualifications,
       certifications, specialized mission training, etc.) whether they are completed in-unit or at
       the FTU. Once a training program is completed (or terminated for any reason), it shall be
       closed out IAW procedures in para 6.8. Each record will be entered in chronological
       order with the most recent on the bottom. A separate tab will be used for each record to
       clearly separate unrelated information. Tabs will be numbered in order with the
       member’s initial mission qualification being number one.
   6.2.2. Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for
   official business only. They will be maintained in a secure area within the unit’s training
   section. Only instructors and supervisors should have regular access to these records.
   Individuals may sign out their own records with approval of the training section.
   6.2.3. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the training section will make a paper or
   electronic copy of the table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. For
   crewmembers going to an active flying assignment, these documents shall be maintained for
   six months from the date the individual departs home station in the event records are lost or
   destroyed en route. The unit shall seal the career training folder in an envelope along with
   the individual’s FEF then give it to the member for delivery to the next duty station. For
   crewmembers going to a non-flying position, the losing unit shall keep these copies until the
   member arrives at his next flying assignment or five years (whichever is less).
   6.2.4. Disposition of Career Training Folder. The Career Training Folder shall be
   maintained IAW procedures outlined above so long as the individual remains on active or
   reserve status with any branch of the USAF. The Career Training Folder shall be returned to
   individuals permanently terminating their military service (retirement, separation, death,
   etc.). When individuals are not available to receive their records or do not choose to receive
   them, the last flying unit to which they were assigned shall retain these records for six
   months from the service termination date. After this time period has elapsed, the unit
   training office must destroy the records to ensure against accidental release of the
   information.
6.3. Entry Into Upgrade. Each formal training program must have documentation of entry into
upgrade by the unit leadership. This will normally consist of an entry on the first AETC FORM
73/AF FORM 4110 Aircrew Training Narrative in the trainee’s record. Units may also
substitute a copy of the minutes from an upgrade board or a MFR in place of the AETC FORM
73/AF FORM 4110 entry. This document will be signed by the unit commander or designated
representative.
6.4. Active Training Records. Units will maintain an active training folder that contains every
active training record for all assigned or attached aircrew members. If an active training record
syllabus does not include an AETC FORM 75/AF FORM 4109, units will include one. An
active training record is also required for corrective action as a result of an evaluation (other than
end-of-course evaluations). This requirement may be waived by the unit operations officer if
corrective action is limited and would not warrant the initiation of a training folder. The flight
examiner who directed the additional training will annotate training deficiencies on an AETC
FORM 73/AF FORM 4110. Active training folders will be maintained in a location readily
accessible to instructors/trainers, supervisory personnel, and the individual aircrew member
54                                   AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011

        6.5.2.1.1. The AETC FORM 73/AF FORM 4110 will include a write-up for any
        flight training event that was briefed, even if the sortie was canceled due to external
        factors.
        6.5.2.1.2. Name or Trainee Name. Self-explanatory.
        6.5.2.1.3. Aircraft Type Self-explanatory.
        6.5.2.1.4. Crew Position. Self-explanatory.
        6.5.2.1.5. Year/Date. Self-explanatory.
        6.5.2.1.6. Sortie ID. Enter the appropriate training period designator, numbered
        sequentially.
 56                                  AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


         6.5.2.1.7. Profile/Strengths/Weaknesses/Recommendations. This section shall
         include a writeup for each flying training event (simulator or aircraft) the student
         participates in. Writeups may be included for ground training at unit discretion. It will
         also contain any additional information pertinent to the individual’s training (e.g.
         recommendations for proficiency advance, monthly/quarterly reviews, etc). Writeups
         for student flying training events should comply with the following format:
         6.5.2.1.8. Profile. This section should start by listing the event completed and the
         grade earned or indicate why the sortie was incomplete if it was not finished for any
         reason and what items yet remain to complete it. A brief description of weather and
         other related factors (e.g., EMI levels for an NVG sortie or sea state for a water ops
         sortie) should be the next item. The rest of the section should be a brief summary of
         training completed, to include specific events and number of iterations where
         relevant. It should be written so that the next instructor has no doubts where to pick
         up the training. Detailed comments will be entered whenever the performance level
         attained is below the printed RPL.
         6.5.2.1.9. Strengths. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s
         strengths. Make every effort to identify useable, relevant strengths to further build a
         picture of student progression for the next instructor. There should always be some
         strength or strengths to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying
         any or none are honestly noted, state ―none noted.‖ If no strengths are noted, strong
         consideration should be given to awarding the student an ―unsatisfactory‖ for the
         training period.
         6.5.2.1.10. Weaknesses. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s
         weaknesses. It should, again, contribute to the next instructor’s ability to understand
         the proficiency level the student has attained. It should also give the student areas in
         which to strive for improvement. An honest assessment is critical but avoid being
         overly harsh or judgmental. There should always be some weakness or weaknesses to
         emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are honestly
         noted, state ―none noted.‖ If no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration should be
         given to awarding the student an ―excellent‖ for the training period.
         6.5.2.1.11. Recommendations. This section is written to give the student areas to
         concentrate on for the next flight and reinforce the training received on the flight.
         Enter the next recommended step for the student (e.g. continue with training, proceed
         to evaluation, proficiency advance, etc.).
         6.5.2.1.12. Include instructor/examiner signature, printed name, and crew position of
         person completing writeup. It shall also have the initials of the trainee. This indicates
         only that he has read and understands the entry. It does not necessarily indicate
         agreement/concurrence.
6.6. AETC FORM 74/AF FORM 4111 Aircrew Training Sortie Maneuver
Grades. Comply with the following instructions when completing the AETC FORM 74/AF
FORM 4111.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      57


   6.6.1. This form is used to document required maneuver information file (MIF) items and
   required proficiency level (RPL). Typically, this will be a pre-printed form provided in the
   SOI. Locally developed overprints may be used when formal courseware is not available.
   These must be approved by MAJCOM/A3T or lead command (ACC/A3T) prior to use and
   will be posted on the MAJCOM/A3T website. Comply with the following instructions when
   completing the AETC FORM 74/AF FORM 4111.
       6.6.1.1. Trainee Name. Self explanatory.
       6.6.1.2. Course/Phase. Enter formal course title if one exists or enter a descriptive
       identifier for other types of training (e.g. HH60G-MP-UQ, Sling Load Certification, etc)
       6.6.1.3. Crew Position. For aircrew members in a program designed to advance them to
       a higher crew position, enter the qualification to which they are upgrading. For all other
       training, enter the crew position currently held.
       6.6.1.4. Programmed Sortie Name. This line should contain the sortie identifiers for each
       training event.
       6.6.1.5. Programmed Hours. This line should contain the syllabus-directed training time
       and the actual training time the student received (separated by a slash).
       6.6.1.6. Date. Self explanatory.
       6.6.1.7. Grade. The instructor should fill in the actual training time the student received
       and the overall grade for the sortie.
       6.6.1.8. Task/Topic Listing. List each MIF item number from the syllabus (if applicable)
       and a description of the task required (e.g. Safety/Judgment, Lead/Wing Responsibilities,
       etc.) on a separate line.
       6.6.1.9. Min Event. List the minimum number of events to be completed (if applicable)
       before training can be considered complete. Otherwise, leave blank.
       6.6.1.10. PK (performance knowledge). List the grade or RPL to be attained on that
       sortie. On a preprinted form, the instructor should slash through the item if the RPL is
       met. If the RPL is not met or is exceeded, the actual RPL attained should be written over
       the preprinted number/letter. Standards for awarding grades should be IAW procedures
       listed in the Syllabi of Instruction (SOI).
       6.6.1.11. End of Phase RPL Level. This is the final RPL the student must attain prior to
       being recommended for evaluation or certification. One RPL should be listed for each
       MIF item or training event.
6.7. Ops/Periodic Reviews. All open training records shall be reviewed prior to any
certification/evaluation and monthly by the unit training section and quarterly by the operations
officer. This review shall be documented in the AETC FORM 73 and signed by the unit training
representative or the operations officer, respectively. In those months where a quarterly review
is completed, the monthly review is not required.
 58                                    AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011


   6.7.1. The monthly review should ensure all training is correctly documented and instructor
   writeups adequately document student performance. If errors are discovered, take immediate
   action to correct them or document reasons the errors could not be corrected (e.g., instructor
   not available for signature). It should also ensure the trainee is progressing in a satisfactory
   manner, identify any significant problems encountered and recommend any adjustments to
   training.
       6.7.1.1. Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an excessive amount of
       time has elapsed between training rides, an extra training sortie (X-ride) should either be
       awarded and flown or the training section must document the reasons this additional
       training is not required. Typically, no more than 14 days should pass between training
       rides for active duty personnel or 35 days for air reserve component personnel.
   6.7.2. The quarterly review should consist of a cursory look at a sampling of training
   documentation and other administrative items. The focus of this review should be primarily
   on trainee progression. The operations officer should take this time to ensure students are
   performing up to standards and the training program is meeting his goals or vision for the
   unit. Any relevant findings or recommendations should be documented at this time.
6.8. Instructions for Closing Out Training Records. Whether a training program is
successfully completed or terminated for other reasons (failure to progress, extended DNIF, etc),
the training record must be closed out. This is accomplished by a final entry in the trainee’s last
AETC FORM 73. This entry must be signed by both the unit training officer and the unit ops
officer. After this entry is made, the record shall remain in open status for an additional 90 days
before being moved to section three of the career training folder.
   6.8.1. For successful completion of training, the entry should indicate that all training has
   been satisfactorily completed, the new qualification or certification is awarded and all
   records have been updated (to include the AF Form 1381/ AF Form 4348, letter of Xs, FEF,
   and ARMS database as required). It should also include any restrictions (if applicable).
   6.8.2. For termination of training (for cause or unrelated factors), the entry should indicate
   the reasons for termination of the upgrade and plans to re-enter the trainee into the program
   again at a later date (if any).
6.9. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications/Certifications. Units must
accurately track all qualifications and certifications for each crewmember. This is best
accomplished through a combination of the AF Form 1381/ AF Form 4348 and a locally-
generated letter of Xs (or equivalent).
   6.9.1. AF FORM 1381/AF FORM 4348. The AF Form 1381/ AF Form 4348 shall be
   maintained in the member’s flight evaluation folder IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MDS
   Vol 2. Events requiring documentation on the 1381/4348 are listed in chapter five of this
   instruction.
AFI11-2HH-60V1_AETCSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                  59


  6.9.2. Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs (or equivalent document) shall be maintained by each
  unit. This document is the commander’s tool to track specialized training (e.g., locally
  required certifications for new equipment or procedures) and other desired information.
  Specific procedures and format will be determined locally, but it must contain the following
  minimum information: crewmember name, highest qualification currently held, and
  specialized training not documented elsewhere. Other information may be included at the
  discretion of the unit commander. NOTE: The letter of Xs shall not be used as a source
  document for awarding certifications or qualifications. Only appropriate documentation may
  be used for these purposes as detailed in AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2HH-60V2, AFI 11-2HH-
  60V1and AFI 11-401.

Terms
Academic Training—A course of instruction normally completed in a classroom setting.
Academic training is designed to prepare students for simulator/flight training and is normally
completed prior to commencing that training.
Aerial Refueling (AR)—For the purposes of this instruction, airborne fuel off-load, either
simulated or actual, from any fixed wing tanker aircraft to another fixed wing aircraft.
Aircraft Commander (AC)—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being
in command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission. NOTE: See also Pilot in Command (PIC). These terms may be used
interchangeably.
Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)—A series of maneuvers meant to familiarize a
crewmember with the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft (especially those considered
outside the normal flight regime).
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)—Hands-on training aids that include cockpit procedure
trainers (CPT), part task trainers (PTT), weapons systems trainers (WST), operational flight
trainers (OFT) or simulators.
Aircrew Training System (ATS)—An integrated qualification, upgrade and continuation-
training program for aircrew members.
Authoritative Procedures—Procedures that are the tested, proven, best practice way to
accomplish events. Crews are expected to use authoritative procedures, unless extenuating
circumstances dictate otherwise and the crew has carefully considered implementation.
Bambi Bucket—The basics of firefighting operations using an external water bucket are very
similar to sling load operations. Prior to performing water bucket operations, aircrew will be
certified in HH-60 remote operations, sling load, and day water operations.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—The aircrew status identifier of an individual who has

qualification and Use of Force training before being armed. All personnel will fire wearing
individual combat equipment, including unit issued holsters, magazine pouches, helmet,
individual body armor, and vest. EXCEPTION: AFRC group commanders may set arming
groups as required to meet mission needs. When deviating from parameters set in para 3.4.2.6.,
formal notification must be sent to AFRC/A3T.
A2.27. Use of Force Training. Per AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
Personnel, all armed personnel must meet level of firearms proficiency required by their arming
group. Unit commanders will ensure crewmembers receive ―use of force‖ training before being
issued a firearm. Training is required every 12 months and will consist of a guided lecture led by
an instructor using the program training guide in attachment seven of AFI 31-207. Unit training
offices will document this training in a manner that records the name of the individual trained,
the date trained, and the name and rank of the individual responsible for the training.
Additionally, this training date will be tracked in ARMS.
A2.28. Continuation Verification Planning Exercise (VPE). The VPE provides an
opportunity for aircrews to apply their combat knowledge and skills in a training environment.
VPEs reinforce knowledge gained during in-unit academic training, CMT, mission qualification
open/closed book examinations and refresh crews on real world mission planning procedures.
VPEs also provide crews the opportunity to exercise local mission planning support processes
such as intelligence, weather, rules of engagement and legal (judge advocate) mission
considerations.     VPEs should be tailored to prepare aircrews to support a specific
OPLAN/CONPLAN/AEF or other rotational tasking. Participation in the planning and briefing
of an operational, contingency, or exercise mission may be substituted for a VPE and satisfies
the recurring training requirement. Unit operations officers will determine which missions
satisfy this requirement, based upon a recommendation by tactics office personnel. Attachment
4 is provided as a guideline for the development of verification briefings
   A2.28.1. VPE refreshers update crewmembers on their squadron’s wartime mission. Each
   crewmember will participate in a squadron initial/CT verification planning exercise every 24
   months as a briefer or seminar participant. Crewmembers who participate in a unit
   contingency deployment or major exercise may receive credit for continuation VPE. This
   approval is at the discretion of unit operations officers, based upon a recommendation by
   tactics office personnel.

Device (HEED). All HH-60 aircrew members must successfully complete refresher WST and
HEED training IAW AFI 16-1301 and MAJCOM supplements. All flight surgeons and other
personnel who perform frequent duties on over-water helicopter missions must maintain the
same currency in refresher WST and HEED as helicopter crewmembers. Crewmembers non-
current for water survival refresher training are prohibited from flight over water beyond
autorotational distance from land.
A2.30. Weapons & Tactics Academics. Units will establish a weapons and tactics academic
program to accomplish both MQT and CT requirements. Academics are required IAW the
ground training table in the RAP Tasking memo. Weapons & Tactics Academics will normally
be conducted in conjunction with Intelligence Training
   A2.30.1. Weapons and Tactics Academics is an assortment of academic training on various
   topics. Items covered are not specifically related to any particular flying skills, but are
   designed to prepare crewmembers to operate more effectively in the combat rescue
   environment. Successful Weapons and Tactics programs require the active involvement and
   support of unit commanders, operations officers, tactics officers, intelligence officers, and all
   aircrew members.
   A2.30.2. Unit intelligence, tactics personnel and USAFWS graduates will normally teach
   Weapons and Tactics Training. Unit tactics and training personnel will determine training
   requirements based on unit- and theater-specific mission requirements and unit METLs.
   Materials should contain unit mission, area of operations (AO) and theater-specific threat
   information, command and control structures, general threats and weapons system specific
   counter-measures/evasive maneuvers. Training should focus heavily on areas not covered
   during other tactical ground training. Minimum training events are detailed below.
   Additional requirements may be outlined in the MAJCOM tactics instruction or in a
   supplement to this AFI.
   A2.30.3. To complete academics, aircrew must pass an examination with a minimum score
   of 85 percent. Aircrew may receive training credit in lieu of academics if an exam is passed
   and corrected to 100 percent, where authorized by the governing publication.
