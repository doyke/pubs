1. Purpose.
   1.1. The 36th Wing Plans, Programs, and Readiness Directorate (36 WG/XP) provides the
   36th Wing Commander (36 WG/CC) a strategic planning capability in the areas of joint
   basing policy, military buildup/development, operational plans (OPLANS), and large-scale

     exercises. To achieve this capability, the office uses three divisions along the following
     functional lines: Joint Basing (XPJ), Plans and Programs (XPP), and Readiness (XPR).
     1.2. This instruction articulates the internal division of labor for 36 WG/XP as well as its
     relationships with other 36 WG organizations regarding plans, programs and readiness. In

     detailed operational/tactical planning and execution to the responsible 36 WG units. 36

     contact (POC) for external agencies to initiate coordination for major exercises and training
     events at Andersen AFB (AAFB) and surrounding areas, e.g., Andersen South and Northwest
     Field. Additionally, 36 WG/XP coordinates with internal and external organizations to
