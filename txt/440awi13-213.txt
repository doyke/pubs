                                           Chapter 1

                            DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The aim of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is to develop and maintain a safe
   airfield environment. Safe motor vehicle operation on the airfield is essential to everyday
   aircraft operations. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger to both aircraft and
   ground personnel. Human factors, carelessness, haste, and disregard for established safety
   standards are the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle collisions and/or incidents to include
   personal injury with motor vehicles on the airfield.
   1.1.2. The standards set in this instruction apply to all drivers on the airfield. Only trained
   personnel will be assigned duties which include driving on the airfield. Therefore, those
   persons who have vehicular access to the movement areas of the airfield must have an
   appropriate level of knowledge of the ADP rules. Personnel assigned driving duties will be
   knowledgeable of and comply with this instruction to support ADP and mission
   requirements.
   1.1.3. The 440 OSS/OSAA (Airfield Management) is responsible for the Pope AAF Airfield
   Driving Program (ADP). Airfield Management (AM) trains and certifies the Unit Airfield
   Driving Program Managers (ADPMs). The ADPMs train and certify unit personnel who
   have a requirement to drive on Pope AAF. All Ft Bragg and Pope AAF-assigned personnel
   who operate a vehicle on the airfield must complete all training and testing requirements.
   Airfield experience (i.e. operating vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of
   airfield driving training and testing requirement.
1.2. 440 Wing Commander (440 AW/CC).
   1.2.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support Pope AAF’s Airfield Driving Program.
   1.2.2. May reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential duties
   following suspended/revocation of base driving privileges. See AFI 31-218, Motor Vehicle
   Traffic Supervision, Para 2-10 for additional information. Authority must not be delegated.
   1.2.3. Request an AF Runway Safety Action Team (AFRSAT) through the Major Command
   (MAJCOM) OPR for Airfield Operations (AO) if there are recurring problems with CMAVs.
   See AFI 13-204V2 Airfield Operations Standardization and Evaluations, Chapter 4 for
   additional information.
   1.2.4. Reviews runway incursion incidents and corrective actions taken.
1.3. 440 Operations Group Commander (440 OG/CC).
   1.3.1. Reviews CMAVs and corrective actions taken.
   1.3.2. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group (RIPWG) if
   there are two runway incursions in a six month period. Board must convene within 30 days
   after the second runway incursion.
      1.3.2.1. The RIPWG will include OSS/CC, Airfield Operations Manager, Airfield
      Manager, Wing ADPM,      Air Traffic Manager, 440 AW/43 AG Safety, Unit
6                                                         440AWI13-213 25 MARCH 2014


    Commanders, and/or Unit ADPMs, and other organizational leadership as determined
    locally. The RIPWG shall take the following actions:
       1.3.2.1.1. Analyze each runway incursion and corrective actions taken.
       1.3.2.1.2. Evaluate the airfield driving operating procedures/standards and airfield
       configuration (to include signs/marking/lighting) to determine if corrective actions
       are needed.
       1.3.2.1.3. Develop strategies to prevent future runway incursions. Examples include
       but are not limited to:
          1.3.2.1.3.1. Increase or improve local training or testing materials.
          1.3.2.1.3.2. Implement mandatory briefings to all airfield drivers/aircrew/Air

   https://private.amc.af.mil/ADTP/Login.aspx.
   2.1.3. The AFM, Wing ADPM and other designated Airfield Management personnel are the
   issuing authorities for the AF IMT 483. This authority may not be delegated outside of
   Airfield Management. For units that do not have access to ADTP, the unit ADPM has to
   show proof of the individual’s training before the AFM, Wing ADPM, or other designated
   Airfield Management personnel will issue the AF IMT 483.
   2.1.4. AFSC, prior experience or career field training (e.g. aircraft maintenance, aircrew, fire
   and emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a substitute for
   completion of airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this instruction.
2.2. Personnel Requiring Initial AF IMT 483 Training/Certification.
   2.2.1. As a minimum, training will consist of:
      2.2.1.1. Airfield drivers’ training and certification will be documented in Attachment 5.

      locations (provided by Wing ADPM).
      3.1.2.4. For Full-Access drivers, Pope Phraseology Guide and/or unit Phraseology Guide
      are local requirements. Ensure these items are in possession before driving on the
      airfield.
      3.1.2.5. All vehicles operating on the airfield must have FOD containers and FOD tools.
      Ensure FOD containers are closed or sealed when not in use to prevent the accidental
      release of FOD on the airfield.
      3.1.2.6. Unit Commanders will be notified of discrepancies noted during spot checks.
   3.1.3. Vehicle traffic on the runway must be kept to an absolute minimum necessary for
   mission completion. At no time will any portion of the airfield be used as a shortcut or for
   convenience.
   3.1.4. Due to engine run operations and hazardous aircraft movements, all vehicles will
   make maximum use of the vehicle access lanes. An aircraft that has its landing and/or taxi
   lights operating (beacon) indicates it is about to start engines or has engines running and is
   about to taxi.
   3.1.5. All vehicles will stop prior to entering the airfield to visually determine whether the
   area is safe to proceed. If an aircraft is taxiing within the immediate vicinity, the vehicle
   operator will maintain position and not enter the ramp until the aircraft has cleared the area.
   3.1.6. All vehicles must stop before entering the fire lane access road from the airfield to
   visually determine whether the area is clear to proceed.
   3.1.7. Vehicles will not be driven into the path of taxiing aircraft. EXCEPTION: “Follow
   Me” vehicles providing aircraft taxi guidance.
   3.1.8. Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and its “Follow Me” guide.

   will maneuver safely to a position that will allow them to exit the intended path of movement
   of the aircraft. Once clear, the vehicle operator will stop the vehicle and visually confirm
   adequate minimum wing tip clearance (30 feet) from the aircraft.
   3.1.11. Right of Way Priorities (Listed in sequence below.)
      3.1.11.1. Emergency response vehicles responding to an actual emergency.
      3.1.11.2. Taxiing/Towed Aircraft. Vehicles must exercise caution on all taxiways.

  3.2.2. The CMA is comprised of one runway (Runway 23/05), the landing zone (LZ), and
  overruns; 100 feet on either side of the runway. The CMA is at least 100 feet off the edge
  of Runway 23/05 and LZ. Portions of Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, Delta North, Hotel North,
  Mike, Sierra, Romeo, Lima, and Kilo extend into the CMA at Runway 23/05. Portions of
  Taxiway Hotel South and Taxiway Delta South extend into the CMA from the LZ. Note:
  The runway edge is defined as the physical edge of the pavement. See Attachment 8 -
  AIRFIELD DIAGRAM – INCLUDING CRITICAL AND CONTROLLED/RESTRICTED
  AREAS, AIRCRAFT PARKING LOCATIONS, AND CMA HOT SPOTS.
  3.2.3. Runway hold lines are necessary on all pavements leading to an active runway. These
  markings designate a boundary intended to protect the runway environment from incursions
  and prevent interference with signals transmitted by electronic navigational aids. On paved
  surfaces (taxiways, entry roads, etc.), yellow runway hold lines consisting of a double solid
  and double broken lines are painted across the pavement surface approximately 200 feet from
  the runway centerline. The double solid line is on the ramp side; the double broken line is on
  the runway side. A combination taxiway and runway identification sign is located adjacent
  to each runway hold line. A taxiway/runway identification sign for Golf taxiway and the
  west runway would appear on the left side of the taxiway, adjacent to the runway hold line.
  The sign would appear as: “G 05/23”. The letter “G” is yellow surrounded by a black
  background. The “05/23” portion has white letters on a red background.
  3.2.4. Operators must establish and maintain two-way radio communications and gain
  approval into the CMA from the ATCT using phraseology and procedures outlined in
  Chapter 5.
  3.2.5. No vehicle or person may enter the CMA without specific approval from the ATCT.
  Vehicles/personnel are not allowed within 100 feet from the runway edge without permission
  from the ATCT. Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted into the CMA by
  another vehicle and/or pedestrian that has two-way radio contact with the ATCT.
  3.2.6. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must always monitor the appropriate radio
  frequency when in the CMA.
  3.2.7. Vehicle operators not following instructions from the ATCT will be removed from the
  airfield immediately and have their airfield drivers license revoked.
  3.2.8. Do not cross runways, overruns and taxiways for convenience. Crossings are limited
  to vehicles engaged in mission support (K-loaders, AGE, airfield management vehicles, etc.)
  operations on the airfield and responding emergency vehicles. Only agencies designated by
  Unit Commanders who have official duties that require them to operate on the runways,
  overruns or taxiways are authorized.
  3.2.9. There are no vehicle control devices (stop lights) on the airfield. The only method for
  receiving approval into the CMA or on to the runways is via direct radio communications
  with ATC.
  3.2.10. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or
  emergency flashers.
  3.2.11. Runway crossings are restricted to mission essential duties. Note: When crossing a
  runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.

                                   COMMUNICATIONS

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. Vehicles and personnel operating in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA) must have
   the ability to communicate with the ATCT at all times.
   5.1.2. All vehicles and personnel must establish and maintain two-way radio
   communications with the ATCT and receive ATCT approval prior to entering the CMA.
   Vehicle operators must continue to monitor the ATCT until reporting out of the CMA.
   5.1.3. All vehicles operating within the CMA must have a designated call-sign approved by
   Airfield Management. See Attachment 11.
   5.1.4. While in the CMA, the use of vehicle or personnel stereo equipment is prohibited.
   The use of such devices may distract the operator or drown out ATC communications.
   5.1.5. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft and ATC transmissions priority unless an
   emergency exists. VHF/UHF transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and
   ATCT personnel.
   5.1.6. Radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   5.1.7. The words "clear" or “clearance” will NOT be used by personnel or vehicle operators
   in the CMA or in communication with ATCT. Exception: Vehicle operators may reply
   “Loud and Clear” in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission quality or clarity.
5.2. Vehicle Communication Procedures.
   5.2.1. It is imperative that proper phraseology is adhered to. This is to prevent
   miscommunications and possible safety compromises. Utilize radio techniques in AFI 13-
   213 Ch. 4.2.
   5.2.2. Vehicle operators shall look both ways for aircraft landing/departing/taxiing prior to
   calling the ATCT for access onto the CMA.
   5.2.3. Normal communications with the ATCT will be initiated with call-sign (who you are),
   present location (where you are) and request (what you want to do or where you want to go).
   (Ex: “Pope Ground, Airfield 3, on taxiway Alpha, request to cross runway 23”).
   5.2.4. The only words that authorize a vehicle to operate within the CMA are “PROCEED”
   or “APPROVED”. The words “PROCEED” and “APPROVED” may be accompanied with
   other words or phrases. The words “Clear or Cleared” are not to be used in the CMA by
   vehicle operators communicating with the ATCT. (Ex: “Airfield 1, Pope Ground, proceed
   across runway 23” or “Safety 1, Ground, approved to cross runway 23”).
   5.2.5. “HOLD” will indicate disapproval of an operator’s request. “HOLD” may be
   accompanied with other words or phrases; however, if this word is used, the vehicle operator
   will not enter the CMA. (Ex: “Sweeper 1, Ground, hold short of runway 23”)
   5.2.6. All vehicle operators will ensure their exact call-sign is used by the ATCT. Hearing
   the correct location of your vehicle but the wrong call-sign does not give approval for your
44                                                         440AWI13-213 25 MARCH 2014


  request. For example, if your vehicle’s call-sign is Ops1 and you are requesting access on to
  Runway 05 and the ATCT gives approval for Airfield 1 to proceed on Runway 05, you
  would not have approval to proceed until the ATCT states the correct call-sign, even if it
  appears obvious that you are the only vehicle at that location.
  5.2.7. Vehicle operators will read back all instructions verbatim prior to
  proceeding. Due to the complexity of air traffic control, other instructions may be given, so
  it’s important that vehicle operators listen carefully and read back the instructions as they
  understand them. Note: If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you do
  not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to “Say Again”.
  5.2.8. When a vehicle operator advises the ATCT that they are out of the CMA or off the
  runway, they must ensure a response from the ATCT is received. This will indicate the
  Control Tower understands that your vehicle is no longer on the CMA or on the runway.
  Note: The ATCT is often busy on other frequencies and may take some time to respond.
  Vehicle operators should be patient and pause before calling again.
  5.2.9. If other vehicles will accompany the vehicle requesting access to an area, the vehicle
  operator must say the word, “plus” and the number that will accompany, for example;
  “Escort 1 plus 2 request to cross runway 23”.
  5.2.10. The vehicle operator is personally responsible to check for approaching aircraft,
  either in the air or on the ground.
  5.2.11. All vehicles will report when runway crossing has been completed and all vehicles
  are beyond established hold lines.
  5.2.12. Radio Phraseology Samples
     5.2.12.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:
         5.2.12.1.1. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground… Freight 9”
         5.2.12.1.2. Pope Ground: “Freight 9…Pope Ground”
         5.2.12.1.3. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Freight 9 request to cross Runway
         23 at Taxiway Mike”
         5.2.12.1.4. Pope Ground: “Freight 9, Pope Ground cross Runway 23 at Taxiway
         Mike, report when off”
         5.2.12.1.5. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Freight 9 crossing Runway 23 at
         Taxiway Mike, will report when off”
         5.2.12.1.6. Once the crossing is complete…
             5.2.12.1.6.1. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Freight 9 off Runway23 on
             Taxiway Romeo.”
             5.2.12.1.6.2. Pope Ground: “Freight 9, Pope Ground, Roger”
     5.2.12.2. A typical runway crossing transmission with a HOLD SHORT instruction
     sequence is as follows:
         5.2.12.2.1. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Golf 2”
         5.2.12.2.2. Pope Ground: “Golf 2…Pope Ground”
440AWI13-213 25 MARCH 2014                                                                       45


         5.2.12.2.3. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Golf 2 request to cross Runway 23 at
         Taxiway Delta North”
         5.2.12.2.4. Pope Ground: “Golf 2…HOLD SHORT of Runway 23.”
         5.2.12.2.5. Vehicle Operator: “Pope Ground, Golf 2, Holding Short of Runway 23
         at Taxiway Delta North.” (STOP. DO NOT PROCEED ONTO OR ACROSS THE
         RUNWAY)
   5.2.13. Common Use Phrases and Words.
      5.2.13.1. Radio phraseology on the airfield will be strictly adhered to in order to reduce
      confusion and streamline communications.
      5.2.13.2. “Ten-Codes” (i.e. “10-4”, “10-9” etc.) are specifically prohibited for use in
      communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC).
      5.2.13.3. Standard phraseology should be used to the maximum extent possible. (See
      Table 5.1)
      5.2.13.4. ATC radio frequencies are reserved for ATC communications only.
      Communications between vehicles or between vehicles and aircraft are prohibited.

5.3. Lost Communications Procedures.
   5.3.1. Light Gun Signals. In an emergency, such as loss of communication, the ATCT may
   use light gun signals to control vehicles. Vehicle operators must comply with all light gun
   signals from the ATCT. The standard light gun signals for control of aerodrome traffic are:
   Note:
      5.3.1.1. Steady Green Light – Permitted to cross runway or taxiway.
      5.3.1.2. Steady Red Light – STOP. Vehicle will not be moved.
      5.3.1.3. Flashing Red Light – Clear active runway or taxiway immediately.
      5.3.1.4. Flashing White Light – Return to starting point.
      5.3.1.5. Alternating Red and Green Light – General warning, exercise extreme caution.
   5.3.2. In the event of communication loss between the ATCT and the vehicle operator, and
   in the event that the vehicle operator does not respond to light gun signals, the ATCT will
   raise and lower the intensity levels of the runway edge lights. The purpose of this signal is to
   alert the vehicle operator to immediately exit the runway. All vehicle operators/pedestrians
   must exit the runway immediately. Contact ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the
   runway and include any pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If not
   able to communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication such
   as a cellular phone (when available).
   5.3.3. There are no known radio dead spots at Pope AAF.
   5.3.4. ATCT visual blind spots are located on Taxiway B before Runway Hold Line, at
   Vehicle Gate X10, and at ACE Board (see Attachment 8).

maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)

3 APS escorting Army personnel on Green Ramp.
Runway—A paved surface used by aircraft to land and take off.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
