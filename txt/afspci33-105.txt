This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 33-1, Command, Control, Communications, and
Computer (C4) Systems, and specifies how to distribute astrodynamic software developed by or belong-
ing to HQ AFSPC units. It applies to Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), subordinate
units, supporting activities and contractors who develop, acquire, maintain or deliver computer software,
including all systems that require astrodynamic algorithms. It also applies to Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units gained by HQ AFSPC. It further details particular proce-
dures for release of software developed by or for HQ AFSPC. For guidance on the DoD Freedom of Infor-
mation, refer to: Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5400.7, The DoD Freedom of Information
Act Program. DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, Appendix 3, Section 2 describes the use of
the marking “For Official Use Only” in the context of software and other applications. DoD 5200.1-R ref-
erences DoDI 7930.2 and DoDD 8500.1, Security Requirements for Automated Information Systems.
AFSPCI 60-102, Space Surveillance Astrodynamic Standards, mandates that only standard constants,
physical models and astrodynamic algorithms will be used in all AFSPC systems requiring space vehicle
trajectory data from or providing space vehicle trajectory data to the Space Control Center (SCC). Refer
to Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and terms.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1. General. This instruction defines procedures for release of HQ AFSPC astrodynamic software,
including the AFSPC Astrodynamic Standards Software used in the SCC for the space control mission
and various Orbital Analysis Software. Attachment 5 provides a listing of all HQ AFSPC software cur-
rently governed by this instruction.
   1.1. Over the past 15 years or so, various commercial companies have produced and marketed prod-
   ucts that they claim contain some of HQ AFSPC’s astrodynamic algorithms. These claims are very
   difficult to confirm. In many cases, HQ AFSPC has no documentation that states why, when, and from
2                                                                    AFSPCI33-105 2 AUGUST 2004


    whom the contractor obtained the Command’s code. Consequently, HQ AFSPC and other DoD units
    may have unknowingly purchased its own software.
    1.2. If the claims are true, the algorithms and code contained in these products may be outdated ver-
    sions or had even been modified without consultation and certification from HQ AFSPC. Since the
    contractor rarely provides source code of its proprietary system, HQ AFSPC cannot confirm whether
    the system’s software actually contains the HQ AFSPC “astrodynamic algorithms.” Consequently,
    HQ AFSPC cannot perform verification and validation that the astrodynamic algorithms have been
    utilized correctly in decision support systems, potentially critical to the space support provided to
    other combat units. Because of the severity of the problem with HQ AFSPC’s astrodynamic algo-
    rithms, an overall instruction for control and release of all of the command’s astrodynamic standards
    software is required.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. HQ AFSPC/XPY Responsibilities.
       2.1.1. The HQ AFSPC/XPY maintains all Astrodynamic Standards Software and is responsible
       for software updates, changes, etc. The Integrated Space Command and Control (ISC2) contractor
       will assume responsibility for maintaining the Astrodynamic Standards Software library on a date
       specified by HQ AFSPC/XPY.
       2.1.2. HQ AFSPC/XPY sends the specified astrodynamic algorithms in the code format specified
       by the requesting agency upon receipt of distribution authorization from HQ AFSPC/XOC.
       2.1.3. HQ AFSPC/XPY maintains the Satellite Track (SATRAC) Orbital Analysis Software.
    2.2. Space Warfare Center (SWC)/XID Responsibilities.
       2.2.1. SWC/XID maintains the Satellite and Missile Analysis Tool (SMAT), and Space Common
       Operating Picture and Exploitation System (SCOPES) in the Orbital Analysis Software library.
       2.2.2. Forward all internal SMAT requirements to HQ AFSPC/DRC (Space Superiority Branch).
       2.2.3. Develop and maintain SMAT and SCOPES software.
       2.2.4. With assistance of AFSPC/XPY, test software and perform Validation and Verification
       (V&V) according to US Air Force Validation and Accreditation policy.
       2.2.5. Provide development team/technical software support to appropriate units for SMAT/
       SCOPES issues, as required.
       2.2.6. SWC/XID sends the specified HQ AFSPC Orbital Analysis Software, SMAT or SCOPES,
       in the code format specified by the requesting agency upon receipt of distribution authorization
       from HQ AFSPC/XOC.
           2.2.6.1. Place Validated and Verified software releases on the proper web server(s) for distri-
           bution.
           2.2.6.2. Distribute SMAT/SCOPES software via CD-ROM in the event SIPRNET and/or
           NIPRNET is unavailable.
    2.3. HQ AFSPC/XOCS Responsibilities. The AFSPC Space Situation Awareness Branch Chief
    (HQ AFSPC/XOCS) will be the final approving authority, on behalf of HQ AFSPC/XOC, for all
    requests for distribution of Astrodynamic Standards Software or Orbital Analysis Software. Upon
AFSPCI33-105 2 AUGUST 2004                                                                            3


  receipt of a request for distribution of HQ AFSPC Astrodynamic Standards Software or Orbital Anal-
  ysis Software, a HQ AFSPC/XOCS action officer (AO) will:
     2.3.1. Review the request to ensure that the Requesting or Sponsoring Organization has identified
     the government requirement for the HQ AFSPC-owned software and stated its technical justifica-
     tions.
     2.3.2. Coordinate requests that involve contractor organizations through other HQ AFSPC offices
     and consolidate responses. At a minimum, these agencies will include:
         2.3.2.1. HQ AFSPC/XPY (Space Analysis Division). Coordinates on all requests that involve
         contractor organizations.
         2.3.2.2. HQ AFSPC/DRC. Coordinates on all requests that involve contractor organizations.
         2.3.2.3. HQ AFSPC/PKM. Coordinates on all requests that involve contractor organizations.
         2.3.2.4. Requests that deviate from standard practices will be reviewed by HQ AFSPC/JAI
         (International Law). Deviation from standard practices is defined as a practice that raises the
         level of concern of approval authorities. For example a requester that has made modifications
         to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) from the
         established format prescribed by this regulation would require review by HQ AFSPC/JAI to
         ensure the original intent of the MOA or NDA is maintained.
         2.3.2.5. Requests involving possible release to foreign entities or governments (including
         aliens resident in the U.S.) will be coordinated with HQ AFSPC/JAI and HQ AFSPC/XPIF
         (International Affairs Division).
         2.3.2.6. Requests that involve the Combatant Commanders Integrated C2 System (CCIC2S)
         or its contractors will be coordinated with HQ AFSPC/DRN (C3 and Navigation Division).
     2.3.3. Requests that involve only military organizations can be approved without formal staffing
     by HQ AFSPC/XOCS.
     2.3.4. Prepare Recommended Response. Once all tasked agencies have completed coordination,
     the HQ AFSPC/XOCS AO will provide a consolidated recommended response for approval/dis-
     approval to the Space Situation Awareness Branch Chief (HQ AFSPC/XOCS).
     2.3.5. Resolution of Non Concur Issues. HQ AFSPC/XOCS will attempt to resolve any non-con-
     currence for release of the software with the coordinating, requesting or sponsoring organizations.
     If resolution cannot be accomplished, the issue shall be referred to Chief of the Space Control
     Division (HQ AFSPC/XOC) or higher for final decision.
     2.3.6. Disapproval. If the request is disapproved, the HQ AFSPC/XOCS AO will notify (in writ-
     ing) the Requesting or Sponsoring Organization, and will provide the rationale for the disapproval.
     The Requesting or Sponsoring Organization may present any additional information regarding
     requests that may assist XOCS in reconsidering its decision.
     2.3.7. Approval. Upon approval of the request, the HQ AFSPC/XOCS AO will:
         2.3.7.1. Ensure government/contractor signatures of NDA/MOA comply with paragraph
         2.4.2. and 2.4.3.
         2.3.7.2. Ensure that NDA/MOAs have tracking numbers assigned if applicable.
4                                                                   AFSPCI33-105 2 AUGUST 2004


          2.3.7.3. Obtain HQ AFSPC/XOCS signature for the MOA/NDA.
          2.3.7.4. Notify HQ AFSPC/XPY or SWC/XID of approval to distribute software. Provide
          courtesy copy of signed MOA/NDA to HQ AFSPC/XPY or SWC/XID as applicable.
          2.3.7.5. Provide copies of signed MOA/NDA to the requesting government organization, con-
          tractor and distributing organization (HQ AFSPC/XPY or SWC/XID).
          2.3.7.6. Maintain a library of approved and disapproved requests for Astrodynamic Standards
          Software and Orbital Analysis Software.
    2.4. Requesting or Sponsoring Organization:
       2.4.1. Request Letter Submission Guidance:
          2.4.1.1. The requesting agency will send a request letter (Attachment 2) to HQ AFSPC/
          XOCS, identifying the specific U.S. Government requirement, including the contract vehicle
          if acquiring for use by a Government contractor. Request letters will include a statement of
          impact describing consequence(s) if request is denied and will attach either an NDA or MOA,
          as applicable, in the format prescribed by Attachment 3 and Attachment 4. All requests for
          distribution of HQ AFSPC Astrodynamic Software will be submitted in writing to:


              HQ AFSPC/XOCS

                     Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4420


       2.4.2. Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Submission Guidance:
          2.4.2.1. When the requesting agency will utilize government personnel to meet the require-
          ment for which the software is required, it will submit an executed NDA (Attachment 3) to
          HQ AFSPC/XOCS. The agency will maintain a copy of that agreement for a minimum of one
          (1) year after it returns the software to HQ AFSPC/XOCS. A military squadron commander,
          civilian equivalent or higher, will sign the NDA. Promptly report to HQ AFSPC/XOCS any
          violations of the signed NDA.
       2.4.3. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) Submission Guidance:
          2.4.3.1. When the requesting agency will utilize contractor personnel to meet the requirement
          for which the software is requested, the responsible Contractor Program Manager will submit
          a MOA (Attachment 4) through the government program manager and cognizant contracting
          officer to HQ AFSPC/XOCS. Each subcontractor organization will also complete a MOA and
          submit it through the government program manager and government contracting officer to HQ
          AFSPC/XOCS. The responsible government program manager, government contracting
          officer, and responsible contractor program manager will sign the MOA prior to submission to
          HQ AFSPC/XOCS. Promptly report to HQ AFSPC/XOCS any violations of the signed MOA.
          Note: Every contractor/subcontractor that requires access to the software must sign a separate
          MOA with HQ AFSPC/XOCS. However, a single contractor may request copies of multiple
          applications via a single request letter and MOA.
AFSPCI33-105 2 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 5


         2.4.3.2. Ensure that, upon termination of the contract or completion of the effort for which it
         was needed, all copies of the HQ AFSPC software (including all documentation) that were
         provided pursuant to the MOA are either returned to HQ AFSPC/XOCS or destroyed with
         proof of destruction maintained.
         2.4.3.3. Ensure the MOA is incorporated in the contract file and maintained IAW the provi-
         sions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its supplements and AFI 25-201, Support
         Agreements Procedures.
         2.4.3.4. In the event a MOA is deviated from, the contracting officer will ensure the contract
         is modified to incorporate the MOA IAW HQ AFSPC/XOCS and HQ AFSPC/JA guidance.
         2.4.3.5. Contractors are responsible to notify HQ AFSPC/XOCS of contract extensions to
         remain eligible to receive HQ AFSPC software updates.
         2.4.3.6. Contract Re-competition/Award. HQ AFSPC astrodynamic software will be trans-
         ferred between outgoing and incoming contractors after contract re-competition/award by hav-
         ing the incoming contractor complete a new request letter and MOA IAW with this instruction.
      2.4.4. Special Justification for Astrodynamic Standards Software Source Code. R e q u e s t e d
      Astrodynamic Standards Software will be provided by HQ AFSPC IAW AFSPCI 60-102, Space

Terms
Algorithm—A step-by-step method for solving a mathematical problem. As an example for this
instruction, an algorithm is used to compute a satellite’s orbit.
Astrodynamic Algorithms—Algorithms which utilize geophysical constants and satellite Element Sets
(“ELSET”) or vectors to accurately define the past, present and future positions of space objects in orbit
around the earth.
Executable Code (or “Executable”)—A commonly-used term that describes the file (or files) of a
software program. The file(s) consists solely of computer machine language that can be “executed” or
operated. If executable files are printed, the printout is unintelligible machine language letters, numbers,
and symbols. With executable code, one can “run” the software program but cannot read it, understand it,
or modify it.
Object Code—The code produced by a compiler. Programmers write programs in a form called source
code. The source code consists of instructions in a particular language, like C or FORTRAN. Computers,
however, can only execute instructions written in a low-level language called machine language. To get
from source code to machine language, the programs must be transformed by a compiler. The compiler
produces an intermediary form called object code. Object code is often the same as, or similar to, a
computer’s machine language. The final step in producing an executable program is to transform the
object code into machine language, if it is not already in this form. This can be done by a number of
different types of programs, called assemblers, binders, linkers, and loaders.
Office of Primary Responsibility—An individual or organization within HQ AFSPC, or any military
organization designated to provide information and management on a specific activity.
Orbital Analysis Software—HQ AFSPC Orbital Analysis Software are approved tools for operational
support, decision making, orbital and missile trajectory analysis and training and education. SMAT,
SCOPES and SATRAC are examples of Orbital Analysis Software.
Product—The Astrodynamic Standards Software or Orbital Analysis Software to be delivered.
Requesting Organization—The organization requesting a copy of the executable (or object) or source
code of one or more pieces of HQ AFSPC-owned software or algorithms.
Source Code—Program instructions in their original form. The word source differentiates code from
8                                                                  AFSPCI33-105 2 AUGUST 2004


various other forms that it can have (for example, object code and executable code). Source code is the
only format that is readable by humans. Possession of source code allows modification of the program.
Sponsoring Organization—The Government agency requesting a copy of the executable (or object) or
source code of one or more pieces of HQ AFSPC-controlled software or algorithms for use by a
contractor who is providing direct support through an authorized contract vehicle.
