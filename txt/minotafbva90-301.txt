                                               The USAF has an excellent complaint program. It is designed to provide quick
                                               and fair feedback/resolution to your military service-related grievances. The
                                               Installation IG is committed to effective complaints resolution and serves the
                                               interests of all personnel who live and/or work on Minot AFB.
                                               You can make a complaint at any level without fear of reprisal--no one may act
                                               against you just because you complained. If you have reason to believe
                                               someone has taken action against you simply because you complained,
                                               inform your commander or any IG immediately.

AFI 90-301 describes how to make a complaint. You may go to an IG at any level, but experience has shown
commanders/supervisors closest to the situation can best solve complaints. Therefore, we encourage you to seek
assistance through your chain of command before seeing the IG.
If a USAF policy, directive or instruction provides a specific means of handling appeals, you must exhaust those procedures
first. Additionally, the IG will not process a complaint of an appeal unless your complaint in the appeal process was
mishandled prejudicially and improperly. Mere dissatisfaction with the outcome of a properly conducted appeal is not
sufficient basis for an IG investigation. Air Force policy prohibits the IG from handling/investigating certain issues (those
governed by specific instructions). The following list identifies a few of these "non-IG" complaints and the official
guidance/offices you should consult for resolution. NOTE: If in doubt of the appropriate means for resolving your
complaint, always call the IG for clarification.
