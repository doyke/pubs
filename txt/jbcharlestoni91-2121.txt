SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. General:
     1.1. BASH Phase Conditions. A moderate wildlife-aircraft strike hazard exists at Joint Base
     Charleston, NAAF, and the surrounding areas due to resident and migratory wildlife. Daily
     and seasonal bird movements, as well as movement from non-flying wildlife, create a hazard
     to aircraft operations. All pilots and operations supervisors must be alert to these dangers,
     which can be sub-divided into categories as follows:
        1.1.1. Migratory bird threat: Joint Base Charleston lies along a major migratory route
        and attracts species for rest and feeding due to suitable habitats. Some species migrate
        through the airfield at particular times of the year increasing the total amount of birds at
        Joint Base Charleston and NAAF. Mitigation is accomplished through the use of
        harassment and depredation, the use of a USDA a Biologist, and by restricting flying
        operations. During heightened times of bird migration, Phase II BASH procedures may
        be implemented as listed in AFI l1-2C-17 V3, C-17 Operation Procedures, All AW Flight
        Crew Bulletin (FCB) and/or 437 AW Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
        1.1.2. Indigenous bird threat: Joint Base Charleston and NAAF are inhabited year-round
        by several species of birds regardless of the migration of other bird species.
        1.1.3. Local wildlife threat: Many species of wildlife (deer, coyote, foxes, etc.) represent
        a high risk to flying operations at Joint Base Charleston and NAAF.
     1.2. BASH Phase Periods.
        1.2.1. When the local bird population is comprised mostly of indigenous birds rather
        than migrating birds, Phase I BASH procedures, as outlined in AFI11-2C-17 V3, FCBs
        and/or FCIFs are in effect.
        1.2.2. The 437 OG/CC establishes a Phase II period at Joint Base Charleston and NAAF
        based on the bird migration period, increased bird strike incidents and whether or not
        Phase II procedures would have prevented the strikes. If bird migration is prolonged, or
        started earlier than normal, the 437 OG/CC may modify Phase II periods as necessary,
        with recommendations provided by 437 AW/SE.
     1.3. Bird Watch Condition (BWC).
        1.3.1. Completely separate from the BASH Phase I or II distinction, the BWC measures
        an immediate and continuously changing bird threat at Joint Base Charleston and NAAF.
        It measures the threat only within close proximity to the runways. It does not provide data
        or bird activity information for low level routes or other airfields (consult the Bird
        Avoidance Model (BAM) and Avian Hazard Avoidance System (AHAS) databases for
        this information). The threat is determined by observation of bird type, the quantity of
        birds, and the proximity of the birds to the runways.
        1.3.2. Changing BWC. BWC is formally changed by 437 OSS/OSA. Recommendations
        for BWC changes can be made by any individual (aircrew, safety, etc.), but the final
JBCHARLESTONI91-2121 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             3


     approval authority for changing the BWC remains with Airfield Operations. Personnel
     observing bird concentrations on the airfield, as defined in 1.3.2.1.l.through 1.3.2.1.3.,
     should call 437 OSS/OSA with the appropriate information. This information should
     include (at a minimum) the type, quantity, and location of the birds. Airfield Operations
     will pass all pertinent information to the Charleston Air Traffic Control Tower and 628
     ABW/CP. Furthermore, they will update the base operations airfield status board in base
     operations. EXCEPTION: If the USDA Biologist sees a threat that represents an
     immediate or extreme threat, they will call the tower (on either ground or tower
     frequency) with all appropriate information (change in BWC, location of species, species
     type, other important information, etc.) and immediately disperse/eradicate the species.
     Upon completion, the USDA Biologist will brief Airfield Operations on the situation.
     Airfield Operations will pass all pertinent information to the Command Post and will
     update the airfield board in base operations.
         1.3.2.1. There are three types of BWC.
             1.3.2.1.1. Bird watch condition LOW is defined as no significant threat of bird
             activity in the local pattern. Flying operations are not restricted.
             1.3.2.1.2. Bird watch condition MODERATE is defined as concentrations of 10
             to 15 large birds (egrets, waterfowl, raptors, gulls, etc.) or 15 to 30 small birds
             (terns, swallows, etc.) observed in locations that represent an increased potential
             for strike.
             1.3.2.1.3. Bird watch condition SEVERE is defined as heavy concentrations of
             birds (more than 15 large birds or 30 small birds) on or above the runway,
             taxiways, infield areas and departure or arrival routes or in areas that represent an
             imminent hazard to safe flying operations.
             1.3.2.1.4. The different BWC levels may restrict flying operations. Check the
             most current 437 AW FCB/FCIF for the latest guidance.
  1.4. Bird/Hazard Working Group (BHWG). A coordinated agency effort aimed primarily
  at preventive measures that provide the best chance of avoiding a collision between birds/wildlife
  and aircraft. The BHWG may meet monthly during phase II periods; otherwise it meets once a
  semiannual period (usually in March and October). The 437 AW/CV chairs the BHWG and
  members include: 437 OG (CC or CD), 437 MXG (CC or CD), 628 MSG (CC or CD), 437
  OSS/CC, 437 OSS/OSA (Airfield Management), USDA Biologists, 628 CES/CEO, 628
  CES/CEIE, 437 AW/SE, 628 ABW/SE, Charleston Air Traffic Control Representative,
  Charleston County Aviation Authority Director of Operations, and 14 AS, 15 AS, 16 AS, 17 AS,
  315 AW safety representatives. BHWG meeting minutes will be taken and stored on the 437
  AW/SEF EIM site for 2 years at the following link and be available for all JBC personnel:
  https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/437se/Flight/BASH%20Program/Forms/AllItems.aspx?Root
  Folder=%2forg%2f437se%2fFlight%2fBASH%20Program%2fBird%20Hazard%20
  Working%20Group%20and%20FOD%20DOPP&FolderCTID=&View=%7bE770C4
  C7%2d428E%2d441F%2dB49A%2d81C364A516FA%7d. BHWG minutes should
  include (at a minimum): a list of attendees, USDA issues at JBC and North Auxiliary
  Airfield, and a status update BASH related projects and recommendations.
  1.5. Birdstrike Determination. Personnel will use the following guidance to determine the
  presence of a birdstrike. If a birdstrike is confirmed, use the appropriate checklists to report
4                                           JBCHARLESTONI91-2121 26 NOVEMBER 2013


    the strike, collect remains, and wipe clean the area to avoid duplicate reports. Birdstrikes are
    defined as:
       1.5.1. Any smudge accompanied by fleshy bird remains (i.e., down, feathers, body parts,
       etc.)
       1.5.2. Any smudge that is close (within 2 inches) to new aircraft damage (i.e., a dent,
       hole in aircraft skin, etc.), with or without fleshy remains.
       1.5.3. Any smudge that does not meet the conditions of 1.5.1. or 1.5.2., but is greater
       than 6 inches in length and reddish in color is a bird strike. Other smudges will not be
       reported as bird strikes. NOTE: These procedures do not relieve 437 MXG of the
       responsibility to conduct proper aircraft inspections. For instance, if a smudge is found on
       an engine inlet, deciding the smudge is not a bird strike does not mean an engine
       inspection should not be accomplished.
    1.6. Deer population control. Deer inhabit areas within the boundaries of Joint Base
    Charleston and NAAF. Deer population control will be attained through the use of the
    recreational hunting program, deer depredation, and non-lethal methods of control. The OPR
    for nuisance deer management is 437 AW Safety. The following agencies actively help
    achieve our deer control as outlined in JB Charleston Instruction 32-7064.
       1.6.1. 628 CES/CEIE controls the recreational deer and turkey hunting program. South
       Carolina deer hunting season runs 15 August through 1 January and Turkey season is 15
       March to 1 May, IAW all existing federal and state laws. Hunting is allowed four days
       per week (Friday through Monday) in hunt areas 4,7,10,11,12,13,16,19A, I-1 and I-2
       IAW JBCI 32-7064 paragraph 6.1. Hunting is allowed seven days per week in hunt areas
       1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15A, 15B, 17A, 17B, 17C, 19B, 20, and 21 IAW JBCI 32-7064
       paragraph 6.1. Any questions regarding rules and procedures for the recreational deer
       hunting program will be referred to 628 CES/CEIE.
       1.6.2. Deer depredation may be accomplished by the USDA Biologist, 628 CES/CEIE,
       437 AW/SE, and 437 OSS/OSA. Depredation activities will occur year round. All
       depredation activities will be conducted IAW laws and procedures on file with 628
       CES/CEIE. Depredation permits from both state and federal regulatory agencies will be
       obtained and managed by 628 CES/CEIE. Deer depredation permits are for deer
       harvested outside of regular hunt times/seasons and only apply to deer in airfield areas.
       Questions regarding these rules and laws will be referred to 628 CES/CEIE.
    1.7. Disposal of depredated animals. Animal depredation must be conducted IAW all
    federal and state laws. Applicable depredation permits are kept for the base at 628
    CES/CEIE. Animals depredated are to be disposed of by the person who performed the
    depredation and IAW federal and state laws on file at the 628 CES/CEIE. Any animal
    remains discovered on the airfield will be collected and disposed of IAW the USDA contract,
    i.e. buried or placed in a lidded dumpster. Animal remains may be donated, but only after a
    hold harmless agreement has been signed by the receiver of the depredated animal which is
    then placed on file with 437 AW/SE. No field dressing of and subsequent disposal of remains
    will be allowed at NAAF.

       2.1.12. Present any significant findings to the BHWG and facilitate any actions required
       to reduce bird strike potential.
       2.1.13. Maintain Joint Base Charleston and NAAF Wildlife Dispersal Team IAW
       AFPAM 91-212 and identify the names of individuals selected for the dispersal team.
       These names will be forwarded to 628 CES/CEIE for record keeping purposes.
    2.2. 628 CES, IAW AFI 32-7064, will:
       2.2.1. Grass Height. Mow airfield to maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14
       inches. Each installation BHWG will establish airfield mowing zone boundaries.
       Installations located in arid climates where growing grass is difficult may develop natural
       vegetation on the airfield to limit attractiveness to wildlife. These situations require
       comprehensive vegetation and wildlife hazard management and will be reviewed
       individually by AFSC/SEFW for approval. MAJCOM safety offices may request a
       waiver to grass height restrictions from AFSC/SEFW.
       2.2.2. Perform mowing operations at an appropriate frequency and schedule to ensure
       airfield grass remains within the 7 – 14” specified tolerance. HQ AMC/A7V has
       determined that 11 inches is an optimum height to set mowing equipment to maintain the
       7-14 inch standard. This takes into account grass lying over from winds, rain, etc.
       2.2.3. Eliminate all growth in airfield ditches. Perform weekly checks to monitor grass or
       foliage height.
       2.2.4. Identify and drain standing water in low areas to reduce bird/wildlife habitat.
       EXCEPTION: Areas that have been designated as wetlands will not be drained.
       2.2.5. Maintain homogeneous vegetation areas on the airfield through elimination of
       stands of brush and shrubs from grassy areas. Perform monthly checks to verify
       conditions.
       2.2.6. Inspect areas of the airfield that are subject to water pooling for adequate insect
       control on a monthly basis.
       2.2.7. Arrange for application of pesticides, seed suppressants and herbicides, as
       necessary, to eliminate attractants to bird populations.
       2.2.8. Obtain federal and state wildlife hunting permits for recreational deer hunters and
       depredation permits for 437 AW/SE, 437 OSS/OSA, and the USDA Biologist at Joint
       Base Charleston and NAAF. Names to be included on permits (other than recreational
       deer hunting) will be forwarded by 437 AW/SE to 628 CES/CEIE.
       2.2.9. Submit all required reports for depredation activities to appropriate regulatory
       agencies using data provided by the USDA Biologist and 437 AW/SE.
       2.2.10. Manage the recreational deer hunting program at NAAF.
    2.3. 437 OSS/OSA will:
       2.3.1. Notify 628 ABW Command Post and the air traffic control tower of BWC
       changes.
       2.3.2. Notify aircrews of significant bird activity on the airfield. Post the bird condition
       on the base operations airfield status board.

     2.3.3. Annotate wildlife activity on the airfield and bird condition status on AF Form
     3616 Daily Record Facility Operations. The AF Form will be available for review by 437
     AW/SE and the USDA Biologist for presentation at BHWG.
     2.3.4. Train Airfield Management personnel on Bird Dispersal IAW AFPAM 91-212 and
     maintain appropriate weapons IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.
     Airfield Management will assist 437 AW SE in BASH Phase I when USDA Biologist is
     unavailable at Joint Base Charleston. During Phase II operations at Joint Base Charleston
     or at NAAF USDA Biologist will be on-call during non-duty hours.
     2.3.5. Report any wildlife hazard condition to the USDA Biologist or 437 AW/SEF
     when the USDA Biologist is unavailable.
     2.3.6. Coordinate with 628 CES to maintain airfield grass height IAW paragraph 2.2.1..
     2.3.7. Issue NOTAM for BASH Phase II period as directed by the Bird Hazard Working
     Group or the 437 OG and publish additional BASH information in appropriate Flight
     Information Publications.
  2.4. USDA Biologist will:
     2.4.1. Report directly to 437 AW/SE.
     2.4.2. Act as the primary executor of all wildlife dispersal efforts at Joint Base
     Charleston and NAAF IAW their Memorandum of Understanding, with assistance from
     437 AW/SE and 437 OSS/OSA as required.
     2.4.3. Meet monthly with 437 AW/SE to discuss the following conditions:
        2.4.3.1. The status of the "clear zone" areas off the end of the runways at Joint Base
        Charleston and NAAF.
        2.4.3.2. Grass height, drainage ditch foliage, low area standing water, etc.
        2.4.3.3. Provide input for Phase I and Phase II forecasts and the associated priorities
        for wildlife management.
        2.4.3.4. Report to the airfield for emergency depredation activity within 2 hours
        during normal duty hours.
     2.4.4. Provide data on number and species killed to 628 CES/CEIE to be used in
     preparing reports to be submitted to appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies and
     provide 437 AW/SE with a copy of this information.
     2.4.5. Coordinate trapping or depredation activities with 628 CES/CEIE.      All
     communication with federal and state regulatory agencies should flow through 628
     CES/CEIE.
     2.4.6. Change the BWC, if deemed necessary IAW paragraph 1.3.2. Under no
     circumstance should the USDA Biologist delay notification to the air traffic control
     tower. The primary intent is to remove imminent hazards to the flying environment as
     quickly as possible.
     2.4.7. Inform 437 OSS/OSA when entering or leaving the airfield.
     2.4.8. Inform 437 OSS/OSA before initiating wildlife dispersal/depredation techniques.

Terms
Bird Avoidance—Techniques (including radar detection, warning, and use of bird data) that
reduce potential for bird strikes by allowing aircrews to schedule or maneuver to avoid bird
concentrations.
Bird Hazard Reduction Plan—A written document that addresses bird strike hazards and
designates organizations responsible for implementing solutions.
JBCHARLESTONI91-2121 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           11


Bird/Hazard Working Group (BHWG)—A coordinated agency effort aimed primarily at
preventive measures that provide the best chance of avoiding a collision between birds/wildlife
and aircraft which may meet monthly during phase II periods; otherwise it meets once a
semiannual period (usually in March and October).
Bird Species—A group of interbreeding birds with common characteristics such as size, shape,
voice, and behavior.
Bird/Wildlife Strike—Any collision between a bird or other species of wildlife and an aircraft.
Bird Watch Condition Codes—The following terminology is established for rapid
communication of bird activity. When communicating, avoid color-coded conditions to eliminate
any confusion with color codes used during exercises, contingencies, and emergencies (i.e.,
disaster preparedness exercises). Also, give bird locations with the condition code:
       - Bird Watch Condition SEVERE. Bird activity on or immediately above the active
       runway or other specific location representing high potential for strikes. Supervisors and
       aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas
       under condition SEVERE.
       - Bird Watch Condition MODERATE. Bird activity near the active runway or other
       specific location representing increased potential for strikes. BWC moderate requires
       increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors, and caution by aircrews.
       - Bird Watch Condition LOW. Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low
       potential for strikes.
Damaging Bird/Wildlife Strike—Any bird/wildlife strike that causes reportable damage
according to AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
Habitat—The total environmental elements of food, water, shelter, nesting sites, and space that
must be present for wildlife species to survive.
