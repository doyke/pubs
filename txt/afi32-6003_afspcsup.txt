                                           Chapter 1

                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Management.
   1.1.1. GOQs receive close scrutiny from both the private and public sector. The Office of the
   Secretary of Defense (OSD) is involved with GOQ policies and oversight, and GOQs
   frequently receive special congressional interest.
   1.1.2. The laws, rules, and congressional language concerning GOQs are complex. Those
   responsible for GOQ management at MAJCOMs and installations, particularly base civil
   engineers (BCE), housing flight chiefs, and BCE financial management personnel, must
   understand GOQ rules, convey these rules concisely to general officer residents and base
   leadership, and consistently apply those rules to the management of GOQs.
1.2. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). OSD, Director of Administration and
Management (DA&M), designates SCPs and establishes entitlements for furnishings and
tableware support as directed in DODD 1100.12. OSD, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
(AT&L), establishes broad housing policy under DOD 4165.63-M.
   1.2.1. An SCP is occupied by a general officer or civilian equivalent and carries public
   entertainment responsibilities requiring the incumbent to represent the interests of the United
   States in official and social activities involving foreign and domestic dignitaries. Although
   these positions are typically limited to generals (O-10), general officers in a lower grade may
   be designated as an SCP if they meet one of the following criteria:
       1.2.1.1. Responsible directly to the Secretary of Defense or secretary of a military
       department.
       1.2.1.2. Serving as the top US representative in an international, political, or military
       group.
       1.2.1.3. Serving as the commandant, director, president, or superintendent of a DOD or
       military service college or academy.
   1.2.2. Application for designation as an SCP is made in accordance with DODD 1100.12
   and this instruction. The requestor sends their application to the MAJCOM civil engineer
   (CE). Requests should include specific justification regarding how the position meets the
   OSD criteria, and supporting documentation estimating the number of official entertainment
   functions, level of guests entertained, and other pertinent information about official
   representational duties. The MAJCOM/CC endorses the request and forwards it to the
   Deputy Chief of Staff, Installations & Logistics, The Office of the Civil Engineer (HQ
   USAF/ILE), who processes the request for Air Force Chief of Staff (CSAF) endorsement and
   OSD (DA&M) approval.
1.3. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Installations (SAF/IEI). SAF/IEI:
   1.3.1. Approves Air Force housing policy and provides oversight for GOQ management.
   1.3.2. Approves and forwards to Congress out-of-cycle budget requests exceeding the
   $35,000 annual GOQ limits (Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and Operations, Maintenance,
   and Repair (OMR)).

     1.3.3. Approves and forwards after-the-fact notification to Congress when the $35,000 M&R
     threshold (or higher Congressionally approved limit) is exceeded solely due to costs
     associated with environmental remediation. Annual Military Construction Appropriation
     Acts prohibit exceeding $35,000 per unit for maintenance and repair unless the committees
     are first notified and 30 days pass, except in the case of unforeseen necessary environmental
     remediation.
     1.3.4. Approves and forwards after-the-fact notification to Congress when the $35,000 M&R
     threshold is not exceeded but the $35,000 OMR threshold (or higher Congressionally
     approved limit) is exceeded solely due to costs associated with environmental remediation,
     occupant safety, and/or security.
     1.3.5. Approval authority for lawn irrigation systems.
     1.3.6. Approves MAJCOM requests to exempt M&R expenditures on historical features
     from the $35K OMR limit.
1.4. The Civil Engineer (HQ USAF/ILE). HQ USAF/ILE formulates GOQ housing policy
and provides program oversight, guidance, and staff assistance to MAJCOMs and direct
reporting units (DRU), and:
     1.4.1. Develops program guidelines, facility standards, and customer service quality
     standards for GOQs, and approves or disapproves requests to add new supplemental
     furnishings items.
     1.4.2. Facilitates GOQ management education and training for all civil engineer personnel,
     including the BCE, housing flight chief, and civil engineer financial management personnel.
     1.4.3. Develops and maintains GOQ furnishings allowances and provides policy oversight of
     the SCP tableware program.
     1.4.4. Advocates for and provides required resources for GOQ management to MAJCOMs
     and DRUs.
     1.4.5. Processes requests to designate new SCPs to CSAF and OSD.
     1.4.6. Approves waivers to the 3-year rule for new or recently improved units (delegated to
     HQ USAF/ILEH).
     1.4.7. Prepares budget exhibits and notification packages for approved requests to exceed the
     $35,000 annual limits (M&R and OMR).
     1.4.8. Forwards MAJCOM-approved requests for after-the-fact notification to Congress
     when the $35,000 annual limits (OMR or M&R as appropriate) are exceeded for reasons
     authorized by law.
1.5. Major Commands (MAJCOM) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU). MAJCOMs and
DRUs provide oversight for the execution of Air Force GOQ policies, programs, and standards,
and:
     1.5.1. Develop requirements, prepare budgets, and supervise execution of programs using
     the Air Force GOQ Master Plan and the Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP).
     The MAJCOM/CE validates GOQ projects requiring MAJCOM approval to make sure the
     scope of work is consistent with the GOQ Master Plan Individual Facility Profile (IFP).

   1.5.2. Provide oversight and positive control of base GOQ programs, expenditures, and
   management actions; perform staff assistance visits and train BCE personnel, as required;
   make sure individuals responsible for GOQ management (primary and secondary GOQ
   monitor, housing flight chief, financial manager, and BCE and deputy) attend the GOQ
   Management Course.
   1.5.3. The MAJCOM/CE makes sure BCEs follow the GOQ IFP and items rated in good
   condition are not replaced early. If early replacement is required due to unforeseen failed or
   unserviceable condition, the BCE documents the circumstances with a life-cycle analysis and
   photographs or other evidence supporting the early replacement or repair decision and
   document changed conditions in the next IFP update.
   1.5.4. Forwards MAJCOM approvals to AF/ILEH to notify Congress after-the-fact when the
   $35,000 annual limits (OMR or M&R as appropriate) are exceeded for reasons authorized by
   law.
   1.5.5. The MAJCOM/CV is the approval authority for minor alteration work exceeding
   $3,000 and up to, but not exceeding, $7,500. No general may approve work on their own
   quarters or quarters of general officers senior in rank; for single installation MAJCOMs and
   DRUs the approval authority is the Air Force Assistant Vice Chief of Staff (HQ
   USAF/CVA).
      1.5.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) GOQ occupants will defer GOQ furnishing purchases
      whenever possible. All GOQ furnishing purchases must be approved, in advance, by
      AFSPC/CV, unless the GOQ is assigned to a person senior in rank to AFSPC/CV.
      Furnishing requests for AFSPC/CV, individual’s senior in rank to AFSPC/CV, and
      requests exceeding monetary furnishing limits must be approved by AFSPC/CC. Submit
      all requests to HQ AFSPC/A4/7 via e-mail (A4.7.wf@us.af.mil). Request will include:
      list of items with associated costs and purchase justification. HQ AFSPC/A7IH will
      verify statutory limits and authorizations. Requests totaling $750 or less (purchase &
      delivery) will be approved or denied on behalf of AFSPC/CV via e-mail, without a
      formal package. Requests totaling more than $750 will be staffed by HQ AFSPC/A4/7 to
      AFSPC/CV for pre-approval. If pre-approved, requestor will submit a formal request
      including a list of items with associated costs and completed AFSPC Furnishings Request
      Justification worksheet. AFSPC Furnishings Request Justification worksheet is available
      in the document library of the HQ AFSPC/A7IH SharePoint® website. (T-2).
   1.5.6. The MAJCOM/CC is the approval authority for waivers for monetary limits on
   furnishings and carpet replacement. MAJCOM/CCs validate requests to establish new SCPs
   for general officer positions within their purview. They also authorize exceptions to GOQ
   grounds maintenance in accordance with this instruction (paragraph 2.7.1). MAJCOM/CCs
   may not approve work on their own quarters or quarters of general officers senior in rank and
   must forward these requests to the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff (HQ USAF/CV) for
   approval.
1.6. 11th Wing Supply Squadron (11WG/SUPS). Upon notification, the 11WG/SUPS at
Bolling AFB provides initial-issue SCP china to newly assigned general officers. The
11WG/SUPS orders, stores, maintains, and ships SCP china in accordance with procedures in
this instruction and AFMAN 23-110. Point of contact is the 11WG/SUPS, DSN 297-0871.

                                           Chapter 2

                                      REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Concept:
   2.1.1. The Air Force is committed to maintaining GOQs in a state of excellence
   commensurate with their purpose and historical significance and to protect significant Air
   Force investments. Quality GOQs are critical to enabling senior Air Force leadership to
   perform their mission and provide adequate settings for official entertainment.
   2.1.2. The key to maintaining GOQs is properly identifying facility work requirements;
   participation by general officer residents in this process is vital. Each GOQ must have a plan
   that includes day-to-day requirements while considering future capital investments necessary
   to sustain the quality of the dwelling. Specific details for long-range requirements are in the
   GOQ IFP. For major maintenance, repair, and investment decisions, bases must use the Air
   Force GOQ Master Plan and the Air Force FHMP. All work must be consistent with Air
   Force GOQ Standards for Programming, Design and Construction as supplemented by
   MAJCOM-approved installation standards.
   2.1.3. By Congressional direction, military family housing funds are the exclusive source of
   funds for all operations and maintenance of family housing units, including those temporarily
   diverted as unaccompanied housing.
2.2. Air Force General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Master Plan. To make sure MAJCOMs and
bases appropriately plan, program, and budget for GOQ requirements, the Air Force developed a
GOQ Master Plan. The plan captures facility data, identifies improvements, major and minor
M&R requirements, and provides recommendations and cost estimates for each GOQ based on a
whole-house perspective. The GOQ Master Plan contains an IFP for each GOQ. The IFP will be
updated and incorporated into the Housing Community Profile (HCP) every 3 years as the HCP
is updated. The HCP, including the IFP, identifies requirements for all family housing and is
incorporated into the FHMP for funding priority and allocation. Whole-house projects for all
family housing will be scheduled according to overall Air Force priorities for investment funding
based on condition as determined by the Air Force FMHP.
2.3. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Guide. In addition to the GOQ Master Plan, the Air
Force has developed a GOQ Guide. The GOQ Guide is contained in a boxed set of three
volumes:
   2.3.1. Volume I, GOQ Resident’s Handbook. The handbook provides general officers, their
   spouses, and executive staffs with the rules, standards, and expectations concerning GOQs.
   The handbook also incorporates guidelines and limitations associated with overall GOQ
   program management, work requirements, furnishings authorizations, cost reporting, and
   standards.
   2.3.2. Volume II, GOQ Standards for Programming, Design, and Construction.
       2.3.2.1. This volume supplements housing facility standards in the Air Force Family
       Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction (available from the
       Air    Force    Center   for   Environmental     Excellence    [HQ     AFCEE]     at
       http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/dc/dch/mfhguide/guide.asp). Volume II also provides
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                            11


       standardized residential criteria for all GOQs, balances quality of life with cost,
       establishes architec-tural elements and building features comparable with regional and
       local housing standards, and minimizes recurring maintenance.
       2.3.2.2. Installations with GOQs should supplement Volume II with local installation
       standards compatible with Air Force parameters, but which address climatic conditions,
       architectural styles, and local construction practices. MAJCOM policies, applicable laws,
       and regulations must also be considered.
   2.3.3. Volume III, GOQ Individual Facility Profile. The IFP for each GOQ includes facility
   data, such as the age and condition of the GOQ, improvements and major and minor M&R
   requirements, and cost estimates for work accomplished using the O&M program or as a
   one-time, more cost-efficient, whole-house, improvement project. Each IFP identifies an
   interim O&M plan and a long-range whole-house investment plan.
       2.3.3.1. IFP cost estimates are categorized based on M&R codes, indicating the relative
       urgency of repair. Codes 1 through 3 prioritize work items by distinguishing among
       repairs immediately required to address life-safety issues, components that fail prior to
       the whole-house project, and those which should wait until the whole-house project is
       executed.
       2.3.3.2. Whole-house estimates combine all required maintenance, repairs, and
       investments into one project to completely revitalize a GOQ to last another 25 years.
       Whole-house projects represent the most cost-effective housing revitalization approach
       for the Air Force to meet current standards. These projects are congressionally approved
       and are typically accomplished using military construction (MILCON) funds (P-713).
   2.3.4. The following documents are available in GOQs and are accountable on AF Form
   228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and Condition Report.
       2.3.4.1. GOQ Guide, Volumes 1, 2, and 3 (boxed set), provided in all GOQs.
       2.3.4.2. Mary Starkey's Setting Household Standards, and USAF Enlisted Aides
       Household Management Guide (Guide publication, late summer 2003). These two
       documents are provided in GOQs where an enlisted aide is authorized.
2.4. Planning. The BCE prepares an annual work plan for each GOQ and uses the GOQ IFP
along with the base FHMP to prepare the long-range plan. Comprehensive planning can prevent
unprogrammed, often costly, services and maintenance. GOQ long-range plans should reflect the
total scope of work and improvements to renovate the GOQ to standards. Do not suppress costs
but make sure budget estimates accurately reflect anticipated expenditures. GOQ work may cost
more than other family housing units because of age, historic designation, design and size of
typical units, and the complexity of the work. The BCE must make sure all work is consistent
with the GOQ Master Plan and IFP.
   2.4.1. Annual Plan.
       2.4.1.1. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, prepare an annual plan that identifies
       programmed and recurring work and services required during the coming year. Inputs
       should include requirements provided by residents, current inspections, HCP, and
       approved project work (operation and maintenance [O&M] or improvement) from the
       GOQ IFP. Use priorities identified in the IFP to determine O&M work requirements.
 12                                                   AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


       Adjust the plan as new requirements develop, and include change of occupancy
       maintenance (COM) work when a change of resident is anticipated. Use the annual plan
       to schedule work throughout the year for each unit while closely monitoring cost limits.
       2.4.1.2. BCEs must document justification for accomplishing work requirements that
       cannot wait for a whole-house project. If there are compelling or unforeseen reasons that
       cause GOQ IFP components rated good or excellent to fail or be in a worsened condition,
       BCEs must document the circumstances with a life-cycle analysis and photos or other
       evidence supporting early replacement or repair decisions. The intent is not to preclude
       good maintenance and repair of GOQs but to make sure fully functional components or
       systems are not replaced until they are near the end of their economic life or it makes
       good economic sense when included as part of a larger revitalization project.
   2.4.2. GOQ Long-Range Plan. See Table 2.1.
       2.4.2.1. Bases prepare an annual long-range plan to budget GOQ costs, including
       operations; maintenance and repair; and improvement work requirements. Maintenance
       and repair and improvement requirements are identified in the IFP. The plan must cover a
       5-year period (the current year plus the following 4 years). The plan should provide
       detailed costs of management, services, furnishings, change of occupancy, minor/routine
       M&R, major M&R, grounds maintenance, minor alteration, and improvement costs for
       each year. The plan should identify the need to seek additional authority in the case
       where the total OMR/M&R costs for the year will exceed $35,000.
       2.4.2.2. When a whole-house renovation project is planned, limit M&R work to correct a
       life, health, or safety issue, or to repair a failed component that cannot wait for the whole-
       house project.

2.5. Programming. Use the installation FHMP and GOQ IFPs to identify requirements for
family housing investment or major M&R projects. Follow programming instructions contained
in AFI 32-6002. Consider all statutory limits and Air Force GOQ policies; do not exceed these
limits under any circumstances without prior congressional approval through the budget
submission process or an out-of-cycle exceed-threshold request. Bases may not perform
major M&R, minor alteration, replacement, improvement, or minor improvement to a new (P-
711) or improved (P-713; whole-house) unit within 3 years after the first resident moves in
(beneficial occupancy) following project completion without prior approval (exception noted in
paragraph 2.5.1.7).
   2.5.1. Improvements (P-713). Bases must program improvement (investment) projects to
   whole-house and whole-neighborhood criteria as defined in AFI 32-6002 and GOQ
   standards. Program scope in DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, must
   comply with approved scope and functional changes in the GOQ IFP. Major improvement
   projects are accomplished with MILCON funds (P-713) and should revitalize the unit to last
   another 25 years. This is the preferred Air Force method used to upgrade the housing
   inventory.
       2.5.1.1. Congress sets the statutory unit cost limit for housing improvements and
       concurrent major M&R and minor alteration work. The current statutory limit for
       improvement projects is $50,000 times the area cost factor (ACF). ACF is not applied in
       foreign locations. The limit excludes costs associated with installation and maintenance
       or repair of communications, security, and antiterrorism equipment required by the
       occupant in the performance of assigned duties. If the cost of a proposed improvement
       project is expected to exceed the statutory limit, the Air Force must include the project in
       the annual President’s Budget for approval by Congress.
       2.5.1.2. The project can be executed at the higher cost only if prior authority is obtained
       in the military construction authorization bill. The new limit resulting from this bill
       becomes the new statutory limit for the specific GOQ for the specific fiscal year (FY) of
       project execution.
       2.5.1.3. DD Form 1391 provides additional justification needed for congressional
       approval of all projects exceeding $50,000. This data must provide strong justification
       and be consistent with the GOQ IFP. The MAJCOM/CE will validate the work is
       consistent with the GOQ IFP by signing the DD Form 1391. The BCE will provide
       information to the base financial management office, which will prepare the economic
       analysis (EA) (AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and AFMAN 32-1089, Air Force
       Military Construction and Family Housing Economic Analysis Guide).
14                                                  AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


        2.5.1.4. An EA is required for all projects. If the EA determines the estimated
        improvement costs exceed 70 percent of the replacement cost, a replacement construction
        project will be programmed unless the GOQ is eligible for or listed on the National
        Register of Historic Places.
           2.5.1.4.1. Installation commanders may request historic properties be removed from
           the National Register following procedures in 36 CFR 60.15(a)(1)-(4).
        2.5.1.5. The most expensive unit (costs include contingency and supervision, inspection
        and overhead) in a MILCON project becomes the high-cost unit. When the most
        expensive unit is a GOQ and there is a requirement to exceed this limit, HQ USAF/ILE
        approval is required prior to proceeding. Additionally, SAF/IEI approval is required to
        exceed the high unit cost by more than 25 percent during project execution. Requests to
        exceed the most expensive unit must be signed by the MAJCOM/CE and submitted to
        HQ USAF/ILE.
        2.5.1.6. DD Forms 1391 for GOQ improvement projects (P-713) must also include
        projected major M&R. In the FY the improvement project is awarded (when funds are
        obligated), the new congressional limit for the GOQ is the only limit that applies. Since
        major M&R is included in the improvement project, the only type work authorized in the
        year of award is minor maintenance and COM (Attachment 1). In the FY improvement
        project funds are obligated, the P-713 congressionally approved limit applies. In
        following years, the $35,000 limits apply. Make sure only minor maintenance and COM
        work is allowed for 3 years following occupancy except for extremely urgent and
        compelling repairs, typically relating to health or life-safety.
        2.5.1.7. Do not undertake a replacement, improvement, minor improvement, major
        M&R, or minor alteration project on a new unit or on a unit that has been improved for 3
        years following beneficial occupancy. The 3-year limit does not apply when a project
        addresses health, safety, or life-threatening conditions, if the project falls under the
        auspices of a larger program, such as a general energy efficiency upgrade program, or if
        work must be accomplished to prevent further damage to the dwelling following a natural
        disaster or other emergency. In all cases, MAJCOMs must request approval from the
        Deputy Chief of Staff, Installations & Logistics, The Office of the Civil Engineer,
        Housing Division (HQ USAF/ILEH), prior to accomplishing the work by submitting a
        copy of DD Form 1391 with full justification for not meeting the 3-year limit. See
        paragraph 2.5.4 for self-help project approval.
  2.5.2. M&R (P-722). There are two statutory limitations (10 USC 2831 and annually
  recurring provisions in the Military Construction Appropriation Acts) that limit the annual
  expenditure of certain types of FH O&M funds on a GOQ. These limits are discussed below:
     - Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Threshold. Military Construction Appropriation Acts
     annually place a ceiling of $35,000 on all maintenance and repair (M&R) expenditures per
     GOQ per fiscal year. GOQ expenditures counted against the M&R annual limit include
     change of occupancy, minor/routine maintenance and repair, major maintenance and repair,
     grounds maintenance and minor alterations. FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act allows for
     after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen environmental remediation.
     - Operations, Maintenance and Repair (OMR) Threshold: 10 USC 2831 placed a ceiling of
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                           15


  $35,000 on all operations, maintenance and repair (OMR) expenditures per GOQ per fiscal
  year. GOQ expenditures counted against the OMR annual limit include management (P-
  721.1), services (P-721.2), furnishings (P-721.4) and maintenance and repair (P-722).
  Maintenance and repair expenditures include change of occupancy, minor/routine
  maintenance and repair, major maintenance and repair, grounds maintenance, and minor
  alterations. 10 USC 2831 allows for after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen
  environmental remediation, or safety and security as defined below. 10 USC 2831 also
  allows the restoration costs for a GOQ’s historical features to be exempted from counting
  against the annual OMR limit. These costs however cannot be waived from counting
  against the annual M&R limit.
     2.5.2.1. The Air Force does not budget for, nor expect each resident to spend $35,000 per
     year. Significant needs in all categories of family housing, including GOQs, must be
     addressed with limited housing O&M budgets. Funding is based on the validated
     requirements contained in the installation FHMP and GOQ IFPs.
     2.5.2.2. Do not exceed the M&R or OMR thresholds without prior notification to
     Congress or approval to notify Congress after-the fact. An after-the-fact notification can
     only be accomplished in the case where the requirement arose after the President’s
     Budget was submitted. Approval to notify the Congress after-the-fact must be based on
     unforeseen environmental remediation (M&R or OMR threshold) or occupant safety and
     security (OMR threshold only) as defined below.
        2.5.2.2.1. Exception for Environmental Remediation. The Military Construction
        Appropriation Acts and 10 USC 2831 allow after-the-fact notification to Congress if
        the GOQ annual M&R or OMR threshold ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded solely
        due to costs associated with unforeseen environmental remediation costs resulting
        from an on-going maintenance and repair action. Work executed under this
        exemption should be limited to that required to ensure occupant safety and health
        from environmental conditions.
            2.5.2.2.1.1. The MAJCOM/CE is the approval authority to exceed the annual
            M&R or OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified).
            2.5.2.2.1.2. MAJCOMs will notify AF/ILEH within 15 days of approval to
            exceed the annual M&R or OMR limit due to unforeseen environmental hazard
            remediation. The notification package will include a copy of the approval letter
            plus a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost estimates) documenting revised
            project costs including the planned remediation plan, start date of the original
            M&R project (prior to discovery of the remediation work), and a summary of
            current and projected end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved,
            MAJCOM/CE will provide a copy of the approval letter to the installation.
            2.5.2.2.1.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the
            GOQ project folder and the GOQ cost report files.
            2.5.2.2.1.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo to
            AF/ILEH with the annual cost report for the GOQ.
            2.5.2.2.1.5. SAF/IEI notifies Congress after the fact, as required.

     2.5.2.2.2. Exception for Safety and Security. Provided that the GOQ M&R threshold
     is not also exceeded, 10 USC 2831 allows after-the-fact notification to Congress if the
     annual GOQ OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded to protect the safety and
     security of the occupants or because of a combination of environmental remediation
     and safety and security costs. Since the FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act does not
     allow for this exception, this authority cannot be used to notify Congress after-the-
     fact of exceeding the M&R limit ($35,000 or as notified). This exception is provided
     to allow the Services to respond in a timely manner to correct imminent, documented
     threats to GOQ occupant safety or security. Appropriate documentation of the
     requirement and its urgency should include AT/FP or threat assessments, JSIVA
     reports, RAC Codes, and/or safety evaluation reports.
        2.5.2.2.2.1. The MAJCOM/CE is the approval authority to exceed the $35,000
        OMR limit due to occupant safety and security issues. Notice that this authority
        cannot be used to exceed the $35K M&R limit. Approval must be obtained prior
        to starting any work that will cause the GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the
        annual limit. MAJCOMs will provide a copy of the approval memo to the
        installation.
        2.5.2.2.2.2. MAJCOMs will notify AF/ILE within 15 days of MAJCOM/CE’s
        approvals to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit for occupant safety or security. The
        notification package will include a copy of the exception approval memo, detailed
        documentation of the safety or security issue (e.g. safety reports, threat
        evaluations, JSIVA report), a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost
        estimates), and a summary of current and projected end-of-the-year OMR costs
        for the GOQ.
        2.5.2.2.2.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the
        GOQ project folder and the OMR cost files.
        2.5.2.2.2.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo with
        the annual cost report for the GOQ.
     2.5.2.2.3. Historical Restoration Costs. Costs for restoration of a GOQ’s historical
     features must be reported as part of the annual M&R costs but can be exempted from
     counting against the 10 USC 2831 OMR limit. Work on any other system and/or
     component not specifically identified as a historical feature will be charged to the
     annual OMR limit. All M&R costs (for historical features or otherwise) count against
     the Military Construction Appropriation Acts M&R limit. SAF/IEI approves all
     historical restoration exemptions. Work to repair, maintain or replace historical
     features on GOQs eligible for or currently on the historical register can qualify for
     this exclusion. Historical features qualifying for this exemption must be recorded in
     the State Historical Preservation Office description of the property.
        2.5.2.2.3.1. SAF/IEI is the approval authority to exempt work on historical
        features from the annual OMR limit. Approval to exempt work of this type must
        be obtained prior to starting any work that will cause the GOQ annual OMR costs
        to exceed the OMR limit.
        2.5.2.2.3.2. Requests for SAF/IEI approval will be forwarded to AF/ILE for
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                               17


               processing. The request package will include a copy of the SHPO documents
               validating the items being worked upon are historical features, a DD Form 1391
               (with backup detailed cost estimates), and a summary of current and projected
               end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved, AF/ILE will provide a
               copy of the approval letter to the MAJCOM.
               2.5.2.2.3.3. File a copy of the exception approval memo in the GOQ project
               folder and the OMR cost files.
               2.5.2.2.3.4. Submit a copy of the exception approval memo with the annual cost
               report for the GOQ.
   2.5.3. Minor Alterations (P-722). Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new)
   work typically performed in support of an M&R project and funded with MFH M&R funds
   (P-722). However, some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair.
   Minor alteration work installs or constructs systems, or features that do not currently exist or
   changes systems, features, or spaces that already exist. This authority should be used for
   interior and exterior work consistent with the Air Force GOQ IFP and GOQ standards. Do
   not use this authority to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of rooms in any
   unit.
Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system, or component systems prior to the
end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or unserviceable
materials, systems, or components with contemporary standard components or materials,
consistent with local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle
analysis. Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems, or components with an
upgraded material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local GOQ
standards shall always be classified as minor alteration.
Some examples of minor alteration work are provided below:
- Installing new planting areas or borders which are not currently installed
- Replacing carpet with wood flooring or tile (even if the carpet is due for replacement)
- Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface such as Corian or Granite
- Installing new outlets and/or lighting which is not currently installed
- Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system
       2.5.3.1. MAJCOMS may delegate authority for minor alterations costing up to $3,000
       per GOQ unit per year to the BCE. Minor alteration work exceeding $3,000 and up to but
       not exceeding $7,500 annually must be approved by the MAJCOM/CV. Cumulative
       annual costs exceeding $7,500 require approval by SAF/IEI.
       2.5.3.2. Do not use this authority to:
           2.5.3.2.1. Increase the size (living area or net square footage) of the unit.
           2.5.3.2.2. Increase the number of rooms in the unit.
           2.5.3.2.3. Perform improvement or alteration to nonliving (uninhabitable) space in
           attics or basements.

     2.5.3.3. No general officer may approve a waiver to the minor alteration limit for work
     on their GOQ, nor for the GOQ of an officer senior in rank. For DRUs and single-
     installation MAJCOMs, the approval authority is HQ USAF/CVA. For MAJCOM CCs or
     other O-10s, the approval authority is HQ USAF/CV. Requests for approval by HQ
     USAF/CV or CVA must be forwarded to AF/ILEH for processing.
     2.5.3.4. Charge costs for GOQ minor alterations work against the annual GOQ M&R and
     OMR limit.
     2.5.3.5. Installation of AT/FP requirements is excluded from minor alteration limits.
     Requirements subject to this exclusion must be identified through a Joint Service
     Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) or MAJCOM, service, or installation
     vulnerability assessment. The work must be approved by the installation commander
     before beginning installation. Keep documentation of the assessment and approval on file
     with the project approval documentation. Although the AT/FP requirement is not charged
     against the minor alteration limit, it must be charged on the AF Form 3826 cost report as
     minor alteration and as a result, charged against the annual M&R and OMR limit.
  2.5.4. Self-Help Work. The Air Force strongly supports self-help projects that are consistent
  with codes and standards, safety, and functionality. If the BCE approves self-help projects
  with the condition the GOQ be returned to its original configuration, the resident is
  responsible for restoring the GOQ to its original condition before clearing the GOQ.
  Residents must obtain approval through Civil Engineering before beginning self-help
  projects. Charge government-provided self-help work materials against the $35,000 OMR
  and M&R limits.
     2.5.4.1. For self-help projects, HQ USAF/ILEH will consider waivers to the 3-year rule
     explained in paragraph 2.5.1.7.
     2.5.4.2. Waiver is for simple, minor projects (e.g., installing ceiling fans, fences, and
     flower beds).
     2.5.4.3. Waiver is not for large complicated projects (e.g. renovating kitchens or
     bathrooms).
     2.5.4.4. The waiver must not violate approval levels, Air Force size standards,
     improvement cost limits, or GOQ limits.
     2.5.4.5. Project costs may not exceed $2,500.
  2.5.5. Exceeding M&R or OMR Limit. GOQ limits may be exceeded only after appropriate
  approval and if needed, notification to Congress. Typically, notification is accomplished
  through submission of the Air Force budget. MAJCOMs accomplish this in their response to
  HQ USAF/ILEH call letter issued as part of the Budget Estimate Submission (BES)
  preparation.
     2.5.5.1. Submit DD Form 1391 validated by the MAJCOM/CE, as justification for all
     GOQ exceed-threshold projects.
     2.5.5.2. Projects must be consistent with the GOQ IFP.
     2.5.5.3. When submitting an exceed-threshold request, MAJCOMs must make sure the
     total amount requested is equal to the sum of annual projected costs for management,
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                               19


     services, furnishings, and M&R (major and minor M&R, minor alteration, grounds
     maintenance, and change of occupancy maintenance). Once approved by Congress, the
     total becomes the OMR limit for this GOQ for that budget year (BY) and the M&R
     request becomes the M&R limit for that BY.
     2.5.5.4. Every effort must be made to award major M&R projects (P-722) included in the
     exceed threshold request in the BY. MAJCOMs are responsible to work with the base to
     ensure timely awards. Only as a last resort may these projects be executed in the year
     following the BY under the limits reported to Congress. Current year (year of award)
     funds will be used to award the projects.
         2.5.5.4.1. MAJCOM/CEs must notify HQ USAF/ILE prior to 1 September of the BY
         of GOQ exceed-threshold projects not awarded in the BY.
         2.5.5.4.2. If an exceed threshold GOQ project is deferred to the year following the
         budget year (BY+1), the M&R and OMR limit for the BY are reduced to the GOQ
         statutory OMR limit ($35,000). The M&R and OMR limit for the BY+1 is the
         approved exceed threshold amount (includes the cost of the project work and all
         M&R)
         2.5.5.4.3. A memo for record will be placed in the project file that documents the
         carryover of the budget authority. Annotate AF Form 3826, Quarterly Cost Report for
         General Officer Quarters, to reflect carryover of this authority.
  2.5.6. Out-of-Cycle Requests.
     2.5.6.1. Out-of-cycle budget submission will be made only when there is an extremely
     urgent situation, typically relating to risks to health, life or safety. Out-of-cycle requests
     must be for proposed work so urgent and compelling it cannot wait for the next annual
     budget submission; it could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of budget
     submission; cost of the work will cause the GOQ to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit and
     possibly the M&R limit; and work does not constitute an alteration, addition, or
     improvement.
     2.5.6.2. Out-of-cycle requests to exceed the $35,000 limit(s) receive scrutiny by
     numerous Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat officials. After-the-fact notifications are not
     allowed except as described in 2.5.2. SAF/IE must review and approve all out-of-cycle
     notifications. Approved requests are then submitted to Congress for notification.
     Congress has 30 days to act on the notification to exceed the M&R limit. Time periods
     for notification to exceed the OMR limit only may be shorter. Submissions should
     include:
         2.5.6.2.1. Strong justification for why work must be done out of cycle, including
         reasons the requirement was not included in the budget submission, urgency, and
         impact of the delay.
         2.5.6.2.2. Comprehensive narrative for each GOQ project, including validation the
         work is identified in the GOQ IFP. If the work is not included in the GOQ plan,
         provide a detailed explanation for the work.
         2.5.6.2.3. A completed DD Form 1391 to show specific project work to be
         accomplished on the unit and to identify costs additional to the threshold.
 20                                                    AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


          2.5.6.2.4. Detailed cost breakout (including line item details).
          2.5.6.2.5. Photographs depicting repair requirements.
          2.5.6.2.6. A statement signed by the GOQ resident acknowledging the work.
          2.5.6.2.7. A project certification statement signed by the MAJCOM/CE.
          2.5.6.2.8. Detailed breakout of other anticipated costs for the FY, including, but not
          limited to, specific projects approved by SAF/IEI and all OMR costs.
          2.5.6.2.9. Detailed breakout of major M&R or investment work completed in the
          previous 5 years or planned for the next 5 years in accordance with the GOQ IFP.
2.6. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM). COM is maintenance and repair work on
housing units when occupancy changes, including interior painting; repairing floors, walls, and
ceiling finishes; repairing electrical and plumbing fixtures; and cleaning over and above
occupant responsibilities. Air Force policy is to make sure necessary COM tasks are
accomplished, depending on the local conditions and installation requirements.
   2.6.1. COM may include, but is not limited to, the following tasks and should be performed
   as required:
       2.6.1.1. Restore interior walls. Depending on condition, patch and repaint walls and
       ceilings as required, typically every 3 years. Paint walls and ceilings, using a neutral
       color. Paint must meet Air Force and base GOQ standards. Neutral color is defined in
       Attachment 1.
       2.6.1.2. Clean carpets, window coverings, light fixtures, and chimney.
       2.6.1.3. Service heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; inspect and clean air
       ducts.
       2.6.1.4. Perform minor M&R work throughout, including electrical and plumbing
       fixtures.
       2.6.1.5. Restore and paint exterior surfaces.
       2.6.1.6. Inspect and repair structure and infrastructure (roof, attic, crawlspace, and
       pavements).
       2.6.1.7. Service and repair doors and windows.
       2.6.1.8. Apply/renew barrier pesticide treatments.
       2.6.1.9. Grounds maintenance (mow, edge, trim trees and bushes).
       2.6.1.10. Repair or replace caulking and weather seals (interior and exterior).
   2.6.2. Charge all minor M&R and cleaning done during the COM to 722.62 on AF Form
   3826, section II, line 1 (paragraph A3.2.1). Minor M&R includes, but is not limited to,
   minor repairs to floor, wall, and ceiling finishes, and electrical and plumbing fixtures with a
   cost of less than $2,500 per task. Charge interior painting and floor repair or replacement to
   major repairs when the cost per task (single item of work) exceeds $2,500. Do not split M&R
   requirements to keep costs under $2,500.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                                 21


   2.6.3. If time permits and conditions warrant, other M&R work may be performed during the
   COM which must be consistent with requirements identified in the GOQ IFP and in
   accordance with Air Force and local GOQ standards. NOTE: For new units and those within
   3 years of reoccupancy after a MILCON project, some work may not be authorized if
   determined to be major M&R, minor alteration, or improvement type work (paragraph
   2.5.1.7).
2.7. Maintaining Grounds. GOQ residents are responsible for maintenance of the grounds
within the exclusive use area for their quarters. The exclusive use area includes the grounds
around the facility that are considered to be reserved for the use of the occupants of the GOQ (or
authorized guests) only. Normally, this includes an area 50 feet from the quarters (calculated
from the further most elevation on all four sides of the quarters); however, it may be larger as a
result of natural or man-made barriers which limit free access to the area by members of the
installation’s housing community or as designated by the wing commander. Grounds
maintenance includes routine lawn/landscaping maintenance actions such as mowing, edging,
raking, planting annuals, tree trimming, maintaining shrubbery, herbicide treatments, fertilizing,
pruning, mulching, and related materials from self-help store.
   2.7.1. SCP GOQ residents are entitled to government-provided grounds maintenance for the
   quarter’s entire exclusive use area. All costs for the government-provided grounds
   maintenance must be charged against the quarter’s OMR and M&R limits and reported on
   the AF Form 3826.
   2.7.2. Non-SCP GOQ residents are personally responsible for grounds maintenance of the
   entire exclusive use area; however, in certain situations, government-provided grounds
   maintenance may be allowed only after a MAJCOM/CC waiver approval is received. The
   waiver approval authority may not be further delegated. In no case will the individual
   exercising this authority make a decision about their own GOQ or the GOQ of a person
   senior in rank. When Government-provided grounds maintenance has been approved, all
   associated costs are charged against that GOQ’s annual OMR and M&R limits. When
   enlisted aides perform grounds maintenance, their work is not charged to the OMR limit.
   MAJCOM/CC’s may approve waivers to:
       2.7.2.1. Allow government-provided grounds maintenance of the entire exclusive use
       area if the GOQ is prominently located and makes a unique contribution to the
       appearance of the installation. All costs for the government-provided grounds
       maintenance must be charged against the quarter’s OMR/M&R threshold and reported on
       the AF Form 3826.
       2.7.2.2. Allow government-provided grounds maintenance on the portion of the
       exclusive use area beyond 50 feet if exclusive use area is extremely large (one-half acre
       or more). All costs for the government-provided grounds maintenance must be charged
       against the quarter’s OMR and M&R limits and reported on the AF Form 3826.
       2.7.2.3. HQ USAF/A4/7 may authorize government-provided grounds maintenance for
       the entire exclusive use area of a GOQ occupied by a senior civilian as a condition of his
       employment and assignment to a position which, if occupied by a military officer, could
       be maintained by enlisted aides to that military officer. In this situation, the costs must be
       charged to the annual $35,000 limit.
 22                                                 AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


   2.7.3. When the government provides grounds maintenance to areas shared by more than
   one GOQ, costs are prorated and charged to each benefiting GOQ; OMR and M&R limits
   apply.
2.8. Miscellaneous Facility Work. Facility work accomplished in GOQs must be charged to
the applicable GOQ limit in accordance with the following:
   2.8.1. Base Infrastructure Work.
      2.8.1.1. M&R (P-722) costs to serviced GOQs for utility systems such as water,
      electricity, gas, wastewater, communications and alarm systems, and associated M&R
      will extend only to the 5-foot line of the GOQ footprint. This charge does not apply to the
      alarm system itself, but only to the communications connections going to the central
      system.
   2.8.2. Communications, Security and AT/FP Requirements. M&R costs for security, AT/FP
   and communications (excluding removable communication equipment) required by the GOQ
   occupant to perform his or her mission, are charged to the annual $35,000 limit, except when
   funded by a minor improvement or MILCON project (P-713 funds). Communications
   requirements include permanently installed communications, such as fiber optic cables,
   funded from the MFH O&M account (P-722), or in a MILCON project (P-711, P-713).
   Communications equipment that is readily removable and mission-required is funded with
   non-MFH funds. See Attachment 1 for the definition of readily removable communications
   equipment.
   2.8.3. Carpet. Installed carpet, including pad, is considered an alternative floor finish and
   therefore an integral part of the GOQ. Carpet should be professionally cleaned as needed in
   accordance with the AFCEE carpet guide, the most current engineering technical letter
   (ETL), and manufacturers instructions to preserve the quality and life of the carpet.
      2.8.3.1. Charge installation and cleaning of installed carpet against the annual limits.
      2.8.3.2. Carpet may be installed in all living areas except the kitchen, bathroom, powder
      room, patio, porch, and areas exposed to weather. When possible, do not install carpet at
      entrances and heavy-traffic areas of the GOQ. To minimize damage to flooring and sub
      flooring, no glue-down installation is allowed.
      2.8.3.3. The BCE must keep the following historical information for each carpet
      installation:
          2.8.3.3.1. Location (address, building number, and room).
          2.8.3.3.2. Name of carpet manufacturer, pattern, and color.
          2.8.3.3.3. Manufacturer certification the carpet conforms to ETL 02-20 (or
          superseding ETL) Air Force Carpet Standard (available from the Air Force Civil
          Engineer         Support          Agency        [HQ       AFCESA]           at
          Https://www/afcesa.af.mil/library/index.asp>
          2.8.3.3.4. Date of installation.
          2.8.3.3.5. Method of installation and type of pad used.
          2.8.3.3.6. Disposal certification.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                           23


     2.8.3.4. For all carpet replacement, the installation commander must certify the carpet is
     no longer serviceable and requires replacement.
     2.8.3.5. Purchase quality carpet with a minimum 7-year life expectancy that meets Air
     Force standards in the AFCEE Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning,
     Programming, Design, and Construction (paragraph 2.3.2.1) and ETL 02-20
     (paragraph 2.8.3.3.3). Prior to purchase, the BCE must certify the carpet meets Air
     Force carpet standards.
     2.8.3.6. Carpet must be a neutral color, such as beige, taupe, or off-white in a light to
     medium value that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of
     successive occupants. Do not use pure whites or dark shades. Use solid colors or very
     muted tone-on-tone tweeds.
     2.8.3.7. Do not replace carpet in less than 7 years. Only MAJCOM/CCs may approve
     exceptions to the 7-year minimum life carpet replacement policy. This authority may not
     be further delegated. In no case will the individual exercising this authority make a
     decision about carpet in his or her own unit or the unit of a person senior in rank.
     2.8.3.8. Waiver requests must include:
         2.8.3.8.1. A statement signed by the installation commander validating the

                   FURNISHINGS, TABLEWARE, AND APPLIANCES

3.1. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Furnishings Support. General officers (and civilian
equivalents) living in government-controlled (family housing and unaccompanied personnel
housing) and privatized housing are authorized furnishings support to meet official
representational and entertainment responsibilities. Attachment 5 provides furnishings and
tableware allowances for the quarters of incumbents of SCPs and supplemental furnishings for
quarters of general officers, brigadier general selectees, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
(CMSAF), colonels (O-6) serving as installation commanders, and civilian general officer
equivalents. The CMSAF is authorized the same furnishings and amenities as SCPs. Furnishings
items not included in Attachment 5 may not be purchased, maintained, repaired, or replaced at
government expense.
   3.1.1. SCP Furnishings and Tableware. SCPs have significantly more responsibilities than
   non-SCPs for official and social entertainment activities in representing the interest of the
   United States. Also, incumbents of SCPs are often housed in larger GOQs, which may
   require more than the usual amount of furniture. Therefore, incumbents of SCPs are
   authorized whole-house furnishings and window treatments in all rooms throughout the
   GOQ, including bedrooms. Tableware support includes Air Force crystal, china, flatware,
   hollowware and table linens. See Attachment 5 for a detailed listing of authorized items.
   3.1.2. Supplemental Furnishings. Supplemental furnishings are intended to support the
   official entertainment needs of non-SCP general officers, brigadier general selectees,
   colonels serving as the installation commander, and civilian general officer equivalents living
   in government-controlled and privatized housing. Supplemental furnishings should be used
   to complement, not replace, personally owned furnishings typically expected of an individual
   of this grade and position based on his or her grade and family size. Installation commanders
   approve the purchase of supplemental furnishings. Entertainment areas include the entrance
   foyer, living room, dining room, den, library, family room, kitchen area, porches, patios, and
   stairway and hallways connecting these areas. See Attachment 5 for a detailed listing of
   authorized items.
   3.1.3. Furnishings for Unaccompanied Members Residing in Government-Controlled Family
   Housing. Unaccompanied members and voluntarily unaccompanied members residing in
   family housing receive the same entitlement to furnishings as accompanied members of equal
   grade. Unaccompanied members who reside in housing permanently designated as
   unaccompanied housing on real property records receive appropriate furnishings support
   provided in accordance with AFI 32-6004.
3.2. Authorized Furnishings. The Air Force standardizes SCP furnishings, tableware and
supplemental furnishings to ensure these items are prudent, reasonable, and consistent with OSD
directives. Authorized furnishings are identified in Attachment 5. MAJCOMs may request
authorization for additional furnishings items if required (paragraph 3.2.3).
   3.2.1. Window Treatments. See Attachment 1 for the definition of window treatments.
   Window treatments (not to be confused with window coverings) are considered furnishings
   and include draperies, curtains sheers, rods, valances, cornices, fabric blinds and associated
26                                                 AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


  hardware. Window treatments must be neutral in color (may include white) and constructed
  of quality materials with at least a 7-year life expectancy. See paragraph 2.8.4 to note the
  difference between window treatments and window coverings.
     3.2.1.1. For SCP quarters, window treatments are authorized throughout the unit. For
     other GOQs, window treatments are authorized only in entertainment areas (Attachment
     1).
     3.2.1.2. For SCP quarters, charge the cost of initial-issue and replacement window
     treatments against the annual furnishings limit of $10,000 and 5-year limit of $40,000
     (exclude initial-issue window treatments required due to new construction or
     redesignation of a unit for GOQ/SCP use). For all other GOQs, charge the replacement
     cost against the annual furnishings limit of $6,000 and 5-year limit of $20,000.
     3.2.1.3. Cleaning costs for window treatments are reported on AF Form 3826 under
     Section I, Line 3B, Furnishings Not charged against the limit (AC 721.41-.42; these costs
     are not subject to the one year or five year furnishings limits but are charged against the
     annual OMR/M&R limit.
     3.2.1.4. Exceptions.
         3.2.1.4.1. MAJCOM/CC may approve exceptions to the 7-year minimum life for
         window treatments. This authority may not be further delegated. In no case will the
         individual exercising this authority make a decision about his or her own dwelling or
         the dwelling of a person senior in rank.
         3.2.1.4.2. The installation commander will forward requests to replace window
         treatments before the 7-year period has expired to MAJCOM/CE. MAJCOM/CC is
         final approval authority for waivers. Waiver requests must be justified and include:
             3.2.1.4.2.1. A statement the BCE has validated the requirement for replacement.
             3.2.1.4.2.2. Total cost of the replacement items.

             installed or placed in the housing. State whether the items are still under
             manufacturer warranty and include available warranty information.
             3.2.1.4.2.5. An explanation of why early replacement is necessary. Include a
             description of all furnishings actions and costs completed and proposed for the
             FY; and the annual and long-range plans, including furnishings and how the
             furnishings will be maintained with future expenditure limits.
  3.2.2. Appliances. The BCE provides freestanding or permanently installed appliances for
  GOQs in accordance with Attachment 5, part C. To determine the proper cost category, use
  the principle that installed is an M&R cost (P-722), and freestanding is an operations cost
  (P-721). Charge subsequent costs incurred for the item (maintenance, repair or replacement)
  to the same cost category initially assigned to the appliance.
     3.2.2.1. Authorized appliances and equipment for GOQs include stove or cook top with
     wall oven, two refrigerators or a refrigerator and freezer, installed or portable dishwasher,
     microwave oven, trash compactor, and icemaker. Washers and dryers are provided in
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                             27

      and overseas.
      3.2.2.2. Costs to buy, install, maintain and repair built-in appliances, such as a
      dishwasher or built-in oven or cook top, are charged to the appropriate M&R category in
      Section III of the AF Form 3826.
      3.2.2.3. Cost to buy, install, maintain, and repair freestanding appliances (not installed)
      such as a portable dishwasher on wheels, refrigerator, stove, microwave, and washer and
      dryer are charged as furnishings - not against the limit (AF Form 3826, Section I, line
      3B).
   3.2.3. Requesting New Items. If new furnishings, appliance, or equipment items not included
   in this instruction are needed, the MAJCOM will submit a request with supporting
   documentation to HQ USAF/ILE. To assist HQ USAF/ILE to evaluate the request, state the
   cost, describe the proposed location in the designated entertainment area of the quarters, and
   provide other available information (brochures, sketches, and photographs). HQ USAF/ILE
   will determine whether the item is appropriate for Air Force-wide application; if so, the item
   will be added to this instruction and MAJCOM/CEs will be notified of the new SCP or
   supplemental furnishings item.
3.3. Furnishings Cost Limits.
   3.3.1. 1-year and 5-year Furnishings Limitations. Limit expenditures for furnishings -
   charged against the limit (Attachment 5, part A) to $10,000 per SCP per fiscal year and
   $40,000 per SCP over a 5-year consecutive period. For other GOQs, limit these expenditures
   to $6,000 per GOQ per fiscal year and $20,000 over a 5-year period. All furnishings costs
   (AF Form 3826, Section I, Line 3A-D) count against the OMR annual limit. NOTE: The
   one- and five-year limits apply to new items taken from existing base stocks that have never
   been charged to a GOQ. Exclude items from existing base FMO stock when the item has
   been used and previously charged to other quarters. Exclude costs associated with
   government-provided shipping, transportation, pickup, delivery, installation, repair and
   cleaning furnishings, as well as commercial shipping costs for items delivered to base FMO
   stocks at OCONUS locations. Apply the furnishing limit to the:

   the $35K OMR limit. The MAJCOM/CC may approve waivers to the 1-year and 5-year
   limits. In no case will the individual exercising this authority make a decision about his or
   her own dwelling or the dwelling of a person senior in rank. All furnishings costs (AF Form
   3826, Section I, Line 3A-D) count against the OMR annual limit. If waiving the 1-year
   and/or 5-year limit also causes the project OMR costs to exceed $35,000 for that FY,
 28                                                  AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014

                                            Chapter 4

                         COST ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

4.1. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Expenditures. GOQ expenditures are reported to OSD
and Congress annually per their direction. This requirement applies to all government
expenditures in all GOQs (government-owned, lease or privatized). All O&M costs for family
housing GOQs temporarily diverted as unaccompanied GOQs are paid exclusively from family
housing funds and all limits apply. It is important to track and accurately account for GOQ
operation, maintenance, and repair costs to ensure limits (law or policy) are not exceeded and to
accomplish reporting requirements.
   4.1.1. The BCE will appoint a single POC whose responsibility will be to ensure proper
   collection, recording, and certification of GOQ costs. This POC should monitor and validate
   costs frequently to make sure sufficient authorizations exist before approving additional work
   in the GOQ. The POC initiates quarterly and annual GOQ cost reports.
   4.1.2. GOQ residents should be made aware of all work required and performed in their
   quarters, including cost estimates prior to work, if desired. Residents should review
   expenditures included on their cost reports. Residents should sign quarterly cost reports (if
   available at the duty station), acknowledging expenditures, and return the original signed
   copy to the BCE/housing flight.
4.2. Tracking and Reporting General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Costs. Maintain a separate
cost record (AF Form 3826) for each GOQ, and track and report costs associated with
operations, M&R, and improvement of a GOQ and its associated real property.
   4.2.1. Occupancy Period for Cost Reporting.
       4.2.1.1. Report operations, maintenance, and repair costs (AF Form 3826, Section I, Line
       1-3D and Section III, Line 6) for the entire year if the general officer (including those that
       are "frocked") occupies the GOQ for any part of the year. (Paragraph 4.3.1.1). Do not
       report O&M costs for housing designated for general officer use but not occupied by a
       general officer at any time during the fiscal year. A senior officer quarter (SOQ)
       occupied by a brigadier general select is not a GOQ; however, project approval levels for
       brigadier general selects are the same as for general officers. Additionally, project work
       will not commence until the date of promotion of the occupant to grade O-7.
       4.2.1.2. When a senior officer (O-6; limit of $20,000) and a general officer (O-7 and
       above; limit of $35,000) occupy a GOQ in the same fiscal year, the rules in Table 4.1
       apply. The non-GOQ $20,000 limit places an annual obligation limit on major M&R and
       alteration work on non-GOQs, accomplished by job order, work order, or contract. The
       GOQ $35,000 limit places an annual obligation limit on total costs for maintaining,
       repairing, and making minor alterations on GOQs (AFI32-6002, paragraph 1.12).
           4.2.1.2.1. Table 4.1 gives general guidance for tracking and reporting GOQ M&R
           and non-GOQ major M&R costs. For unusual situations, consult with the MAJCOM
           to avoid exceeding these limits without prior approval authority. In all cases, when a
           general officer occupies a GOQ for any part of a fiscal year costs must be reported on
           AF Form 3826.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                             31

          4.2.1.2.2. To avoid an Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) (Title 31 United States Code
          [U.S.C.] Section 1341) violation, current expenditures and anticipated costs for the
          remainder of the fiscal year must be analyzed (AFI 65-608, Antideficiency Act
          Violations). If it appears statutory and congressional language limits of $35,000 and
          $20,000 may be exceeded for the fiscal year, submit an out-of-cycle budget request to
          exceed the limit through the MAJCOM to SAF/IEI for review, who will forward it to
          SAF/FMB for submittal to Congress (paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4).
   4.2.2. When to Charge and Report Costs. In general, charge and report annual costs on the
   date the funds are obligated. However, for multiunit service contracts where funds are
   obligated when the contract is awarded charge costs to individual GOQs as expenses are
   incurred. Examples of these contracts are housing maintenance, grounds maintenance and
   refuse collection.
      4.2.2.1. Contract Costs. For contract work (P-713 and P-722), charge and report the
      entire cost of the work (labor plus materials) at the time the contract is awarded. Changes
      to costs prior to end-of-year reports (fourth quarter) will be reported when the contract
      change is approved. Once annual reports have been submitted through the MAJCOM to
      HQ USAF/ILEH, updated reports need to be submitted only if a cost change would affect
      statutory or regulatory compliance. However, updated AF Form 3826s, incorporating the
      changes, should be retained at the installation.
32                                                  AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


     4.2.2.2. In-house Costs. For in-house work, charge and report the cost of materials as
     they are received. Charge and report actual labor for in-house work at the time the hours
     are expended. When military or civilian labor (other than enlisted aides) perform housing
     work, the cost for the reported labor hours is based on the total shop rate, less the military
     factor.
  4.2.3. How to Charge Costs. Determine O&M costs for GOQs in one of two ways and
  charge accordingly:
     4.2.3.1. If the costs are solely attributable to a GOQ, such as a maintenance project or
     contract cleaning for an individual unit, charge the entire cost to the GOQ.
     4.2.3.2. If two or more units benefit from services (e.g., refuse collection, maintenance,
     shared garage), prorate the costs among all benefiting units. For utilities, determine a cost
     per square foot and establish the charge based on the unit size (paragraph A3.1.3.6).
     4.2.3.3. Charge costs to maintain and repair irrigation systems within 50 feet of the GOQ
     to that GOQ. If two or more units share an irrigation system, prorate the costs among all
     GOQs sharing the system, but in all cases charge only the cost within 50 feet of each
     GOQ. This policy is specific to irrigation systems, and the "exclusive use" provision in
     paragraph 2.7 does not apply.
  4.2.4. Cost Categories. All costs associated with the operations, M&R, and improvements of
  a GOQ and its associated real property must be tracked and reported. Table A3.1 shows an
  overview of reporting categories and limits. Attachment 3 provides detailed instructions for
  costing and reporting expenditures in all categories. Table A3.2 provides a quick reference
  guide and expanded information on cost categories, cost limits, and approval authorities.
     4.2.4.1. Operations Costs. Report all expenditures associated with management, services,
     furnishings and miscellaneous operations in this category.
         4.2.4.1.1. Initial issue, replacement, reupholstering, refinishing, cleaning, shipping,
         transportation, taxes, moving and handling, repair, and storage of furnishings. Charge
         each piece of furniture to a GOQ only once. Examples:
             4.2.4.1.1.1. For an item purchased for a specific GOQ, charge it to that GOQ
             when the item is ordered. When no longer required by a successive occupant,
             return the item to FMO stock for use by other authorized residents.
             4.2.4.1.1.2. For an item taken new from FMO stock as a first-time issue to a
             GOQ, charge it to that GOQ when it is issued.
             4.2.4.1.1.3. For an item issued from FMO stock but previously issued and used in
             another GOQ, do not charge it at all.
         4.2.4.1.2. Window treatments, including initial issue, replacement, and cleaning.
         (Exclude initial-issue window treatments required due to new construction or
         redesignation of a unit for GOQ use.)
         4.2.4.1.3. Area rugs, including initial issue, replacement, and cleaning. NOTE: Area
         rugs are not authorized when installed carpet is in place.
         4.2.4.1.4. Initial issue, replacement, connection and disconnection, and repair of
         freestanding appliances and equipment.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                            33


      4.2.4.2. M&R Costs. Report all expenditures for M&R work in this category, including
      periodic and recurring maintenance, change of occupancy, contract cleaning, service
      calls, minor and major repair, minor alteration, grounds maintenance, and self-help
      materials.
          4.2.4.2.1. Exterior Utilities. Charge M&R costs for common utility infrastructure
          systems work within the 5-foot line of the quarters’ footprint.
          4.2.4.2.2. Other Real Property. Charge other real property costs associated with the
          dwelling unit, such as garages, driveways, and grounds, directly to the GOQ.
          4.2.4.2.3. Built-in Appliances and Equipment. Charge costs associated with the
          purchase, installation, repair and replacement of built-in appliances and equipment to
          M&R costs. This includes, but is not limited to, cook tops, ovens, dishwashers, and
          trash compactors.
4.3. Reporting Requirements. Report expenditures for each GOQ quarterly on AF Form 3826,
along with a detailed breakout of GOQ expenditures worksheet (Attachment 2).
   4.3.1. See Attachment 2 for a sample AF Form 3826. This documents is used to report
   expenditures for each GOQ and to inform residents of costs charged against their quarters.

amenities (such as lamps, mirrors, and rugs) identified in Attachment 5.
General Officer Quarters (GOQ)—A family-housing unit assigned to a general officer
(including those frocked to O-7) or a civilian equivalent, including grounds, walks, driveways,
other paved areas, and structures on the grounds for the exclusive use of the residents.
General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Limit (Annual Military
Construction Appropriations Act)—The annual $35,000 or as notified cost limit for all
maintenance and repair (P-722) expenses (Includes change of occupancy, minor/routine
maintenance and repair, major maintenance and repair, grounds maintenance, and minor
alterations).
General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Operations, Maintenance, and Repair (OMR) Limit (10
USC 2831)—the annual $35,000 or as notified cost limit for all management (P-721.1), services
(P-721.2), furnishings (P-721.4), and maintenance and repair (P-722) costs. Maintenance and
repair includes change of occupancy, minor/routine maintenance and repair, major maintenance
and repair, grounds maintenance, and minor alterations.
GOQ Master Plan—An Air Force plan that captures GOQ facility data, identifies
improvements, major and minor M&R requirements, and provides recommendations and cost
estimates for each GOQ based on a whole-house perspective. This plan defines GOQ
requirements, which are integrated into the Housing Community Profile (HCP), to prioritize
funding allocations through the Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP).
Grounds Maintenance—includes routine lawn/landscaping maintenance actions such as
mowing, edging, raking, planting annuals, tree trimming, maintaining shrubbery, herbicide
treatments, fertilizing, pruning, mulching, and related materials from self-help store.
Individual Facility Profile (IFP)—A profile of each GOQ that includes facility data such as the
age and condition of quarters, improvement and major M&R requirements, and estimates for
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                                 39


work accomplished via the O&M program or as a whole-house improvement project. This
profile is updated every 3 years in conjunction with the updates of the Housing Community
Profile (HCP). The IFP is the approved corporate view used to support GOQ M&R, minor
alterations, and improvement projects.
Improvements—MILCON-funded (P-713) work that changes the physical layout or adds to the
overall area of the dwelling unit
Major Maintenance & Repair (M&R)—Maintenance and repair work where the cost of
materials and labor exceeds $2,500. Generally, this is work necessary to fix or replace existing
systems and their components nearing the end of their useful lives. M&R requirements must not
be split for the purpose of remaining under the $2,500 defined cost.
Minor Alteration—Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work typically
performed in support of an M&R project and funded with MFH M&R funds (P-722). However,
some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor alteration work
installs or constructs systems, or features that do not currently exist or changes systems, features,
or spaces that already exist. This authority should be used for interior and exterior work
consistent with the Air Force GOQ IFP and GOQ standards. Do not use this authority to increase
the size of any unit or increase the number of rooms in any unit.
Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system, or component systems prior to the
end of the end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or
unserviceable materials, systems, or components with contemporary standard components or
materials, consistent with local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-
cycle analysis. Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems, or components with
an upgraded material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local
GOQ standards shall always be classified as minor alteration.

Minor Maintenance and Repair (M&R)—M&R-funded (P-722) day-to-day M&R work with a
total cost of less than $2,500, performed in response to service calls or job orders and
accomplished by contract or in-house personnel.
Net Floor Area—Generally, the living area within the exterior walls, excluding unfinished
basements or attics, utility service space or bulk storage (in place of a basement), attic, laundry
rooms, garage, carport, open or screened porches, decks, and stairwells. In multifamily
dwellings, common stairwells, halls, entries, and other common areas are excluded. See AFI 32-
6002, attachment 1 for an expanded definition.
Neutral Color—Neutral colors such as beige, taupe, or off-white in a light to medium range that
provide a flexible background that can integrate with the dcor of successive occupants.
Readily Removable Communications Equipment—Includes mission-essential equipment that
can be unplugged and removed and is dependent on, but not a part of, the installed infrastructure,
such as fiber optics cable.
Special Command Position (SCP)—A position designated by OSD (DA&M) according to
DODD1100.12. A general officer or civilian equivalent occupies the position and carries public
entertainment responsibilities that require the incumbent to represent the interests of the United
States in official and social activities involving foreign or domestic dignitaries. Typically these
 40                                                   AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


positions are limited to general officers in the grade of 0-10; however, generals in a lower grade
may be designated as SCP if the incumbent is:
       -        Responsible directly to the Secretary of Defense or the secretary of a military
                department.
       -        The top US representative in an international, political, or military group.
       -        The commandant, director, president, or superintendent of a DOD or service
                college or academy.
Special Command Position (SCP) Supplemental Allowance—For SCPs, an additional annual
$1,000 allowance for items required for official entertainment purposes, such as small cookware,
serving pieces or tableware items not listed in Attachment 5. These items are not charged
against any other allowance.
Tableware—For SCPs, special allowance items including Air Force china, crystal, flatware, and
hollowware issued by 11WG/SUPS. Also includes table linen selected by the occupant
(purchased by the housing flight chief or purchased by the resident and reimbursed by the
government). These items are also called SCP amenities.
Window Coverings—M&R-funded (P-722) items integral to the dwelling that cover windows
to provide privacy and control lighting. Provided on all windows per US Air Force Family
Housing Guide. Window coverings include shades, shutters, blinds (vertical and horizontal
wood, aluminum, and vinyl), and associated hardware.
Window Treatments—Furnishings-funded (P721.4) items used to decorate windows. SCP
units are authorized window treatments throughout homes; non-SCP units are only authorized
window treatments in entertainment areas. Window treatments include draperies, curtains,
sheers, fabric blinds, rods, valances, cornices, and associated hardware. Window treatments
must be neutral in color and constructed of quality materials with at least a 7-year life
expectancy.

NOTES:
1. MAJCOM/CC may increase or limit quantities as deemed necessary. Next higher authority (HQ USAF/CVA or
HQ USAF/CV) must approve requests for DRUs or MAJCOM/CC quarters. Requests for items not on the list must
be approved by HQ USAF/ILEH. Submit fully justified requests as described in paragraph 3.2.3.
2. SCPs and the CMSAF have significantly more responsibilities than non-SCPs for official and social entertainment
activities in representing the interest of the United States. Also, incumbents of SCPs are often housed in larger
GOQs, which may require more than the usual amount of furniture. Therefore, incumbents of SCPs and the CMSAF
are authorized more furnishings and window treatments in all rooms throughout the GOQ.

3. Items for joint service positions filled on a rotational basis or by another service and for which the Air Force has
administrative responsibility will not contain an identification (crest) with an individual DOD component; they will
be suitable and appropriate for use by members of all DOD components. Only one set of china and glassware will be
issued to any SCP quarters.
4. Table linen is not procured by 11WG/SUPS. The housing flight chief will purchase the replacement linen or the
housing resident will purchase it with personal funds and will then be reimbursed by the government. Residents
must contact the installation housing flight chief when a requirement exists to determine the remaining limit for this
allowance. If the resident elects to purchase it with personal funds, process the reimbursement with SF 1164. FMO
will annotate changes to AF Form 228 as appropriate. Additional table linen is authorized for base specific or unique
requirements.
5. A second refrigerator may be substituted for the food freezer.
6. Small kitchen appliances, kitchen utensils, and cookware are authorized for SCP quarters for the purpose of food
 preparation for official functions. This list is not all-inclusive and other items may be purchased by the supporting
          FMO, as needed; the annual $1,000 supplemental furnishings SCP is the only limit that applies.

             IC 2006-1 TO AFI 32-6003, GENERAL OFFICER QUARTERS

19 JANUARY 2006


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates Interim Change 2006-1 and Incorporates $35,000 Operations,
Maintenance and Repair annual limit established by the FY05 National Defense Authorization
Act. Clarifies GOQ occupant’s grounds maintenance responsibilities. Clarifies classification of
minor alteration work. Explains use of revised AF Form 3826 for annual GOQ cost reporting.
The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the
previous edition.
1.3.2. Approves and forwards to Congress out-of-cycle budget requests exceeding the $35,000
annual GOQ limits (Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and Operations, Maintenance, and Repair
(OMR)).
1.3.3. Approves and forwards after-the-fact notification to Congress when the $35,000 M&R
threshold (or higher Congressionally approved limit) is exceeded solely due to costs associated
with environmental remediation. Annual Military Construction Appropriation Acts prohibit
exceeding $35,000 per unit for maintenance and repair unless the committees are first notified
and 30 days pass, except in the case of unforeseen necessary environmental remediation.
1.3.4. Approves and forwards after-the-fact notification to Congress when the $35,000 M&R
threshold is not exceeded but the $35,000 OMR threshold (or higher Congressionally approved
limit) is exceeded solely due to costs associated with environmental remediation, occupant
safety, and/or security.
1.3.6. Approves MAJCOM requests to exempt M&R expenditures on historical features from
the $35K OMR limit.
1.4.6. Approves waivers to the 3-year rule for new or recently improved units (delegated to HQ
USAF/ ILEH).
1.4.7. Prepares budget exhibits and notification packages for approved requests to exceed the
$35,000 annual limits (M&R and OMR).
1.4.8. Forwards MAJCOM-approved requests for after-the-fact notification to Congress when
the $35,000 annual limits (OMR or M&R as appropriate) are exceeded for reasons authorized
by law.
1.5.4. Forwards MAJCOM approvals to AF/ILEH to notify Congress after-the-fact when the
$35,000 annual limits (OMR or M&R as appropriate) are exceeded for reasons authorized by
law.
1.8.2. Provide each GOQ a GOQ Guide boxed set consisting of the GOQ Resident’s Handbook,
Volume I; GOQ Standards for Programming, Design, and Construction, Volume II; and the
GOQ Individual Facility Profile (IFP), Volume III; and provide extra copies of the GOQ Guide
to inbound general officers, as requested.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                              65


2.1.3. By Congressional direction, military family housing funds are the exclusive source of
funds for all operations and maintenance of family housing units, including those temporarily
diverted as unaccompanied housing.
2.4.2.1. Bases prepare an annual long-range plan to budget GOQ costs, including operations;
maintenance and repair; and improvement work requirements. Maintenance and repair and
improvement requirements are identified in the IFP. The plan must cover a 5-year period (the
current year plus the following 4 years). The plan should provide detailed costs of management,
services, furnishings, change of occupancy, minor/routine M&R, major M&R, grounds
maintenance, minor alteration, and improvement costs for each year. The plan should identify
the need to seek additional authority in the case where the total OMR/ M&R costs for the year
will exceed $35,000.

2.5.1.6. DD Forms 1391 for GOQ improvement projects (P-713) must also include projected
major M&R. In the FY the improvement project is awarded (when funds are obligated), the new
congressional limit for the GOQ is the only limit that applies. Since major M&R is included in
the improvement project, the only type work authorized in the year of award is minor
maintenance and COM (Attachment 1). In the FY improvement project funds are obligated,
the P-713 congressionally approved limit applies. In following years, the $35,000 limits apply.
Make sure only minor maintenance and COM work is allowed for 3 years following occupancy
except for extremely urgent and compelling repairs, typically relating to health or life-safety.
2.5.2. M&R (P-722). There are two statutory limitations (10 USC 2831 and annually recurring
provisions in the Military Construction Appropriation Acts) that limit the annual expenditure of
certain types of FH O&M funds on a GOQ. These limits are discussed below:
 - Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Threshold. Military Construction Appropriation Acts
annually place a ceiling of $35,000 on all maintenance and repair (M&R) expenditures per
GOQ per fiscal year. GOQ expenditures counted against the M&R annual limit include change
of occupancy, minor/routine maintenance and repair, major maintenance and repair, grounds
maintenance and minor alterations. FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act allows for after-the-fact
notification based on unforeseen environmental remediation.
- Operations, Maintenance and Repair (OMR) Threshold: 10 USC 2831 placed a ceiling of
$35,000 on all operations, maintenance and repair (OMR) expenditures per GOQ per fiscal
year. GOQ expenditures counted against the OMR annual limit include management (P-721.1),
services (P-721.2), furnishings (P-721.4) and maintenance and repair (P-722). Maintenance and
repair expenditures include change of occupancy, minor/routine maintenance and repair, major
maintenance and repair, grounds maintenance, and minor alterations. 10 USC 2831 allows for
after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen environmental remediation, or safety and
security as defined below. 10 USC 2831 also allows the restoration costs for a GOQ’s historical
features to be exempted from counting against the annual OMR limit. These costs however
cannot be waived from counting against the annual M&R limit.
2.5.2.2. Do not exceed the M&R or OMR thresholds without prior notification to Congress or
approval to notify Congress after-the fact. An after-the-fact notification can only be
accomplished in the case where the requirement arose after the President’s Budget was
submitted. Approval to notify the Congress after-the-fact must be based on unforeseen

environmental remediation (M&R or OMR threshold) or occupant safety and security (OMR
threshold only) as defined below.
2.5.2.2.1. Exception for Environmental Remediation. The Military Construction Appropriation
Acts and 10 USC 2831 allow after-the-fact notification to Congress if the GOQ annual M&R or
OMR threshold ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded solely due to costs associated with
unforeseen environmental remediation costs resulting from an on-going maintenance and repair
action. Work executed under this exemption should be limited to that required to ensure
occupant safety and health from environmental conditions.

2.5.2.2.1.1. The MAJCOM/CE is the approval authority to exceed the annual M&R or OMR
limit ($35,000 or as notified).

2.5.2.2.1.2. MAJCOMs will notify AF/ILEH within 15 days of approval to exceed the annual
M&R or OMR limit due to unforeseen environmental hazard remediation. The notification
package will include a copy of the approval letter plus a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed
cost estimates) documenting revised project costs including the planned remediation plan, start
date of the original M&R project (prior to discovery of the remediation work), and a summary
of current and projected end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved, MAJCOM/CE
will provide a copy of the approval letter to the installation.
2.5.2.2.1.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the GOQ project
folder and the GOQ cost report files.
2.5.2.2.1.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo to AF/ILEH with the
annual cost report for the GOQ.
2.5.2.2.2. Exception for Safety and Security. Provided that the GOQ M&R threshold is not also
exceeded, 10 USC 2831 allows after-the-fact notification to Congress if the annual GOQ OMR
limit ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded to protect the safety and security of the occupants or
because of a combination of environmental remediation and safety and security costs. Since the
FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act does not allow for this exception, this authority cannot be
used to notify Congress after-the-fact of exceeding the M&R limit ($35,000 or as notified). This
exception is provided to allow the Services to respond in a timely manner to correct imminent,
documented threats to GOQ occupant safety or security. Appropriate documentation of the
requirement and its urgency should include AT/FP or threat assessments, JSIVA reports, RAC
Codes, and/or safety evaluation reports.
2.5.2.2.2.1. The MAJCOM/CE is the approval authority to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit due
to occupant safety and security issues. Notice that this authority cannot be used to exceed the
$35K M&R limit. Approval must be obtained prior to starting any work that will cause the
GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the annual limit. MAJCOMs will provide a copy of the
approval memo to the installation.
2.5.2.2.2.2. MAJCOMs will notify AF/ILE within 15 days of MAJCOM/CE’s approvals to
exceed the $35,000 OMR limit for occupant safety or security. The notification package will
include a copy of the exception approval memo, detailed documentation of the safety or
security issue (e.g. safety reports, threat evaluations, JSIVA report), a DD Form 1391 (with
backup detailed cost estimates), and a summary of current and projected end-of-the-year OMR
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                                 67


costs for the GOQ.
2.5.2.2.2.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the GOQ project
folder and the OMR cost files.
2.5.2.2.2.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo with the annual cost
report for the GOQ.
2.5.2.2.3. Historical Restoration Costs. Costs for restoration of a GOQ’s historical features must
be reported as part of the annual M&R costs but can be exempted from counting against the 10
USC 2831 OMR limit. Work on any other system and/or component not specifically identified
as a historical feature will be charged to the annual OMR limit. All M&R costs (for historical
features or otherwise) count against the Military Construction Appropriation Acts M&R limit.
SAF/IEI approves all historical restoration exemptions. Work to repair, maintain or replace
historical features on GOQs eligible for or currently on the historical register can qualify for this
exclusion. Historical features qualifying for this exemption must be recorded in the State
Historical Preservation Office description of the property.
2.5.2.2.3.1. SAF/IEI is the approval authority to exempt work on historical features from the
annual OMR limit. Approval to exempt work of this type must be obtained prior to starting any
work that will cause the GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the OMR limit.
2.5.2.2.3.2. Requests for SAF/IEI approval will be forwarded to AF/ILE for processing. The
request package will include a copy of the SHPO documents validating the items being worked
upon are historical features, a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost estimates), and a
summary of current and projected end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved,
AF/ILE will provide a copy of the approval letter to the MAJCOM.
2.5.2.2.3.3. File a copy of the exception approval memo in the GOQ project folder and the
OMR cost files.
2.5.2.2.3.4. Submit a copy of the exception approval memo with the annual cost report for the
GOQ.
2.5.3. Minor Alterations (P-722). Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work
typically performed in support of an M&R project and funded with MFH M&R funds (P-722).
However, some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor
alteration work installs or constructs systems, or features that do not currently exist or changes
systems, features, or spaces that already exist. This authority should be used for interior and
exterior work consistent with the Air Force GOQ IFP and GOQ standards. Do not use this
authority to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of rooms in any unit.
Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system, or component systems prior to the
end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or unserviceable
materials, systems, or components with contemporary standard components or materials,
consistent with local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle analysis.
Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems, or components with an upgraded
material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local GOQ standards
shall always be classified as minor alteration.
Some examples of minor alteration work are provided below:
68                                                   AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


- Installing new planting areas or borders which are not currently installed
- Replacing carpet with wood flooring or tile (even if the carpet is due for replacement)
- Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface such as Corian or Granite
- Installing new outlets and/or lighting which is not currently installed
- Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system
2.5.3.3. No general officer may approve a waiver to the minor alteration limit for work on their
GOQ, nor for the GOQ of an officer senior in rank. For DRUs and single-installation
MAJCOMs, the approval authority is HQ USAF/CVA. For MAJCOM CCs or other O-10s, the
approval authority is HQ USAF/CV. Requests for approval by HQ USAF/CV or CVA must be
forwarded to AF/ILEH for processing.
2.5.3.4. Charge costs for GOQ minor alterations work against the annual GOQ M&R and OMR
limit.
2.5.3.5. Installation of AT/FP requirements is excluded from minor alteration limits.
Requirements subject to this exclusion must be identified through a Joint Service Integrated
Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) or MAJCOM, service, or installation vulnerability
assessment. The work must be approved by the instal-lation commander before beginning
installation. Keep documentation of the assessment and approval on file with the project
approval documentation. Although the AT/FP requirement is not charged against the minor
alteration limit, it must be charged on the AF Form 3826 cost report as minor alteration and as a
result, charged against the annual M&R and OMR limit.
2.5.4. Self-Help Work. The Air Force strongly supports self-help projects that are consistent
with codes and standards, safety, and functionality. If the BCE approves self-help projects with
the condition the GOQ be returned to its original configuration, the resident is responsible for
restoring the GOQ to its original condition before clearing the GOQ. Residents must obtain
approval through Civil Engineering before beginning self-help projects. Charge government-
provided self-help work materials against the $35,000 OMR and M&R limits.
2.5.4.1. For self-help projects, HQ USAF/ILEH will consider waivers to the 3-year rule
explained in paragraph 2.5.1.7.
2.5.4.4. The waiver must not violate approval levels, Air Force size standards, improvement cost
limits, or GOQ limits.
2.5.5. Exceeding M&R or OMR Limit. GOQ limits may be exceeded only after appropriate
approval and if needed, notification to Congress. Typically, notification is accomplished through
submission of the Air Force budget. MAJCOMs accomplish this in their response to HQ
USAF/ILEH call letter issued as part of the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) preparation.
2.5.5.3. When submitting an exceed-threshold request, MAJCOMs must make sure the total
amount requested is equal to the sum of annual projected costs for management, services,
furnishings, and M&R (major and minor M&R, minor alteration, grounds maintenance, and
change of occupancy maintenance). Once approved by Congress, the total becomes the OMR
limit for this GOQ for that budget year (BY) and the M&R request becomes the M&R limit for
that BY.
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                                    69


2.5.5.4. Every effort must be made to award major M&R projects (P-722) included in the
exceed thresh- old request in the BY. MAJCOMs are responsible to work with the base to ensure
timely awards. Only as a last resort may these projects be executed in the year following the BY
under the limits reported to Congress. Current year (year of award) funds will be used to award
the projects.
2.5.5.4.2. If an exceed threshold GOQ project is deferred to the year following the budget year
(BY+1), the M&R and OMR limit for the BY are reduced to the GOQ statutory OMR limit
($35,000). The M&R and OMR limit for the BY+1 is the approved exceed threshold amount
(includes the cost of the project work and all M&R)
2.5.6. Out-of-Cycle Requests.
2.5.6.1. Out-of-cycle budget submission will be made only when there is an extremely urgent
situation, typically relating to risks to health, life or safety. Out-of-cycle requests must be for
proposed work so urgent and compelling it cannot wait for the next annual budget submission; it
could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of budget submission; cost of the work will
cause the GOQ to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit and possibly the M&R limit; and work does
not constitute an alteration, addition, or improvement.
2.5.6.2. Out-of-cycle requests to exceed the $35,000 limit(s) receive scrutiny by numerous Air
Staff and Air Force Secretariat officials. After-the-fact notifications are not allowed except as
described in 2.5.2. SAF/IE must review and approve all out-of-cycle notifications. Approved
requests are then submitted to Congress for notification. Congress has 30 days to act on the
notification to exceed the M&R limit. Time periods for notification to exceed the OMR limit
only may be shorter. Submissions should include:
2.5.6.2.8. Detailed breakout of other anticipated costs for the FY, including, but not limited to,
specific projects approved by SAF/IEI and all OMR costs.
2.7. Maintaining Grounds. GOQ residents are responsible for maintenance of the grounds
within the exclusive use area for their quarters. The exclusive use area includes the grounds
around the facility that are considered to be reserved for the use of the occupants of the GOQ
(or authorized guests) only. Normally, this includes an area 50 feet from the quarters (calculated
from the further most elevation on all four sides of the quarters); however, it may be larger as a
result of natural or man-made barriers which limit free access to the area by members of the
installation’s housing community or as designated by the wing commander. Grounds
maintenance includes routine lawn/landscaping maintenance actions such as mowing, edging,
raking, planting annuals, tree trimming, maintaining shrubbery, herbicide treatments, fertilizing,
pruning, mulching, and related materials from self-help store.
2.7.1. SCP GOQ residents are entitled to government-provided grounds maintenance for the
quarter’s entire exclusive use area. All costs for the government-provided grounds maintenance
must be charged against the quarter’s OMR and M&R limits and reported on the AF Form
3826.
2.7.2. Non-SCP GOQ residents are personally responsible for grounds maintenance of the
entire exclusive use area; however, in certain situations, government-provided grounds
maintenance may be allowed only after a MAJCOM/CC waiver approval is received. The
waiver approval authority may not be further delegated. In no case will the individual exercising
70                                                    AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


this authority make a decision about their own GOQ or the GOQ of a person senior in rank.
When Government-provided grounds maintenance has been approved, all associated costs are
charged against that GOQ’s annual OMR and M&R limits. When enlisted aides perform
grounds maintenance, their work is not charged to the OMR limit. MAJCOM/CC’s may approve
waivers to:
2.7.2.1. Allow government-provided grounds maintenance of the entire exclusive use area if the
GOQ is prominently located and makes a unique contribution to the appearance of the
installation. All costs for the government-provided grounds maintenance must be charged
against the quarter’s OMR/M&R threshold and reported on the AF Form 3826.
2.7.2.2. Allow government-provided grounds maintenance on the portion of the exclusive use
area beyond 50 feet if exclusive use area is extremely large (one-half acre or more). All costs
for the government-provided grounds maintenance must be charged against the quarter’s OMR
and M&R limits and reported on the AF Form 3826.
2.7.3. When the government provides grounds maintenance to areas shared by more than one
GOQ, costs are prorated and charged to each benefiting GOQ; OMR and M&R limits apply.
2.8.3.1. Charge installation and cleaning of installed carpet against the annual limits.
2.8.3.3.3. Manufacturer certification the carpet conforms to ETL 02-20 (or superseding ETL)
Air Force Carpet Standard (available from the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency [HQ
AFCESA] at Https://www/afcesa.af.mil/library/index.asp>
2.8.4.2. Charge window coverings and associated hardware against the annual limits.
2.8.5.1. Charge authorized wall coverings and decorative borders against the annual limits.

2.8.6. Flags. For government-owned units, US (American), combatant command, Service, and
host nation flags may be purchased and installed using M&R (P-722) funds. Only two flags per
GOQ may be purchased. Purchase of general officer flags, state, and other organizational flags
in not authorized. Charge authorized flags against the annual $35,000 limits. NOTE: Examples
of unified combatant commands are Central Command (CENTCOM), Southern Command
(SOUTHCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), and Special Operations Command
(SOCOM).
3.2.1.3. Cleaning costs for window treatments are reported on AF Form 3826 under Section I,
Line 3B, Furnishings - Not charged against the limit (AC 721.41-.42; these costs are not subject
to the one year or five year furnishings limits but are charged against the annual OMR/M&R
limit.
3.2.2.2. Costs to buy, install, maintain and repair built-in appliances, such as a dishwasher or
built-in oven or cook top, are charged to the appropriate M&R category in Section III of the AF
Form 3826.
3.2.2.3. Cost to buy, install, maintain, and repair freestanding appliances (not installed) such as a
portable dishwasher on wheels, refrigerator, stove, microwave, and washer and dryer are
charged as furnishings - not against the limit (AF Form 3826, Section I, line 3B).
3.3.1. 1-year and 5-year Furnishings Limitations. Limit expenditures for furnishings - charged
against the limit (Attachment 5, part A) to $10,000 per SCP per fiscal year and $40,000 per
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                                71


SCP over a 5-year consecutive period. For other GOQs, limit these expenditures to $6,000 per
GOQ per fiscal year and $20,000 over a 5-year period. All furnishings costs (AF Form 3826,
Section I, Line 3A-D) count against the OMR annual limit. NOTE: The one- and five-year
limits apply to new items taken from existing base stocks that have never been charged to a
GOQ. Exclude items from existing base FMO stock when the item has been used and
previously charged to other quarters. Exclude costs associated with government-provided
shipping, transportation, pickup, delivery, installation, repair and cleaning furnishings, as well
as com- mercial shipping costs for items delivered to base FMO stocks at OCONUS locations.
Apply the furnish- ing limit to the:
3.3.2. Waiver to Cost Limits. The installation commander will forward requests to exceed
furnishings 1-year and 5-year cost limits to the MAJCOM/CE. This waiver does not apply to
the $35K OMR limit. The MAJCOM/CC may approve waivers to the 1-year and 5-year limits.
In no case will the individual exercising this authority make a decision about his or her own
dwelling or the dwelling of a person senior in rank. All furnishings costs (AF Form 3826,
Section I, Line 3A-D) count against the OMR annual limit. If waiving the 1-year and/or 5-year
limit also causes the project OMR costs to exceed $35,000 for that FY, appropriate additional
approvals must be obtained prior to incurring additional furnishing costs. The waiver requests
must be justified and include:
3.4. Special Command Position (SCP) Tableware and Linen Allowances. The Air Force has
standard- ized tableware authorizations. In accordance with Attachment 5, part B, china, crystal,
silver service, and table linen are subject to a $1,000 annual replacement allowance. Housing
flight chiefs are responsible for tracking and reporting these expenditures on the cost reports.
These items are not charged against the 1-year and 5-year furnishing limits but are charged
against the annual OMR limit.
3.4.1.2. Table linen may be cleaned at government expense with P-721.41-.42 funds. Report
costs on AF Form 3826, Section I, line 3B, Furnishings not charged against the limit; these
expenses are charged against the annual OMR limit.
3.4.2. Tableware. The initial issue of SCP china, crystal, and flatware is not subject to the
$1,000 annual replacement allowance. Replacement items are charged against the $1,000 limit
and the annual OMR limit.

3.5. Special Command Position (SCP) Miscellaneous Supplemental Allowance. The Air
Force pro- vides SCPs an additional $1,000 allowance for items required for official
entertainment, such as small cookware, serving pieces, and tableware items not listed in
Attachment 5. The items are not charged against the one-year and five-year furnishings limits
but they are charged against the annual OMR limit.
3.5.1. Authorized items are purchased with P-721 funds and reported under the SCP
miscellaneous supplemental allowance cost category (AF Form 3826, section I, line 3D). These
expenses are charged against the annual OMR limit.
4.1. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Expenditures. GOQ expenditures are reported to OSD
and Congress annually per their direction. This requirement applies to all government
expenditures in all GOQs (government-owned, lease or privatized). All O&M costs for family
housing GOQs temporarily diverted as unaccompanied GOQs are paid exclusively from family
72                                                  AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014


housing funds and all limits apply. It is important to track and accurately account for GOQ
operation, maintenance, and repair costs to ensure limits (law or policy) are not exceeded and to
accomplish reporting requirements.
4.2.1. Occupancy Period for Cost Reporting.
4.2.1.1. Report operations, maintenance, and repair costs (AF Form 3826, Section I, Line 1-3D
and Sec- tion III, Line 6) for the entire year if the general officer (including those that are
"frocked") occupies the GOQ for any part of the year. (Paragraph 4.3.1.1.). Do not report
O&M costs for housing designated for general officer use but not occupied by a general officer
at any time during the fiscal year. A senior officer quarter (SOQ) occupied by a brigadier
general select is not a GOQ; however, project approval lev- els for brigadier general selects are
the same as for general officers. Additionally, project work will not commence until the date of
promotion of the occupant to grade O-7.
4.2.4.1. Operations Costs. Report all expenditures associated with management, services,
furnishings and miscellaneous operations in this category.
4.2.4.2. M&R Costs. Report all expenditures for M&R work in this category, including periodic
and recurring maintenance, change of occupancy, contract cleaning, service calls, minor and
major repair, minor alteration, grounds maintenance, and self-help materials.
4.3.1. See Attachment 2 for a sample AF Form 3826. This documents is used to report
expenditures for each GOQ and to inform residents of costs charged against their quarters. Bases
will complete a quarterly report and worksheet for each GOQ using the instructions provided in
Attachment 3. Submit the report and worksheet in accordance with MAJCOM guidance.
MAJCOMs consolidate base reports and forward third-quarter reports and worksheets to HQ
USAF/ILEH. Consolidated fourth-quarter reports and work- sheets are submitted to HQ
USAF/ILEH and 11 WG/SUPS, 229 Brookley Avenue, Suite 107, Bolling AFB DC 20332-
0302. NOTE: Reports are designated emergency status code C-3; continue reporting during
emergency conditions, precedence delayed. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they
may be delayed to allow submission of higher precedence reports. Submit by non-electronic
means, if possible. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE.
4.3.1.1. For the AF Form 3826, include costs for management, services, furnishings, and
maintenance and repair for the entire year.
4.3.1.4. In addition to the detailed breakout of GOQ expenditures, provide the following
documentation along with each AF Form 3826:
4.3.1.4.1. A copy of all grounds maintenance waivers for non-SCPs

4.3.1.5. Retain AF Forms 3826 and detailed worksheets for 5 years to support 5-year
furnishings limitations.
4.3.2. The fourth quarter, AF Form 3826 is used to report annual obligations for each GOQ and
provides a historical database on GOQ expenditures. Bases submit the fourth quarter AF Form
3826 for each GOQ to the MAJCOM in accordance with MAJCOM guidance. MAJCOMs will
consolidate base reports and provide a MAJCOM summary and signed AF Form 3826 and
supporting documentation (paragraph 4.3.1.4.) to HQ USAF/ILEH. HQ USAF/ILEH will
consolidate the MAJCOM reports and send to SAF/IE for approval. Once approved, the
AFI32-6003_AFSPCSUP_I 27 MAY 2014                                                          73


consolidated report is forwarded to the DOD Comptroller who will sub- mit the reports to
Congress each year.

unserviceable materials, systems, or components with contemporary standard components or
materials, consistent with local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle
analysis. Replacement of failed or unservice- able materials, systems, or components with an
upgraded material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local GOQ
standards shall always be classified as minor alteration.

DODD1100.12. A general officer or civilian equivalent occupies the position and carries public
entertainment responsibilities that require the incumbent to represent the interests of the United
States in official and social activities involving foreign or domestic dignitaries. Typically these
positions are limited to general officers in the grade of 0-10; however, generals in a lower grade
may be designated as SCP if the incumbent is:

government). These items are also called SCP amenities.
Window Coverings—M&R-funded (P-722) items integral to the dwelling that cover windows
to provide privacy and control lighting. Provided on all windows per US Air Force Family
Housing Guide. Window coverings include shades, shutters, blinds (vertical and horizontal
wood, aluminum, and vinyl), and associated hardware.

units are authorized window treatments throughout quarters; non-SCP units are only authorized
window treatments in entertainment areas. Window treatments include draperies, curtains,
sheers, rods, valances, cornices, and associated hardware. Window treatments must be neutral in
