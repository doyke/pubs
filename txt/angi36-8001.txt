SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Some new limitations were placed on telecommuting by ANG drill status guardsmen in section
2. To ensure compliance with this publication it should be read in its entirety by commanders,
supervisors and telecommuters.

Section A—General Information

1. Background.
 2                                                          ANGI36-8001 21 JANUARY 2012


     1.1. Telecommuting is a management tool that allows the ANG to authorize personnel to
     voluntarily work away from their official duty location. Telecommuting is a complementary
     way of doing business, which moves work to the people instead of moving the people to the
     work. In general, it means working from an alternate work location away from the official
     duty location. Traditional telecommuters have used dial-up laptops, telephones and
     facsimiles to provide office communications away from the office. Virtual private
     networking and high-speed internet access have enhanced both electronic security and
     capability for telecommuters. This instruction establishes, sets forth and governs
     commanders’ authority with respect to the types of training and duty that may be performed
     by all telecommuters of the ANG in accordance with Federal statutes and Department of
     Defense (DoD) policy. This instruction does not limit any type of training or operational
     support provided by member (hereafter referred to as telecommuter) of the ANG as may be
     permitted without regard to this instruction.
     1.2. Telecommuting is voluntary. The approval authority should grant telecommuting only
     when it is in the best interest of the ANG. Telecommuting is a privilege and not a right for
     the telecommuter. Travel in connection with this type of duty is not authorized.
     1.3. This instruction requires that participants use a pre-authorized work agreement for
     accountability. Attachment 2 shows a sample work agreement.
2. Scope. This instruction does not apply to AGRs or Technicians. Telecommuting, as a
management tool, authorizes commanders (or their written designees) to allow ANG drill status
Guard members, to work in an official capacity for pay and/or points away from the official duty
location. The alternate work locations must have the necessary tools and environment to enable
the telecommuter to accomplish assigned duties. All data, documents or products developed are
the sole property of the United States Government and will be prepared for filing in accordance
with command guidance if it is to be a permanent record. No classified material will be used or
created while telecommuting. The approval authority and the supervisor determine
telecommuting work not to exceed the limits in 2.1.
     2.1. Under no circumstances should a telecommuter perform all of their duties by
     telecommuting. The limitations placed on telecommuting are as follows:
        2.1.1. Drill status guardsmen (DSG) commanders may perform no more than 5 days
        annual training per fiscal year in a telecommute status. May perform all TPPA and PT
        days in a telecommute status.
        2.1.2. JAGs and medical doctors may perform up to two drills (8 periods), no more than
        5 days AT and all PT days in a telecommute status.
        2.1.3. Enlisted DSG supervisors and DSG officers supervisors may perform up to one
        drill (4 periods), all TPPAs and PT days in a telecommute status.
        2.1.4. All other DSGs may perform up to one drill (4 periods).
     2.2. Requests for exceptions to policy on the limitations of telecommuting must be requested
     in writing, through local approval authority as defined in 3.1, to NGB/A1P with reason and
     justification of exception.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
ANGI36-8001 21 JANUARY 2012                                                                    3

       3.2.5. Maintaining the original approved work agreement with a copy to the
       telecommuter.
   3.3. The commander is responsible for approving the use of Government owned equipment
   and supplies for use by the telecommuter. The decision to use appropriated funds to pay for
   equipment, services or supplies for the purposes of telecommuting rests solely with the
   commander.
4. Compensation.
   4.1. Telecommuters will be compensated in accordance with their duty status. All
   telecommuters must comply with appropriate pay status regulations.
   4.2. The approval authority will not authorize travel or per diem for telecommuting.
   4.3. The approval authority may authorize the performance of duties on an incrementally
   accrued schedule for telecommuters in a military status (NGB IMT 3630, Telecommuting
   Duty Form). An example would be a JAG working in his or her civilian legal office and
   keeping track of time worked on issues for the commander.
   4.4. Incidental expenses incurred by members may be reimbursed in accordance with current
   financial management policy governing claiming reimbursement from the government.
   Approval is not guaranteed and must be obtained prior to incurring the expense.

 4                                                           ANGI36-8001 21 JANUARY 2012


     6.4. The approval authority, supervisor or telecommuter may terminate participation in
     telecommuting at any time.
     6.5. Telecommuters will not use telecommuting for upgrade training or Professional Military
     Education training purposes.
     6.6. Telecommuters must provide adequate and timely access to their telecommuting
     location for troubleshooting, equipment installation, inventory, modification, etc., if needed
     and to ensure telecommunications guidelines are being followed.
7. Agreements. The telecommuter, supervisor and approval authority must sign a work
agreement (Attachment 2), Telecommuter checklist (NGB IMT 3631), and commander’s
authorization (Attachment 3), before starting the telecommuting project.
8. Miscellaneous.
     8.1. Personnel will be entitled to the same protections and indemnification under the Federal
     Tort Claims Act as would be available if the services provided herein were provided at the
     unit during a Unit Training Assembly (UTA) or during scheduled active duty.
     8.2. Wear of the uniform during performance of duty set forth in this instruction is not
     required.

Section B—Equipment

9. Government Equipment.
     9.1. Subject to prescribed rules and limitations, a commander may place government-owned
     computers, computer software, and telecommunications equipment (hereafter referred to as
     equipment) in alternative work locations.
     9.2. The commander retains ownership and control of all hardware, software and data
     associated with, or generated by, government-owned systems. The commander must account
     for equipment on a hand receipt (AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt) and inventory all
     equipment annually. The commander must notify the Equipment Control Officer (ECO) of
     the relocation of the equipment.
     9.3. Government equipment is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Commanders may
     authorize installation, repair and/or maintenance of equipment at their discretion and
     direction. The equipment is for authorized use by the telecommuter only.
     9.4. Telecommuters must comply with all government security procedures and ensure that
     security measures are in place to protect equipment and data from physical and electronic
     corruption, theft, loss or access by unauthorized individuals.
        9.4.1. TELECOMMUTING EQUIPMENT MAY NOT BE USED TO ACCESS OR
        VIEW CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.
        9.4.2. ANG APPROVED ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE (WITH THE LATEST

ANGI36-8001 21 JANUARY 2012                                                                    5


   9.5. Report of Survey procedures must be followed if government equipment is damaged,
   lost or stolen.
   9.6. Government information must be protected from modification, destruction or

   9.7. If telecommuting is no longer required or appropriate, the telecommuter must
   immediately return government-owned hardware, software, data, and cancel all
   telecommunication services that the government provided.
   9.8. The authorizing official assumes responsibility for providing any government network
   or computer equipment. Authorizing officials are not responsible for and will not assume
   personal costs of telecommuting such as telecommuter's home telephone or internet services.
10. Privately Owned Equipment. Frequent telecommuting using privately owned equipment
presents unacceptable risk to ANG information resources and equipment. Privately owned
equipment will NOT be used for telecommuting on a regular basis; government equipment
should be provided for frequent telecommuting or when full network services are required.
Privately owned equipment may be used intermittently for minimal public network services (e.g.,
e-mail via Outlook Web Access) under exceptional circumstances provided that:
   10.1. User agrees to install, service, and maintain (at their own risk and expense) any
   privately owned equipment or services.
   10.2. The government does not incur any liability or assume any costs resulting from the
   misuse, loss, theft or destruction (to include computer viruses) of privately-owned

   inappropriate release. Users must control access to systems in use until appropriately cleared
   per Paragraph 10.6
   10.6. User must remove sensitive residual government information from privately owned
   systems using an approved data removal method when the session is terminated. This
   includes but is not limited to deleting documents, emails, and all attachments; emptying
   recycle bin; deleting cookies, and emptying caches.
   10.7. User will only access network resources through approved gateway protocols and
   methods such as Outlook Web Access in accordance with NGB/A6 Remote Network Access
   Policy. NOTE: Direct connections to the network by privately owned equipment are
   prohibited.
   10.8. User must provide adequate and timely access to privately owned equipment for
   troubleshooting, installation, inventory, modification, etc., in the event an information
   handling incident is encountered and to ensure guidelines are being followed.
   10.9. Telecommuters may not “auto-forward” e-mails from government to non-government
   accounts as e-mail containing sensitive information may not transit public networks without
   appropriate encryption. E-mail and attachments may be manually forwarded after review if
 6                                                           ANGI36-8001 21 JANUARY 2012


     no sensitive information is included. This may also prevent inadvertent transmission of
     classified information in the event such an incident occurs on the unclassified network.
     Telecommuters may establish an auto-reply rule to provide those wishing to contact them
     with alternate contact information.

Section C—Accountability

11. Documentation.
     11.1. The approval authority will sign all required agreements before the telecommuter starts
     the telecommuting project.

     authority reviews the telecommuting documentation prior to signing pay documents. The
     approval authority indicates agreement by signing the appropriate pay documents (e.g., NGB
     105S, Authorization for Individual Inactive Duty Training, etc.).
