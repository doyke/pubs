                                                Chapter 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This volume was developed to provide deployed Airmen w ith alternative methods of
accomplishing certain engineering tasks when there is insufficient time or materials or it is impractical to
employ conventional methods. Information regarding installation of standard expedient construction sys-
tems such as Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR), is beyond the scope of this publication, but
is available in other pamphlets in this series.

1.2. Overview. This pamphlet contains illustrations of basic material applications and construction meth-
ods that have proven their worth during field applications. Any data and definitions presented are general
in nature and should be used solely as guides. Detailed drawings are provided throughout this publication
to help supervisors illustrate and explain requiremen ts to their craftsmen. The data presented herein
applies primarily to a field construction force operation in a remote or bare base area ( Figure 1.1.) ham-
pered by shortages of standard constr uction materials. However, it will be evident that some procedures
may be relevant and helpfu l during peacetime disaster response. In addition, many of the techniques
described may apply during post-att ack recovery efforts. For the pu rpose of this doc ument, the word
"expedient" is defined as: "a m eans devised or employe d in a time and place where prompt action is
essential." Expedient engineering definitely does not preclude usi ng normal engineer practices where
time and materials are available.

1.3. Environmental Considerations. The United States Air Force is committed to achieving and main-
taining environmental quality to protect US intere sts. Upholding a high level of environmental quality
during training exercises or actual contingencies is a dif ficult challenge that must be achieved. T o this
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               11


end, all Air Force personnel involved in these operations are charged with environmental stewardship. In
no way is the intent of this res ponsibility either removed or diminis hed simply because expedient mea-
sures are to be employed. Further information on how to integrate environmentally responsible practices
during contingency operations can be found in Ai r Force Handbook 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental
Guide for Contingency Operations.

1.4. Task Identification. As a general rule, this volume attemp ts to address only expedient field con-
struction and repair tasks that are accomplished during wartime or contingencies. Ho wever, some con-
struction and repair tasks addressed in this pamphlet may also be employed during disaster recovery
operations when immediate action is necessary and resources are limited.

1.5. General Safety Practices. One of the first rules fo r response to a ny situation requiring expedient
applications is to be flexible a nd remain safe. Supervisors must alwa ys keep safety in mind when using
nonstandard construction methods and materials. Losing or injuring personnel or disa bling equipment
during field operations can severely impact miss ion accomplishment. Never compromise personnel and
equipment safety when implementing the expedient procedures described in this pamphlet.
   1.5.1. Whethe r working alongside other military units; federal, state, an d local disaster recovery
   forces; government civilian employ ees and contractors; or traine d and untrained volunteers, it is
   essential that everyone involved is aware of the procedures used to identify hazards.
   1.5.2. To ensure safety, crew leaders should know the capabilities and limitations of assigned person-
   nel and monitor all work ef forts. In addition, make certain that activities are coordinated with all
   involved. For example, debris removal in and around facilities is a dangerous, critical task. Vibrations
   from heavy equipment can cause a building to collapse on recovery workers.
   1.5.3. When working in a contaminated environment, be sure to wear the appropriate individual pro-
   tective equipment (IPE) for the hazard present. Wash contaminated clothing and take a shower as soon
   as possible after working in a contaminated environment. Even when working in an environment that
   is not contaminated, wear protective equipment for dust, noise, sharp objects, and construction mate-
   rials. Plywood and lumber , brick an d block, and sheet metal can all cause cuts and in juries. Even a
   small cut can develop into a serious injury if the wound becomes infected.

               ROAD AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR

2.1. Introduction. Expedient construction and repair of road s and drainage system s during disasters or
after an attack could be crucial to recovery operations and mission sustainment. These efforts may include
tree clearing, grubbing and strippi ng; grading and assessing the drai nage system; repairing existing or
constructing new roads and drainage systems; and implementing draina ge system erosion control prac-
tices and maintenance. In remote locations, or during post-attack operations, engineer personnel may have
few supplies and resources to accomplish needed cons truction and repair. In this type of environment,
engineers will need to use ingenuity , available resources, and a lot of backbreaki ng labor to accomplish
the mission.

2.2. Overview. The concepts and examples in this chapter may be applied singularly or in combination
or may be modified to suit fieldconditions for expedient construction. By using these procedures, an engi-
neer contingent faced with resource shortfalls may be able to meet the minimum requirements for mission
accomplishment until additional resources become available. The topics presented in this chapter consist
of expedient road construction and repair , expedient drainage construction and repair, and drainage sys-
tem erosion control and maintenance. Note: Information regarding airfield pavement repair procedures is
contained in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-270-07, O&M: Airfield Damage Repair.

2.3. Expedient Road Construction and Repair. Establishment of useable roadways during disa ster
recovery operations or after an attack is crucial. Tasks may be as simple as clearing existing pavements or
as arduous as actually constructing new surfaces. At austere sites where equipment and materials are lim-
ited, expedient construction and repair measures may be needed to provide workable surfaces in a timely
fashion. The expedient road construc tion methods discussed in this chap ter are: wire mesh; sand grid;
plank tread; landing mat; and snow and ice. In addition, soil cement, geo-fiber, lime, and fly ash stabiliza-
tion procedures are also discu ssed. Field Manual (F M) 5-34, Engineer Field Data and FM 5-430-00-1,
Planning and Design of Roads, Airfields, and Heliports in the Theater of Operations—Road Design, pro-
vide further options for dealing with problems related to expedient road construction.
     2.3.1. Expedient Road Construction Methods.
        2.3.1.1. Wire Mesh. Chicken wire or chain-link (cyclone) fencing material may be used for expe-
        dient surfaces over sand. Adding a layer of burla p or similar material und erneath the wire mesh
        helps confine the sand. Longer life can be obtained by proper subgrade preparation, multilayer or
        sandwich construction, and staking the edges of the wire mesh at 3-foot intervals. As indicated in
        Figure 2.1., diagonal wires that cross the centerline at 45-degree angles and are securely attached
        to buried pickets fortify the lighter meshes. The more layers used the more durable the surface will
        become. Other roads should never cross wire-mesh roads unless planking or some such material is
        placed over the mesh to protect it. In addition, mesh surfaces should not be used on muddy roads
        because they prevent grading and reshaping of the surface when ruts appear. Commercial wire/
        fabric barriers, laid flat, prov ide similar confinement and separation as the wire mesh/burlap and
        may be more available in the area of responsibility (AOR).

      2.3.1.2. Sand-Grid Roads. This technique involves the conf inement of sand or sandy materials
      in interconnected cellular elements called grid s (Geocells) to produce a load-distributing pave-
      ment base layer. It has application in areas where sandy materials are abundant and quality con-
      struction aggregates are not av ailable. A sand-grid road over a sand subgrade is capable of
      supporting over 10,000 passes of heavy truck traffic, including tandem axle loads of up to 53,000
      pounds. The plastic honeycomb grid is manufactured and shipped in unexpanded sections that are
      easily expanded for field use (see Figure 2.2.). Each 4-inch-thick section expands to form a hon-
      eycomb arrangement of 561 cells that cover an area 8 by 20 feet and weigh 1 10 pounds. Other
      applications of sand-grid technology include field fortifications, slope protection, channel protec-
      tion, and retaining walls.
         2.3.1.2.1. When installing this ma terial, use pickets or place sand on the corners and sides to
         maintain placement. After positioning the entire first layer, use a bucket loader to begin filling
         the grid, working from one edge of the repair to ward the center. A full grid section will hold
         the weight of a bucket loader. A four-person crew can quickly construct a sand-grid road using
         bucket loaders, light bulldozer s and vibratory compaction roll ers. The use of rough-terrain
         forklifts; water distributors; asphalt distribut ors; long-handled, round-point shovels; and
         8-foot by 4-foot by 3/8-inch sheets of plyw ood can increase the effectiveness and speed of
         construction.

Figure 2.2. Typical Sand-Grid Material in Shipping Configuration.




          2.3.1.2.2. As the grids are filled, the loader can drive forward onto the grids to expand their
          range. Use shovels and rakes to spread the material to overfill the cells by a uniform layer of 1
          to 2 inches. Provide suf ficient compaction by using a rubber-tire or steel-wheel roller. How-
          ever, be aware that over compaction can damage the sand grid and result in premature failure.
          After compacting the first layer, repeat the process, starting by placing a porous layer of mem-
          brane (typically permeable geotextiles or geof abrics that are lightwe ight, waterproof, and
          breathable). Put the top layer of sand grid with its long dimension stretched 90 degrees to the
          first. This makes it perpendicular to the r oad centerline and increases strength. Once again,
          overfill the grid cells by 1 to 2 inches. The surface can be further stabilized by applying a
          sand-asphalt surface of about one-gallon of RC-250 asphalt cutback per square yard. Figure
          2.3. is an example of using sand grids to construct roads over rough terrain.

Figure 2.3. Sand-Grid Road Construction.




          2.3.1.2.3. When making road repairs with this material, place the initial 4-inch layer of sand
          grid in the crater parallel to the centerline of the roadway. Expand the sand grid, using shovels
          to fill the grid-edge sections to hold it in place. Cover the entire bottom of the cavity with grid
          material in this ma nner so it confor ms to the shape of the repair, curving or cutting as neces-
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               15


          sary (see Figure 2.4.). Sections that do not fully expand add strength to the base. After posi-
          tioning the first layer , fill the grid, working fr om one edge of the repair toward the center .
          Compact the cells level with the pavement, using a rubbe r-tire or steel-wheel roller or vibra-
          tory-plate tampers, and remove any excess material after compaction. If more than one layer is
          needed, follow the previous instructions for sand-grid road construction.

Figure 2.4. Sand-Grid Construction Details.




      2.3.1.3. Plank-Tread Roads. Use plank-tread roads for crossing short sections of loos e sand or
      wet, soft ground. This type of road may last severa l months if it is well-built and has an adequate
      base (see Figure 2.5.).
          2.3.1.3.1. To construct a plank-tread road, first place sleepers 12 to 16 feet long perpendicular
          to the centerline on 3- to 4-foot centers, depending on the loadsto be carried and subgrade con-
          ditions. If finished ti mber is no t available, logs may be used as sl eepers. Next, place 4- by
          10-inch planks parallel to the li ne of traffic to form two treads about 36 inches apart. S tagger
          the joints to prevent forming weak spots. If desired, 6-inch curbs may be installed on the inside
          of the treads. When built with an adequate ba se, plank roads can last for several months.
          Planks 3 to 4 inches thick, 8 to 12 inches wide, and at least 13 feet long are ideal for flooring,
          stringers, and sleepers. When desired, 3- by 10-inch planks (rough, not finished) can replace
          the 4- by 10-inch timbers shown in Figure 2.5. Rough 3- by 8-inch a nd 3- by 10-inch planks
          can normally be cut to order.
          2.3.1.3.2. Position stringers in regular rows parallel to the centerline on 3-foot centers with
          staggered joints. Lay floor planks across the stringers with about 1-inch gaps when seasoned
          lumber is used. The gaps allo w for swelling when the lumber absorbs moisture. Spike the
          planks to every stringer . Place 6-inch-deep gu ardrails on each side with a 12-inch gap left
          between successive lengths of guardrails for surface-water drainage. Install pickets along each
          side at 15-foot intervals to hold the roadway in line.

Figure 2.5. Plank-Tread Road Layout Plan.




          2.3.1.3.3. To achieve pr oper drainage, construct the base for a plank road with a tr ansverse
          slope, as shown in Figure 2.6., instead of a center crown. T o provide a smoother riding sur-
          face, put treads parallel to the line of traffic over floor planks.

Figure 2.6. Plank Road Construction Details.




      2.3.1.4. Airfield Landing Mats. The demand for rapidly constructed airfields led to the develop-
      ment of several portable, metal landing mats. As metal airfield landing mats became a standard
      supply item, they were quickly put to use on beaches as well as airf ields. They are still in us e as
      expedients for crossing sandy terr ain. Landing mat designs fabricated from aluminum alloys can
      support heavier loads than many other materials and have a lower weight per square foot as com-
      pared to timbers. They also provide smoother su rfaces so that the smallest-wheeled vehicle using
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  17


      the road can obtain traction. The three most common types of matting employed in expedient road
      construction are pierced steel planking (PSP), M8A1, and AM-2 (see Figure 2.7.).

Figure 2.7. Common Landing Mat Variations.




         2.3.1.4.1. When used on sand, place the metal landing mats directly on the sand to the length
         and width desired. Install the mat so that its long axis is perpendicular to the flow of traffic. If
         a width greater than the ef fective length of one plank is required, use half sections to stagger
         the joints. A second layer of the steel mat, laid as a treadway over the initial layer, increases its
         effectiveness. If PSP is used, place an impervious membrane under the mat to smooth and firm
         the subgrade, thus improving the road stability.
         2.3.1.4.2. After extended use, landing mats te nd to curl at the edge s. This problem can be
         overcome by anchoring the edges properly. Screw-type earth anchors provide the best means
         of anchoring. Another me thod of securing the edges is to us e a curb of timber on the outside
         edge of the road and either wire it tightly to buried logs laid para llel to the road or stake it a s
         shown in Figure 2.8. In addition, the road surface must be void of high spots and ruts for mat-
         ting to be effective. Such irregularities cause difficulties in assembling the matting pieces.
      2.3.1.5. Snow and Ice Roads. In regions with heavy snowfall and where temperatures are below
      freezing for extended periods, expedient roads can be constructed over the snow. When a road is
      laid out over snow or ice, make grades and curves as gentle as possible and compact the snow until
      it is capable of supporting the weight of the vehicles expected to use it. Once proper compaction is
      achieved, add water to the comp acted plane and allow it to fr eeze to produce a sounder wearing
      surface. Vehicle tire traction can be improved by spreading sand over the surface.

     2.3.2. Soil Stabilization Techniques. In addit ion to expedient r oad construction procedures
     addressed previously, mechanical and chemical soil stabilization tech niques can be used to bolster
     road surfaces during contingencies ( Figure 2.9.). Many of these approaches can be ef fective for
     extended periods. Mechanically stabilized soil mixtures are widely used as surfaces for military roads
     to carry light traffic where difficult soil conditions exist. Chemical admixtures are often used to stabi-
     lize soils when mechanical methods are inadequate and replacing an undesirable soil with a desirable
     soil is not an option. Most chemic al admixture stabilization projects involve the use of cement, lime,
     or fly ash. While both of these methods appear to be labor intensive, they are quite the opposite when
     compared to standard road cons truction methods. In terms of mate rial, both processes are less costly
     than normal road construction involving asphalt or concrete. Warning. The use of cement, lime or fly
     ash to stabilize a soil with a high content of sulfates (as present in many Southwest Asia (SWA) coun-
     tries) can lead to heave from ettri ngite formation. Engineers may need to have soil tested for sulfate
     content before selecting a stabilization agent.

        2.3.2.1. Chemical Mixtures Methods. Although effective, there ar e hazards associated with
        chemical stabilizers. When working with these materials, refer to detailed information listed in the
        Material Safety Data Sheet (M SDS) prepared by the manufactur er. Generally, the hazard of air-
        borne particles is reduced signifi cantly in the open air on the c onstruction site. General informa-
        tion is also provided in FM 5-410, Military Soils Engineering, Appendix C.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            19


        2.3.2.1.1. Soil-Cement. Soil-cement, also referred to as cement-modified s oil an d
        cement-treated aggregate base, is a dense, highly compacted mixture of soil or roadway mate-
        rial, Portland cement, and water. Almost any inorganic type of soil is suitable for soil-cement.
        However, granular soils are preferred over clay soils because they pulverize more easily and
        require less cement to achieve the required strength and durability. A well-graded granular soil
        will generally require 5 to 8 percent cement by dryweight of soil aggregate, while a soil that is
        sandy silt with 25 percent passing the No. 200 sieve will need 8 to 11 percent cement. In addi-
        tion, granular soils are more desirable for this application since they tend to make the surface
        resistant to both the abrasive effects of traffic and the penetration of precipitation.
           2.3.2.1.1.1. Soil-Cement's Advantages. Soil-cement's advantages include high s trength
           and durability combined with low first cost, making it an economical material. About 90
           percent of the material needed for soil -cement is already i n place, keeping handling and
           hauling costs to a minimum. Like concrete, so il-cement continues to gain strength with
           age. Because soil-cement is compacted into a tight matrix during construction, the pave-
           ment does not deform under traf fic or deve lop potholes l ike unbound aggregate bas es.
           Soil-cement is capable of br idging over weak subgrade areas and is highly resistant to
           deterioration caused by seasonal moisture changes and freeze/thaw cycles.
           2.3.2.1.1.2. Installation Steps. Tests must be performed t o determine the proper cement
           content, compaction, and water requirements for the soil material used. Soil-cement can be
           mixed in either a central plan t or mixed in place. However , during contingency situations
           involving expediency, mixing the material in place is often the obvious choice. For
           in-place operations, e ither clay or granular soils ca n be used. During a mixing-in-place
           operation, always follow the four basic soil-cement paving steps: spreading, mixing, com-
           pacting, and curing.
               2.3.2.1.1.2.1. When the roadway has been shaped to grade and the soil loosened to a
               depth of 8 to 10 inches, the proper quantity of cement is spread on the in-place soil.
               2.3.2.1.1.2.2. Th e cement is then thoroughly mixed into the soil and the required
               amount of water is added.
               2.3.2.1.1.2.3. The mixture is then tightly compacted with rollers, shaped to the proper
               contour and rolled again to achieve a smooth finish. Finally, to supply and maintain the
               moisture needed for hydration, the soil-cement is sprayed with water and sealed with a
               bituminous mixture. Further information regarding soil-cement procedures can be
               found in HQ AFCESA Enginee ring Technical Letter (ETL) 01-06, Contingency Air-
               field Pavement Specifications. This document can be downloaded from the AFCESA
               web site:

               ETL%2001-6.pdf
        2.3.2.1.2. Lime. Experience has shown that lime reacts with medium, moderately fine, and
        fine-grained soils to produce de creased plasticity, increased workability and strength, and
        reduced swell. Several soil classifications in the U nified Soils Classification System (USCS)
        are potentially capable of being stabilized wi th lime. Additional data on lime stabilization
        actions can be found in FM 5-410.
20                                                               AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


        2.3.2.1.2.1. If the soil temperatur e is less than 60 de grees Fahrenheit and is not expected
        to increase for one month, ch emical reactions will not occu r rapidly. Thus, the strength
        gain of the lime-soil mixture will be minima l. Lime-soil mixtures should be scheduled so
        that sufficient durability is gained to resist any freeze/thaw cycles expected. If heavy vehi-
        cles are allowed on the lime-stabilized soil before a 10- to 14-day curing period, pavement
        damage can be expe cted. Lime gains strength slowly and requires about 14 days in hot
        weather and 28 days in cool weather to gain significant strength. Unsurfaced lime-stabi-
        lized soils degrade rapidly under traffic, so bituminous surface treatment is recommended
        to prevent surface deterioration.
        2.3.2.1.2.2. Lime can be used either to modify some of the physical properties and thereby
        improve the quality of a soil or to transform the soil into a stabilized mass, which increases
        its strength and durability. The amount of lime additive depe nds on whether the soil is to
        be modified or stabilized. Th e lime to be used may be either hydr ated or quicklime,
        although most stabilization is done using hydrat ed lime. The reason is that quicklime is
        highly caustic and dangerous to use.
        2.3.2.1.2.3. When lime is added to a soil, a comb ination of reactions begins to take place
        immediately. These react ions are nearly complete withi n one hour, although substantial
        strength gain is not reflected fo r some time. The react ions result in a change in both the
        chemical composition and the physical properties. Most lime has a pH of about 12.4 when
        placed in a water solution. Therefore, the pH is a good indicator of the desirable lime con-
        tent of a soil-lime mixture. The reaction that takes place when lime is introduced to a soil
        generally causes a significant change in the plasticity of the soil.
     2.3.2.1.3. Fly Ash. Fly ash consists mainly of silic on and aluminum compounds that, when
     mixed with lime and water , forms a hardened cementitious mass capable of obtaining high
     compression strengths. Fly ash is a by-product of coal-fired, el ectric-power-generation facili-
     ties. The liming quality of fly ash is highly dependent on the type of coal used in power gener-
     ation. Fly ash is categor ized into two broad classes by its calcium oxide (CaO) content. They
     are: Class C and Class F. Refer to FM 5-410 for more information on fly ash stabilization.
        2.3.2.1.3.1. Class C. This class of fly ash has a high CaO content (12 percent or more) and
        originates from sub-bituminous and lignite (soft) coal. Fly ash from lignite has the highest
        CaO content, often exceeding 30 pe rcent. This type can be used as a stand-alone stabiliz-
        ing agent. The strength characteristics of Class C fly ash having a CaO less than 25 percent
        can be improved by adding lime.
        2.3.2.1.3.2. Class F. This class of fly ash has a low CaO content (less than 10 percent) and
        originates from anthracite and bituminous coal. C lass F fly ash has an insuf ficient CaO
        content for the po zzolanic reaction to o ccur. It is not effective as a stabilizing agent by
        itself; but when mixed with lime or lime and cement, the fly ash mixture becomes an effec-
        tive stabilizing agent.
        2.3.2.1.3.3. Lime Fly Ash (LFA) Mixtures. LFA mixtures can contai n either Class C or
        Class F fly ash. The LF A design process is a four-part process that requires laboratory
        analysis to determine the op timum fines (particles passing a Number 200 sieve) content
        and lime-to-fly-ash ratio. The op timum fines content is the percentage of fly ash that
        results in the maximum density of the soil mix. The initial fly ash content should be about
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              21


               10 percent based on the weight of the total mi x. The design fines content should be 2 per-
               cent above the optimum fines content. For example, if 14 percent fly ash yields the maxi-
               mum density, the design fines content would be 16 percent. The moisture density relation
               would be based on the 16 percent mixture. LFA is constructed in laye rs not less than 4
               compacted inches. Final thickness and actual proportions are set by the engineer. After
               LFA has been constructed, the surface must be kept moist until a bituminous curing cover
               is applied.
               2.3.2.1.3.4. Lime-Cement-Fly Ash (LCF) Mixtures: The design methodology for deter-
               mining the LCF ratio for delibe rate construction is the same as for LFA except cement is
               added at the ratio of 1 to 2 percent of the design fines content. Ceme nt may be used in
               place of or in addition to lime; however , the design fines content should be maintained.
               When expedient construction is required, use an initial mix proportion of 1 percent Port-
               land cement, 4 percent lime, 16 percent fly ash, and 79 percent soil. Minimum unconfined
               strength requirements (see Table 2.1.) must be met. If test specimens do not meet strength
               requirements, add cement in 1/2 percent increments un til strength is adequate. Note: As
               with cement-stabilized base course material s, LCF mixtures containing more than 4 per-
               cent cement cannot be used as base course material under Air Force airfield pavements.

      2.3.2.2. Mechanical Mixture (Sand Fiber) Method. The Army Enginee r Research and Devel -
      opment Center (ERDC) in Vicksburg, Mississippi, developed this rapid-road-construction method
      to overcome sandy and soft soil deficiencies. The road construction procedure involves stabilizing
      sand with geofibers, also known as sand fibers. The effectiveness of this approach has been veri-
      fied through extensive testing at the ERDC testing facilities.
          2.3.2.2.1. Sand-fiber ro ad stabilization technology involv es mixing small amounts (0.8 per-
          cent by weight) of hair-like, 5-centimeter-long (2 inches) polypropylene fibers into moist sand
          with a rotary mixer ( Figure 2.10.). The sand-fiber layer is then compacted with a
          smooth-drum vibratory roller. Next, a wearing s urface is added by spraying a re sin-modified
          emulsion or emulsified asphalt onto the road surface to bond the sand grains with the fiber fil-
          aments and protect the sand-fiber surface.
          2.3.2.2.2. Using the geofiber cons truction method, military supply roads can be constructed
          quickly at remote sites, over beaches, or acros s desert sands with less equipment, manpower,
22                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


          and materials than ot her road-building methods require. Experime nts conducted at ERDC
          indicate that roads constructed with this new technology can carry over 10,000 passes of heavy
          military supply traffic with very little or no maintenance required. Sand-fiber stabilization uses
          existing military construction equipment and re quires no special construc tion skills. In addi-
          tion, it can be used on a wide variety of sands and silty soils found around the world. Table
          2.2. lists soil stabilization me thods for specific applicati ons. For additiona l information

       2.3.2.3. Geotextiles Technique. Another technique available for improving the condition of soils
       besides mechanical blending and chemical stab ilization involves the us e of geotextiles (see Fig-
       ure 2.11.). The term geotextile refers to any permeable textil e used with foundation, soil, rock,
       earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of a human-made
24                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      project, structure, or system. Geotextiles are also commonly referred to as geofabrics, engineering
      fabrics, or just fabrics.

Figure 2.11. Using Geotextile During Road Construction.




          2.3.2.3.1. Geotextiles serve four primary functions: reinforcement, separation, drainage, and
          filtration. In many situations, using these fabrics can replace soil, which saves time, materials,
          and equipment costs. In theater -of-operations horizontal construction, the primary concern is
          with separating and reinforcing low load-bearing soils to reduce construction time.
          2.3.2.3.2. The design engineer attempts to reduce the thickness of a pavement structure when-
          ever possible. Tests show that for low load-bearing soils (generally anything less than a 5 CBR
          value) the use of geofabrics can often decrease the amount of subbase and base course materi-
          als required. The fabric lends its tensile stre ngth to the soil to incre ase the over all design
          strength. Figure 2.12. shows an example of this concept.
          2.3.2.3.3. Swamps, peat bogs, and beach sa nds can also be quickly stabilized by the use of
          geofabrics. The normal solution is to remove the poor base material by a process commonly
          referred to as “mucking.” However, this is not an option during most contingencies for a num-
          ber of reasons. Specifically, the removal pro cess is often very dif ficult and time-consuming.
          Furthermore, it can only be used if the area has sound, stable soil underneath the soft soil and
          a suitable fill ma terial is available near by. Consequently, during co ntingencies, a bridge of
          base course construction material is usually placed directly over the weak soil separated by a
          layer of geotextile material, as shown in Figure 2.13. The basic construction sequence for the
          direct fill process is shown in Figure 2.14. Specific geotextile application details are provided
          in FM 5-410 and UFC 3-220-08FA, Engineering Use of Geotextiles.

          2.3.2.3.4. Choosing Geotextiles. A wide range of geotextile fabr ic is available to meet vari-
          ous soil conditions. Selection of the proper geot extile will depend o n the ac tual soil and
          hydraulic conditions. The general soil conditions and considerations listed in Table 2.3.
          should provide some in sight into selecting th e optimum material. Fu rther information about
          geotextile uses is available in FM 5-410 and UFC 3-220-08FA.
      2.3.2.4. Other Surface Options. A number of other materials can be used to construct expedient
      road surfaces. A few examples incl ude rubble, bricks, concrete blocks, timbers, and loose aggre-
      gate or gravel. Detailed information on expedient road construction variations can be found in FM
      5-430-00-1.

Table 2.3. Soil and Hydraulic Conditions.
         Soil Condition                                        Consideration
Graded Gravels and Coarse The use of very open monofilament or multifilament woven materials
Sands                     may be required to permit high rates of flow anda low risk of blinding.
Sands and Gravels with Less This very "dirty" or si lty sand and gravel mate rial requires the use of
than 20% Fines              open monofilament wo ven fabrics and need le-punched nonwoven
                            materials with large openings to redu ce the risk of blinding. For thin,
                            heat-bonded nonwoven geotextile s and thick needle-punched,
                            nonwoven geotextiles, filtration tests should be performed.
Soils with 20% to 60% Fines       When silt or silty sa nd soils are invo lved, filtration tests should be
                                  performed on all fabric types.
Soils with Greater than 60% If dealing with silt or clayey silt type soils, heavyweight
Fines                       needle-punched and heat-bonded nonwoven geote xtiles tend to work
                            best as fines will not pass. If blinding does o ccur, the permeability of
                            the blinding cake would equal that of the soil.
Gap Graded Cohesionless Soils With these types of soils, consider using a uniform sand filter with a
                              woven monofilament as a filter for the sand.
Silts with Sand Seams             Consider using a uniform sand filt er over the soil with a woven
                                  geotextile to prevent mo vement of the filter sand; alternatively ,
                                  consider using a heavyweight (t hick), needle-punched nonwoven
                                  directly against soil as water can flow latera lly through the geotextile
                                  should it become locally clogged.

2.4. Expedient Drainage Construction and Repair. Removing surface water and water runoff away
from roads, buildings, and other structures is critical during disasters or after an attack. The use of cul-
verts, ditches, and other drainage methods may be necessary to prev ent erosion of key building founda-
tions and roadways or to clear floodwaters from housing and industrial areas.
   2.4.1. Expedient Culvert Designs: Expedient culverts can be cons tructed from a wide varie ty of
   materials. A few of the more common variations include sand bags, pierced steel planks, and empty
   oil, gasoline, or asphalt drums. Culverts constructed of timber or logs are usable in the field as tempo-
   rary measures until structures that are more permanent can be employed. In both of these instances, an
   area equal to the end area of an appropriately sized corrugated metal pipe (CMP) or concrete pipe out-
   let, on the same slope, can be used for hydraulic capacity.
       2.4.1.1. Oil Drum Culverts (Figure 2.15.). When empty drums are used, the capacity of the cul-
       verts can be assumed to be equivalent to the same diameter CMP set at a comparable slope. Note:
       If using drums as culverts, take extreme care when using a cutting torch to remove the lids. Joints
       between drums should be welded solid. However, if this cannot be accomplished, tack welds can
       be used if provisions are made to seal the join ts to prevent the culvert water from saturating the
       surrounding fill material.
28                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 2.15. Expedient Oil Drum Culvert.




        2.4.1.2. Log or Timber Box Culverts. When constructing a log or a timb er culvert, the co ver
        should be greater than the top width of the box (seeFigure 2.16.). Joints should be as tight as prac-
        ticable and, if plausible, covere d with some type of sealing ma terial (such as plastic sheeting,
        asphalt, or tar) to prevent water seepage. If such material is not available, caulk with leaves and
        brush. If logs are to be used, in order to obtain maximum structural strength, logs should be
        trimmed where required to ensure proper seating and securely fastened with spikes or driftpins
        (see Figure 2.17.). In order to reduce j oint openings, always lay logs butt to tip. To prevent the
        movement of soil through log openings, double-layer the top logs with burlap or brush. This step
        also applies to culverts made of sandbags and pi erced steel planks if a paved surface is not used
        (see Figure 2.18. and Figure 2.19.). Note: A minimum cover of three feet over a culvert of this
        type is required.
     2.4.2. Open-Ditch Design. From an expedient construction perspe ctive, the shape of a ditch is usu-
     ally governed by the engineer equi pment available. The road grader will probably be the most com-
     mon heavy equipment item used. T riangular ditches are appropriate for most situations; they can be
     symmetrical or nonsymmetrical. If large quantities of runoff are probable, a trapezoidal ditch can be
     excavated. Do not be conservative when it comes to sizing drainage ditches; an oversized ditch will
     cause much less problems than one that is too small.

     2.4.3. Deflectors. To remove water off the surface of an e xpedient road, a deflector can be installed.
     Deflectors are particularly ef fective on sloping roads and help to stop channeling and rutting of the
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  31


   road surface. A deflector is simply a piece of rubber belting 3/8- to a 1/2-inch thick fastened between
   treated timbers. An unserviceable ar resting barrier tape could also be used if a flat rubber belt is not
   available. The timbers are buried at a slight angle across the roadway with only about 3 inches of the
   belt exposed (see Figure 2.20. and Figure 2.21.). As water runs down the surface of the roadway, it is
   intercepted by the belt and is dispersed off to the side. It is common practice to place riprap at the dis-
   persal end of the deflector to prevent erosion of the shoulder and side slopes of the road.

Figure 2.20. Typical Deflector Installations.




Figure 2.21. Deflector Construction Details.




   2.4.4. Open Top Culverts. The open top culvert ( Figure 2.22.) is another way to remove surface
   water away from the surface of roads. This met hod consists of a “U” shaped wooden trough made of
   treated lumber. This trough is installed flush with the roadway surface and angled 30 to 45 degrees
   downgrade. The outlet end of this type of culvert should extend beyond the edge of the road, and
   riprap should be placed at the outlet end to prevent erosion. Thistype of culvert generally requires reg-
   ular maintenance; consequently, it should only be used on roadways with minimum grades. If treated
   lumber is not readily available, an open culvert can also be fabricated using natural material as shown
   in Figure 2.23. where logs were employed.

     2.4.5. French Drains. The purpose of a French drainage syst em is to carry unwanted freestanding
     water away from a building. French drains, also known as blind drains, ar e commonly installed near
     the perimeter of a structure at the lowest point where standing water is found. The system may termi-
     nate at any point where the water will not drain back toward the building. Installing a French drain is
     usually a simple, but labor -intensive, project. However, obstacles such as tree roots, boulders , and
     underground utilities, can make the project difficult and time-consuming.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                33


      2.4.5.1. French drains are normally shallow systems that function on the principle of gravity. As
      such, to be effective, the drain must slope downward with a minimum recommended slope of 1/4
      inch per foot. If the adjacent ground grade runs upward along the dr ain path, dig deeper to main-
      tain a downward slope.
      2.4.5.2. In general, French drains are constructe d by filling a ditch or trench with broken or
      crushed rock (see Figure 2.24.). The top surface of the rock may be left exposed so the trench will
      act as a combination drain or the rock may be c overed by a relatively impe rvious soil so that no
      surface water can penetrate. The latter is the general practice. Normally, French drains are not rec-
      ommended for permanent construction because they have a tendency to silt up with prolonged use.
      In field construction, such drains are often used as a substitute for perfo rated or open joint pipes
      because of logistical limitations on piping or on filter materials suitable for use with such piping.
      However, it is advisable to use a French drain with a perforated land drain in the bottom, which
      may also be wrapped in a layer of this geotextile fabric to ensure longer life by stopping any fines
      from clogging the system. In areas with severe drainage problems, multiple perforated pipes can
      be run together to act as water collectors or interceptor drains. This wa y, water is carried away
      more quickly when the surrounding earth is saturated.

Figure 2.24. Open French Drain Without Pipe.




      2.4.5.3. French Drain Construction Details. The basic procedure for installing a French drain
      that includes perforated pipe is as follows. However, keep in mind, a system can also be installed
      without piping and geotextile fabr ic, but its longevity may be greatly reduced due to silt transfer.
      From the beginning point of th e drain, dig a trench about 12 inches deep and approximately 8
      inches wide. If the ground slopes upward, dig deep er from the starting point to maintain a down-
      ward slope. Line the cavity with a geotextile, leav ing sufficient excess to allow it to overlap the
      subsequent piping and fill material . Next, pour in about 2 inches of rock (pea gravel or crushed
      stone). Lay a 4- to 6-inch perforated pipe over the rock with the perforations facing down. If per-
      forated pipe is not available, fabricate a substitute from lumber as shown in Figure 2.25. Once the
      piping has been installed, place another 2 inches of rock in th e opening to completely cover the
      pipe and fold the remaining geotextile over the stone in order to encapsulate the drain field. Lastly,
34                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


        back fill with soil (about 2 inches) and plant grass. Note: Water entering the tre nch will have to
        run to a suitable drain-of f point, and in most cases, this is a soakaway or watercourse. However ,
        rainwater should never be discha rged into a cesspool or septic tank, and foul drai nage should
        never be discharged into a French drain or soakaway.

Figure 2.25. Improvised Drain Line.




     2.4.6. Soakaway: A soakaway is simply a hole in the ground filled with rubble and coarse stone with
     a drainage pipe laid into it to aid in removing surface (rain) water from other areas. The soil in which
     the soakaway i s placed must be granular with good dr ainage properties. A soakaway should not be
     used in clay soils. Most local au thority regulations dictate soakaways be located at least 15 feet from
     any habitable building. The pipe flowing to them should be at least 3 inches in diameter , however, a
     4-inch pipe diameter is the recommended size. This pipe should be laid to a fall of 1 in 40. The size of
     the soakaway should be a minimum of 3’ x 3’ x 3’ below the bottom of the incoming pipe. The stone
     fill should surround the pipe and finish approximately 4 inches above it. As indicated in Figure 2.26.,
     an impervious layer should then be placed on the stone. Materials such as thick polyethylene, tarpau-
     lin, or even a bed of conc rete (A1) are recommended. Topsoil can then be placed on top of this layer
     to restore the garden level (A).
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                35


Figure 2.26. Typical Soakaway.




   2.4.7. Vertical Wells. Vertical wells are sometimes constructed to permit trapped subsurface water to
   pass through an impervious soil or rock layer to a lower, freely draining layer of soil. Additional wells
   are driven if drainage is obstructed or the pocket is drained with an easily maintained lateral sub-drain
   system. Vertical wells are often used in northern latitudes to permit fast runoff from melting snow to
   get through the frozen soil and reach a pervious stratum. Under such conditions, the bottoms of these
   wells are treated with calcium chloride or a layer of hay to prevent freezing.

2.5. Drainage System Erosion Control and Maintenance. Erosion presents many difficult problems in
designing and maintaining open channels. Erosion tends to change the shape of channels, which can cause
troubles near structures such as roads, bridges, and culverts. Additionally, erosion presents problems
when the displaced material is deposited in undesi red locations. The primary cause for erosion is the
velocity of the water in the channel. The principle method for preventing erosion is to lower the velocity
in the channel below the soil erosion velocity.
   2.5.1. Controlling Velocity. Velocity is dependent on the slope of the chann el. If the slope is
   increased, the velocity increases. One method of decreasing the velocity of the water in a channel is to
   decrease the slope. Channel velocity is also affected by the shape and depth of the channel. Making
   the ditch wider and shallower increases the surface area. The larger surface area causes greater friction
   and lowers the channel velocity. Since constructing a new ditch at a different slope is impractical, an
   effective alternative is to construct a check dam. Check dams are the most common structure used to
   reduce velocity in ditches that have longitudina l grades not exceeding 8 percent. They work by
   decreasing the slope of the water surface. Eventually soil is depo sited on the ditch bottom and the
   ditch slope itself is decreased. Check dams should be considered when the slope ranges between 2 and
   8 percent. Channels with slopes of 2 percent or less generally do not require extensive erosion con-
   trols. Usually with slopes in excess of 8 percent, it is more economical to pave the ditch with asphalt.
   2.5.2. Constructing Check Dams. Check dams may be constructed of timber, sandbags, concrete,
   rock, or similar materials. They should extend at least 24 inches into the bottom and sides of the ditch,
   and the ditch top should be at least 12 inches above the top of the dam. The effective height of the
   check dam should be at least 12 inches, but not mo re than 36 inches. An ap ron of rubble or riprap
   should extend at least 4 feet from the face of the chec k dam on the discharge side to prevent erosion.
36                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


     A weir notch must be cut in the top of the chec k dam with a capacity lar ge enough to dischar ge the
     anticipated runoff to prevent water from cutting around the edges of the dam. Figure 2.27. shows two
     views of a check dam.

Figure 2.27. Typical Check Dam With Weir Notch.




     2.5.3. Check Dam Maintenance: Erosion around the dam is the most common problem associated
     with check dams. The primary cause for this situation is that the weir notch is too small or is clogged
     with debris causing water flow over the top of the dam. This situation results in erosion where the dam
     is anchored into the ground (see Figure 2.28.), and if left uncorrected over time, will often result in
     more damage to adjacent structures than if the dam was never installed.
     2.5.4. Using Riprap and Rubble. By increasing the effective roughness of a ditch, ditch soil erosion
     is decreased. One easy way of doing this is with riprap and rubble ( Figure 2.29.). This method
     involves placing rocks or rubble in the ditch bottom to provide a pr otective cover over the soil. Nor-
     mally, rocks should be lar ger than 6 inches to assure stabilization. Furt hermore, they should be
     hand-placed and compacted individually in at least two layers. The riprap not o nly prevents erosion,
     but will also tend to decrease the velocity in the channel. This makes it useful for lowering velocities
     in sections of channel when ma king transitions to so il ditches from paved or other high-velocity
     ditches.

   2.5.5. Using Turnouts on Roadside Ditches. If hilly terrain is encountered during the construction
   of expedient roads, erosion in the supporting drainage ditches may be a problem. As addressed previ-
   ously, one method of f ighting such erosion involves us ing riprap, but the us e of t urnouts might be
   more effective. Turnouts are channels cut from the roadside ditches to adjacent areas that can handle
   larger runoff quantities. Attempt to have collected water spread over an open land area. Refrain from
   diverting the water directly into nearby streams or lakes. Figure 2.30. shows a typical turnout arrange-
   ment and a chart that indicates the spacing of turnouts in respect to the grading of the road.

Figure 2.30. 2B22BTurnout Layout and Spacing Requirements.




     2.5.6. Constructing Headwalls and Wingwalls. Headwalls and wingwalls are constructed to pre -
     vent and control erosion, guide water into a culvert, reduce seep age, and hold the end of a culvert in
     place. Figure 2.31. illustrates three types of expedient headwalls. Headwalls, also known as retaining
     walls, are a lways employed at the upstream e nd of a culvert. Nevertheless, they can also be used
     downstream where steep grades are involved to support and protect the soil mass at the end of the cul-
     vert and to hold the culvert sections in place. They should be constructed of materials as durable as the
     culvert. Sandbags or rubble can be used in emergency situations.
        2.5.6.1. Headwalls. The inlet end of the pipe should be ex tended so that a minimum-sized head-
        wall is required. Headwalls should not protrude above the shoulder grade and should be located at
        least two feet outside the shoulder to avoid becoming traffic hazards.
        2.5.6.2. Wingwalls. Wingwalls are required to channeliz e water and prevent washing out of
        headwalls. They are set at an angle to the headwall to further support the surrounding fill and help
        direct the water flow. Their hei ght should prevent embankment mate rial from spilling into the
        waterway. The log headwall, shown as (3) in Figure 2.31., includes wings.

Figure 2.31. Expedient Headwall Examples.




      2.5.6.3. Alternatives. Headwalls and wingwalls ar e costly to build in both time and materials.
      When possible, avoid this ef fort by extending the outlet a minim um distance of two feet beyond
      the toe of the fill. In addition, the area directly beneath the pr ojecting culvert should be well pro-
      tected by erosion-resistant material such as sandbags or rock riprap. Riprap should consist of rock
      not less than 6-inches in diamet er. Riprap should be tw o layers deep on the sides of the channel.
      Riprap under the culvert outfall should be at least three layers deep (see Figure 2.32.).

                               EXPEDIENT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS

3.1. Introduction. Expedient structural repair techniques are employed by Air Force engineers to protect
fixed assets following a disaster, wartime or terrorist attack, or during humanitarian assistance activities.
After a wartime or terrorist attack, emergency building repair is generally limited in scope and emergency
repairs are considered adequate when they allow mission-critical functions to continue. During peace-
time, an emergency building repair may be required as a result of a major disaster or emergency. The type
and extent of the disaster or emergency will, to a la rge degree, dictate both th e type and extent of the
recovery response. Tornadoes and hurricanes are two of the more common natural disasters that af fect
military installations. In the past, Altus, Homestead, and Tinker Air Force Bases suf fered heavy damage
that was similar to that of an ai rfield attack from these weather phenomena. Installations and local com-
munities can also experien ce fires, floods, and the af fects of volcanoes. The devastation from Hurricane
Katrina at Keesler Air Force Base in 2005 (Figure 3.1.) reinforces the necessity for engineers to have the
skill-sets required to expediently repair the damage generated by such storms.

Figure 3.1. Building Damage From Hurricane Katrina at Keesler AFB (2005).




3.2. Overview. This chapter concentrates on common technique s used to make expedient or emer gency
repairs to damaged structures—either civilian or military. Emergency repairs of critical facilities normally
involve debris removal; demolition and/or shoring and expedient structural patching of roofing, structural
openings, and exterior sheathing. The topics presented in this chapter consist of repair considerations,
area clearing and safing practices, debris clearing opera tions, structural shoring, and facility expedient
damage repair.

3.3. Repair Considerations. Expedient repair of facilities must be viewed f rom a common sense per-
spective. The following considerations should form the basis for facility repair activities.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                    41


   3.3.1. Safety. Wartime and contingency environments are hazardous enough without endangering
   personnel through unsafe acts during repair activities. S tructures may b e weakened, live electric al
   wires may be down, explosive gas vapors may be pres ent, chemical or biological contamination may
   be prevalent, and unexploded ordnanc e may litter the inst allation. Air base medical facilities may be
   crowded with casualties, and civil engineer (CE) manpower will probably be at critical levels. These
   conditions make it essential that resources are not further taxed by injuries caused through neglect of
   safety practices. Enthusiasm for getting the job done must be temper ed with a prudent assessment of
   the risks. Time should be taken to make a preliminary survey of any suspect structures before any
   repairs are attempted. Also, when civil engineers provide assistance to off-base civilian facilities dur-
   ing a major disaster, they may be faced with various types of structures and hazards that are not com-
   mon to their installation environment.
   3.3.2. Expediency. All engineer efforts immediately following an emer gency should be limited to
   minimum-essential repair of crucial facilities. W ork performed should c oncentrate on functional
   rather than cosmetic repair. All structural repair efforts should be geared toward making a facility safe
   for occupancy and providing minimal protection from the elements.
   3.3.3. Mission. The importance of the facility to the overall base mission determines the repair prior-
   ity. Damaged facilities housing activities that are not essential to the base mission and do not present
   a hazard should be left as they are until time and resources permit conventional repairs.
   3.3.4. Practicality. Considerations of other re lated repair activities af fecting the fac ility should be
   taken into account. For example, if the facility pr ovides service to aircraft and all access pavements
   are so severely damaged that they cannot be made usable for days, the structural repair can wait. Sim-
   ilarly, if the supporting utility systems to a facility are far beyond emergency repair, the structural por-
   tion of the repair effort can be delayed. On the other hand, lack of full utility service does not mean a
   building will be totally useless. A facility with partial utility service, electricity but no water for exam-
   ple, can still be used for its wartime purpose. The da mage control center will have to make the deci-
   sion as to the practicality of repair.
   3.3.5. Flexibility. Flexibility is essential to any expedient repair effort—including ones of a structural
   nature. During war, expect repair priorities to ch ange; engineer efforts must adjust accordin gly. As
   might be expected, no two attacks will be identical; therefore, no two sets of structural repair taskings
   will be identical. Even during peac etime contingencies, engineer forc es must not get locked into a
   standard set of facility priorities and spend a lot of time on minor repairs to the detr iment of other
   more pressing requirements. For example, emergency repairs to a power generating plant may prove
   more important at some point in time than minor repairs to either an installation command and control
   (C2) center or other normally high-priority facility.

3.4. Area Clearing and Safing Practices. Area clearing and safing are im portant considerations when
accomplishing any type of repair, but they are es pecially important with regard to expedient repairs fol-
lowing an emergency. Below are some common safety considerations and hazards that may be encoun-
tered.
   3.4.1. Safety Considerations. Working smartly and safely is vitally important during area clearing
   operations. Disease-causing contaminants and structural damage could present s ome unusual health
   and safety problems for workers.
42                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


        3.4.1.1. Disease-Causing Contaminants. Some buildings affected by conventional attacks, hur-
        ricanes, or contaminated floodw aters have walls, insulation, fl oors, and ventila tion systems that
        can become breeding grounds for disease. Build ing materials can exhibit a wicking ef fect that
        draws water into and up the walls—as much as 3 feet above the water line. Even if workers do not
        become contaminated while rep airing the facility, the occupants working in the buildings after-
        wards may quickly become seriously ill as the pa thogens grow and become airborne. If time is
        available, make sure that the work area and criti cal facilities are free of contaminants, even if it
        requires ripping out wallboard, fl oor covering, and insulation. Cons ider hosing off contaminants
        with clean water or disinfectant at the work site.
        3.4.1.2. Structural Damage. As emergency repairs are underw ay, efforts may grind to a halt
        should the building incur further consequential structural damage by wind and water after the ini-
        tial onslaught. When sheetrock becomes wet, it loses strength and becomes heavier. The additional
        weight and loss of stre ngth can cause further damage or coll apse. If repairs are delayed, provide
        temporary protection and early cleanup to avoid ad ditional damage. Shoring procedures that are
        covered in paragraph 3.6. may also be necessary.
     3.4.2. Hazards. Whether on or off base, not all hazards are identified and not all hazards are quickly
     cleared. Problems could arise when setting up for em ergency repairs even after first responders have
     been through the facilities.
        3.4.2.1. Electrical Hazards. Electrical wires are usually a problem following bomb damage, hur-
        ricanes, tornados, or floods. Th e wires are vulnerable and are easily knocked down. They can be
        especially hard to see at night and may not have been made safe by others. A generator powering
        a nearby work site can send power through damaged electrical systems and reenergize wires at the
        work site. When working in this type of environment, be on the lookout for loose wires and make
        sure that main power panels are off before entering a building for emergency repair. This is espe-
        cially important when working on metal roofs or metal structures situated near damaged electrical
        lines. The power distribution system damage depicted in Figure 3.2. is typical of what one might
        expect to encounter after a larger category hurricane.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              43


Figure 3.2. Hurricane Damage on St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (1995).




      3.4.2.2. Gas Hazards. Gas explosions and fires can cause fatalities. Containers and tanks can be
      displaced by winds and floods. Compressed gas tanks and dr ums carrying chemicals are often
      found in facilities. These containe rs can easily penetrate buildi ng walls as they are moved about
      by high winds and flood waters. Be alert for leaking gas from tanks or ruptured utility lines, and
      pay particular attention to smells when around buildings. An extremely offensive, garlicky odor is
      usually associated with mercap tans, a class of sulf ur-containing compounds added to natural or
      bottled gas. Even moderate damage can turn deadly when leaking gas is involved. An ozone smell
      or a peculiar odor suggest ing that of weak chlorine may indi cate that there ar e arcing electrical
      wires.
      3.4.2.3. Biological Hazards. Biological hazards can be a problem after an attack. An example of
      this hazard would be a terrorist use of anthrax or smallpox. Natura l biological hazards are also a
      problem for civil engineers conducting emergency repairs after floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
      Hazardous wastes can also be a major problem afte r floods and other natural disasters. Floodwa-
      ters or debris may expose rot ting animal carcasses and sewage that contain pathogenic microbes,
      viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
      3.4.2.4. Animal and Insect Hazards. Live animals and insects can be just as dangerous as the
      effects of dead animals during floods. Animals, re ptiles, and insects often take refuge within
      buildings that have been damaged. Snakes and venomous insects can be especially problematic in
      coastal areas affected by floods and hurricanes.
      3.4.2.5. Asbestos and Lead Hazards. Exposure to asbestos and lead can be a problem, espe-
      cially when the work area has been badly damaged by an explosion or windstorm. Flying debris or
      blast waves can expo se enclosed areas of buildings wher e brittle asbestos wa s previously con-
      cealed. Previously encapsulated asbestos shingles, wallboard, plaster, insulation, or stucco can
      fracture and disperse asbestos fibers (see Figure 3.3.). While recent ba se control and removal
      efforts may limit exposure to asbestos on the in stallation, off-base facilities could cause serious
      exposure problems.
44                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 3.3. Examples of Asbestos Use in Construction.




3.5. Debris Clearing Operations. A major disaster or enemy attack could generate vast amounts of
debris (Figure 3.4.). When clearing debris from work areas and facilities, provide enough room around
the facility to allow access for high-reach trucks, cranes, ladders, or scaffolding that may be required dur-
ing the repair. Make sure utility and telephone cables are removed or completely isolated from the work
area. Wires, cable, metal fences, pipes, and roofs can become energized and cause electrocution if con-
tacted by hot power lines. At times it is safer to remove damaged building parts when it is extremely dan-
gerous to repair the component. This is often the case with heavy hangar doors when dislodged from their
tracks after an explosion or winds torm. Doors of this type normally require special equipment and train-
ing to allow recovery or repair. However, large doors or smaller hangar door sections may be valuable as
temporary replacement wall sections if equipment is available to safely move them. Always clear out haz-
ardous materials and debris, especially wet debris. If immediate repairs cannot be made to walls or roofs
with plywood, protect the area with tarps and/or plastic sheeting. Keep in mind that little adjustments can
make the job much more manageable. For example, cleanup is easier when debris can be tossed through a
blown out wall or window before repairs are made.

Figure 3.4. Debris Clearing After Hurricane Andrew at Homestead AFB (1992).




   3.5.1. Debris Removal Priorities. The priorities for debris removal will va ry depending on base
   mission and type of disaster. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC), or the on scene commander in
   the case of military response to a civilian emergency, assigns debris removal priorities. In the instance
   where damage is limited to a military complex, debris removal personnel should expect the EOC to
   assign the highest priorities to the areas most critical to the mission.
   3.5.2. Debris Removal Resources. As might be anticipated, the type of equipment required to clear
   an area is related to the size and amount of debris. Large pieces of wreckage will necessitate the use of
   heavy equipment such as bulldozer s and cranes. If equipment is s carce, areas with lar ge amounts of
   smaller-size debris may be cleared with hand tools. The following equipment items can be effective in
   debris clearance operations.
      3.5.2.1. Crane. For removing extremely large chunks of debris, a crane may be the only suitable
      piece of equipment. A crane can clear destruction on upper floors of a structure beyond the reach
      of a excavator or front-end loader.
      3.5.2.2. Bulldozer. A bulldozer has the power to push large pieces of debris out of an area and can
      quickly clear large areas of smaller debris (see Figure 3.5.). One skilled dozer operator can clear
      an area that would require several hours of labor if done by hand. However, bulldozers may be in
      short supply if runway repair is required.
46                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 3.5. Debris Clearing After Volcano Eruption in the Philippines (1991).




      3.5.2.3. Front-End Loader. Front-end loaders are especiall y useful in loading debris on dum p
      trucks and other vehicles for removal from the site. They al so are adeq uate for clearing paved
      areas and streets of large amounts of small debris.
      3.5.2.4. Dump Truck. Dump trucks haul debris to disposal sites; however, after an attack, like
      bulldozers, they are essential vehicles in airfi eld damage r epair activities and may be available
      only in limited numbers for debris removal. Other suitable vehicles, such as cargo trucks and trac-
      tor-trailer units, can sometimes substitute for them.
      3.5.2.5. Sweepers. Once larger debris is removed from an area, street sweepers are employed to
      clear smaller items from aircraft operating surfaces and primary access streets. If sweepers are not
      used, small metal items left on ro adways and working areas can cause tire damage to equipment
      involved in cleanup operations. Time spent repairing and replacing flat tires on these vehicles only
      serves to further delay the overall recovery effort.
      3.5.2.6. Towing Devices. Steel cable, chains, hooks, and similar items can be fashioned into tow-
      ing devices for debris removal.
      3.5.2.7. Hand Tools. Various types of ha nd tools are useful in debris cleara nce. Chainsaws and
      axes can be used to cut fallen tr ees into smaller sections for easier removal. Shovels are useful in
      loading smaller debris on vehicles for transport to a disposal site. Brooms and rakes can be used to
      clear surface areas of scattered debris.
      3.5.2.8. Manpower. The amount of CE manpower required to clear an area of debris w ill be
      based upon the availabilit y of the labor -saving equipment discussed in th e previous paragraphs.
      Obviously, if mechanical equipm ent is available, fewer person nel will be needed for cleanup.
      However, personnel assigned to cleanup detail must be skilled in the operation of equipment. Less
      equipment means a greater number of persons required, but their skil l levels need not be as high.
      During recovery operations on a military installa tion, in all likelihood, the EOC will task other
      installation agencies, whose post-attack missions may not be critical to aircraft generation, to sup-
      ply augmenters for debris removal efforts. In such instances, CE personnel will have to supervise
      these individuals during debris removal activities and provide them with necessary tools and pro-
      tective gear such as gloves. Also, remember the augmentees may not be cognizant of the dangers
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                   47


       involved with debris removal nor be trained in explosive ordnance reconnaissance; therefore, their
       taskings should be assigned with these limitations in mind.
   3.5.3. Debris Removal Operations. The debris removal operation is dictated by available equip-
   ment, manpower, and common sense. In the period immediately following a disaster or enemy attack,
   the EOC or on scene commander will make decisions regardi ng how debris removal operations
   should proceed. Debris in nonessential areas will be left until additional re sources become available
   unless it hampers recovery operations or poses a sa fety hazard. Personnel will be assigned debris
   clearance tasks, and equipment will be allocated on a priority basis.
       3.5.3.1. Removal Preparations. This step consists of establis hing debris removal crews, posi-
       tioning equipment f or removal a ctivities, attaching cables and other devices to lar ge pieces of
       debris, breaking or cutting up lar ger debris pi eces for ease of removal, and similar actions. Any
       debris salvageable for recovery operations should be set aside.
       3.5.3.2. Removal and Disposal. Under certain circumstances, the debris may be pushed into cra-
       ters, or prepared holes, and buried. When debris is not buried or otherwise disposed of at the scene
       of destruction, it is moved to a central location where it is loaded into dump trucks or other vehi-
       cles for transport to a remote location for burial or burning. The local environmental flight should
       be consulted before establishing any landfill or debris-burning operation.

3.6. Structural Shoring. Once debris has been removed and safe access is assured, the first concern in
structural repairs should be shoring any weakened areas to restore a minimum degree of structural integ-
rity to the facility. Immediately after an attack or natural disaster, there may not be time to make a detailed
engineering analysis on structural soundness. Instead, rely on field experience, facility appearance, com-
mon sense, and instinct. If a facility appears beyond repair, demolition is probably in order. On the other
hand, once it is determined to "save" a facility and the areas in need of repair have been identified, there
are numerous shoring and patching repair options available. Most require relatively common engineering
materials readily available on base or from off-base vendors. Examples include guying, bracing, jacking,
splinting, tension ties, stitching dogs, and welding.
   3.6.1. Guying. Guys are usually fashioned from wire rope and tensioned by turnbuckles, if available.
   Guy wires are commonly found providing stabilizing support for power poles and tall antennas. Guys
   are normally installed to function in opposing pairs to pr ovide lateral restraint from such forces as
   wind or ice loading. They are particularly effective when damage has been sustained to end walls or
   sidewalls, yet roof members have been essentially untouched. Depending upon the situation, they can
   be installed either inside or outside a facility. The number of pairs required will depend upon the situ-
   ation at hand, based upon the size of the facility being shored and extent of damage sustained.
       3.6.1.1. Although a number of dif ferent wire rope fittings are avai lable commercially, by far the
       most common means of attachme nt of wire rope guys is the use of wire rope clips ( Figure 3.6.).
       When properly installed, clips can provide up to 80 percent of the rope’s strength. The size of the
       wire rope dictates the number of clips used and their spacing. A good rule of thum b is to use a
       minimum of three clips spaced about 3- 3/4 inches apart for 1/2- or 5/8-inch rope, and four clips
       spaced 4- 1/2 inches apart for 3/4- or 7/8-inch rope. These st andard practices prevent kinking of
       the rope and fraying of the cable due to friction when it is connect ed to a turnbuckle or other
       attachment. Also, note how the clips are attached to the rope. The bend of the U-bolt compresses
       the dead end of the rope, whereas the clip compresses the live end of the rope. The live end of the
       rope leads back to the structure that is being guyed.
48                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 3.6. Installation of Wire Rope Clips.




       3.6.1.2. Figure 3.7. illustrates a typical guy wire connectio n to a structure. The wire rope is
       attached to a turnbuckle that is attached to the building. This particular example shows a connec-
       tion to a steel beam using a beamclip. A beam clip is merely a C-shaped connector that can be fab-
       ricated in the shop, if necessary. Other connections to a structure are possible using eye bolts and
       even wrapping the rope around the structural member to be stabilized. Note the use of the 2" x 4"
       board as a brace to prevent the guy wire from twisting as the turnbuckle is tightened. If an external
       guy is to be used, one end of the guy must be connected to a solid, immovable object, commonly
       referred to as a “deadman.” The deadman can be a nearby foundation, another part of the structure
       to be guyed, screw-anchors similar to what linemen use for pole guying, or even a piece of unser-
       viceable equipment, provided it is heavy enough.

Figure 3.7. Typical Guy Wire Connection to a Structure.




       3.6.1.3. As mentioned earlier, guys can be in stalled either inte rnally or externally. Figure 3.8.
       illustrates an internal configuration. Keep in mind that guys must be tightened in pairs and concur-
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                49


      rently to avoid placing too much stress on the stru cture’s frame at any particular point. However ,
      caution must be used to prevent overtightening; th e intent is to take a ll the sag out of the wire
      ropes.

Figure 3.8. Internal Guy System.




      3.6.1.4. The external guy configuration is also installed in pairs (see Figure 3.9.). The major dif-
      ference is instead of using the structure itself as the end points for the guys, external anchors or
      deadmen are used. The stabilization effect is essentially the same.

Figure 3.9. External Guy System.




   3.6.2. Bracing. Braces are compression members usually made of structural steel and heavy timbers
   (Figure 3.10.). Like guys, they can be installed either internally or externally. Depending upon the sit-
   uation, they can be placed in opp osite pairs or used individually . Regardless of the method used,
   ensure adequate connecti ons to the struct ure are made. If not we ll attached, the probability that the
   bracing will slide out of position is great, risk ing further facility damage or collapse. F ootings for
   bracing require the same attention; they must be of sufficient mass so they will not move when force
   is applied. Do not expect a brace that is just shoved into the ground to hold. If necessary , build an
   expedient footing out of rubble, heavy metal, or timber if another part of the structure’s foundation, or
   the foundation of an adjacent building is not available.
50                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 3.10. Typical Brace Configuration.




      3.6.2.1. In most cases, braces will have to be installed in pairs, as shown in Figure 3.11. Like guy
      wires, more than one pair of braces may be required. This will be an on-site decision, generally
      driven by the size of the building being shored and severity of damage incurred.

Figure 3.11. Externally Opposed Braces.




      3.6.2.2. Inte rnal braces are depicted in Figure 3.12. and are als o normally installed in pairs.
      Remember, braces must be firmly attached to the facility to prevent slipping out of position when
      pressure is applied.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 51


Figure 3.12. Internally Opposed Braces.




   3.6.3. Jacking. Guying and bracing usually are used to st abilize a facility from lateral movement,
   keeping it from moving side to side. In some cases, the structural integrity of a facility may be jeopar-
   dized due to damaged structural me mbers that are more directly affected by vertical loads—in other
   words, the effects of gravity. In such situations, there may be deflected or cracked beams/girders that
   need vertical support or damaged co lumns that will eventually need replacement. Shoring jacks help
   provide expedient solutions for these types of problems.
       3.6.3.1. Shoring jack s are placed immediately under the point of deflection, or adjacent to the
       damaged column, and extende d until they are firmly wedged into position ( Figure 3.13.). Any
       debris around the base of the jacks must be cleared away so that the jacks are positioned squarely
       on the facility floor. While not shown in the figure, it is also advisable to brace the jacks once they
       are in position. This can be accomplished by welding two steel plates on the jacks at 90 degrees to
       each other. The plates should have 3/4-inch holes drilled in them. Standard 2" x 4"s are then bolted
       to the plates at one end and nailed at the other end to short pieces of 2" x 4" stock that have been
       attached to the floor of the facility using explosive actuated fasteners or suitable threaded concrete
       fasteners.

Figure 3.13. Shoring Jack Installation.
52                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      3.6.3.2. In most cases, shoring jacks will be in short supply and too valuable to leave in damaged
      facilities. An alternative to leaving the jacks is using timbers as supporting members, as shown in
      Figure 3.14. Wood and timber are extensively used to shore damaged structural components
      because of their availability and economy. A variety of elemen ts can be employed, ranging from
      tree logs, sawed timbers, and utility poles to industrially made items with different cross sections,
      such as planks, boards and beams. The procedures for installing t imbers are similar to jacks, but
      are somewhat more manpower intensive. After clearing debris from the work area, a shoring jack
      is placed immediately adjacent to the location wher e the ti mber is going to go. Th e jack is then
      raised until it reaches the desi red height, or it can no longer be extended. Measure the distance
      from the top of the jack to the floor and cut th e timber 1/2-inch shorter than the measurement.
      Once cut, the timber is raised in to position and several wedges are pounded into the 1/2-inch gap
      between the top of the timber and the damaged b eam; this secures the timb er into position. The
      shoring jack is then lowered and removed. The final step is to brace the timber in two directions,
      similar to what was done earlier with nails and 2" x 4" stock.
      3.6.3.3. Timber shoring can also be used for expedient repair of damaged load-bearing walls with
      openings, such as windows or doors. The use of timber to take the vertical load from a damaged
      masonry pier between tw o windows is shown in Figure 3.15. Note that bracing is used between
      the vertical timbers in each window opening. Th is common construction technique increases the
      efficiency of the timbers by reducing their potential for buckling under any increases in load. Also,
      spreader beams have been placed at the top and bottom of the ti mbers where they meet the win-
      dow frames. These beams spread the vertical load over a larger surface area, decreasing the chance
      of punching through or sh earing the window frame. Spreader beams can be made from planks,
      boards, or even steel plates. The wedges shown are used to secure the vertical timbers in position.
      One final note concerning the us e of timbers; if heavy timbers are not readily available, be
      resourceful. Other facilities that have been damaged beyond repair may contain salvageable tim-
      bers. Also, consider nailing, gluing, bolting, or banding 2" x 8" or 2" x 10" stock together to form
      usable substitutes.

Figure 3.15. Support of Damaged Load Bearing Walls With Openings.




   3.6.4. Splinting. Another method of providing basic structural integrity involves the splinting of col-
   umns, particularly the reinforced concrete type, that have not been seriously damaged but show signs
   of cracking or minor fracturing.
       3.6.4.1. One te chnique involves "sandwiching" the dama ged column between two steel plates
       connected by threaded rods. The plates have sl otted holes so they can be fitted to various sized
       columns. In this repair, splints are placed around the column at the location of the crack(s) to pro-
       vide a lateral restraining force (see Figure 3.16.). If cracks are at several locations on the column,
       multiple splints can be used. This repair is preferable to column replacement when a damaged col-
       umn is still capable of carrying a significant load, because it requires less manpower and is a faster
       repair. However, if a column is severely damaged and appears n ear the point of collapse, column
       replacement using jacks or timber supports should be used.

Figure 3.16. Steel Plate Splint.




       3.6.4.2. A second splinting technique involves placing angle iron at the corners of a damaged col-
       umn and connecting the angles with steel straps (see Figure 3.17.). Steel plates should be provided
54                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


        at the ends of the angles to a void load-bearing problems at the bottom of the column whe re it is
        attached to the slab.

Figure 3.17. Use of Steel Angles at Corners of a Damaged Column.




        3.6.4.3. A third method of splinting again uses angle iron at the corners of the damaged columns,
        but the angle irons are joined together with wire rope or similar cabling (see Figure 3.18.). One
        end of the wire rope is welded to the top of one of the angles, and the rope is tightly wound around
        the column. The other end of the wirerope is welded to one of the angles at the base of the column.
        Additional welds may be made at various points to better secure the cable to the angle iron.

Figure 3.18. Use of Wound Spiral to Repair Column.




     3.6.5. Tension Ties. Some facilities at overseas locations are essentially all reinforced concrete con-
     struction. In such cases, slabs and beams will be of unitary construction, meaning that they are
     formed, reinforced, and poured as a single unit. After an attack or na tural disaster, some of the slabs
     and beams may develop minor cracki ng. Tension ties are a method of providing a compressive force
     on the slabs and beam s that aids in th e prevention of furt her cracking (see Figure 3.19.). For slab
     repair, a thr eaded rod is anchored to the beams on both sides of the cra cked area of the s lab. For
     beams, anchor plates are bolted to the beam on both sides of the crack and a threaded rod is placed
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                55


   parallel to the beam, connecting the two anchor plates. Tightening the nut s on the threaded rod
   induces a compressive force into the beam or slab, thereby restricting further cracking.

Figure 3.19. Tension Ties.




   3.6.6. Stitching Dogs. Yet another method of restoring structur al integrity into a cracked concrete
   slab is the use of "stitching dogs." These dogs are steel bars, normally rebar , formed into a U-shape
   and placed over the crack, rather like staples, as shown in Figure 3.20. The dogs should be of random
   length and variabl y spaced al ong the crack. The hol es that the dogs are inse rted into must be well
   grouted to ensure a tight fit.

Figure 3.20. Stitching Dogs.




   3.6.7. Welding. Welding steel sections back into place to restore the stability of a steel framework is
   a common shoring meth od. Welding repairs will usua lly be limited to a relati vely small section of a
   facility. To attempt more than this as an expedient repair will take too much time and ef fort. For the
   most part, such repairs will involve erecting scaffolding, positioning steel plate and structural shapes,
   and accomplishing the welding.

3.7. Expedient Repair of Damaged Facilities. Once basic structural integrity has been restored through
structural shoring, steps can be taken to protect personnel and essential equipment from the elements. This
56                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


usually involves patching hol es in walls, roofs, and floors. Befo re expending resour ces to patch these
holes, determine if ur gent, immediate patching is required. Local climate and prevaili ng weather are
major factors. If the weather i s warm and rainfall is not a detrimental factor , some openings may be left
exposed temporarily without significant impact. On the other hand, if patching is required, there are sev-
eral different types of materials and expedient techniques that can be used.
     3.7.1. Roof Repairs. It is important to recognize that some roofs and support sy stems perform vari-
     ous functions. While some are simply a weather cover, others act as part of a structural frame or dia-
     phragm. Analyze failed sections and holes in the roof to determine the needs for eme rgency repair.
     Initial efforts must focus on safety. Ensure that bracing and shoring are adequate. Secondly, eliminate
     hazardous hanging materials (i.e., lights, wires, cable trays, mechanical ducts, etc.) below the roof and
     assess the extent of damage to the roof support system. The third and any subsequent efforts are to
     cover the hole, replace damaged sections of roof covering, and strengthen the support system as nec-
     essary.
        3.7.1.1. Damage Assessment. Once the emergency has subsided, inspect both the top and bottom
        portions of the roof to make su re that the areas are sound. Be aw are that even though roof struc-
        tural members and the deck are intact, emergency repairs may still be needed. One example is that
        even after hurricane winds subside, persistent rains can cause severe damage or building collapse.
        Many roofs are covered with insulation boards. High winds can leave the decking intact but blow
        off felts and expose insu lation boards. Some insula tion boards soa k up rain like a sponge. The
        additional dead load from the water-soaked insulation, as well as ponding of trapped water, can
        collapse structures, especially warehouses and large hangars. If the supporting members are dam-
        aged, shore and brace the trusses and repair damaged supports.
        3.7.1.2. Fire-Damaged Roofing Components. Fire-damaged wood structural members must be
        checked for structural integrity. Scrape the ch arred wood off the member in various sections to
        check for the extent of damage. Fire-damaged wo od can remain in place if it retains most of its
        structural integrity. The amount of remaining strength will depend on the extent of charring or
        exposure to high temperatures. There is no defini tive, in-place test to determine if fire-damaged
        wood is still structurally sound. An engineering test and analysis are normally required. If the
        structure was modified af ter construction, such as installing an overhead rail, then a structural
        analysis is needed to determine if fire-damaged members are adequate. Charred wood should only
        be used if at least 90 percent of the wood cross section is not charred; and charring itself does not
        extend more than 1/16 inch into the wood. Emer gency repair of fire-damaged trusses normally
        involves scraping off the charred material and sistering a similar piece of wood onto the damaged
        section, splinting the damaged area between two sound pieces of wood, using gusset plates (see
        Figure 3.21.), or using a combination of these procedures.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  57


Figure 3.21. Gusset Plate Repairs.




      3.7.1.3. Weather Tightness. Once the structural integrity is assured you can begin returning the
      weather tightness to the structure. From an expedient aspect, it will be difficult to completely seal
      off the building from weather, but most of the i ll effects of bad weather can be kept out. Keep in
      mind that many roof systems are interchangeable . An example is that metal and wood roof sys-
      tems can be used with wood, metal, or precast concrete buildings. Sheets of plywood can be nailed
      over the opening. Sheet metal, plas tic sheeting, and even canvas can be used in lieu of plywood.
      For flat roofs, sheets of plywood can be fabricated into a patch a bit larger than the hole and nailed
      in place. If the roof is concrete, explosive actuated fasteners or suitable threaded concrete fasteners
      could be used to att ach the plywood patch. If av ailable, rolled roofing ca n then be nailed to the
      patch for added weather protection. Figure 3.22. shows personnel providi ng expedient roof pro-
      tection, in the form of plastic sheeting, on a h ousing unit at Homestead AFB after Hurricane
      Andrew’s assault in 1992. Once any covering is in place, positive drainage must be maintained to
      divert rainwater and prevent po nding. This could involve stacki ng sandbags above the repair to
      divert the water or changing the sl ope at the repair itself. For lar ger areas, raise the center of the
      tarp or sheeting to divert water.

        3.7.1.4. Metal Roof Repair. Metal roofs are repaired the same way as metal wall systems. When
        possible, remove the dama ged surface material and replace wi th new or cannibalized material.
        Overlap the good metal roofing wi th the replacement metal roofi ng by at least a matching co rru-
        gation or rib section. Catch as many purlins as possible for support and t ack in place with sheet
        metal screws along the edges. Use caulk or construction adhesive on the upslope side for addi-
        tional water protection. For large holes where purlins are too badly damaged to allow fast repair,
        and where reuse and imme diate coverage is required, expediently pa tch the hole w ith similar
        materials, but provide at least 24 inches of overlap to distribute loadings. Add purlins later as time
        allows.
     3.7.2. Wall Repairs. For the most part, wall repairs are similar to roof repairs, except they should be
     somewhat easier since the requirement to lift all materials to ro of height is eliminated. Damage to
     walls can be c overed with standa rd materials such as plywood, sh eet metal, tarpaulins, and plastic
     sheets (Figure 3.23.). Before beginning a wall repair , ensure the structure is st rong enough to with-
     stand pounding from additional winds when using tarps or plastic sheeting. Shore and brace the struc-
     ture as described previously in paragraph 3.6., if required. Secured tarps can provide good protection
     from rain and can withstand greate r wind loads than plastic sheeting. Note: Usually large tarps and
     high-strength plastic sheets must be special ordered but are generally available as a construction mate-
     rial item. Coordinate with federal and state emergency management officials or MAJCOM personnel
     to obtain large tarps and sheeting. For overseas humanitarian deployments, the US Agency for Inter-
     national Development (USAID), Office of Foreign Disa ster Assistance (OFDA) ca n often provide
     special sheeting for shelters.

      3.7.2.1. Plastic Sheeting Protective Techniques. When plastic sheeting is used to cover a hole,
      size the nailing strips and plastic based on the si ze of the hole. Normally , the required materials
      are: nailing strips that are at least 1" x 2" furring strips (or 12-gauge metal strips that are 1" wide),
      plastic sheeting that is at least 6-mil plastic or reinforced sheeting (10-mil plastic or plastic with
      woven fiber is preferable), and fasteners of sufficient length to penetrate the sheathing (or at least
      1- 1/2 inches into the stud). Avoid black, recycled plastic sheeting if the repair will be exposed to
      harsh elements for more than a month due to the hi gh rate of deteriorati on. Use nails, staples, or
      screws in wood and self- tapping metal screws to fasten into metal siding. To accomplish the
      repair, wrap plastic sheeting around nailing strips and nail the strips around the hole as a rectangu-
      lar frame to provide a tight plastic surface. When possible, provide 6 to 12 inches of plastic over-
      lap around the edges of the hole. For holes in plywood (or other nailable substrate) cut the nailing
      strips 12 to 24 inches wider than the hole and cut the plastic sheeting yet another 24 inches wider.
      For holes in a non-nailable substrate, locate the nailing strips over the closest undamaged
      wall-framing studs. Cut the plastic sheeting 24 inches wider than the nailing strip. Wrap 12 inches
      of plastic around both the top and bottom nailing strips. When installed, the plastic should be flat
      against the building with the wrapped nailing strip on the outside. Position the strips and fasten in
      place to the wall (or studs for non-nailable surfaces), stretching tight vertically (see Figure 3.24.).
      Note that both plastic sheets and tarps only provide protection against the elements. More substan-
      tial structural repairs are often necessary.
          3.7.2.1.1. If there are no intermedia te studs to nail into for s upport, use adhesive and tape to
          secure the top and bottom edges. If there are damaged intermediate studs, sister new studs to
          the damaged studs to allow nailing strips to be fastened.
          3.7.2.1.2. Repair any miss-cuts or tears in the plastic with flexible duct tape. Use caulk to fill
          in larger gaps between the nailing strips and wall surface. For metal skin walls with deforma-
          tions, use expanding foam to fill in gaps as necessary between the metal and the nailing strip.

       3.7.2.2. Emergency Wall Repairs on Wood Frame Structures. Wood-framed walls are ty pi-
       cally the easiest wall systems to repair. Depending on the size of the hole, the repair may be made
       by replacing the damage d area in kind, repl acing a wall section, or providing a structural or
       non-structural patch. Explosions, projectiles, or debris can create similar damage in wood-framed
       walls. The repair requirements will vary by the size of hole, location, a nd wall function. Smaller
       holes with little damage to framing members can usually be fixed with a sheathing material (ply-
       wood, fiberglass, metal sheet, etc.) or plastic sheeting. Plywood or Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
       sheets are normally used. Holes larger than 3 feet in diameter usually require some reframing and
       new plywood/OSB. Still larger holes usually require the wall s ection to be replaced with new
       framing and plywood/OSB on the outside of the wall. If the damaged wall is a shearwall, a cross
       wall that provides lateral support, or a load-bearing wall, a structural frame wall having plywood
       on both sides may be required.
          3.7.2.2.1. Small Hole Repair. Use plywood or OSB sheathing to repair small holes (less than
          3 feet in diameter) when the substrate is nailable. If possible, provide at least a 6-inch overlap
          over the undamaged siding. If mo re weather protection is need ed than provided by plastic
          sheeting, use sheathing. When the substrate is not nailable, cut the sheathing to fit between the
          closest studs on both sides of the hole. Position sheathing over the hole and fasten into a stud
          or nailable substrate. Be sure to caulk alongthe edge of the sheathing before fastening in place.
          3.7.2.2.2. Large Hole Repair. Remove damaged framing for larger holes, but be particularly
          careful around any load-bearing joists, beams, or wall top plates. Replace damaged or missing
          framing and blocking. Where sheathing is missi ng and framing is damaged, the wall usually
          requires repair or replacement of damaged framing and new sheathing. After shoring and brac-
          ing adjoining walls and ceiling, replace any missing studs and top and bottom plates. Attempt
          to maintain normal stud spacing at 16 inches on center. For partially split or gouged studs (i.e.,
          60 to 80 percent of the damaged stud cross section remains) and where some sheathing is still
          present, sister another stud to the damaged stud to strengthen it. Apply construction adhesive
          between the damaged stud and new stud for addi tional strength. To add strength to walls that
          must withstand additional wind lo ads, apply construction adhesi ve on stud surfaces and then
          nail the members together.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 61


        3.7.2.2.3. Sheathing Repair. One emergency repair where sheathing is required is during
        repair of a structural wall, particularly where shearwalls have failed. As seen in Figure 3.25.,
        shear failure in plywood can be either localized to a small area that appears as a tearing pattern
        in the plywood, or invol ve a complete fa ilure where t he sheathing itself is dislodged. When
        sheathing is entirely missing, add new material as necessary. To do this, remove damaged wall
        covering and/or sheathing back to the nearest exposed stud. Apply 1/2-inch nominal sheathing
        to the studs for most walls. However, for shearwalls, use 3/4-inch plywood when available. If
        additional nailing surface is needed for securing the new sheathing, add another stud to the
        exposed stud. When the wall must act as a hold down for the roof, nail the sheathing at 6
        inches on center vertically and horizontally, except on the top and bottom plates where nailing
        is at 4 inches on center . Be sure to block the wall at sheathing edges if it is taller than the
        sheathing. For addition al strength and less nailing, appl y construction adhesive (meeting
        requirements of APA AFG-01) on framing members near edges. Also, if the repair will be
        exposed to hea vy rains, cover with plastic sheeting and/or ca ulk butt joints. For shearwalls
        wider than 4 fe et, apply plywood horizontally on both s ides of the wall. When deali ng with
        shearwalls between floor levels, if possible do not align plywoo d butt joints with any of the
        floor joints. Instead, stagger end joints and block all edges that require nailing. For other walls,
        except shearwalls, apply sheath ing vertically or horizontally per standard nailing procedures.
        Note: Some failed shearwalls may have been constructed with vertic al sheathing. If new
        building standards require three-by (3x) lumber at edges, consider running the plywood hori-
        zontally and block at all hori zontal edges. Bloc king provides additional stif fness support to
        shearwalls.
     3.7.2.3. Emergency Wall Repairs on Masonry Structures. Emergency repair of masonry walls
     is usually more time-consuming, strenuous, and equipment and material sensitive than emergency
     repairs to wood walls. Masonry walls are usually block and/or brick; however, masonry building-
     scomposed of rock and mo rtar walls may be encountered at some overseas locations. Use extra
     caution when performing emergency repairs on masonry walls. Failed masonry walls are normally
     more dangerous to work with than most other walls for seve ral reasons. This added danger is
     caused by factors such as the increased dead weight of the building materials, the brittle nature of
     masonry products, and the limited ab ility to determine the actual extent of damage by simply
     viewing the apparent damage. In fact, it may not be known how or even if the wall is reinforced or
     what is holding the cracked areas together.
        3.7.2.3.1. Damage Assessment Considerations. Consider the following when assessing
        masonry wall damage. While a crack may appear to be small, the wall may still fail if there is
        inadequate reinforcing steel to hold the crack together . Reinforcing steel is us ually in select
        cells. Determine if a crack crosses reinforced cells and if the cells are still solid. If the cells do
        not contain reinforcing steel, determine if the crack is being momentarily held in place by fric-
        tion from dead loads. If such is the case, a small shift in the weight of a structure or ground
        tremors (i.e., seismic shaking from nearby move ment of heavy equipmen t) can cause releas e
        and catastrophic collapse. Keep in mind that re moval of debris, rain, snow , or wind can also
        cause shifting in multistory structures and subsequent collapse. Two additional factors associ-
        ated with masonry walls that must be assessed include determining if the wall can be shored to
        maintain lateral support when pilasters are damaged and deter mining if the wall’s floor/roof
        attachments are damaged or have failed.
62                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008

          3.7.2.3.2. Masonry Wall Variations. Emergency re pairs to mas onry s tructures usuall y
          depend on whether the wall is a structural wall or a non-stru ctural infill wall ( Figure 3.26.).
          Structural walls can be infill walls that provide lateral support or shearwalls built into a con-
          crete or steel moment frame building. Also, structural wall s can be supporting walls (and
          pilasters) that provide lateral and vertical support for the roof and other floors. Non-structural
          walls are usually constructed as infill walls that have wall ties to flexible frames, or they may
          use tracks or of fset walls that extend past the exterior frame and wrap around it without pro-
          viding lateral support. If a structural wall is damaged, emergency shoring and bracing may be
          required along with repair . Once strengthened, th e wall should be closed up with injection
          grout or some other means of confinement as discussed in this chapter. Emergency repairs for
          non-structural walls depend on the da mage. Typical repairs usually involve rem oving and
          replacing damaged material and patching the open area with appropriate sheathing.

Figure 3.26. Damaged Brick Infill Wall.




      3.7.2.4. Small Hole Repair in Structural Walls. The simplest emergency repair to a masonry
      wall is repairing a small hole that has been punched through the wall involving no damage to the
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               63


      rest of the structure. Usually , this will occu r from debris being thrown through the wall from an
      exterior blast or high winds. The repair method for small punched holes in masonry structures var-
      ies according to the type of wall involved. Th e emergency repair method for small holes cleanly
      punched through a non-structural masonry wall, where only a few blocks are missing, is to simply
      fasten a patch of wood sheathing over the hole. Cut a sheet of sheathing (plywood or OSB) that is
      large enough to extend several in ches past the next unda maged blocks' grout joints around the
      hole. When positioning the patch on the outside of the wall, apply construction adhesive to the
      edges of the sheathing. Next, drill holes through the sheathing and into the undamaged grout joint
      (or a block with a filled cell); secure the shea thing in place with bolts , washers, and lead or
      expanding anchors. Do not use th is repair method if there are loose blocks or cracks around the
      hole; rather, tie the wall together with sheathing on both sides. When only a block or two are miss-
      ing, it is usually easier to knock out the damage d material, square up the opening to size, and fill
      the void using new blocks and a fast-setting cement or epoxy grout mortar (see Figure 3.27.).

Figure 3.27. Correcting Damage With New Material.




      3.7.2.5. Large Hole Repair in Structural Walls. Structural masonry walls with lar ger holes
      (i.e., larger than about five blocks high and four blocks wide) or failed sections are very dangerous
      (see Figure 3.28.). It is usually better to shore and br ace the roof or floors above the failed area
      and then work somewhere else in the facility. However, moving to another section of the building
      should not be attempted until th e extent of the structural dama ge has be en thoroughly analyzed.
      Failed sections in one part of a masonry building can often lead to a progressive collapse in the
      rest of the structure when wind, rain, vi bration, or shifting loads are involved. Figure 3.29. is an
      excellent example of a progressive structural failure after an earthquake. There are few options for
      making emergency repairs for larger holes in structural masonry wa lls. For a wartime repair of a
      larger hole in a shearwall or support wall, shore and brace the area around the wall, square up the
      hole, provide necessary bracing, and cover the hole. Leave the shoring in place if there will be
      continued blast or seismic shaking; cribbing is more stable than using a single support post. After
      shoring the area, square the hole, brace the hole with double 2" x 8" headers and side braces, and
      use double 2" x 4" cross bracing. Cover over e ach side with 1 or 2 layers of 3/4-inch plywood
64                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      (depending on the expected shear loads). Cut sheets to run horizontally, and allow at least 8 inches
      of overlap onto good masonry . Position sheets and drill holes th rough the masonry to align with
      the holes in the plywood. Tie together with threaded rods, wa shers, and nuts. When possible, use
      2" x 4"s between opposing bolts to prevent the tie rods, washers, and nuts from tearing through the
      plywood.

      3.7.2.6. Structural Wall Confining. When broken blocks cannot be replaced for a small hole in
      a structural masonry wall, confin ing the wall is a safe option. Th is repair should be limited to
      small holes with 7 or 8 blocks missing and where there is no extensive cracking around the hole.
      Use at least 4- or 3-gauge sheet steel (i.e., about 1/4-inch thick) on both sides of the hole. Cut the
      steel to provide about 8 inches of overlap b etween the steel and the undamage d block. Drill
      through the sheet steel about 4 in ches from t he edges in the corn ers and midpoint on each side.
      Next, drill through the masonry so it will align with the holes in the sheet steel. Next, run a bead
      of construction adhesive around the hole on both sides before fa stening the sheet steel together
      with threaded rods, washers, and nuts (see Figure 3.30. graphic sequence).

      3.7.2.7. Large Hole Repair in Non-Structural Walls. Non-structural walls with lar ge holes
      (i.e., up to about five blocks high and four blocks wide) can usually be repaired with a sheet of ply-
      wood, a couple of 2" x 8" braces , and a header. Knock out or sa w-cut loose block on the top and
      sides of the hole to provide fairly straight edges (i.e., square up the hole). Cut one or two 2" x 8"s
      for a header to fit the top of the squared hole (if overseas and metric blocks are used, use a wider
      header or add 3/4-inch plywood cut as wide as the block and nailed to the top of the header). Next,
      cut two side braces about 1/8 inch longer than the distance from the bottom of the hole to the bot-
      tom of the header and place one end of the braces at the bottom of the hole on each side and drive
      the top of the braces in place to hold up the header . Once in position, toe- nail the top of each
      header. Lastly, cut sheathing and fasten in place in the same manner as described for covering a
      small hole. If desired, and for add itional rigidity, apply 1/2-inch sheetrock on the inside facing.
      Additional expedient masonry wall repair procedure options, such as pressure injected epoxy and
      structural steel bracing, are provided in the Expedient Structural Repair Course on the Air Force
      Civil Engineer Virtual Learning Center web site at https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil.
      3.7.2.8. Crack Repairs on Reinforced Walls. When replacing a reinforced masonry or concrete
      wall is not feasible, an a cceptable repair is to f ill the cracks with a struct ural grout or epoxy. In
      most cases, epoxy injection works best (see Attachment 2, Crack Repair Using Epoxy Injection
      Method). The epoxy injection method can be used to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 inch if the
      reinforcing steel has not been stre ssed beyond its elastic limit. If necessary, seal the top of the
      crack with the same epoxy troweled in place or use metal plates. This type of repair generally con-
      sists of drilling holes at close intervals along the cracks, in some cases installing entry ports, and
      injecting the epoxy under pressure . However, for small cracks, cartridges can be used with hand-
      guns (see Figure 3.31.). For mass ive structures, an alterna tive procedure consists of drilling a
      series of holes, usually 7/8 inch in diameter, that intercept the crack at a number of locations. Typ-
      ically, holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals.
66                                                                         AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 3.31. Epoxy Application.




     3.7.3. Window Repair. In an expedient sen se, there are no t too many fixes fo r damaged windows.
     Attempting to replace glass is much too long an ef fort and during a conflict or earthquake, is almost
     self-defeating since it will probably all be lost again in the next attack or aftershock.
        3.7.3.1. Repair Options. Normally, placing plywood over the window opening is sufficient. If
        the facility must remain occupied and requires da ylight, then rigid plasti c sheets can be used to
        maintain a visible opening. Plexiglas sheets ar e usually used for this repair . Use polycarbonate
        sheets if additional protection is required. Either way, it is important to first bond the rigid sheet to
        the building using construction adhesive, and then clamp it to the building using a simple wooden
        or metal frame and screws.
        3.7.3.2. Repair Procedures. Do not drill or fasten through the sheets if there will be additional
        blasts or high winds. In stead, hold them in place with a wooden (or metal) frame. Cut the rigid
        sheets 2 inches wider and taller than the opening. Use 2" x 4"s or 2" x 6"s to frame the opening,
        sizing the frame to fit outside the dimension of the opening. Once the frame is configured, apply a
        continuous bead of construction adhesive to the edge of the opening to set and hold the sheet in
        place. Sandwich the rigid sheet between the building and the frame and clamp in place by fasten-
        ing the frame to the building with screws or other appropriate (removable) fasteners.
     3.7.4. Door Repair. Damaged door openings that must remain accessible for entry and exit are usu-
     ally shored and framed to keep the opening safe . To protect the opening against further damage from
     wind, weather, or blast forces, use expedient measures such as stacking sandbags at the opening. This
     is especially important when the wall is a structural wall and has been damaged.
        3.7.4.1. Repair Priorities. The first priority for an emergency repair of a door opening in a struc-
        tural wall is to maintain the wall's structural integrity. Shore the opening at the top, bottom, and
        sides. Use spreaders at the top and bottom of the door to take the place of cross bracing. If blast or
        wind protection is required, use sandbags stacked at the entrance and along walls (see Figure
        3.32.).
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               67


Figure 3.32. Sandbagged Entrance.




      3.7.4.2. Weather Tightness. If weather tightness and further strengthening are required, con-
      struct a separate door. Tack the door framework to the opening to avoid causing additional stress
      on any weakened structures. Make sure the conn ections to the building are relatively weak. Rely
      on sandbag berms or other expedient berm structures for protection against blast.
      3.7.4.3. Sliding/Roller Doors. Hangars, warehouses, and maintenance facilities are often critical
      facilities. Other than for hardened aircraft shelters, these types of fac ilities have doors that are
      quite vulnerable to exterior blast and high wind s. Typical hangar-type doors are bottom rolling
      (sliding doors), which have top guide tracks and bottom rollers on support tracks. Different types
      of large doors can be used on large facilities when blast protection is not a problem or when snow
      and ice are a problem. Lightwei ght doors are often used on newe r permanent or deployable han-
      gars and warehouses. Deployable hangars and some newer hangars, maintenance facilities, and
      warehouses may have vertical lift, clamshell, canopy, or folded-fabric lift (panel) doors.
      3.7.4.4. Heavy Metal Door Repair. Full metal, bottom-rolling doors that have come loose from
      their tracks usually cannot be expediently repaire d. Limit repairs to patchi ng holes. If the rollers
      and top tracks are not damaged, some doors can be jacked up and pushed back on tracks. The fol-
      lowing failures require door removal and/or track repair: (1) rolling doors come loose from the top
      rail; (2) the doors have fallen in ward from the top when wind or blast pressures have racked the
      building or collapsed the metal overhead track sy stem, (3) high winds or floods lifted or pushed
      the doors off the bottom track; (4) the door ha s hung up on the upper track and torqued the wall
      and supporting framework. Warning: When dealing with very lar ge metal rolling doors such as
      those on ha ngars, emergency repair is usually not feasible excep t by tra ined heavy repair teams
      supported by cranes and other special equipment. Also, check on the door and framing specifica-
      tions before considering the repair of top rail s using standard shapes of A36 (36,000-psi) steel.
      Large steel hangar door structures often use 50,000-ps i steel and special fittings. If an A36 struc-
      tural shape is used and the orig inal specification was for 50,000-psi st eel, the door framing and
      tracks will be grossly undersized for the load.

      3.7.4.5. Lightweight Metal and Fabric Door Repair. Because of their de sign, lighter weight
      doors, such as vertical lift, clamshell, canopy, and folded-fabric lift doors, can usually be repaired
      in an emergency without the use of heavy equipm ent. Two deployable fa bric door examples are
      shown in Figure 3.33. The first example is a B-1 hangar th at uses folded-fabric lift doors with
      lightweight framing door guides. In the clamshell hangar example, lightweight framing and tubing
      are used as the superstructure.

Figure 3.33. Lightweight Fabric Hangar.




          3.7.4.5.1. Structural Repairs. Bent framing on these types of structures can usually be
          straightened, bolstered with additional pipi ng, or replaced with similar common materials.
          Also, damaged tracks can often be straightened or detached/cut out and replaced using similar
          materials.
          3.7.4.5.2. Surface Skin Repairs. Holes in lightweight rigid co mposite panels are usually
          repaired with a patch of 14-gauge sheet metal fastened over the hole. Use construction adhe-
          sive and sheet metal screws, screw-in shield s, or expanding sleeve anchors, whichever is
          appropriate. Fabric panel system s can usually be quickly repair ed. Coated fabric systems are
          used with many port able shelters, deployable hangars, and maintenance shelters. The most
          common coating is PVC-coated polyester. It is used with many clamshell-type structures and
          fabric hangars. Larger structures may u se a tensile fabric design. Emergency repairs must
          maintain structural integrity of these larger structures. Emergency fabric repair kits are usually
          available from the manufacturer . If one is not available, cons ult with Fuel System Mainte-
          nance or Fabrication shops, as some of their shop methods and equipment are similar to man-
          ufacturers' recommended methods and equipment. Depending on whether the material is a
          cover fabric or tensile fabric, there are usua lly two repair methods for fixing pierced fabric
          sections in walls and overhead doors: the Fabric Clamp and PVC-Coated Polyester Fabric sys-
          tem.
          3.7.4.5.3. Fabric Clamp Repair. Fabric clamp system s are most often used for folded fab-
          ric-lift doors ( Figure 3.34.). The steps involved begin with loosening scre ws on the fab-
          ric-clamp strips above and belo w the torn section. Next, cut th e repair fabric large enough to
          overlap the t ear by at least 2 inches on each side. Once t he repair patch is proper ly sized,
          extend the repair fabric under and between th e two clamp strips . Then, retighten the clamp
          strips, trim off excess material, and tack down the fabric edges with adhesive or double-sided
          tape. Lastly, trim off or glue together any l oose fabric that is under the patch and around the
          tear.

Figure 3.34. Typical Fabric Clamp Repair.




   3.7.5. Repair of PVC-Coated Polyester Fabric Systems. These systems are used with several gen-
   erations of shelters and hangars. T he manufacturer for each system usually provides repair criteria;
   however, if criteria are not readily available, follow the general guidance here. Repairs usually require
   either a heat-welde d patch (with either a heat gun or bonding iron and a roller) or a solvent-welded
   patch (with solvent). For coated fabric systems that have a slick, Teflon-like coating on the exterior
   surface, patch the hole from the inside using a piece of fabric and adhesive. As with the Fabric Clamp
   method, work with Fuel System Maintenance and Fabrication shop personnel to repair these types of
   fabrics. Begin the repair by cutting and positioning afabric patch over the torn section. For tensile fab-
   ric systems that distribute load, cut the patch to extend at least 12 inches past each damaged edge,
   unless the manufacturer has othe r recommendations. For simple cover systems, cut the patch to
   extend 2 to 4 inches past each damaged edge. For heat-welded patches, provide heat between the fab-
   ric and the patch. Hold a piece of plywood on the inside surface and use the roller on the outside of the
   heated patch to roll the material together. Roll out air bubbles, keeping the temperature just under the
   point where smoke develops on the patch or the two fabrics will melt. When done properly, the result
   should look similar to that in Figure 3.35.

Figure 3.35. Typical Heat/Solvent -Welded Patch Repair.




   3.7.6. Cement and Sealer Fabric Repair. Other fabric-based deployabl e structures, such as the
   TEMPER tent and Medium/Small Shelters, are all sh eathed with a fabric outer covering over rigid
   framing. When dam age to these units occurs, it is not always pos sible or practical to make sewn
   repairs. This is especially true when a tent is erected and the damage is minor. If a hole or tear is fairly
   small and it is not located near a seam, an edge, or hardware, a cemented patch or dab of adhesive can
70                                                                         AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


     be used to repair the damage. When a stovepipe shield is slightly damaged, sealer can be used to repair
     the damage. There are specific repair kits available that have been developed by each product manu-
     facturer to correct minor damage. T ypical repair procedures for minor holes and tears are described
     below.
        3.7.6.1. Small Hole Adhesive Repair. A dab of adhesive is used on a hole in a tent that measures
        1/8 inch or less across. To seal a small hole, first use a wire brush to clean the area around the hole
        and raise the nap of the fabric. Next, simply use a small stick or paddle to put a dab of adhesive on
        the hole, working it into the fabr ic while being sure to bridge the damage with the adhesive to
        ensure a complete seal.
        3.7.6.2. Large Hole/Tear Adhesive Repair. Cemented patches are used to cover holes and tears
        that are more than 1/8 inch, but less than 4 3/4 inches across. Putting a cemented patch on a tent is
        similar to patching a bicycle tire. To apply a cemented patch (seeFigure 3.36.), first obtain the fol-
        lowing items (if not included in the repair kit): a ruler, chalk, wire brush, flat board, paddle, roller,
        tent-patching adhesive, and a piece of clean matching canvas. Ne xt, measure the damage and cut
        a round patch from a piece of matching canvas, making sure the patch is large enough to extend 3/
        4 inch beyond the damage in all directions. Th en, place the board under the damage for support.
        On an erect tent, another individua l will be needed inside the tent to hold the board against the
        damage. Center the patch over the damage and draw a circle with chalk around the patch, then
        remove the patch. Use a wire brush to clean the fabric and raise the nap of the material inside the
        circle and the patch itself. Now, position the patch facedown over the damage and use the paddle
        to coat the patch evenly with adhesive. Let the adhesive overlap the edge of the patch a little so
        that it forms a circle on the tent. Next, remove the patch, flatten out the canvas and the edges of the
        hole or tear as much as possible and fill in the circle with a coating of adhesive. Let the adhesive
        dry, then apply a second coat of adhesive to the tent and to the patch. Now, wait 10 to 15 minutes
        for the adhesive to become tacky (test the patch by touching it). The patch is ready to use when it
        is sticky. Once the adhesive reaches this point, center the patch face up on top of the damage and
        press the two sticky surfaces together. Use a roller to press the excess adhesive and the air bubbles
        from under the patch. Roll first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. If no roller is
        available, use the can of adhesive as a roller. Be sure to tightly seal the can first. Lastly, dip the tip
        of one gloved finger in the adhesive and ru n the finger around th e edge of the pa tch to seal the
        edge with adhesive and prevent fraying. Note: With some fabric (e.g., TEMPER tents), large tears
        must be sewn together prior to theapplication of adhesive or sealer. Caution: Seam sealer and sol-
        vent are extremely flammable and contain toxic fumes. Do not sm oke or use seam sealer/solvent
        near an open flame. Use seam sealer and solven t with goggles and gloves. When indoors, wear a
        respirator, or use in an open, well ventilated area, aw ay from sources of combustion. Death or
        severe injury may result from explosion or fire. Inhalation of fumes may cause toxic sickness.

      3.7.6.3. Sealer Repairs for Small Holes and Tears in Stovepipe Shields. Holes and tears in
      stovepipe shields can be repaired with sealer. The kind of repair used depends on the extent of the
      damage, as described below. A layer of silicone sealer is used to repair holes or tears that measure
      2 inches or less across. To make this repair, obtain cleaning materials, a dry rag, a can of silicone
      sealer (MIL-A-46106), and a pa ddle. Then clean and dry the da maged area thoroughly. Next,
      spread a 1/16-inch-thick layer of sealer on both sides of the shield, covering the hole or tear and at
      least 1/2 inch on each s ide of the damage. Smooth out the layer as evenly as po ssible. Brace the
      shield so that the sealer does not touch anything while it is wet, and allow the repair to dry for 4
      hours on a sunny day with low humidity or 6 hours on a humid day. Do not move the tent while the
      sealer is drying.
      3.7.6.4. Sealer Repairs for Large Holes and Tears in Stovepipe Shields. A p a t c h a t t a c h e d
      with silicone sealer is used to repair holes and tears more than 2 inches across in stovepipe shields.
      To make this repair (see Figure 3.37.), first obtain the following items (if not included in the repair
      kit): ruler, cleaning materials, a dry rag, a craftsman’s knife, a piece of matching patch material, a
      can of silicone sealer , and a paddle. Begin th e process by cleaning and drying the damaged area
      thoroughly. Next, measure the damaged area and cut a patch from material salvaged from a shield
      that could not be repaired, making sure that the patch is large enough to extend 1 inch beyond the
      damage on all sides. Now, spread a layer of s ealer on either the pa tch or the shield and press the
      patch in place at once. Finally, spread sealer 1 inch over all edges of the patch to eliminate fraying.
      Do not move the shield for 4 to 6 hours.

3.8. Conversion of Alternate Facilities. There may be some facilities which are damaged beyond expe-
dient repair capabilities. If such a facility is vital to the air base mission, another facility must be con-
verted to meet the uninhabitable faci lity’s role. To effectively convert another facility, engineers must be
aware of the function of the destroyed structure. Equipped with this knowledge, potential alternate facili-
ties can be evaluated in terms ofsize, utilities support, and other special functional requirements. To select
or recommend the best facility for conversion, the base civil engineer (BCE) should consider two factors.
First, what other structures on the installation come closest to meeting the requirements for an alternate
facility? Second, how much work will be required to convert the facility to meet its intended use? If there
are no special considerations, the structure meetin g the functional requirements and taking the least
amount of time to convert should be selected.

                    EXPEDIENT REPAIR OF WATER AND WASTE SYSTEMS

4.1. Introduction. Timely repair of water and waste systems is essential after a disaster or enemy attack
for obvious health, hygiene, and operational reasons. Since it is impossible to predict the extent of damage
to these systems during a disaster or attac k, specific priorities need to be established after an incident.
Facility priorities listed in base recovery plans are generally a s ound starting guide. However, the Emer-
gency Operations Center (EOC) normally dictates repair priorities during emergencies. Bottom line—ser-
vice to crucial base functions must be restored quickly. If necessary, some creative engineering and
cannibalization of non-critical systems may be required to establish or keep priority water and sanitation
systems operating.

4.2. Overview. This chapter primarily focuses on exp edient water and waste systems repair. Addition-
ally, gas line and POL system repa ir is briefly discussed. Although some expedient repairs to water and
waste systems end up being permanent, most repairs are temporary measures that provide limited support
for short periods. The topics presented in this chapter address expedient repair of water distribution, water
treatment, water storage, expedient water sources, sewage disposal, gas line, and POL systems.

4.3. Water Distribution Systems. Water is an important utility requiring quick restoration following a
disaster or hostil e attack. Water systems normally have a high pr iority for repai r due to fi refighting
requirements, decontamination purposes, personal consumption, cooking uses, and both general and med-
ical hygiene. The major components of any water supply system are source, treatment, storage, and distri-
bution. Of these, the distribution network is the most extensive component of the installation water system
and is where most expedient repairs are affected.
   4.3.1. Anticipated Damage and Effects. Subterranean construction pr otects the distribution net-
   work from certain types of disasters. Its widespread layout can make it more vulnerable to other emer-
   gencies.
       4.3.1.1. High wind associated with ahurricane or tornado is not likely to break underground water
       mains, but a major enemy air attack is almost certain to disrupt some part of the dispersed layout
       of the distribution network. Dama ge to the d istribution system is normally confined to pumps,
       valves, and water mains. Water mains may be broken in several locations resulting in easily recog-
       nizable leaks ( Figure 4.1.) as well as numerous hidden leak s producing delayed damage in the
       form of undermined streets or structures.
       4.3.1.2. A water system is easily contaminated wh en water mains and sewe rs in close proximity
       are fractured. If the water mains and sewers are on a steep gradient, sewa ge may enter the water
       mains with enough head to flow to the consumer s' taps below. Contamination may result when
       broken mains reduce pressure within the system, heavy draft for firefighting, valve closures, and
       supply failures occurring during enemy attack or sabotage. Contamination may also be caused by
       filth entering open mains through open ends or fractures during repair operations. The more com-
       mon diseases attributed to contaminated water are typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. Diarrhea
       may also be caused by contaminat ed water. An epidemic of any of these seriously hampers mili-
       tary operations.
74                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 4.1. Obvious Water Line Break.




        4.3.1.3. During periods of conflict, a retreating enemy or terrorists may deliberately contaminate
        water supply systems by placing bo ne oil, refuse, bodies, lubrica tion oils, or other materials in
        wells, springs, reservoirs, tanks, or the distri bution system. Consequently, measures should be
        taken to secure easy access points such as well points, pumping stations, and storage vessels.
     4.3.2. Expedient Repair Procedures. As soon as the situation perm its, work should be started on
     restoring water supply sin ce water supply systems ofte n have a higher priority in rehabilitation than
     other utilities. Time is normally a limiting factor during base recovery, and rapid completion of the job
     is by far more important than economy of labor , materials, and equipment. In making improvised
     repairs, any suitable material or equipment available is used to me et the immediate need. A repaired
     water main does not have to be l eak-proof to be functional. Expe dient repairs are improved as time
     and supplies allow. Water distribution systems include pipe from 1- 1/ 2 to 24 inches in diameter and
     may consist of PVC rigid plastic pi pe, steel, asbestos cement, cast iron, and ductile iron. Water pres-
     sure ranges from 60- to 120- psi. Most distribution lin es are considered repa irable and, therefore,
     efforts should concentrate on quickly reestablishing major feeder lines. As a general rule, system com-
     ponents, such as pumps, hydran ts, valves, and purifica tion units, are not considered expediently
     repairable due to the time required to accomplish a fix. Suggested repair procedures for water supply
     systems are listed below.
        4.3.2.1. Identify the Problem. The fi rst corrective action is to iden tify the extent of the problem.
        Pipes and mains, valves, and pumping stations can be lo cated from existi ng utility drawings. If
        available, local techn icians should be able to assist greatly in this effort. Multi-frequency pipe
        locators and similar equipment can be used to locate otherwise hidden lines.
        4.3.2.2. Select Repair Materials. Repairs can be accomplished with cast-iron pipe with mechani-
        cal couplings or by using iron or steel pipe. Steel pipe is preferable to cast-iron pipe because it is
        stronger and lighter, can be fabricated in longer lengths, has fewer joints, and is easier to transport
        and handle. Fire hoses may also be used for temporary bypasses. Schedule 40 PVC piping can also
        be used as feeder lines. Plastic piping, which normally comes in 10-foot lengths, is very easy to
        assemble and modify. Mechanical couplers are generally desirable because they are quickly
        installed and resist vibr ation and settle ment. The most common coupler s are the full circle and
        closed circle types. The full circle or open side couplers ( Figure 4.2.) are the most preferred and
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 75


       recommended for water, sewer, and POL line repairs. The closed ci rcle or closed side coupler is
       used primarily for steam line repairs. If normal repair materials, such as couplers, are not available
       to repair a broken pipe or leaking joint, other expedient line repair techniques are still available.

Figure 4.2. Typical Full Circle Couplers.




       4.3.2.3. Implement Repairs. Expedient repair to water distribution systems basically consists of
       piping. In essence, replace or repair piping syst ems with locally available materials or materials
       obtained by dismantling non-criti cal systems for components. Fi rst responders will nor mally
       attempt to isolate and/or bypass damaged lines. Once the damage has been assessed, make tempo-
       rary repairs to control water wastage, maintain essential flow, and permit the reopening of valves.
          4.3.2.3.1. Repairing Water Main Breaks and Leaks. Water main repairs should be repaired
          as quickly as possible. The type of repair technique that is used depends on the type of leak in
          the water main. Use the procedures in Table 4.1. as a guide for repairing water main breaks
          and leaks.
76                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Table 4.1. Checklist for Repairing Water Main Breaks and Leaks.
     Problem Type                                     Repair Procedure
Small Holes            Use wood plugs to stop small holes temporarily. (Replace wood plugs with
                       permanent metal plugs at a later date.) Temporary wood plugs can also be used
                       to plug the ends of pipes up to 8 inches in diameter. Brace the plugs to withstand
                       the pressure in the main.
Joint Leaks            Repair joint leaks by recaulking the joint if caulking was previously used in the
                       joint.
Cracks in Main         Cracks in mains usually require that the valves be shut off in the affected area,
                       especially in severe main breaks. Notify the fire fighting authorities in case of
                       main shutoff. Repair leaks in mains using split sleeves or mechanical couplings.
                       Split-sleeve and mechanical-joint repair fittings offer the best method for quick,
                       effective repairs. Several companies manufacture split-sleeve and
                       mechanical-joint repair fittings.


                       Split-sleeve repair method: Insert a split sleeve over fracture or hole.
                       Split-sleeve fittings can be installed underwater if necessary.


                       Mechanical-joint repair method: Cut out a section of the cracked pipe and
                       replace it with a piece of pipe and mechanical couplings. Mechanical couplings
                       are manufactured by several companies for various types of repair jobs. Consult
                       the manufacturer’s instructions for installation methods to make the proper
                       selection and installation. If the break is too long for a short insertion piece,
                       insert a whole length of pipe.


                       When a water main is opened for repair, flush and disinfect it before returning it
                       to service.


          4.3.2.3.2. Tapping Water Mains. After a disaster or during a contingency, it may be necessary
          to tap into water mains to make expedient repairs or reroute essential service. Water mains are
          usually cast iron, 8 inches or more i n diameter. If the involved main is less than 8 inches in
          diameter, taps should be 2 inches or smaller. Use the steps in Table 4.2. and the illustration in
          Figure 4.3. to tap the water main.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               77


Table 4.2. Steps to Tap a Water Main.
                                   Water Main Tapping Procedures
Step 1     Dig to expose pipe at thepoint where tap is to be made. Dig as close to the top of water main
           as possible.
Step 2     Clean all dirt and rust off pipe at that point.
Step 3     Place gasket of water main self-tapping machine on pipe, and set saddle of machine on the
           gasket.
Step 4     Wrap the chain around the pipe, and tighten it to clamp water main self-tapping machine to
           the pipe.
Step 5     Remove cap from the cylinder of machine, and place combination drill and tap in boring bar.
Step 6     Reassemble machine by putting boring bar through cylinder and tightening cap.
Step 7     Open flap valve between the compartments and start drilling hole by applying pressure at
           feed yoke and turning ratchet handle until drill enters the main.
Step 8     When tap starts threading the hole, back off the feed yoke to prevent stripping threads.
Step 9     Continue to turn boring bar until the ratchet handle can no longer be turned without extra
           force.
Step 10    Remove tap from the hole by reversing the ratchet. Then, back the boring bar out by turning
           it counterclockwise.
Step 11    Close the flap valve between upper and lower compartments.
Step 12    Drain water from cylinder through the bypass.
Step 13    Remove cap and drill tool. Place a corporation stop in the boring bar, ensuring that the stop
           is closed.

         4.3.2.3.3. Making Temporary Repairs in Water Pipes. Although expedient repairs may not
         eliminate all leaks from water distribution pipes, small leaks should be repaired when the tac-
         tical situation or mission permits. Before making any repairs, shut off the water and relieve the
         pressure from the system. Pipes can be temporarily repaired using the following methods.
             4.3.2.3.3.1. Rubber Hose or Plastic Tubing. Cut the pipe on either side of the leak with
             a hacksaw or pipe cutter. Remove the damaged pipe section and replace it with a length of
             rubber hose or plastic tubing. To do this, slip the ends over the pipe and fasten them with
             hose clamps. The inside diameter of the hose must fit the outside diameter of the pipe.
             4.3.2.3.3.2. Sheet Rubber. Wrap the leaking area with sheet rubber . Place two
             sheet-metal clamps on the pipe (one on each side). Then, fast en the clamps with nuts and
             bolts.
             4.3.2.3.3.3. Electrician's Friction Tape. Wrap several layers of friction tape around the
             hole or crack, extending the tape about 2 inches above and below the leak.
             4.3.2.3.3.4. Wood Plugs. Similar to water main repairs, small holes in other water pipes
             can also be filled with wood plugs. Drive a wooden plug into the hole after it is drilled or
             reamed. The pl ug will swell as it absorbs wat er, preventing it f rom being blown out by
             water pressure.
         4.3.2.3.4. Installing Temporary Piping or Hoses. These repa irs may involve plugging or cap-
         ping fractured mains or shunti ng water around breaks with a fire hose connected to the frac-
         tured pipe or fire hydrants. Ex pedient repairs could also consis t of new piping laid on the
         ground. Replace temporary piping and hoses with more permanent repairs as soon as possible
         because they may interfere with traffic, are likely to freeze in cold weather, and may not pro-
         vide sufficient supply. Figure 4.4. and Figure 4.5. give examples of typical service and water-
         line connections that may require repair.

          4.3.2.3.6. Using Dissimilar Material s. During expedient repair, the goal is delivery. As such,
          the piping size must be based upon the sizes that the pumps will accommodate and the materi-
          als available. During contingency operations pr oper fittings, material, and tools may not be
          available. Therefore, the field eng ineer may h ave to improvise using dissimilar materials to
          effect temporary repairs. Figure 4.7. through Figure 4.9. illustrate a few ways to accomplish
          pipe repairs when working with limited resources or dissimilar materials. Regardless of what
          type of expedient repairs are performed, the total system will need to be disinfected when the
          repairs are completed.

          4.3.2.3.7. Thawing Frozen Systems. Pipes may freeze in temperat e as well as frigid zones.
          In frigid climates, freezing presents a major problem to a water distribution system, and pipes
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                   83


            are normally insulated and he ated. If a building’ s temperature falls below freezi ng, inside
            pipes may also freeze causing thepipe to break at the weakest point. The best way to avoid fro-
            zen pipes is to insulate or wrap lines with electrical heat tape. In areas where the ground is per-
            manently frozen, water pipes are placed in h eated conduits. Pipes are typically buried below
            frost penetration depth in temperate climates where freezing is only a seasonal problem. Even
            with proper protection, some pipes may still freeze. The paragraphs below discuss some
            pipe-thawing procedures.
               4.3.2.3.7.1. Electrical Thawing of Wrought-Iron and Cast-Iron Pipe. Electrical thaw-
               ing is quick and relatively inexpensive. Th e electrical circuit fo r the thawing operation
               consists of a sourc e of curre nt (a DC genera tor, such as a welding unit, or a transformer
               connected to an AC outlet), a length of the frozen pipe, and two insulated wires connecting
               the current source and the pipe. As current fl ows through the pipe, heat is generated and
               the ice within the pipe begins to melt. As the water starts to flow, the rest of the ice is pro-
               gressively melted by contact with the flowin g water. The wires f rom the cur rent source
               may be connected to nearby hydrants, valves, or exposed points at the ends of the frozen
               section. The amount of current and voltage required to thaw various sizes of wrought-iron
               and cast-iron pipe are given in Table 4.3. The time required for el ectrical thawing varies
               from 5 minutes to over 2 hour s, depending on the pipe size and leng th, the intensity of
               freezing, and several ot her factors. The best practice is to supply current until the water
               flows freely.

                   4.3.2.3.7.1.1. Precautions. In general, do not use a curr ent higher than the one listed
                   in Table 4.3. for a particular pipe size. When in doubt, use a lower current for a longer
                   period of time. Select contact points on the pipe as close as possible to the frozen sec-
                   tion and make sure the contact points are free of rust, grea se, or scale. Remove any
                   meters, electrical ground connections, and couplings to the building plumbing from the
                   line to be thawed. If the pi pe joints have gaskets or ot her insulation, thaw the pipe in
                   sections between the joints or use copper jumpers to pass the current around the insu-
                   lated joints.

                4.3.2.3.7.1.2. Procedures. To thaw pipe with a weld ing generator or similar DC
                source, set the generator to the correct amperage for the pipe to be thawed and connect
                leads to the pipe. For an AC source, transformers are required to adjust the amperage
                of the AC circuit to the pipe being thawe d. Consult an electrical engineer for the best
                transformer arrangement. To keep hazards to a minimum, a competent electrician gen-
                erally sets and connects tr ansformers, makes the connec tions, and assists throughout
                the thawing procedure. Wher e frequent thawi ng is necessary at di fferent points, the
                transformers may be mounted on a trailer for ready use.
             4.3.2.3.7.2. Steam Thawing. Steam thawing is slower than electrical thawing and is used
             only when insulating ma terial in pipe joints or couplings makes the us e of electricity
             impractical. In steam thawing, a hose connected to a boiler is inserted through a discon-
             nected fitting and gradually ad vanced as the steam melts th e ice. Steam thawing is com-
             monly used on fire hydrants.
             4.3.2.3.7.3. Thawing With a Heat Lamp or Blow Torch. A heat lamp or blowtorch is a
             good method for th awing aboveground pipes, but there is a risk of fi re—especially with
             plastic pipes. Use the followi ng steps to thaw frozen pipe s when using a heat lamp or
             blowtorch: (1) open the faucets in the line; (2) apply heat from the heat lamp or blowtorch
             at one end of the pipe and work along the entire length of the pipe (Figure 4.10.); (3) con-
             tinue to heat the pipe unt il the wa ter flows free ly. Caution: Do not overheat the pipes,
             because soldered joints will break loose if the solder melts.

             burlap or other cloth and pouring boiling water over the wrappings, thus transmitting heat
             to the frozen pipe. In some cases, a small pump may be used to clear a piece of pipe. How-
             ever, excessive pump pressure can cause a backup; therefore, this procedure must be care-
             fully monitored. When indoor pi pes freeze due to failure in the heating plant, the heating
             plant must be repaired. A high temperature should be maintained in the building until the
             pipes thaw.

           4.3.2.3.8. Disinfecting the Piping System. After repairs are made to water supply pipes, clean
           and disinfect plumbing pipes and other parts of a water supply system carrying drinking water
           before use. Flush the system to remove dirt, waste, and surface water. Disinfect each unit with
           a chemical such as a solution of hypochlorite or chlorine according to established disinfection
           standards and procedures. Normally, there is little danger of contamination, and disinfection is
           not required if leaks or breaks are repaired with clamping devices while the mains remain full
           of pressurized water.

         Step 2     Insert small thaw pipe or tube into the frozen pipe as shown in Figure 4.11.
         Step 3     Add an elbow and a piece of vertical pipe to outer end of the thaw pipe.
         Step 4     Place a bucket under the opening to the frozen pipe.
         Step 5     Insert a funnel into the open end of the vertical pipe.
         Step 6     Pour boiling water into the funnel and, as the ice melts, push the thaw pipe
                    forward.
         Step 7     After the flow starts, withdraw the pipe quickly. Allow the flow to continue
                    until the thaw pipe is completely withdrawn and cleared of ice.

4.4. Water Treatment Systems. The expedient restoration of water trea tment capabilities may consist of
repairs to an existing treatment plant or the installation of portable water treatment units. The importance
of restoring the water treatment facility will depend upon the quality of the in stallation water source fol-
lowing an emergency. If the source is relatively free of contaminants, treatment plant repairs or setting up
of portable treatment equipment may be of less importance than othe r installation repairs. If water treat-
86                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


ment is necessary and the treatment plant is beyond repair, or the installation does not possess a treatment
facility, it may be necess ary to use expedi ent water treatment equipment. Th e most common expedient
water treatment system available to civil e ngineer forces is the rever se osmosis water purification unit
(ROWPU). The ROWPU purifies wate r by forcing water under high pre ssure through a series of mem-
branes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU is capable of removing disso lved minerals from water. Dis-
infection treatment is accomplished only after processing through the membrane fi lter elements since
chlorine causes acute damage to the filter elements. The producti on capability of the ROWPU will be
reduced by high temperatures of the feedwater source. Although ROWPUs come in several sizes, the Air
Force currently uses both the 600-GPH unit shown in Figure 4.12. and the 1500-GPH unit shown in Fig-
ure 4.13. For more information on ROWPU operations, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 9, Guide to Reverse
Osmosis Water Purification Unit Installation and Operation.

4.5. Water Storage Systems. The water storage system on an air base or beddown location may consist of
underground reservoirs, elevated water tanks, open reservoirs, and temporary storage facilities like those
in Figure 4.14. The mos t severe damage to the storage system could be a rupture causing loss of the
stored water. Another consideration is sabotage by clandestine groups. Whenever possible, water storage
facilities should be postured well within the secure area of the installation or beddown setting. Ruptures
or other damage to existing storage facilities can be sealed from the inside using rubber patches, epoxy, or
wooden dowels if the holes are small. When conventional installation water storage facilities are damaged
or additional storage space is required, swimming pools and similar watertight facilities make excellent
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  87


alternate reservoirs. Other expedient water storage alternatives include: flexible bladders ranging in size
up to a 50,000-gallon capacity, water distribution trucks, water trailers, lyster bags, 5- and 10-gallon igloo
water coolers, and 55-gallon drum s. An aboveground reservoir can be constructed using sandba gs or
earthen berms lined with plastic sh eeting to make it watertight. Bear in mind that a considerable amount
of water is stored within the pipelines themselves. For example, a 6-inch pipeline, two miles long contains
approximately 16,000 gallons when full. Using shutof f valves to quickly isolate undamaged sections of
the distribution system could mean substantial amounts of water saved within the pipes for future use.

Figure 4.14. Temporary Water Storage Facilities.




4.6. Expedient Water Sources. The source of water for an air base or beddown location may be as var-
ied as a commercial supplier, a ground water source, or a surface water source (Figure 4.15.). Damage to
a commercial water suppl y during an emergency will normally consist of a ruptur ed or bl ocked supply
line that results in either reduc ing or eliminating the base water supply. Ground water sources, water
pumped from below the surface, are probably the least vulnerable supply sources. It can be assumed most
natural disasters or hostile attacks would not destroy this type of water source. However, some emergen-
cies can cause damage to the well and pumping systems that give access to this source. Specifically, wells
could be partially filled with debris, well walls and pumping facilities damaged or destroyed entirely. Var-
ious types of emergency situations can af fect surface water sources a lso. Water-borne debris associated
with a flood or hurricane might block water inlets to the system; nuclear, biological, or chemical contam-
inants used during an en emy attack could make the source unus able; or convention al enemy munitions
may diminish, divert, or stop access to a river or lake. Other sources of water available to the civil engi-
neer force are sometim es overlooked. In cold weather regi ons there are vast amounts of "solid" water
available in the form of snow and ice. Snow and ice melting devices can be fabricated and used to provide
excellent water supplies from glaciers and other ice formations. Base swimming pools, ornamental pools,
and similar facilities often contain substantial amounts of water, which can be used during emergencies.

plying and using water in the four major climatic regions of the world.

                                                       scenario.

                                                       vital.

     4.6.1. Water Sources Development. Once water sources have been identified for a beddown loca-
     tion, the field engineer must further develop and maintain these sources for use. General tasks
     involved in this process include, (1) developing water points by creati ng ponds and lakes across
     streams, deepening and reinforcing existing water collection areas; (2 ) providing drainage to prevent
     contamination of water sources from storm runoff; (3) constructing physical protection structures for
     water sources; (4) constructing and improving roads from water points and well sites to the main sup-
     ply routes; (5) maintainin g, repairing and buildin g semi-permanent and pe rmanent water utilities at
     existing installations; and (6) repairing and constructing water storage and distribution systems.
     4.6.2. Surface Water Resources. Surface water from ri vers, streams, lakes, or spri ngs is the most
     common sources of water supply . Surface water sources must be tr eated according to established
     water treatment procedures and standards to ensure water is potable before use. Refer to AFH 10-222,
     Volume 9 for water treatment procedures. The capacity of small streams to meet supply requirements
     may be increased by the construction of small dams or reservoirs. Expedient structures for this pur-
     pose are shown in Figure 4.16. through Figure 4.18. In regions such as tropical islands where there is
     abundant rainfall and rapid surface runof f, rainwater is the primary source for the inhabitants, how-
     ever, the quantity of water available may not be sufficient to supply the needs of both the civilian pop-
     ulation and the military. Rainwater as a source may be sufficient for small units for limited operations,
     but it should not be considered if other more reliable sources are available.

     4.6.3. Water Intakes. Once the natural water resources are confined in a reservoir the water must be
     delivered to the point of usage. This is generally accomplished by pumps or gravity pipelines. Intakes
     are used as a means of obtaining water from its source. Water at the intake point should be as clear and
     deep as possible. Screens are in stalled on all in takes regardless of how clean the water appears.
     Screens used at surface sources serve to keep fish and debris out of the water system. Special attention
     must be given to the intake. If a lot of muck or silt is on the bottom of the water source, a floating type
     intake is best. On the other hand, if bottom of the water source is a bed of sand or gravel, a surface
     intake with a screen may be equally effective and easier to use.
        4.6.3.1. Floatable Intakes. Floats made of logs, lumber, sealed cans, or empty fuel drums can be
        used to support the intake strainer in deep water. They are especially useful in large streams where
        the quality of the water varies across its width or where the water is not deep enough near the
        banks to cover the intake strainer. An adequate depth of water can cover t he intake point by
        anchoring or stationing the float at the deep part of the stream. The intake hose should be secured
        to the top of the float, allowi ng enough slack for movement of the float. If support lines are used
        to secure the float to the banks, the position of the float can be altered to correspond to changes in
        depth by manipulation of the lines. The chief advantage of a float intake is the ease with which the
        screen can be adj usted. Figure 4.19. and Figure 4.20. illustrate two type s of improvised intake
        floats. Note: The strainer on the suction hose of a floating intake should be placed at least 4 inches
        below the water level. This precaution reduces the possibility of the strainer becoming clogged
        with floating debris, or the loss of prime owing to air entering the suction line.

      4.6.3.2. Rock and S take Supported Intakes: If the stream is not too sw ift and the water is deep
      enough, an expedient intake may be prepared by placing the intake strainer on a rock. This will
      prevent clogging of the strainer by the streambed and provide enough water overhead to prevent
      the suction of air into the intake pipe. If the water source is a sm all stream or shallow lake the
      intake pipe can be secured to a post or pile as shown in Figure 4.21.
94                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 4.21. Stake Supported Water Intake.




      4.6.3.3. Pit Supported Intakes. When a stream is so shallow that the intake screen is not covered
      by at least 4 inches of water , a pit should be dug and the screen laid on a rock or board placed at
      the bottom of the pit. Pits dug in streams with clay or silt bottoms should be lined with gravel to
      prevent dirt from entering the purification equipment (Figure 4.22.). The screen is surrounded by
      gravel that prevents collapse of the sides of th e pit and shields the screen from damage by lar ge
      floating objects. The gravel also acts as a coarse strainer for the water. Enclosing the intake screen
      in a bucket or other container as shown in Figure 4.23. may provide a similar method.

4.7. Wastewater (Sewage) Systems. Improper disposal of sewage in the aftermath of a disaster or
enemy attack will compound base recovery problems. If the sewage enters a water supply, an outbreak of
intestinal diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea, is almost certain to occur. To prevent
such outbreaks, civil engineer forces may have to repair damage to existing sewer systems as well as pro-
vide temporary sanitation facilities. The priority of these repairs will be based on an estimate of potential
hazard to the installation population.
   4.7.1. Classification of Air Base Sewage. Sewage may be divided into several classifications accord-
   ing to its source. These classifica tions will decide the imm ediate need for sewe r rehabilitation. The
   two primary types of sewage on most installations are domestic sewage and storm sewage.
96                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


        4.7.1.1. Domestic Sewage . Domestic sewage is the waste from toilets, lavatories, urinals, bath-
        tubs, showers, laundries, and kitchens. Proper disposal of this type of sewage should receive first
        consideration in expedient repair operations.
        4.7.1.2. Storm Sewage. Storm sewage is the inflow of surface runoff during or immediately fol-
        lowing a storm or heavy rain. Disposal of storm sewage following a disaster is not a high priority
        unless it hinders base operations or endangers lives by flooding critical areas. Since storm sewers
        are designed to catch runof f whether it is natural or man-made, th ey will also ca tch and c ollect
        toxic chemicals introduced accide ntally or on purpose. For this reason, civil engineers should be
        prepared to establish blocking points at critical locations to prevent the spread of hazardous mate-
        rials. Storm sewers may be blocked using commercially available plugs or sandbags.
     4.7.2. Sewage System Operation. The major components of the sewage system consist of facilities for
     collecting, pumping, treatin g, and disposing of sewa ge. The basic collecting system consists of a
     series of branch, lateral, main, and trunk sewers leading from various installation structures. Raw sew-
     age moves through the collection system to a central point for treatment and eventual disposal. At any
     point along the system where gravity is not sufficient to move the sewage, a pump or lift station may
     be required. Sewage treatment plants vary in complexity according to the characteristics of the in flu-
     ent and the degree of treatment requ ired prior to discha rge. Effluent standards, set by national and
     local regulations, determine the degree of treatment.
     4.7.3. Anticipated Sewer Damage. Common problems with the sewage system during typical disas-
     ters such as floods and hurricane s are complete inundation of th e system by exce ssive amounts of
     water and blockage of parts of the system by debris. In the extreme, earthquakes or enemy attacks can
     cause complete destruction of treatm ent plants and lift stat ions as well as rupt ures of sewage lines.
     Damage sustained during hostile attacks will probably be collateral in nature since the sewage system
     is not normally a preplanned target. Specific damage could consist of the following:
        4.7.3.1. Sewers. Deliberate demolition to sewers by an enemy is usually limited to junction man-
        holes or large mains. Stoppages caused by debris being blown and washed into sewers can be
        expected.
        4.7.3.2. Pumping S tations. During conflict, pum ping stations may be deliberately damaged
        because they are key points, are more accessible, and are most dif ficult to repair. They are not
        likely to be damaged seriously by bombs or artillery fire since they offer a relatively small target.
        However, flooding during either tropical storms or tornados can prove consequential.
        4.7.3.3. Treatment Units. Treatment units may be damaged during a conflict by the demolition of
        machinery and othe r key equipmen t. However, they are not norma lly high-value targets due to
        their small size and the ability to achieve effective treatment results by other means.
        4.7.3.4. Cesspools and Sep tic Tanks. Damage to cesspools an d septic tanks from sabotage or
        bombing is relatively unimportant. Destruction of a cesspool or septic tank would affect only one
        or a small number of properties. Their wide dispersal provides a large measure of safety.
     4.7.4. Effect of Damage. Human wastes must be properly disposed of in order to protect personnel. If
     sewage enters a water supply , an epidemic outbreak of intestinal diseases such as typhoid, cholera,
     dysentery, and diarrhea is almost certain to follow . Existing sewer systems ma y have to be rehabili-
     tated to prevent such mission-impacting outbreaks.

  4.7.5. Expedient Re pair Procedures. Expedient sewer repairs shou ld consist only of the minimum
  work required to prevent the outbrea k of disease. For example, i f the ruptured sewer line results in
  sewage leakage into an occupied area and does not threaten water sources, repairs can be delayed until
  emergency conditions subside. When damage is too widespread for expedient repair, civil engineers
  must resort to pro ven field sanitation methods. Development of temporary latrine facilities is
  addressed in Chapter 6 of this pamphlet. The rehabilitation of a sewage disposal system requires the
  following actions.
     4.7.5.1. Sewers. Sewer lines are the most essential item in a sewage disposal system. If the situa-
     tion is critical, service can be restored temporarily by pumping from an upstream manhole, around
     the damaged section, and into a downstream manhole. If the sewer is completely stopped or badly
     damaged, an open channel can be built. Where storm and sanitary sewers are separate, it may be
     possible to divert sanitary sewage through a storm sewer to a suitable outlet.
     4.7.5.2. Pumping Stations. When sewage pumping stations cannot be repaired expeditiously using
     available replacement parts or parts cannibalized from other st ations, portable pumps should be
     substituted. If pumps are not availabl e, consider rerouting past the lift station with pipe or open
     channels using gravity flow.
     4.7.5.3. Treatment Plants. It may be necessary to bypass severely damaged treatment plants. Set-
     tling and digestion tanks and filters can usually be repair ed with standard construction materials.
     Sludge beds are practically indestructible. M achinery must be repair ed by cannibalization or
     improvised methods. If compressed air is used in an activated sl udge process, replacement of air
     compressors is difficult at best. However, the activated sludge plants can be operated as sedimen-
     tation or septic tanks. Such treatment, together with chlorination, provides a reasonable degree of
     purification. Further information about expedient septic systems is provided in Chapter 6 of this
     pamphlet.
     4.7.5.4. Septic Tanks. Septic tank systems ( Figure 4.24.) are used to treat and dispose of waste-
     water from buildings wher e it is not feasible to provide a community wastewater collection and
     treatment system. A septic tank speeds up the decay of raw sewa ge. It may be made of concrete,
     stone, fiberglass, or brick (lumber is used when other materi als are not available), in box-section
     form, and it should be watertight. The septic tank should have a manhole and cover to give access
     for cleaning and repair and must be designed to hold 70 percent of the peak water demand of that
     facility for 24 hours and not less th an 16 hours. Contingency rapid re pair of a septic tank would
     normally be low prio rity since other options ar e usually available. However, if a septic tank is
     severely damaged and totally inoperable and othe r prudent options are not available, an expedi-
     ent-type septic tank can be constructed using procedures provided in Chapter 6 of this pamphlet.
     Otherwise, expedient repairs w ould probably be limited to unc logging pipes, pumping out tanks,
     and improving or expanding drain fields.

      4.7.5.5. Grease Traps. Grease traps come in countless sh apes and sizes, but their operation is
      basically the same. Just as the name suggests, a grease trap catc hes grease (animal fats and oils)
      from kitchen wastew ater. Although there are ma ny different models, grea se traps are typically
      placed in the flow line of the building’s sewer system to ca tch grease and fats from kitchen and
      scullery sinks, preventing clogs in the waste pipes. Expedient repair of grease traps is usually lim-
      ited to unclogging inlet pipes and repairing or replacing damaged traps. Service personnel should
      be trained to perform routine cl eaning and maintenance of grease traps installed in their area(s) .
      Figure 4.25. provides a layout of a typical grease trap.

4.8. Natural Gas Systems. Damage to a natural gas system must be dealt with rapi dly to prevent and
contain potential accidents like the one shown in Figure 4.26. The most expedient method of dealing with
gas system leaks is to shut off the gas supply at main feeder po ints. Since gas is often not essential to
installation operations, selective syst em isolation can usually be used until time and resources are avail-
able to make the necessary permanent repairs.
100                                                                          AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 4.26. Ruptured Natural Gas Line Fire.




      4.8.1. Emergency Cut-Off Procedures. If it is not possible to shut the gas off through the use of exist-
      ing valves, gas main bags or gas stoppers, as shown in Figure 4.27., may be required. Gas main bags
      are canvas or rubber bags which can be inserted into a gas main and inflated until they fill the pipe and
      halt the gas flow. The gas stopper consists of oiled or rubber -coated canvas stretched over a flexible
      steel frame. The edge of the stopper forms a seal with the interior of the gas main thereby stopping the
      gas flow. To seal a main with a gas bag, the rubber or canvas bag is inserted through a hole in the main
      (a hole created by damage, removal of a riser, or access port). If the interior of the pipe is coated with
      tar or oil, canvas bags are necessa ry. The bag is then inflated thro ugh a piece of attached tubing until
      it fills the pipe and stops the gas flow. To use a gas stopper, the frame is squeezed together and inserted
      into the hole in the gas main. After the stopper is in the pipe, it is restored to its circular shape through
      the use of wire levers attached to the frame. The ga s stopper can then be adjusted to shut of f the gas
      flow. In larger mains, it is safer to use both bag and stopper.

   4.8.2. Expedient Repairs of Gas Systems. As mentioned earlier, it is best to simply cut off gas systems
   and make permanent repairs later when the emergency has subsided. However, certain conditions may
   call for some immediate expedient repairs to prevent danger to personnel or to provide limited gas ser-
   vice.
      4.8.2.1. Venting of Gas Accumulations. After the main gas supply is shut off, immediately check
      buildings and other areas for th e presence of dangerous gas accu mulations. The presence of gas
      can be detected through the use of special gas detection devices such as a combustible gas indica-
      tor or, when no detection instrument is availabl e, by an individual’s sense of smell. The sense of
      smell cannot always be depended on to detect leaks because ga s can lose its odor while traveling
      through the ground. Any accumulations should be vented to the outside to reduce the potential for
      asphyxiation or explosion.
      4.8.2.2. Repair of Broken or Punc tured Gas Pipes. There may be conditions following an emer-
      gency when gas must be supplied to certain facilities for esse ntial operations. For example, the
      dining hall may have no alternate method of preparing food for the recovery force, or the hospital
      may need hot water for crucial medical services and have no other source of energy for water heat-
      ers. During periods of cold weather, gas may be the only source of heat for certain mission-critical
      installation facilities. Un der any of these conditions, leaking or ruptured gas lines may require
      patching. If the leak is small a nd involves low-pressure gas pipes, a sealant may be used in con-
      junction with a pressure mold to close the opening. The sealant should be a product which does
      not break down in the presence of natural gas. Larger leaks and pipe breaks can be repaired using
      various types of mechanical clamps.
      4.8.2.3. Safe ty. The potential for asphyxiation or explosion during encounters with gas leaks
      makes it imperative that the repair crew exercise extreme caution. Personnel should not enter con-
      fined areas with high gas accumu lations unless they are equipped with self-contained breathing
      apparatus. No open flame from cutting torches, ci garette lighters, or similar devices will be used
      in a gaseous environment. Additiona lly, the repair crew must be careful not to generate sparks in
      the vicinity of a gas leak. A good rule of thumb is not to enter any area where the mixture of air
      and gas is at, or approaches, the lower explosive limits. Taking a few extra minutes to properly
      vent the area will greatly reduce the danger to personnel.

         4.8.2.4. Leak Detection Measures. Natural gas can be detected through the use of special gas
         detection devices such as the ones shown in Figure 4.28. There are also other methods to detect
         gas leaks—like heavy insect activity (swarming), hissing sound, unusual improvement or deterio-
         ration in surrounding vegetation, and odor. Although natural gas is odorless, gas companies inject
         odor additives into the syst em to warn the public and aid in leak i dentification. These addi tives
         produce a rotten egg or sulfur odor when released into the air . However, be aware that a lack of
         odor is not a reliable indicator of the absence of a gas leak. The odor of the gas c ould be filtered
         out as the gas passes through cert ain soils or the odor may be m odified by other vapors within a
         sewer system. Therefore, reports of gas leaks should be investigated using leak detection devices
         such as a Combustible Gas Indicator (CGI) or Flame Ionization Detector (FI). An effective way to
         pinpoint the location of small leaks on exposed lines involves using a spray bottle of soapy water.
         The soapy liquid will bubble when it comes in contact with a leak.

4.9. POL Systems. An installation’s petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) system is a key utility that has
two primary components: storage facilities and distribution systems.
      4.9.1. Storage Facilities. Most installations have several days of storage capacity for major fuel prod-
      ucts. POL storage methods vary considerably from installation to installation. At some CONUS
      installations, there are large fixed storage tanks located aboveground (Figure 4.29.). Conversely, POL
      storage tanks at most overseas locations are both dispersed and covere d by a protective layer of soil.
      In both instances, engineer forces will only be able to accomplish expedient repairs if the involved
      damage is superficial.

Figure 4.29. Altus AFB POL Tank Farm.




   4.9.2. Distribution System. The POL distribution consists of pum ping stations, pipelines, and dis-
   pensing points. The nature of construction of the POL distribu tion system makes it relatively safe
   from natural disasters othe r than flooding. The ma jor damage that a POL distribution system might
   receive would more likely result from an enemy attack during wartime. The impact of damage will be
   reduced at installations where the distribution system is interconnected. As a protective measure, most
   control valves at a number of overseas locations have been installed in pits in order to limit their expo-
   sure to direct impact during an attack.
      4.9.2.1. Pumping Stations. POL pumping stations are not easy targets to hit, however, and would
      not be considered primary tar gets during an en emy attack. Some loss es to pumping capability
      should be expected from collateral damage but it is likely that some capacity to pump fuel will be
      retained.
      4.9.2.2. Pipelines. POL pipe lines are essentially al l welded steel. They are the most survivable
      POL system component. However, since the distribution system piping is the most extensive ele-
      ment of the POL system, it is the most likely element to be damaged. The impact of such damage
      will be reduced at installations where the distribution system is looped.
      4.9.2.3. Dispensing Points. Dispensing points range fr om vehicle fill stands to concrete-encased
      aircraft hydrant refueling systems. The fill stands service POL tank trucks for refueling aircraft at
      most locations. Damage to fill stands can be expected as a collateral effect of weapons detonation.
      Hydrant refueling systems, however, because of their "hardness," should remain relatively intact.
   4.9.3. POL Repair Actions. Damage to the POL system is compounded by the volatile nature of the
   system contents. Engineers will ha ve to think in terms of expedien t repairs to water systems and use
   whatever spare parts and materials currently exist in bench stock or special levels. However , unlike
   water systems, POL repair crews will have to be especially concerned with toxicity, flammability, and
   compatibility issues. Primarily for Pacific theater installations, the POL rapid utility repair kit
104                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      (RURK) provides a means of quickly repairing valve and line failur es resulting from an attack or
      disaster. For additional information on the POL Utility Repair Kit or the Contingency Fuel Recovery
      System, refer to the associated Qualification Training Package (Figure 4.30.).

                  EXPEDIENT REPAIR OF HVAC AND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS

5.1. Introduction. Air bases need viable power source to support mission operations. Electrical power is
essential to daily activities; and, to a lesser de gree, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
systems are also necessary. Obviously, having effective heating and air conditioning for personal comfort
has a minimum impact on aircraft sortie generati on. However, in today’s operating environment, a large
number of mission-critical systems and electronic equipment require stringent climate control. For exam-
ple, many command and control cente rs are self-contained operations that cannot function without inde-
pendent electrical or HVAC support. In these situations, adequate HVAC systems are critical to mission
accomplishment.

5.2. Overview. This chapter focuses on expedient HVAC and electrical repair options during contin-
gency situations. Specific topics include recovery concepts and expedient repair of heating, air condition-
ing, and electrical distribution systems. Each of these areas deals with ha zardous materials and may
require work on or near ener gized circuits; therefore, only trained technicians are allowed to accomplish
HVAC and electrical system repairs and modifications, while strictly complying with Air Force electrical
safety criteria. Elect rical safety requirements in AFI 32-1064 , Electrical Safe Practices, and UFC
3-560-01, Electrical Safety O&M, are mandatory and outline the type of arc thermal performance value
(ATVP) rated PPE to wear when wo rking on or near energized circuits, when work on or near ener gized
circuits is authorized, and who is the energized work authority. Table 4-2 in UFC 3-560-0 defines hazard./
risk category classifications for work tasks. In addition, due to the complexity of these systems, the scope
of this document is to pr ovide only basic expe dient repair guidelines for use during emergencies. Addi-
tional information is provided in the references listed in Attachment 1.

5.3. Heating Systems. In general, heating systems carry heat from the point of production to the place of
use, and thei r design can be complex with many variations. They are usuall y classified by t he medium
used to carry the heat fromthe source to the point of use, such as hot water, steam, and forced-air systems.
   5.3.1. Heating Systems Repair. Depending upon weather c onditions at the time of a disaster or
   attack, repairing damage to the h eating system can range in importan ce from critical to insignificant.
   The extent of damage can span the gamut from nothing whatsoever to total destruction. However,
   unless the installation is undergoing a pe riod of severe cold, repairs to heating systems servicing
   non-mission-essential facilities can probably be delayed throug h the use of spa ce heaters and the
   wearing of additional clothing. Ho wever, if repairs must be made , concentrate on minimum efforts
   necessary to return some measure of heat to base facilitie s. It is not necessary to attain pre-disaster
   comfort levels following an emergency. A partial return of heat can raise temperatures to a level that
   will allow normal operations if personnel are warmly clothed.
       5.3.1.1. Central Heating Systems Repair. For those installations that have a lar ge central heat-
       ing system, damage following an attack or disaster can be widespread. It may well involve the pro-
       duction plant along with the distribution system. The feasibility of conducting expedient repairs to
       the heating system will depend to a great degree upon the amount of damage incurred. For exam-
       ple, if an earthquake or bomb explosion causes a la rge rupture of the central boiler, it is unlikely
       that expedient repair techniques will suffice. On the other hand, a break in one of the pipes leading
       from the boiler could probably be expediently repaired. Fortunately, the inherent strength of mate-
106                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      rials used to contain the pressure within the system also serves to protect the system from external
      damage. Expedient repairs to central heating systems may consist of the following:
         5.3.1.1.1. Production Plant Repairs. Expedient repair of heat production plants may be
         delayed pending structural and/or electrical support. Damaged walls may have to be shored to
         prevent structural collapse or electrical utility service may have to be restored to power control
         and monitoring devices. From a mechanical perspective, broken pipes may need to be repaired
         or replaced, damaged automatic controls may ha ve to be bypass ed with m anual ones, and
         internal cannibalization may be require d in order to get some boilers back in operation. As
         stated earlier, however, if a plant’s boilers have sustained significant damage, the production
         plant is probably beyond immediate repair.
         5.3.1.1.2. Distribution System Repairs. The high heat and pressure associated with most
         heating systems are characteristics that preclude the use of many expedient repair methods and
         materials used to otherwise correct water distribution system damage. For example, temporary
         connectors, such as fire hoses, which are ef fective in bridging damage to a water distribution
         system, will likely not tolerate the high temperatures and pressures of a heat distribution line.
         Similarly, a standard sealer or joint compound which could patch a water leak will break down
         when applied to a steam line. If repairs are attempted, only materials which have been specifi-
         cally designed to withstand th e stresses imposed by heating systems s hould be used. Pipe
         replacement and welding are the most common re pair techniques used to correct distribution
         system problems. Caution must be exercised, however, since welding of high-pressure vessels
         is a specialized technique and requires substa ntial experience. You cannot slap together a
         steam line, even in a contingency mode, and e xpect it to work. In overseas areas, expect to
         encounter older systems which may contain components that are no longer in production.
         Repair parts for these facilities may have to be custom fabricated or cannibalized from other
         systems. Most locations, however, should have an emergency stock of heating system materi-
         als. Tap this source as much as possible.
      5.3.1.2. Individual Systems Repair. Installations without a central heating system generally fea-
      ture individual building systems. The great advantages of these independent units are that damage
      is limited to the system which supports a single building and genera l repair concepts are, for the
      most part, universally applicable. The basic question then becomes whether or not to repair.
         5.3.1.2.1. The easiest way to deal with a damaged individual heating system is to ignore it. If
         the weather permits, or the facility is not critical to the base mission, delay repairs until emer-
         gency conditions are essentially over. Another quick alternativ e when extensive repairs are
         required is to move personnel into a nearby building with a working heating system.
         5.3.1.2.2. Expedien t repairs to an individu al heating unit are gene rally less complex than
         repairs on a large central system. Damage is confined and easy to determine since the indepen-
         dent system does not involve a dispersed ne twork. Components are sma ller, making it easier
         for repair crew members to install replacements. Also, spare parts may be more readily avail-
         able from base supply and local vendors. Furt hermore, since there often are many facilities
         containing similar individual heating systems, there are more opportunities for cannibalization
         of parts from low- priority buildings. If the damage is limited to the system’s ducting, tempo-
         rary flexible ducts can be rapidly put in place to correct the problem. Figure 5.1. shows exam-
         ples of flexible ducting.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              107

   5.3.2. Alternative Heating Source s. If attempts to re pair existing installati on heating systems fail,
   temporary heating sources can be provided for mission-essential facilities. Remember, however, alter-
   nate heat sources can be dangerous and require fre quent checks and servici ng. As time permits, sys-
   tems should be repaired by using existing stocks or canni balized materials, thereby freeing the
   portable heaters for use elsewhere.
      5.3.2.1. Space Heaters. Various types of space heaters provide an alternative to central or indi-
      vidual heating systems. Fuel-fired heaters (Figure 5.2.) can be used in large open buildings if the
      odor is not objectionable and explosive vapors are not present. The propane heater on the right of
      the figure delivers 8,000 to 24,000 BTUs of portable, infrared heat from a common 20-lb propane
      cylinder. A number of variations are readily available o n the open market, including lar ger units
      designed to meet higher heating demands. Table 5.1. provides approximate propane fuel con-
      sumption information for various temperatures. In general, open flame heaters are dangerous,
      especially the unvented type. If they are used th e catalytic types are the safest. Electric heaters
      (Figure 5.3.) provide a safe alternative to open flame units provided temporary wiring and power
      sources can handle the extra load. Space heaters can b e obtained from various sources. BEAR
      assets contain units ( Figure 5.4.) that can be used in permanent structures or tents. Commercial
      space heaters may be available from local vendors. Some installation units may also have portable
      shop heaters which can be reassigned to more critical facilities.

       5.3.2.2. Cart-Type Ducted Heaters. Cart-type ducted heaters provide an excellent alternate heat
       source because combustion stays ou tside the structure being heated . The units may be ava ilable
       from organizations on base , such as aerospace ground equi pment (AGE) or communications
       squadrons, after requirements for aircraft sorties and other vital operations have been met.
       5.3.2.3. Improvised Heaters. The use of improvised heaters should be avoided except in cases of
       extreme cold and where no other alternative exists. The primary dangers inherent with improvised
       heating systems are the possibility for asphyxiation and fire hazard potential. Caution must be
110                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


         taken to ensure that dangerous fumes are vented during combus tion and any open flame is prop-
         erly contained. One of the most common types of improvised heaters consists of a 55-gallon drum
         converted for use as a burner coupled with makeshift sheet metal ducting to vent fumes to the out-
         side. Remember, improvised heaters do not completely contain combustion vapors. Therefore,
         even with vents to the outside, makeshift heaters should never be used in totally enclosed areas.

5.4. Air Conditioning Syste ms. Most, if not all, installations have some facilities that ca nnot function
properly without air conditioning a nd/or climate control support. T oday’s Air Force relies on sophisti-
cated electronics that supp ort the operation and maintenance of such things as aircraft navigation and
attack systems, computer systems, communications, and air traffic control equipment. These systems are
highly susceptible to heat build-up and fail rapidly if subjected to overheating conditions. This situation
makes air conditioning support critical to these mission-e ssential facilities. As a general rule, air condi-
tioning systems are more vulnerable than their heating counterparts. Most critical climate control system
components are located externally to the facility they serve and therefore are more susceptible to damage.
Two air conditioning or r efrigeration systems are used by the Air Force: the vapor compression system
and the absorption system. The vapor compression system is the most common.
      5.4.1. Repair of Air C onditioning Systems. Typical air conditi oning repairs tend to be manpower
      intensive and usually take a considerable amount of time. Like heating systems, air conditioning sup-
      port is highly dependent on a reliable electric supply. In addition to being time intensive, it is common
      to have a very large number of unit and system va riations present on the average base. These factors
      make developing an expedient repair strategy and standardized repair kit to satisfy all potential needs
      both cost prohibitive and virtually impossible. Expedient repairs may typically involve replacing parts
      and locating and repairing leaks within the system.
         5.4.1.1. Replacing Parts. If system rejuvenation is pl ausible and parts are not available in a stan-
         dardized repair kit, consider obtaining needed parts from similar units that support less critical
         functions.
         5.4.1.2. Leak Testing and Repair. If a mission-essential refrigeration unit is operable except for
         minor leaks after a natural disaster or damage from attack, the usual first course of action would be
         to charge the unit as a temporary measure and move on to the next issue. However, if the situation
         allows for a more concerted effort, permanent repairs should always be considered to avoid dupli-
         cation of effort. When a leak is found and repaired, the complete unit should be rechecked not only
         to confirm the repair, but also to ensure that there are no additional leaks.
             5.4.1.2.1. The method for leak testi ng varies with the refrigeran t used. However, most meth-
             ods involve applying pressure to the system with an inert gas, such as nitrogen or carbon diox-
             ide. With proper care, nitrogen or carbon dioxide may be used safely when pressure-testing for
             leaks. However, be aware that the pressure in a nitrogen cylinder is us ually about 2,000-psi
             and the pressure in a carbon dioxide cylinder is normally about 800-psi. Consequently, a pres-
             sure-reducing device that has both a pressure regulator and reli ef valve must always be used
             when testing with either of these gases. Check the system’s nameplate before conducting this
             type of test. In most cases, it will provide recommended testing pressures. If this information
             is not provided, UUnever UU test all or part of a hermetic sy stem at pressures exceeding
             170-psi.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            111


          5.4.1.2.2. Many companies recommend using the refrigerant in the system to test for leaks. In
          such situations, sensitive elect ronic leak detectors like thos e addressed below should be
          employed.
      5.4.1.3. Leak Detection Devices. As a general rule , refrigeration system leaks are usually very
      tiny and require sensitive dete cting devices. Commonly used detection devices include bubble
      solutions, fluorescent dye, and el ectronic detection devices such as the coro na discharge (Figure
      5.5.), heated diode (Figure 5.6.), and UV lamps. The newer electronic detectors can be used with
      R-134a, R-123, and other new alternative refrigerants.

      5.4.2. Alternative Air Conditioning Sources. If ai r conditioning systems cannot be expediently
      repaired after an attack or natu ral disaster, portable un its are the ideal w ay to go u ntil time and
      resources allow permanent repairs. A number of BTU vari ations are available that support air condi-
      tioning requirements, ranging from sm all area units to lar ge package configurations used for cooling
      entire buildings. Two examples of large portable units are shown in Figure 5.7.

Figure 5.7. Typical Large Portable Air Conditioning Units.




5.5. Electrical System. After an attack or disast er, power for airfield lighting, navigational aids
(NAVAIDS), communications centers, C2 nodes, medical facilities, and other important activities must be
restored before t he installation can resume its operational mission. If the attack or disaster resulted in
downed or damaged electrical lines, the repair or isolation of life-threatening electrical hazards must also
receive high priority.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 113


  5.5.1. Basic Safety Rules. Detailed safety procedures for electrical repair operations are contained in
  Air Force criteria and must be strictly followed. Electrical safety requirements in AFI 32-1064, Elec-
  trical Safe Practices, and UFC 3-560-01, Electrical Safety O&M, are mandatory and outline the type
  of arc thermal performance value (ATVP) rated PPE to wear when working on or near energized cir-
  cuits, when work on or near energized circuits is authorized, and who is the energized work authority.
  Table 4-2 in UFC 3-560-0 defines hazard./risk category classifications for work tasks. As outlined in
  AFI 32-1064 and UFC 3-560-01, work on or near energized lines and equipment is prohibited except
  in rare circumstances and then only when appr oved in advance by the BCE or equivalent. When
  authorized, the energized work will only be performed after the energized work permit completion is
  accomplished IAW AFI 32-1064.
  5.5.2. Primary and Secondary Circuits. The electrical s ystem can be divided into two major sub-
  systems: primary circuits and secondary circuits. Circuits above 600 volts are generally referred to as
  primary or feeder circuits. Circuits carrying less than 600 volts are usually referred to as low voltage
  or secondary circuits. Even in a contingency situation, work on the high-voltage primary systems will
  be performed only by craftsmen with specialized qualifications and equipment.
  5.5.3. Components of Electrical System. The electrical system supporting a typical installation
  consists of three components: pr oduction, distribution, and interior wiring. Each component of the
  system should be viewed in term s of its anticipated da mage during a continge ncy and the expedient
  repair techniques needed to adequately remedy the damage.
     5.5.3.1. Production Systems. At overseas installatio ns, electrical power is either supplied by
     base power plants or commercial sources. In the CONUS, primary power is most likely provided
     by a commercial grid. If the commercial source is interrupted, usually the only alternative is to dis-
     connect the impaired po wer source from the dist ribution system and su bstitute generators to
     power vital facilities. Most mission-essential facilities already have dedicated standby generators
     with an automatic transfer capability to maintain operations in the event the prime power is lost.
     5.5.3.2. Distribution Systems. The power distribution system may consist of substations,
     switchgear, and utility lines that are either overhead or underground. Overhead power lines and the
     associated utility poles are likely to suffer extensive damage during a hurricane, tornado, or enemy
     attack. An underground system, although better protected from th e high winds common to hurri-
     canes and tornadoes, is still vul nerable to the effects of an earthquake, flooding, or enemy muni-
     tions. There are three basic ty pes of distribution systems: radial, loop, and network. Any
     combination of these three systems can be found at most installations.
         5.5.3.2.1. Radial System. The radi al layout is one in which a mainline is established through
         the approximate center of an installation and branch lines are run from the main to power var-
         ious facilities. A very basic radial layout is shown in Figure 5.8. The primary disadvantage of
         the radial layout is that a break of wires at point "B" results in a complete loss of power to all
         facilities on the installation. Thus, the radial system is less effective since it is very susceptible
         to extreme weather conditions, war damage, a nd sabotage. However, since the radial system
         requires considerably less material, manpower, and time to construct, radial systems are often
         used during contingency beddowns.
         5.5.3.2.2. Loop System. A loop or ring layout supplies power to a facility from more than one
         direction as shown in Figure 5.9. Note that a break in the circ uit at point "A" will not cause
         complete power failure since power may still be distributed through the lower section of the
114                                                                        AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


             loop. Thus, a loop system has an inherent capabi lity to prevent complete power loss of all
             facilities. Faults in the circuit can be isolated and repaired without large disruption of service.
             In addition, the loop layout normally distributes power with less voltage drop. The primary
             disadvantage of the loop system is that it requires more material and time to construct than the
             radial system.

Figure 5.8. Basic Radial Layout.




Figure 5.9. Basic Loop Layout.




             5.5.3.2.3. Network System. A network system is simply a merger of both the radial and loop
             systems. In pa rticular, it uses the independent feeder system of the radi al system to supply
             power to distribution tran sformers while also paralleling th e secondary lines that are used in
             the loop concept. This c onfiguration capitalizes on the strong individual points of both the
             radial and loop systems, thereby allowing optimum flexibility and efficiency.
         5.5.3.3. Interior Wiring. After transmission and distribution systems, the “third leg” of the elec-
         trical system is the interior wiring. It generally consists of the electrical wiring, switches, outlets,
         circuit breakers, and other electrical accessories located within a building after the service
         entrance interface.
      5.5.4. Repairing Electrical Systems. After assessing the initial damage to an electrical system after
      an attack or disaster, the first action should be the isolation of those damaged areas presenting
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               115


  life-threatening hazards to personnel or posing the potential for additional property damage. Once ini-
  tial isolation is accomplished, damage control center (DCC) personnel, using installation utility plans
  and maps, determine how to best restore electrical power to vital installation facilities. Typically, this
  is accomplished by rerouting po wer lines to bypass damaged area s. After damage assessment data
  have been posted to the installati on utility maps, the DCC should be able to quickly direct electrical
  system rerouting using the existing, undamaged circuits. When rerouting around damaged areas,
  remember that non-standard materials can be used provided they do not jeopardize safety. If capable
  of carrying the required loads, wires and cables of different sizes or those normally designed for other
  uses may be substituted as expedient power lines. Strictly adhere to electrical safety requirements out-
  lined in previous paragraphs and ensure proper “phasing” of cond uctors is accomplished. Addition-
  ally, conductors, wire, and othe r components may be salvaged from unimportant or abandoned
  facilities.
     5.5.4.1. Repairing Power Production System. The extent of damage to an independent power pro-
     duction plant on the installation will vary with th e type of emer gency that has occurred. Natural
     disasters, such as hurric anes and tornadoes, are likely to cause st ructural damage to the plant as
     well as disrupt the plant’s connections to the distribution system . An enemy attack will probably
     cause structural damage and disruption of connections to the distribution system, and it may pro-
     duce damage to other components of the power system; e.g., demolished control equipment, bro-
     ken turbine blades, and shattered insulators and bushings. In re pairing such damage, take full
     advantage of bench stocks maintained by each power plant or draw on ba se supply sources. As a
     last resort, try cannibalization. Generators, as an alternate power source, will probably be in short
     supply, making it imperative that these vital assets be properly positioned and maintained. Gener-
     ators should be limite d to providing power to only those faci lities that are absolutely crucial to
     base operations. AFI 32-1063, Electric Power Systems, shall be used to determine those facilities
     that are authorized emergency or standby generators. Consider damaged or inoperative generators
     as a source of spare parts. Com ponents and parts from several da maged generators may be reas-
     sembled to produce one usable machine. Equipment other than disabled generators may serve as a
     source of repair parts; e.g., inje ctors from a diesel e ngine in a destroyed ve hicle can be salvaged
     and adapted to a generator engine.
     5.5.4.2. Repairing Power Distribution System. Expedient repairs to power distribution systems
     are limited by the extent of damage involved and av ailability of spare parts. A large part of most
     electrical distribution systems is composed of non-repairable items such as poles, insulators, cross
     arms, switch gear, and in most cases, transformers. Only a few items within the electrical distribu-
     tion system lend themselves to repair. Items such as conduct ors, grounding wires, guy wires,
     anchors, service entrances, and occasionally transformers fall into this category.
         5.5.4.2.1. Conductors. Overhead power lines may need to be hung from trees, existing struc-
         tures or new poles. In some instances, cutting the damaged line on both sides of the destruction
         and bridging the area with new cable may be n ecessary. If it does not pose a danger , run the
         new power cable directly on th e ground. It can always be pr operly buried or elevated when
         time and resources are more available. Low-volt age distribution cables can be placed or run
         along the ground. Conductors that cross roads or pathways must be buried or protected by
         some means at the crossing. Figure 5.10. and Figure 5.11. show two different techniques for
         such crossings. The former displays a commercial cable protector bei ng used, and the latter
         shows how to protect cables using PVC and sandbags. The latter figure also has the cables on
         both sides of the road protected from foot traffic by sandbags. Schedule 40 Polyvinyl Chloride

         (PVC) conduit with a diameter of 3 to 4 inches is suitable for expedient raceways under cross-
         ings. In applications for which excessively high roadway temperatures are expected, Schedule
         80 PVC should be used if available. For average temperatures over 90°F, the number of cables
         per raceway should be limited to three to prevent insulation overheating. In addition, the race-
         way in this application must also have at least 60 percent air space in its section to reduce the
         possibility of overheating.

Figure 5.10. Commercial Cable Protector Across Roadway.




            5.5.4.2.1.1. Cable Burial Requirements. As manpow er becomes available, the cables that
            were placed on the ground should be direct-buried to protect them from threat, equipment,
            and personnel damage; to prevent deterioration by the elements; and to improve their cur-
            rent- carrying ability. In moderate temperature locations, a burial depth of 8 inches for sec-
            ondary cable and 18 inches for primary cable is normally adequate. However , in sites
            where high temperature is anticipated, ensure that the secondary cable has at least 12 to 16
            inches of cover.

            5.5.4.2.1.2. Buri ed Cable Grounding. To save time and labor , distribution cables can be
            placed in trenches along with water and san itary lines. To reduce personnel exposure to
            electrical hazard, it is highl y advisable to place a bare c opper conductor in the trench
            alongside the cables if the cable does not have concentric neutral wires inside the cable
            jacket. This conductor must be bare and solidly attached to the generator ground terminal
            and to the f rames of al l connected electrical eq uipment. The size of the bare conductor
            should be close to the size of the largest insulated conductor in the trench.
         5.5.4.2.2. Grounding W ires and Rods. Proper grounding of elect rical systems is essential to
         the safe operation of the system. Grounding is most of ten accomplished by driving ground
         rods into the ground with a minimum 1/0 American Wire Gage (AWG) bare copper wire from
         the ground rod to either the device or system to be grounded. The spacing and depth of ground
         rods depends upon the resistance to ground to the earth at the site. In the absence of the capa-
         bility to measure the resistance to ground and determine actual grounding requirements for the
         site, use a 3/4-inch diameter metal water pipe with at least 10 feet in contact with the earth, or
         a ground rod driven at least 8 fe et into the earth or into th e permanent ground water level, if
         known. Electrical continuity is essential in agrounding system; therefore, all connections must
         be clean and properly bonded. The design and application of grounding to an electrical system
         should normally be inherent in the system installation and not something that is added at a later
         date.
         5.5.4.2.3. Guys (Wires and Anchors). Expedient repairs to guys usually involve replacing or
         resetting guy wires and anchors while raising new poles or br acing existing poles. In new
         work, guys should generally be installed before power line wires are strung. In reconstruction
         work, guys should be installed before making any changes in the line wires while at the same
         time being careful not to place excessive pu ll on the pole and wi res already in position.
         Improperly or inadequately guyed power lines will soon begin to sag, degrading the reliability
         of the line. When replacing guy wires, determine the condition of the pole before removing the
118                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


           old guy wire. If the pole is we ak, it should be securely bra ced before any changes in pole
           strains are made. Make sure the guy wire is installed so there is minimal interference with the
           climbing space on the pole, and guys should clear all energized wires. In some cases, it may be
           necessary to install a guy hook to prevent the guy from slipping down the pole. Position these
           hooks so they do not interfere with climbing and cannot be used as steps. Where guys are lia-
           ble to cut into the surface of a pole, protect the pole by installing a guy plate at the attachment
           point. The plate should be well secured to the pol e to prevent the possibility of injury to a
           worker climbing up or down the pole. When guys are installed near roadways, position them
           so they do not interfere with st reet or roadway traf fic. Guys located near streets should be
           equipped with yellow traffic guards (sometimes called "anchor shields"). Any guy wires con-
           taining snarls or kinks should not be used for line work, and it is preferable to use guy wires of
           the correct length to avoid unnecessary splices. The type of anchor used in these repairs must
           provide suitable resistance to up lift and is therefore dependen t on the condition of the soil.
           Table 5.2. indicates suitable anchor types based on a range of soils from hard to soft. While the
           soil descriptions are not an i ndustry standard, manufacturers are familiar with this or similar
           classifications. For the majority of cases, the most suitable anchor is an expanding type ( Fig-
           ure 5.12.), because most lines are installed in ordinary soils.

         5.5.4.2.4. Service Entrances. During the aftermath of an attack or disaster, it may become nec-
         essary to repair or build ne w service entrances with expedi ent methods and materials. New
         installations would be intended as temporary measures only and would be upgraded as the sit-
         uation stabilizes or used where the location isintended only as a one-time, short-term develop-
         ment. An electrical service entrance is the point at which electrical service enters a facility, and
         it normally consists of a main junction box, circuit breakers or fuses, and any other equipment
         located between the main junctio n and service drop, including meters. An e xpedient service
         entrance can be constructed as follows:
             5.5.4.2.4.1. If service entrance cable is available, a weather head can be formed with plas-
             tic electrician’s tape that will effectively seal moisture out of the cable insulation for a ser-
             vice entrance purpose (Figure 5.13.). Individually insulated wires can be bundled, tied
             with marline, and wrapped with tape to form a service en trance cable. Should plastic tape
             not be available, friction tape can be us ed to wrap the cabl e; however, if friction tape is
             used, it should be coated with varnish to render it waterproof before installation.
             5.5.4.2.4.2. Normally, split bolt connectors or compression splices will be used to connect
             the service entrance conductors to the service drop conduc tors. In a n emergency where
             both conductors are solid, terminal loops can be turned in the conductors and a bolt with
             two washers can be used to make the connection ( Figure 5.14.). This type of connection
             should be taped on all hot conductors, but tape is not required for the neutral conductor.
120                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008

             5.5.4.2.4.3. If circuit breaker panels or mains are not available, using safety switches for
             service equipment can protect light loads. It may be necessary to bridge one set of contacts
             inside the switch so that the neutral will be a solid, unbroken circuit. The hot circuits can
             then be fused to the proper ampaci ty through the operating contacts ( Figure 5.15.). Keep
             in mind that this is an emergency situation and that the fuses should be well below the
             ampacity of the branch circuits installed to protect the ins ulation of these br anch circuits.
             Regardless of circumstances, some method must be provided to open all circuits within the
             structure with a maximum of five hand motions.

          5.5.4.2.5. Transformer Repair. Expedient repair of transformers can be accomplished if the
          damage is not too extensive. Cracks or holes in the tank can be patched by welding, provided
          testing indicates that internal windings have not been compromised. T ransformers can be
          returned to service after being thoroughly dried and replacing lost or contaminated oil. Keep in
          mind that oil from damaged transformers must be filtered be fore being reused and that motor
          oil is not a satisfactory substitute for transformer use (a transformer requires a highly refined
          mineral oil free from moisture or other impurities). In most case s, there will not be s ufficient
          spare transformers available to provide a one-for -one replacement for damaged units. For
          example, you may not have a single-phase transformer with the capacity for the required load.
          In such a case, it may be necessary to parallel two smaller transformers in order to supply the
          load (Figure 5.16.). This expedient solution will solve an immediate problem, but it is not cost
          effective and should be replaced when the correct equipment becomes available. In a situation
          where three-phase power is n eeded and one transformer out of the three is damaged,
          three-phase power can still be provided by making what are commonly called open-delta con-
          nections. Figure 5.17. shows the open-delta connection wh en a four-wire, three-phase wye
          primary is involved. Figure 5.18. illustrates the connections that must be made to achieve the
          open-delta connection when a three-wire, three-phase delta primary is involved. Regardless of
          the type of primary involved, these connections are used only for emer gency situations and
          should not be constructed as per manent installations. The two transf ormers used in the
          open-delta connection will only supply 86.6 percent of their rated capacity. The total capacity
          of the bank will be only 57.7 percent of the original bank capacity.

      5.5.4.3. Repairing Interior W iring. Expedient repairs to the interi or wiring of a structure depend
      on the extent of da mage and the criticality of th e facility. If t he facility is not criti cal to current
      base recovery operations, delay repairs until additional resources are available. For facilities con-
      sidered essential to base operations, determin e the minimum level of required electrical service.
      Does an entire structure need power or only a small portion of it? What type of equipment will the
      electrical system of the building be required to support? Will it only need minimum electrical volt-
      age to provide lighting, or are th ere requirements for specialized voltages to power large air con-
      ditioning units, refrigerati on units, or X-ray machines? For exam ple, there is no need to devote
      excessive manpower and materials to complete restoration of the base hospital’s electrical system
      if the hospital staf f needs only one section of th e building and one X-ray machine. In this case,
      electrical wiring in this section of the building could be restored and a special high-voltage cable
      could be run to operate the X-ray machine.
          5.5.4.3.1. When making expedient repairs to the interior wiring, use undamaged wiring to the
          maximum extent possible. This will cut repair time and r esult in fewer exposed live circuits
          when the facility is returned to operation. As with distribution systems, damaged areas can be
          bypassed with new wiring to complete a vital circuit.
          5.5.4.3.2. When bypassing damaged areas or running temporary lines into a structure, wiring
          can be run across floors and other building surfaces to expedite repairs. However, if the facility
          will have a high volume of pers onnel traffic, tack the wiring to the wall or ceiling to prevent
          further damage or hazards. The temporary wiring does not have to be conc ealed to present a
          finished appearance; it only needs to be functional and out of the way of heavy traffic (Figure
          5.19.).

              5.5.4.3.3. Another important consideration in the expedient repair of in terior electrical sys-
              tems is the supply of wiring, switches, and a ssociated hardware needed to make repairs.
              Depending on the extent of damage, base supply sources may not have adequate levels to pro-
              vide for all repair needs. In these cases, cannibalization and substitution become very impor-
              tant. At theater locations, many components will be of foreign manufacture and not readily
              available through US supply channels, making it imperative that repair crews salvage as much
              as possible. Structures declared irreparable may contain switches, wiring, and other hardware
              that can be u sed to res tore electrical services to other structures. A note of caution: do not
              inflict additional or unnecessary damage duri ng salvage attempts. S tructures being s alvaged
              may have to be rehabilitated in the future.
      5.5.5. Foreign Wiring Systems. Another type of contingency situation involves reactivating an estab-
      lished installation in a foreign country. In this case, the facilities on the installation would be intact but
      possibly requiring renovation or modifications.
          5.5.5.1. Foreign Systems Interface. The primary di fference between US and foreign wiring sys-
          tems is that most foreign systems have not be en installed according to the standards outlined by
          the US National Electric Code (NEC). This fact may be attributed largely to the material shortages
          in many foreign countries, particularly economica lly depressed nations, which have dictated the
          use of materials at hand. Additional details rega rding material variance s and electrical system
          comparisons are described in the following paragraphs.
              5.5.5.1.1. Voltage. The U.S. uses nominal voltages th at range from 120 to 240 volts for sin-
              gle-phase alternating current (AC) and 208 to 600 volts for three-phase AC in low-voltage dis-
              tribution systems. A considerable number of foreign countries use other voltages, requiring
              our electrical equipment to be converted, modified, or operated inefficiently when powered by
              these foreign electrical systems.
              5.5.5.1.2. Frequency. The standard frequency of AC distribution in the US is 60 Hertz (Hz). In
              many foreign lands, 50-c ycle frequency genera tion is common; but the electrician may also
              encounter frequencies such as 25, 40, 42, and 100 cycles. General guidelines for using 60 Hz
              electrical equipment on 50 Hz power sources is provided in paragraph 5.5.5.4.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             125


        5.5.5.1.3. Materials. The wiring materials commonl y used in foreign countries are normally
        peculiar to the country’s manufacture. The US employs the American Wire Gage (AWG) sys-
        tem, which is peculiar to US installations. Most foreign wire will differ in size and use. Also,
        receptacles, switches, and plugs used in foreign wiring systems are different and normally can-
        not be mated or used with similar American -manufactured components. Be aware that prob-
        lems may be cr eated when dissimila r ma terials are used interchangeably in a
        power-distribution system. The close association of dissimilar metals may cause galvanic cor-
        rosion at the joints that eventually destroys the usefulness of the equipment. This is a particular
        concern when aluminum and copper are joined. New materi als are especially made for con-
        nection to copper or aluminum with no adverse ef fects and will be a ppropriately marked.
        Except in emergency expedient installation, dissimilar metals must never be used together . If
        aluminum is exclusively used in a system, a special joint compound must be applied to all con-
        nections or joints to protect against excess surface oxidation. Th e oxide of an aluminum con-
        ductor differs from copper oxide in that it adds a high contact resistance to the wire.
     5.5.5.2. Expedient Procedures Involving Foreign Systems. During contingency operations in a
     foreign country, the Air Force may use all or part of an electrical system on a foreign installation.
     Though the decision of employment is largely determined by the immediate circumstances, the
     Air Force electrician or unit commander will foll ow one of two general procedures as outlined
     below.
        5.5.5.2.1. Since the electrical components of a fo reign and domestic electrical system cannot
        be interchanged, the decision may be made to use all foreign equipment. The obvious problem
        in this decision is one of supply. The parts needed may not be readily available.
        5.5.5.2.2. If time is a consequential factor , consideration should be given to the use of stan-
        dard electrical items made in the US and the modification of plugs or connections so that they
        may be used in the foreign sy stem. Although this method usually results in decreased operat-
        ing efficiency, the ease of adaptability and abundance of supplies usually outweigh the reduc-
        tion in performance.
     5.5.5.3. Different Voltage Effects. Whenever possible, all equipment should be operated at its
     rated voltage. To expedite foreign system use, items built to operate at standard American voltages
     may have to function at dif ferent voltages. T hough such items may not be operated ef ficiently,
     their availability for use may be an important military need. Some effects of voltage differences on
     common electrical devices are explained below.
        5.5.5.3.1. Lighting Fixtures. When fluorescent lamps are operated at voltages higher than
        standard, both the lamp and ballast life are shortened. Line voltages below the minimum of the
        operating ranges of 1 10-125, 199-216, or 220-250 vo lts will cause uncertain star ting, short
        lamp life, and reduced lighting efficiency. When incandescent lamps are used and operated at
        voltages higher than their ratings of 114, 120, and 125 volts, they also have a shortened lamp
        life below that expec ted; but their light output is increased. Conv ersely, if the line voltage of
        operation is below standard, the life of the la mp is increased; but the lighting ef ficiency is
        reduced approximately 3 percent for each 1 percent drop in rated voltage.
        5.5.5.3.2. Motors. Ro tating equipment, such as motors an d fans, is usually manufactured to
        operate with a permissible volta ge variation of 10 percent with in their prescribed rating. The
        combined voltage and frequency variation is al so limited to 1 0 percent. Higher voltages give
126                                                                    AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


         increased torque, increased ef ficiency, and increased starting temperature. Operating at volt-
         ages differing from rated voltages by more th an 10 percent may be permitted only in an
         extreme emergency since the eq uipment may be damaged or ev en destroyed by such ope ra-
         tions.
      5.5.5.4. Different Frequency Effects. Electrical operating items based on resistance characteristics
      (such as heaters, hot plates, and electric sto ves) operate efficiently over all ranges of distribution
      frequencies used throughout the US and foreign territories. Rotating equipment and items such as
      lights and transmission or receivi ng equipment are adversely af fected by variations in frequency.
      Some of the effects of frequency changes on this type of equipment are described below.
         5.5.5.4.1. Resistive Load s. Fluorescent lights rated to oper ate at a nominal 60-cycle current
         can be used at 50 cycles, but with a shorter ball ast life. At lower than 60-cycle frequencies, a
         noticeable flicker in the light output can be de tected. This is undesirable where painstaking
         and meticulous work is being performed. Operation at lower frequency is not satisfactory and
         should be avoided. Incandescent lights, because of their resistance design, will operate satis-
         factorily at all of the frequencies encountered overseas. However, lamps designed to function
         at 60 Hz will not burn as brightly at 50 Hz and ovens will not be as hot.
         5.5.5.4.2. Static Induction Devices. Distribution transformers, electric discharge lighting bal-
         lasts, series lighting current regulators, and other static inductive equipment induce magnetic
         energy fields in iron as part of their normal operation. The magnetic flux density is directly
         proportional to the volts/hertz ratio of the pow er source. Consequently, the voltage must be
         reduced proportionally to maintain the volts/hertz ratio at the design point.
         5.5.5.4.3. Transmitting Equipment. All receiving and transmitting equipment, or other items
         which have transformers included in their wiring, will not operate satisfactorily either below
         or above their rated line freque ncy and should be used only in an emergency. In some cases,
         there may be frequency converters available, part icularly in flight line operations, which can
         be obtained and used when the equipment operation is mission essential.
         5.5.5.4.4. Induction Motors. Induction motors rated for 60 Hz operation will run at about 5/6
         of rated speed when connected to a 50 Hz source. Consequently, if a motor is nominally rated
         to run at 1800 rpm at 60 cycles and is operated at50 cycles, its output speed will be reduced to
         approximately 1500 rpm. Motor current varies inversely with both source frequency and volt-
         age. As the 50 Hz source voltage is reduced, motor current heating the winding increases while
         iron loss heating is decreasing. No amount of voltage reduction can compensate for both heat-
         ing effects simultaneously. However, induction motors rated at 120V, 60 Hz will operate suc-
         cessfully at about 110V, 50 Hz if the speed reduction can be tolerated. Keep in mind that some
         motors are built to function at either 50 or 60 cycles.
      5.5.5.5. Elec tric Motor Voltage/Hertz Variation Remedies. Corrective me asures for two of the
      more common major electric motor problems re lated to voltage and he rtz incompatibilities are
      provided below.
         5.5.5.5.1. Motor Heating Due to Iron Saturation. Motor geometry establishes a design volts/
         hertz ratio. As addressed earlier, if the motor will be operated at less than designed frequency,
         then the voltage must be reduced proportionately (5/6) to maintain the vo lts/hertz ratio at or
         below the design limit.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  127


            5.5.5.5.2. Reduced Moto r Shaft Speed. Shaft speed is a function of source frequency and
            motor configuration. The coupling to the drive load often invol ves belts, pulleys, chains, or
            gears. A change in drive ratio s could cor rect the speed. Howe ver, many loads operat e ade-
            quately at 5/6 of design speed.
   5.5.6. Miscellaneous Reference Ma terial. The next few page s list reference information regarding
   load-carrying capacity of wire, load cu rrent and circuit breaker sizes for AC motors, a description of
   common AWG wire sizes, types, and general uses along with pole sizing and setting specifications.
         5.5.6.1. Wire Size and Voltage Drop Determination. The size of wire for a given section of a sys-
         tem is selected based on the amount of electrical load that it must carry and on the allowable volt-
         age drop. Note the larger the wire size, the greater its capacity and the less resistance it will have,
         hence, less voltage drop. Economy, however, should be considered in size determination. Table
         5.3. shows the KVA (kilovolts-amperes) and current-carrying capacities for wires ranging from
         No. 8 to a 4/0. In addition, Table 5.4. lists current and circuit breaker sizes for AC motors.

           provides information re garding common AWG wire sizes, types, and app lications. In addition,
           Table 5.5., Table 5.6., and Table 5.7. list the wire sizes for 120-volt, single-phase circuits, number
           of wires allowable in various conduits, and th e wire sizes for 240-volt, single-phase circuits,
           respectively. Lastly, Figure 5.21. shows four of the more common wire splice techniques in use
           today.
              5.5.6.2.1. Copper Conductors. Copper has high conductivity and is easily spliced. Hard-drawn
              or medium-hard-drawn copper is desirable for distribution conductors because of its strength.
              Since heating and cooling redu ces the wire's tensile stre ngth from 50,000-psi to 35,000-psi,
              soldered splices should not be used on hard-drawn copper wire because the hot solder weakens
              the joints. Splicing sleeves are normally used when making joints.

          5.5.6.2.2. Steel Conductors. Steel wire used as a conductor permits long spans because of its
          high tensile strength. S teel has a bout 10 to 15 percent as much conductivity size-for-size as
          copper, but the short life and lo w conductivity of steel wire ar e overcome, to some extent, by
          the use of copper-clad steel made by welding a copper coating to the steel wire.
          5.5.6.2.3. Weatherproofing. Triple-braid weatherproofing is preferred to double braid.
          Improved types of weatherproofing include plastic covering and layers of impregnated unspun
          cotton or impregnated rubber filler. Before these newer type coverings are u sed, approval
          should be obtained from the higher command having jurisdiction.

          5.5.6.2.4. Primary Distribution. For primary distribution below 5,000 volts, either bare or
          weatherproof conductors may be used. The ordina ry weatherproof covering is not to be con-

            sidered as insulation, although it does prevent breakdowns on the lower primary voltages
            caused by conductors swinging together . For all primary distribution over 5,000 volts, bare
            conductors are ordinarily used.
            5.5.6.2.5. Sec ondary Distribution. Weatherproof wires are us ed for secondary distribution.
            The weatherproof coveri ng is an ef fective insulation fo r secondary voltages, permitting
            rack-type distribution and closely spaced secondary conductors. No wire smaller than a No. 8
            should be used for secondary distribution or for any external transmission of power.

      rule, lines carrying over 240 volts are supporte d on poles while those carrying 120 to 240 volts
      may be supported on masts or insulators attached to buildings. Service wire s should be kept a t
      least 3 feet from windows and 8 inches above flat roofs. Since theater of operations electrical dis-
      tribution systems are exclusively overhead systems, wooden poles similar to those used in civilian
      construction are used to carry the conductors. Unlike civilian constructi on, cross arms are not
      often used at overseas installa tions. Instead, conductors are hung directly on the pole, one above
      the other.
         5.5.6.3.1. Pole Selection. The poles used in a distribution system should consist of a good
         grade of timber that will last. Good pressure-treated Texas southern pine, for example, can be
         expected to last 35 to 50 years. Conversely, untreated local timb er such as soft pine may last
         only a couple of years and have a useful life of only one season under unfavorable conditions.
         However, the fact that a pole is in good condition is not proof that it can satisfactorily support
         the line. Poles must withstand column loadings aswell as transverse loads from wind and turns
         in the line.
         5.5.6.3.2. Pole Height and Class. Table 5.8. shows the required heights and classes of poles
         for various types of loadings in military installations. The smaller a class number the sturdier
         the pole. The class of a given pole depends on its length, di ameter, and the materi al from
         which it is made. The height is governed by restrictions both above and below the proposed
         conductors. Near airfields, poles must be kept low, yet high enough to provide adequate clear-
         ance over streets and roads. Co rner poles, transformer poles, and the like are usually one or
         more classes heavier and sometimes 5 feet higher than line poles. Table 5.9. gives the required
         classes for transformer poles.

           Six-inch minimum spacing is re quired for spans up to and incl uding 200 feet while 12-inch
           minimum spacing is required for spans over 200 feet. A clear space is always left at the top of
           an electrical pole. This distance is equal to the wire spacing, that is, 6 inches for 200-foot spans
           and less and 12 inches for spans greater than 200 feet.
           5.5.6.3.4. Setting Poles. Poles should be set deep enough to develop their full bending strength
           at the ground line. Table 5.10. gives the recommended setting de pths in soil and in rock. The
           actual setting or installation of the poles is done by one of three methods: by hand, with a
           crane, or by using a nearby pole as a gin pole.

          5.5.6.3.5. Clearances. Minimum clearances of conductors over ground, rails, and other objects
          are given in Figure 5.22. Special consideration must be gi ven to railroad yards and material
          handling areas. Allow a minimum horizontal clearance of 11 inches from the outside face of a
          curb or roadbed to the face of the pole to prevent damage by vehicles. The clearances shown
          may be decreased in theater of operations construction where safety factors are reduced. The
          engineer officer must use sound judgment in establishing minimum clearances for a given
          project, taking into account materials available, military necessity, urgency of the project, and
          other factors.

       5.5.6.4. Frequency and Voltage Data. Different power frequencies and voltages are used in differ-
       ent parts of the world. In the US, 60 Hz is the most common frequency and secondary distribution
       voltages of 120/208, 120/240, and 277/480 are common. Table 5.11. provides an extensive list of
       frequencies and secondary voltages for commercial power systems in many foreign lands and US
       territories. This data is subject to change so always verify before beginning work.

                                                  Chapter 6

                      CONSTRUCTING EXPEDIENT SANITATION FACILITIES

6.1. Introduction. Sanitation during beddown operations or contingencies in cludes providing facilities
for disposal of human waste and ba sic personal hygiene. Prepackaged de ployable facilities like those in
Figure 6.1. are part of BEAR packages that support deployed forces when there are inadequate or no san-
itary systems available. However , expedient methods must be available to provide crude, temporary
amenities until these deployable prepackaged facilities arrive.

6.2. Overview. This chapter presents basic data and concepts to help personnel provide rudimentary san-
itation facilities for initially deployed forces and during contingencies. These concepts can be expanded
by duplication to support additiona l people but are not c onsidered long-term solutions. Facilities
addressed in this chapt er consist of expedient field latrines, urin als, and hand-washi ng stations. These
concepts should help personnel accomplish the minimum requirements for sanitation needs until addi-
tional, more permanent resources are obtained.

Figure 6.1. Typical Deployment Package Sanitary Asset.




6.3. Human Waste Disposition Policy. Air Force policy directs that hum an waste be disposed of with
good sanitary practices; and the Air Force must comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws
for human waste. Few laws specifical ly address human waste disposal in the field; nevertheless, proper
human waste disposal is essential to maintaining good health and requires command emphasis at all lev-
els. For more information on managing waste disposal, see AFH 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental Guide
for Contingency Operations Overseas, and FM 3-100.4, Environmental Considerations in Military Oper-
ations.
      6.3.1. Responsibilities. At installation level, base engineers ar e responsible for constructing, main-
      taining, and operating fixed sewage systems. Commanders are responsible for providing human waste
      disposal facilities in the field. During contingencie s when deployable kits ar e not available, engineer
      support will be required to construct various types of field disposal devices.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  147


   6.3.2. Field Facility Considerations. The type of field latrine selected for a given situation depends
   on a number of factors–the number ofpersonnel, the duration of the stay at the site, and geological and
   climatic conditions. Preventive-medicine personnel can assist in determining the right type, location,
   number, and size of latrines. The locations of base camp latrines are usually a compromise between
   the requirement for separation from dining facilities and water sources and convenience for personnel.
   Multiple latrine sites are clearly necessary for larger base camps. Sanitation and maintenance are crit-
   ical to prevent disease transmission to and from personnel.

6.4. Latrine Facilities. Expedient latrin es are basic versions of either pit or aboveground drum- type
latrines. They are intended for temporary use until more suitable facilities are erected or while an existing
sanitary sewer system is being rehabilitated.
   6.4.1. Basic Field Requirements. The following general rules apply to constructing all types of pit
   latrines, except cat holes. T o ensure that food a nd water are protected from contamination, latrines
   should be at least 100 yards from the dining facility a nd 100 feet from the nearest water source.
   Latrines should not be dug below the groundwater table or where they may drain into a water source.
   (The groundwater table can be determined from information given by local inhabitants or excavating
   to the groundwater table.) Latrines are usually built at least 30 yards from the end of the unit area but
   within a reasonable distance for easy access. They should be lighted at night if the military situation
   permits. If lights cannot be u sed, tie pieces of cord or tape to trees or stakes as guides to the latrines.
   Note: Latrines must be policed daily. Specific unit personnel are to be assigned the responsibility of
   ensuring that the latrines are always properly maintained.
       6.4.1.1. Drainage and Fly Control. Place a canvas or b rush screen around each latrine or
       enclose it in a tent. If possible, heat the shelter in cold cl imates. Dig a draina ge ditch around the
       screen or tent to prevent water from flowing over the ground into the latrine. For fly control, spray
       the shelter with an insecticide twice a week. If fly problems persist, spray the pit contents and box
       interior twice a week with a residual insecticide.
       6.4.1.2. Latrine Closing Procedures. Close a latrine pit when it is f illed to within 1 f oot of the
       surface or when it is being abandoned. Remove the latrine box and close as follows: (1) fill the pit
       to the surface with successive, 3-inch layers of earth and pack each layer down, (2) place a l-foot
       mound of dirt over the length of the pit to prevent fly pupa from getting out of the closed latrine,
       and (3) install a rectangular sign on top of the mound. The sign should indicate the type of pit and
       the date closed; include the unit designation in non-operational areas.
   6.4.2. Types of Field Latrines.
       6.4.2.1. Pit Latrines. There are several versions of the pit latrine and as the name suggests, it
       involves digging a pit in the ground. This type of latrine is normally used where the groundwater
       table is deep enough to prevent gr oundwater contamination or water standing in the latrine pit. It
       is also limited to areas that are free of impervious rock formations near the surface. The pit latrines
       addressed in th is chapter include the cat hole, cross tree, s traddle tree, deep pit, and bore hole
       latrines. Alternatives to pit latrines are available for locations where a high groundwater table or a
       rock formation near the surface prevents digging a pit of adequate depth. They will be addressed
       later in this chapter.
           6.4.2.1.1. Cat Hole Latrine. The simplest of all pit latrines and fiel d human waste disposal
           devices is the cat hole latrine (see Figure 6.2.). This latrine is used by individuals on the move
148                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


          or when on patrol (if individual waste collection bags are not available) and is covered imme-
          diately after use. It is also used in situations where latrine facilities are not available. As indi-
          cated in the drawing, a cat hole latrine should be dug at least 1 foot wide and 1 foot deep. After
          use, replace and repack the removed soil.

Figure 6.2. Cat Hole Latrine.




          6.4.2.1.2. Cross Tree Latrine. Another very basic latrine is the cross tree type (see Figure
          6.3.). One latrine will usually se rve the needs of 6 to 8 personne l. As might be expected, the
          latrine is situated downwind from the beddown area, but not so far from the shelter s as to
          encourage individuals to break sanitary dis cipline. In areas where it is dif ficult to dig a pit,
          ration boxes or similar material should be used to collect waste. A urinal, designated for each
          shelter, should also be located within 4 to 5 mete rs (4 to 5 yards) of th e shelter. Urinal varia-
          tions are provided elsewhere in this chapte r. A windbreak of boughs, tarpaulins, ponchos, or
          snow wall can be constructed to provide both privacy and protect the latrine from the wind.

Figure 6.3. Cross Tree Latrine.




          6.4.2.1.3. Straddle Trench Latrine. The most common type of latrine for temporary (one to
          three days) beddowns is the straddle trench or straddle pit latrine (see Figure 6.4.). A straddle
          trench latrine is usually dug 1 foot wide, 2 1/2 feet deep, and 4 feet long. In this configuration,
          it will accommodate two people at the same time. Provide straddle trenches to serve at least 4
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               149


          percent of the unit's male strength and 6 percent of the female strength. Thus, for a unit of 100
          men and 100 women, at least four latrines are needed for the men and six for the women. Place
          the trenches at least 2 feet apart. As shown in the drawing, there are no seats with this type of
          latrine. Instead, boards may be placed along both sides of the trench to provide better footing.
          Place toilet paper on a su itable holder and protect it from bad weather wi th a tin can or other
          covering. Remove the earth and pile it at the end of the trench so that each individual can prop-
          erly cover his excreta and toilet paper.

Figure 6.4. Typical Straddle Trench Latrine.




          6.4.2.1.4. Deep Pit Latrine. The deep pit latrine is used f or longer periods of time and in
          built-up areas. As shown in Figure 6.5., it is used with a latrine box. The standard latrine box
          has four seats and is 8 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide at the base. A unit of 100 men requires two
          four-seat latrine boxes. Cover th e holes with fly-proof, self-clo sing lids. Fly proof the cracks
          with strips of wood or tin. Place a metal deflector (can be made with a flattened can) inside the
          front of the box to prevent urine from soaking into the wood.
             6.4.2.1.4.1. Dig the pit about 2 feet wide and 7 1/2 feet long. This will give the latrine box
             3 inches of support on all si des. The depth of the pit depe nds on the estimated length of
             time the latrine is to be us ed. As a rough guide, allow a dept h of 1 foot for each week of
             estimated use, plus 1 foot for the dirt cover when closed. Rock or high groundwater levels
             often limit the depth of the pit, but it should be no deeper than 6 feet. Support may be
             needed in some types of soil to prevent the sides from collapsing. If so, use planking or a
             similar material. Pack the ear th tightly ar ound the bottom ed ges of the box to seal any
             openings through which flies might enter. Note: If the ground is too hard for digging or if
             the water table is too high, use a pail latrine or a burnout latrine instead. Both are described
             elsewhere in this chapter.
             6.4.2.1.4.2. To prevent flies from breeding and to reduce odors, keep the latrine box clean,
             the seat lids closed, and the cracks sealed. Maintain a good fly control program in the area.
             Applying lime to the pi t contents or burning it does not ef fectively control flies or odor.
             The box and latrine seats should be scrubbed with soap and water daily.

          6.4.2.1.5. Portable Latrines. The portable latrine uses a latr ine box similar to the deep pit
          latrine except the latrine box is built inside a portable structure that offers limited privacy and
          protection from the elements. If prepackaged deployable sanitation assets are delayed during a
          sizeable deployment or beddown activity; this more substantial portable latrine may serve
          large groups better than some of the other expedient options discussed in this chapter. Portable
          latrines vary; however, all are built on the same basic precepts of mobility, adequate ventila-
          tion, proper sanitation, and reasonable privacy. Once the supporting pit is filled, the latrine is
          simply relocated to another spot, usually in the same vicinity, and the old pit is then filled and
          closed as discussed previously. Figure 6.6. shows an example of this type of facility.

          6.4.2.1.6. Bored Hole Latrine. A bored hole latrine consists of a hole that is about 18 inches
          in diameter and 15 to 20 fe et deep. As indicated in Figure 6.7., a one-hole latrine box covers
          it. The actual diameter is not cr itical, so make it as lar ge as available augers permit. Remove
          both ends of a metal drum and sink it into the ground to serve as a box. Make a fly-proof seat
          cover with a se lf-closing lid to fit the top of th e drum. If a drum is no t available, construct a
          fly-proof, wooden box that is 18 inches high. A bored hole latrine is sa tisfactory for small
          units.
      6.4.2.2. Expedient Latrines in High Groundwater Areas. Latrines should not be dug below
      the groundwater table or where they may drain into a water source. The groundwater table can be
      determined from information give n by loc al inhabitants or exca vating to the groundwater table.
      The latrines described below ar e normally used where the groundwater table is high and ground-
      water contamination or water sta nding in the latrine pit is probable. They are also ideal when an
      impervious rock formation is close to the surface, preventing adequate dispersal of liquids.
          6.4.2.2.1. Mound Latrine. A dirt mound makes it possible to build a deep-pit latrine without
          the pit extending into water or rock. Construct a mound of earth that is at least 6 feet wide and
          12 feet long. It must be able to suppor t a four-hole latrine box . The mound sh ould be high
          enough to meet the pit's depth requirement. Allow 1-foot from the base of the pit to the water
          or rock level. Break up or plow the area where it is to be placed to aid in seepage of liquids
          from the pit. If timber is available, build a crib of desired height to enclose the pit and support
          the latrine box. Build the mound and compact it in successive l-foot layers to the top of the crib
          as shown in Figure 6.8. Roughen the surface of each layer before adding the next. If timber for
          a crib is unavailable, construct the mound to the desired height in l-foot layers, as described
          and dig the pit into the mound. If necessary, brace the walls w ith wood, sandbag s, or other
          material to prevent them from collapsing. Fly proof and enclose a mound latrine as described
          in paragraph 6.4.1.1. Note: The size of the mound base depends on the type of soil in the area.
          Make the mound larger if the slope is steep. Also, it may be necessary to build steps up a steep
          slope.

         6.4.2.2.2. Burn Out Latrine. A burn out latrine (Figure 6.9.) is particularly suitable for jun-
         gle areas with high groundwater tables. It has also been extremely useful in the past in desert
         regions where an impervious rock layer lay a short distan ce under the sand. When using this
         technique, ensure the burning location is downw ind of the base camp. For a unit of 100 men
         and 100 women, at least eight men's latrines and eight women's latrines are needed. As shown
         in Figure 6.10., construct a burn out latrine by first placing a 55-gallon drum in the ground.
         Leave enough of the drum above the ground for a comfortable sitting height. The drum may be
         cut in half, making two latrines of less capacity . Place a wooden seat with a fly-proof,
         self-closing lid on top of the drum. Weld handles to the sides of the drum, allowing two men to
         carry it with ease, because drums must be moved before the contents are burned. Have two sets
         of drums, if possible, so one set can be used while the other set is being burned out. Encourage
         male personnel to urinate in a urine disposal facility rather than a burn out latrine because
         more fuel is required to clean a latrine with a liquid content. Burn the contents of each drum
         daily by adding sufficient fuel to incinerate the fecal matter (Figure 6.11.). Do not use highly
         volatile fuel because of its explosive nature. A mixture of 1 quart of gasoline to 5 quarts of die-
         sel oil is effective; nevertheless, use it with caution. Burn the contents again if they are not ren-
         dered dry and odorless in one ef fort. Bury the residual ash once the bu rning process is
         complete.

          6.4.2.2.3. Pail Latrine . Build a pail latrine when conditions (populated areas, rocky soil,
          marshes) are such that a latrine cannot be dug. Construct a standard latrine bo x according to
          paragraph 6.4.2.1.4. Also add a floor and place a pail under each seat. Pl ace hinged doors on
          the rear of the box (see Figure 6.12.) to facilitate removal of pails when emptying. Position the
          box to form a part of the outer wall (if the box is located in a building) while ensuring that the
          rear of the box opens directly to the outside of the building. The box should be fly proof, and
          the seats and rear doors should be self-closing. Construct the floor of the box with an impervi-
          ous material (concrete if possible) and allow en ough slope toward the rear to facilitate rapid
          drainage of washing water. Clean pails at least once daily and bury, burn, or dispose of the con-
          tents by another sanitary method. Plastic liners for the pails reduce the risk of accidental spill-
          age. Tie the filled bags at the top before disposal.

       6.4.2.3. Alternate Latrine Options. During certain contingencies, a lack of resources may make
       it difficult to build one of the aforementioned latrines. In such situations , the makeshift toilet
       described below may serve as a temporary soluti on. In contrast, where t ime and resources are
       plentiful, it may be worthw hile to construct mobile latrines ahead of an anticipated population
       increase. These options address both ends of the spectrum—from rudimentary to a cut above sim-
       ple functionality. Both have their place during the right situation.
           6.4.2.3.1. Makeshift Toilet. During an emergency or during field activities where digging a
           cat hole latrine is not an option, an expedient toilet can be made using a common water bucket.
           Simply line a bucket with a garbage bag and make a toilet seat out of two boards placed paral-
           lel to each other acros s the bucket. After each use, pour a disinfectant such as bleach (1 part
           liquid chlorine bleach to 10 parts water) into th e garbage bag to help avoid infection and stop
           the spread of disease. Cover the bucket tightly when it is not in use. Bury garbage and human
           waste to avoid the spread of di sease by rats, insects, and other vectors. Dig a pit two to three
           feet deep and at least 50 feet downhill or away from any well, spring, or water supply.
           6.4.2.3.2. Personal Toilets. During very short deployments or during special operations, indi-
           viduals may be provided personal chemical toilets (Figure 6.13.). Also, when on a march, per-
           sonal disposal bags should be used first, if available. If not available, personal cat holes are
           another option. Always dispose of waste immedi ately to prevent flie s from spreading germs
           from waste to food or water supplies. Disposin g of waste a lso helps keep unwanted animals
           out of the beddown area.

Figure 6.13. Typical Personal Chemical Toilets.




6.5. Urinals. In permanent and semi-p ermanent camps, urine disposal facilities are usually connected to
the sewer system. However, in the field, separate devices for urine dis posal are often necessary. At least
one urine disposal facility is required for each male latrine or per 100 personnel. Following are examples
of some of the more common expedient field devices used for the disposition of urine and their applicable
maintenance procedures. As a general rule, urinals should always be situat ed either in or very near male
latrines. This avoids undesirable soiling of the latrine seats and immediate area.
   6.5.1. Urine Soakage Pit. One of the best devices for urine disposal in the field is a urine soakage pit
   (see Figure 6.14.). Begin construction of this item by digging a pit 4 feet square and 4 feet deep. Next,
   fill it with an aggregate material and lay a border along each edge so that each side of the soakage pit's
   surface is 5 feet long. Ideally the border should be 6 inches wide, 4 inches deep, and composed of
156                                                                        AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      small stones. Depending on available materials, use either pipe urinals or trough urinals with this pit.
      An optional feature is the ventilat ing shafts with screened openings that extend from about 8 inches
      above the pit to within 6 inches of the bottom of the pit. As shown in Figure 6.14., pipe urinals should
      be at least 1 inch in diameter and installed at an angle near each corner of the pit or, if needed, on the
      sides halfway between the corners. The pipes should extend at least 8 inches below the surface of the
      pit. Place a funnel made of tarpaper, sheet metal, or similar material in the top of each pipe. The upper
      rim of the funnel s hould extend about 30 inches above the ground surface. For fly control and as a
      sound sanitation practice, if tarpaper funnels are used, fill the funnels with straw and replace them on
      a daily basis. Note: A soakage trench (see paragraph 6.5.4.) may be used when the groundwater table
      or a rock formation precludes digging a standard urine soakage pit.
      6.5.2. Trough Urinal. If materials are available and more permanent facil ities are desired, build a
      trough urinal as shown in Figure 6.15.. The trough is U- or V -shaped and made of sheet metal or
      wood. If it is co nstructed of wood, line it with heavy tarpaper. The four troughs forming the sides
      should be no m ore than 4 1/2 f eet long when t hey are used with a soakage pit and an apron. Each
      trough should slope slightly toward one corner wher e a pipe carries the urine to the soakage pit.
      Another expedient urinal variation is shown in Figure 6.16.

AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                157


Figure 6.15. Common Trough Urinal.




Figure 6.16. Trough Urinal Variation.




   6.5.3. Urinoil. The urinoil represents a further modification for more permanent installation (Figure
   6.17.). In its simplest form, an urinoil is a 55-gallon drum containing oil that is placed over a recessed
   soakage pit, thus the name, urin oil. Waste POL c an be used; but vegetable oil is preferred. Urine
   voided through the screen immediately sinks through the oil to the bottom of the drum. The action of
158                                                                         AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      the urinal is somewhat like that of a barometer. As more urine is added, the oil level rises in the 3-inch
      pipe. This continues until it reaches the 1 1/2-inch no tch on the overflow pipe in the center of the
      drum. Atmospheric pressure and the weight of the oil cause the urine to overflow until equilibrium is
      reestablished in the drum. The oil al so acts as an ef fective seal against odors and flies. The screen is
      easily lifted with attached hooks fo r removal of debris. T o initiate the operation of th e urinoil, place
      the prepared drum in pos ition on the soakage pit a nd tamp the ground around the drum to the level
      shown in the drawing. Next, pour at least one foot of water into the drum. Lastly, add waste oil (about
      32 gallons) until the oil reaches the point indicated in the graphic. The urinoil is now ready for use and
      will remain functional as long as the soakage pit will accept urine.
      6.5.4. Soakage Trench. Use a soakage trench ( Figure 6.18.) when the groundwater level or a rock
      formation precludes digging a soakage pit. The trench consists of a pit, 4 feet square and l foot deep.
      The pit has a trench radiating outward from each side for a distance of 6 or more feet. Dig the trenches
      1 foot wide, varying the depth from 1 foot at the center to 1 1/2 feet at the outer ends. Fill the pit and
      trenches with material similar to that used in the soakage pit.
      6.5.5. Maintenance of Urine Disposal Facilities. Proper maintenance of urinal facilities consists of
      the steps in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1. Urinal Maintenance.
                                         Urinal Maintenance
          Step 1    For proper operation and sanitary purposes, individuals must urinate in the
                    trough or the pipe, not directly on the pit's surface.
          Step 2    Wash funnels and troughs with soap and water daily.
          Step 3    Replace funnels when necessary.
          Step 4    Prevent oil or greas e from getting in to the pit to prevent clogging. Oil
                    leeching through the pit may also contaminate the groundwater.
          Step 5    If the latrine is located some di stance from sleeping areas, place a lar ge
                    can or pail at a convenient location for use as a urinal at night. Empty the
                    can into the trough, pipe, or soakage trench every morning, and wash the
                    pail with soap and water before reusing it.
          Step 6    When a urine soakage pit is abandoned or becomes clogged, spray it with
                    insecticide. Mound it over with a l -foot covering of compacted earth and
                    place a rectangular sign on the mound indicating the type of pit and date of
                    closure.

6.6. Expedient Hand-Washing Devices. Simple hand-washing devices must be available at field latrine
locations. These devices should be easy to operate a nd have a constant supply of water . As previously
mentioned, the importance of hand-washing devices must be given a ggressive emphasis, because hands
contaminated with fecal material are a common means of disease transmission. An expedient hand-wash-
ing device is shown in Figure 6.19.

                    CONSTRUCTING EXPEDIENT SOIL BERMS AND DIKES

7.1. Introduction. In today’s high-tech engine ering environment, low-tech engineering solutions are
sometimes the best way to s atisfy certain expedient field construction requirements. A prime example is
the building of berms and dikes. In addition to force prot ection requirements, e ngineers are frequently
tasked to build earthen berms for la ndfills, hazardous materials, burn pits, aircraft engine blast and noise
abatement, and other expeditionary activities. Dikes are often constructed for spill control, flood control,
and basic water management operations. Both berms and dikes have been around for centuries and like
today, ancient engineers also used these methods for fortification and water management. The simplicity
of design, ease of constructi on, and effectiveness ensure berms and di kes will continue to be a valuable
engineering solution in the future.

7.2. Overview. This chapter reviews expedient field construction procedures for soil berms and dikes
and highlights how these applications are used to s atisfy specific engineering challenges. There are sev-
eral definitions for berms. Many are described as a raised barrier or bank of earth that separates two areas
(see Figure 7.1.). Conversely, dikes are often depicted a s a ditch or c hannel or as a raised barrier that
encloses an area. Each of these berm and dike applications will be addressed in this chapter.

Figure 7.1. Berm Construction During Desert Operations.




7.3. Soil Berms. In an expeditionary field environment, soil berms are constructed around different sites
and facilities for a variety of reas ons. They can be emp loyed as either freestanding structures or built
against building exterior walls a nd retaining walls. Freestanding berms typicall y require more soil and
room to construct than other berms; however, they are very effective when employed in applications such
as burn pits, landfills, and hazardous material storage.
   7.3.1. General Construction Requirements. Due to their size, most berm construction usually
   involves the use of heavy construction equipment. Typically, the berms are built of compacted soil and
   must be designed to contend with th e ever-present effects of gravity. If the sides of a berm are too
   steeply sloped, the soil will shift. Because of this, th e base of berms is often at least three times the
162                                                                        AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      width at the top. Figure 7.2. shows some general berm construction requirements. The top of a berm
      should have a 10-to-1 slope to minimize water ponding on the crest and subsequently soaking into the
      structure's interior. Also, once built, the sides of earthen berms shoul d be faced to control erosion. A
      variety of face-sealing methods are available to meet this purpose. Sod and polyethylene are two com-
      mon methods. Other construction gu idelines and factors are explained in the following paragraphs.
      Table 7.1. provides labor comparisons for construction of soil berms and other types of revetments.
      As can be seen, berms are generally less labor intensive and quicker to build than s ome of the mor e
      common revetment materials—particularly sandbag protective structures.

Figure 7.2. General Berm Construction Factors.




      7.3.2. Berm Base Dimensions and Slope Angle. For general planning purposes, expect to make the
      base of a freestanding berm three times its height. However, if time is available, a more detailed anal-
      ysis may be in order. Simply put, the allowable side slope of the berm face coupled with the width of
      the berm crest determines the width of the berm base. In practice, for expedient situations, the maxi-
      mum realistic slope is the natural angle of repose of the soil. The lesser the slope, the greater berm sta-
      bility during inclement weather. For cohesionless soils (those composed primarily of sand), the slope
      angle can be taken as the angle of internal friction. Table 7.2. gives friction angles for a range of soil
      types. However, if the soil type is unknown or time is not avai lable to conduct proper compaction, it
      is generally conservative to use a 1-to-2 slope for preliminary desi gn and planning purposes. For
      cohesive soils, greater slopes can typically be sustained. If time permits perform a slope failure analy-
      sis as described in standard soil mechanics texts or handbooks. A specific reference source is the mul-
      tiservices product, Unified F acilities Criteria 3-220-03FA, Soils and Geology Procedures for
      Foundation Design of Buildings and Other Structures (Except Hydraulic Structures).

                  Dense sand                                           36-45
                  For cohesionless soils (those compos ed primarily of sand), the slope
                  angle can be taken as the angle of internal friction.

      7.3.3. Other Consequential Factors. Other factors that must be taken into account when planning to
      construct any type of berm are soil composition, moisture content retention, proper drainage, and
      compaction requirements (see Table 7.3.).
164                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Table 7.3. Other Construction Factors.
Soil Composition Factors:
A number of soil composition factors directly impact the performance of any earthen structure. In fact,
the soil consistency of a berm has a direct relation to its stability an d performance. In general, soil is
primarily composed of sand or clay. There are also sandy loams and clay loams, but those are normally
restricted to the relatively thin top layer of earth known as topsoil.
Moisture Content:
As addressed earlier in th e chapter, it is very important that adequate measures be taken to seal the
exterior of the structure at beddown locations where the annual precipitation level is high.
Proper Drainage:
Drainage should always be a prime consideration when constructing any earth berm. Poor drainage can
rapidly undo all the hard work involved in building the structure. If the berm is to be built in a region of
high rainfall, consider installing an interior drainage tile to remove moisture that ma y seep into the
structure's encasement.
Compaction Requirements:
Proper compaction is an essential part of berm c onstruction, regardless of the type of berm or soil
involved. Basically, berm materi al is compacted to increase i ts density—greater density increases
stability and performance. Berm compaction is done in layers, and the extent is dictated by both the soil
type and its moisture content. Usually, compactions will occur after every 6-to-12-inch layer of material
has been placed. Compaction can be accomplished using a hand tamp, portable vibratory tamper , or
pneumatic plate. Heavy equipment (dozers/loaders) can compact in layers if tampers and rollers are not
readily available. The hand tamp approach ( Figure 7.3.) is a slow, labor-intensive process, but its
simplicity means that it shoul d always be available. Th e portable vibratory tamper ( Figure 7.4.) is a
motorized hand-controlled tool ab out the size of a common house hold lawn mower. The pneumatic
plate is an excavator attachment and is one of the fastest methods available. A vibratory roller (Figure
7.5.) may also be used where construction of very large berms is involved.

   7.3.4. Negative Aspects of Soil Berms. Soil berms offer simple and effective engineering solutions
   to several field construction require ments. Soil berms also have nega tive aspects, especially from an
   expediency approach. The principl e disadvantage associated with us ing berms is their lar ge space
   requirements. Soil berms may not be a practical solution in very rocky terrain or where grading equip-
   ment is not available. Heavy equi pment availability is an absolute necessity. Berms sited near taxi-
   ways and runways may increase problems related to blowing dust and debris. Arid locations, such as
   desert beddown sites, are particularly susceptible to this predicament. At such site s, erosion control
   measures are of particular importance. In areas wh ere there is a lar ge amount of rainfall, berms will
   require frequent mainte nance, particularly if the si des and crest are not waterproofed, covered with
   sod, or otherwise adequately stabilized. If berms use sod as protective cover, slope angles steeper than
   1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal (1V:3H) could make mowing grass difficult.
   7.3.5. Slope Protection for Soil Berms. Many different types of slope protec tion have be en
   employed to counter the effects of soil berm erosion. Techniques such as grass or ve getation, gravel,
   sand-asphalt paving, concrete paving, articulated concrete mats, ri prap or rock blankets, and several
   different types of geotexti le material have been used depending on the level of protection needed.
   However, in an expeditionary environment where time and resources are generally limited, techniques
   such as riprap, articulated mats, or paving may beavoided if high-class slope protection is not needed.
   Grass, geocells, or other geotex tile protection methods may provi de lower-class slope protection
166                                                                       AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      options, if neces sary. Table 7.4. addresses the function or suitability of grass and geocells as slope
      protection. Slope protection for soil berms utilized as containment dikes and levees requires special
      consideration. Review paragraph 7.4.2. for information on dike and levee construction.

                       •   Counteracts soil movement down the slope and erosion from rainfall

                           cells or grids

      7.3.6. Berm Applications.
         7.3.6.1. Burn Pits. Burn pits are normally constructed to dispose of solid waste and hazardous
         waste materials. Burn pits at be ddown locations will often be coll ocated with the base controlled
         waste disposal area. Burn pits are normally located far away from the main part of the installation
         to minimized personnel exposure to smoke and alleviate any impact on airfield operations caused
         by burning waste. As an added sa fety measure, a soil or earthen berm (usually 15’-20’ high) is
         placed around the burn pit. Although berms for burn pits are constructed like other expedient
         berms, sometimes other features are incorporated into the design and constr uction of the pit. For
         example, dirt ramps may be added to allow acce ss by dozers and compactors to perfo rm routine
         maintenance on the pit. The size of the pit (and berm) is dictated by the amount of solid waste that
         needs to be burned in the pit. The height of the berm is also determined by factors at the beddown
         location. Factors such as groundwater table, pi t design (above or below ground, loading ramps),
         maintenance equipment, personnel safety, etc., may affect how high the berm is built. Figure 7.6.
         is one example of a burn pit that utilizes a soil berm.

       7.3.6.2. Landfills, Hazardous Material Storage Areas, Airfields, and Firing Ranges. O t h e r
       than for force protection, freestanding soil berms are normally employed around these types of
       facilities to limit a ccess, provide noise abatemen t, or provide a safety ba rrier. Regardless of the
       purpose or location, the construction procedures for freestanding soil berms are basically the same
       as those discuss ed in paragraph 7.3.1. However, engineers should review and comply with ETL
       06-11: Small Arms Range Design and Construction, when constructing soil berms for fi ring
       ranges.

7.4. Dikes. Dikes are generally constructed to support spill control measures or in response to floodwater
emergencies and disasters. They cons ist of two basic featur es: either a raised embankment/barrier or a
drainage ditch. The raised embankment is often constructed around fuel storage and distribution areas to
limit damage due to acc idental spills. Raised embankments are used in conjunction with ditch construc-
tion to hold back or drain floodwaters, respectively.
   7.4.1. Fuel Dikes. Fuel dikes are constructed around POL tanks and bladders (Figure 7.7.) as a force
   protection measure and to contain fuel spills if the tanks rupture or catch on fire. Although the primary
   focus of this section is to address expedient fuel dike construction, a brief description of site selection
   and criteria is app ropriate. Engineers tasked to build fuel dikes should work closely with logistics
   (fuels) specialists responsible for the design and operation of the fuel distribution system.
168                                                                     AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 7.7. Dikes Placed Around Fuel Bladders.




      7.4.1.1. Site Criteria. Selected sites should be in non-conge sted areas where ot her facilities do
      not interfere with fuel operations. Avoid locating fuel dikes in drainage areas above critical instal-
      lations. Locate them in areas where a potential fuel fire will not spread down to other installation
      areas. The best sites are on flat ground in sloping terrain to allow for gravity flow to the issue side
      or first pumping station. Beachh ead sites may be located in sa ndy seashore areas up from the
      beachline (Figure 7.8.). Sites should a lso have adequat e drainage. Preferably, the water table
      should be more than 6 feet b elow the surface. Avoid marshlands, riverbanks, or bottomland sub-
      ject to flooding and other sites with poor or undependabl drainage.

Figure 7.8. Cutting a Sand Dike for a Fuel Bladder.




      7.4.1.2. Fuel Dike Construction. When constructing a fuel dike, the size or height should be
      such that the volume of liquid in the fuel bladder can be contained within the dike should a rupture
      occur. Figure 7.9. and Figure 7.10. give examples of a typical fu el dike construction. When pre-
      paring the surface, clear the site and grade about a 1 p ercent slope towards the issue side or tank
      drain location. Inspect the ground and remove any rocks, sticks, or sharp objects that could punc-
      ture the bladder. Place a dike basin drain at the lowest end of th e bladder pad. The drain is a pipe
      (2-inch diameter minimum) with a gate valve. Place this pipe under th e dike construction. The
      dike should extend about 1 foot above the fuel tank and be at least 4 feet wide at the crown. The
      walkway area between the dike and the fuel bladder should be about 2 feet wide to allow for main-
      tenance.

Figure 7.9. Typical Fuel Dike.




Figure 7.10. Fuel Dike Cross Section.




          7.4.1.2.1. Dike construction for fuel bladde rs should be const ructed to hold fuel a mounts
          slightly larger than bladder capacity. When constructing the dike, ensure the fuel trucks, fuel-
          ing and de-fueling, are able to travel over the ground adjacent to the dike. Keep in mind most
          of the trucks weigh more than 80,000 lbs. Stabilize the travel area around the dike by 50 to 100
          feet to ease truck operations . If applicable, consid er civilian delivery truck weights and turn
          radiuses when sizing the truck travel area.
          7.4.1.2.2. Locations experiencing extreme heat for several mont hs at a time will likely cause
          bladder leaks. Fuel bladder kits contain liners to hold spilled fuel if/when bladders burst or
          leak. Consider constructing secondary dikes outside of the prim ary dike to catch leakage and
          spillage of residual or accidental spills due to hose/coupling breaks (Figure 7.11.). The liners
          should be long enough to cover the secondary dike.
170                                                                      AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 7.11. Illustration of Fuel Dike with Secondary Dike.




      7.4.2. Raised Flood Control Dikes. Raised flood control dikes, emba nkments, or barrie rs (often
      referred to as levees) (Figure 7.12.) are typically constructed of soil and sandbags. However, sandbag
      levees are not considered an e xpedient method because significant time and personnel are needed to
      fill sandbags during an emergency (Figure 7.13.). In recent times , filled HESCO barriers have been
      used in the construction of expedient dike walls. S ince expedient dikes ar e constructed in an em er-
      gency, their primary purpose is to provide flood protection for periods of only a few days or weeks.
      More permanent dikes or levees require more planning, analysis, time, and materials to construct and
      cannot be considered expedient. Although there is typically very little time to pr epare for an unfore-
      seen flood emergency, local emergency planners should address certain basics that engineers will need
      prior to dike construction. Issues such as the loca tion of earth borrow sites; heavy equipment routes;
      proposed alignment for dike, equipment and supplies, and other matters should be determined before
      construction of the dike begins.

Figure 7.13. Personnel Constructing Sandbag Levee.




      7.4.2.1. General Construction Requirements. The design of raised flood control dikes or barri-
      ers is very similar to that of freestanding soil berms discussed earlier; however, they serve two
      very different purposes. Flood control dikes are designed to hold back floodwaters, and their fail-
      ure could potentially result in devastation over a wide area a nd adversely affect many people.
      Raised dikes constructed during an emergency should be built to hold throughout the entire flood
      event. Anytime there is water against the embankm ent, there is a potential dang er that the dike
      could fail. Therefore, even und er emergency situations, proven construction methods should be
      used when constructing raised flood control dikes—an emer gency is not the time to experiment.
      The standard design of a raised dike is generally dictated by the foundation soils and the materials
      available for construction. Always attempt to make the dike or embankment compatible with the
      foundation. Information on foundation soils may be available from local of ficials or engineers,
      and it should be utilized. Use the information in paragraph 7.4.2.5. as a guide when determining
      vertical and horizontal embankment design. Also keep in mind that a revised forecast may require
      additional fill to be placed.
      7.4.2.2. Alignment. Before heavy equipment operators can begin moving earth to build a raised
      dike, engineer planners must establish an alignment for the proposed barrier. The alignment
      should be the shortest route possible, provide the maximum practical protection, and take advan-
      tage of any high ground where available. The flood barrier should be kept as far landward of the
      body of water as possible to prevent encroachment on the fl oodway. Sharp bends should also be
      avoided. Keep as many trees and as much brush between the dike and the water as possible to help
      deflect water current and debris. The earth borrow areas should have ade quate material for con-
      struction of the dike and must be accessible at all times. Also, the borrow area should be located in
      an area that will not become isolated from the dike project by high water.
      7.4.2.3. Foundation Preparation. Prior to constructing a rais ed embankment, the foundat ion
      area along the levee ali gnment should be prepared. Trees should be cut and the stumps removed.
      All obstructions above th e ground surface should be removed, if possible. This includes brush,
      structures, snags, and similar debris. In snow-c overed areas, push the snow riverward so as to
      decrease ponding when the snow melts. The foundation should then be stripped of topsoil and sur-
      face humus. Stripping may be impossible if the ground is froze n. In this case, the foundation
172                                                                   AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


      should be ripped or scarified, if possible, to provide a rough surface for bonding with the embank-
      ment. Every effort should be made to remove all ice or soil containing ice. Frost or frozen ground
      can also give a false sense of secu rity in the early stages of a fl ood fight. It can act as a rigid
      boundary and support the levee; but on thawing, soil strength may be reduced sufficiently to allow
      cracks or slides to develop. Frozen soil forms an impervious barrier to prevent seepage. This may
      result in a considerable buildup in pressure under the soils landward of the levee and, upon thaw-
      ing, pressure may be sufficient to cause sudden blowouts. If this condition exists, it must be mon-
      itored and one must be prepared to act quickly if sliding or sand boils develop. If stripping is
      possible, the material should be pushed landwa rd and riverward of the toe of the levee. Note:
      Clearing and grubbing, structure removal, and stripping should be performed only if time permits.
      7.4.2.4. Materials. Earth fill materials for emergency levees will usually come from local borrow
      areas. As previously mentioned, an attempt should be made to utilize materials which are compat-
      ible with the foundation materials as explained below. However, due to time limitation, any local
      materials may be used if re asonable construction procedures are followed. The materials should
      not contain large frozen pieces of earth.
         7.4.2.4.1. Clay. Clay is preferred because the section can be made smaller (steeper side
         slopes). Also, clay is relatively impervious and has a relatively high resistance to erosion when
         it is compacted. A disadvantage in using clay is that adequate compaction is difficult to obtain
         without proper equipment. Additi onally, the water content in impervious fill can impact th e
         compaction needs. Efforts are typi cally made at the borrow site to obtain material with the
         optimal moisture; otherwise, if that is not possible, more time may be required for compaction.
         Another disadvantage is that the clay may be wet, and sub-freezing temperatures may cause
         the material to freeze in the borrow pit and in the hauling eq uipment. Weather could cause
         delays and should definitely be considered in the overall construction effort.
         7.4.2.4.2. Sand. If sand is used, the section should comply as closely as possible with recom-
         mendations in paragraph 7.4.2.5.1. below. Flat sl opes are impor tant, as steep slopes without
         poly coverage will cause seepage through the levee to outcrop high on the landward slope and
         may cause the slope to slump.
         7.4.2.4.3. Silt. Material that is primarily silt should be avoided, and if it is used, poly facing
         must be applied to the waterside slope. Silt , upon wetting, tends to collapse under its own
         weight and is very susceptible to erosion.
      7.4.2.5. Design Considerations. As previously addressed, dike or levee designs are based on the
      soil foundation and available construction materials. The three foundation conditions cited below
      are classical and idealized, and us ual field conditions depart from them to various degrees. How-
      ever, they should be used as a guide so that possible serious flood fight problems might be less-
      ened during high water. A top wi dth adequate for cons truction equipment will usually facilitate
      raising the embankment. Also, the embankment height should be 2 feet higher than the forecast
      flood crest. Finally, actual embankment construction will, in most cases, depend on time, materi-
      als, and right-of-way available.
         7.4.2.5.1. Sand Foundation. If the foundation material under th e emergency dike is sand or
         some other pervious material, the following guidance is provided.
             7.4.2.5.1.1. If the dike section is to be made of sand, use a minimum of 1V (Vertical) on
             3H (Horizontal) river slopes. A 1V on 4H river slope is preferable and will be less suscep-
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             173


             tible to erosion, but a 1V on 3H slope is considered an ad equate minimum for emergency
             purposes. Use 1V on 5H for the landward slope and a 10-foot top width.
             7.4.2.5.1.2. If the dike section will be made of clay, use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes. 1V
             on 3H slopes are prefer able, but 1V on 1 1/2 H is an ac ceptable minimum for emergency
             purposes. The bottom width should comply with soil creep ratio criteria; i.e., L (across bot-
             tom) should be equal to C x H; where C is the foundation soil creep ratio (i.e., 9 for fine
             gravel and 15 for fine sand) and H is levee height. See Table 7.5. below for various soil
             creep ratios.

         7.4.2.5.2. Clay Foundation. If the foundation material under the emergency levee is clay, the
         following guidance is provided
             7.4.2.5.2.1. If the dike section is to be made of sand, it shoul d be constructed with 1V on
             3H for the river slope. Again, a 1V on 4H is preferable, but the steeper slope is considered
             adequate for emergency purposes. Use 1V on 5H for the landward slope and a 10-foot top
             width, as described in the previous section.
             7.4.2.5.2.2. If the dike section is to be made of clay , use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes.
             Slopes of 1V on 3H are preferable for clay levees, but 1V on 1 1/2 H is an acceptable min-
             imum for emergency purposes. With a clay foundation, there is no need to construct addi-
             tional berms.
         7.4.2.5.3. Clay Layer Over a Sand Foundation. If the foundation material is such that there
         is an impervious clay layer rest ing over a pervious sand layer , the following guidance is pro-
         vided.
             7.4.2.5.3.1. If the dike section is to be made of sand, use a minimum of 1V on 3H river
             slopes for emergency purposes. A 1V on 4H slope is preferable if this construction is pos-
             sible. Use 1V on 5H landward slope and 10-foot top width. In addition, a landside berm of
             sufficient thickness may be ne cessary to prevent rupture of the clay lay er. The berm may
             be constructed of sand, gravel, or clay, but since berms made of clay generally need to be
             wider and thicker than those made of pervious materials, it would probably reduce the con-
             struction effort to build the berm with sand or gravel if these materials are available. Stan-
             dard design of berms requires considerable information and detailed anal ysis of soil
174                                                                   AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


             conditions. Prior te chnical assistance may reduce berm constr uction requirements in any
             emergency situation.
             7.4.2.5.3.2. If the dike section is to be made of clay , use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes.
             Again, 1V on 3H slopes are preferable, but 1V on 1 1/2 H is an acceptable minimum for
             emergency purposes. Additionally, a berm may be necessary to prevent rupture of the
             impervious top stratum.
      7.4.2.6. Placement and Compaction. Obtaining proper compaction equipment for a given soil
      type will be dif ficult. In most cases, the on ly compaction may be fro m hauling and spreading
      equipment; i.e., construction traffic routed over the fill.
      7.4.2.7. Slope Protection. Methods of protecting embankment sl opes from current scour , wave
      wash, seepage, and debris dama ge are numerous and varied. Du ring a flood emer gency, time,
      availability of materials, cost, and construction capability preclude the use of all accepted methods
      of permanent slope protection. Field personnel must decide the type and extent of slope protection
      the emergency barrier will need. Several methods of protection exist which prove highly effective
      in an emergency. Again, resourcefulness on the pa rt of the field personne l may be necessary for
      success.
         7.4.2.7.1. Polyethylene and Sandbags. Experience has shown that a combination of polyeth-
         ylene (poly) and sandbags is one of the most expedient, effective, and economical methods of
         combating slope attack in a flood situation (Figure 7.14.). Poly and sandbags can be used in a
         variety of combinations. T ime becomes the f actor that may determin e which combination to
         use. Ideally, poly and sandbag protection should be placed in the dry. However, many cases of
         unexpected slope attack will occur during high water. A method for placement in the wet is
         covered below. See Figure 7.15. to Figure 7.17. for suggested methods of laying poly and
         sandbags. Since each flood fight project is unique (river, personnel available, materials, etc.),
         specific details of pl acement and materials ha ndling will not be covere d. Personnel must be
         aware of resources available when using poly and sandbags.

             7.4.2.7.1.1. Toe Anchorage and Poly Placement. Anchoring the poly along the water-
             side toe is important for a successful job (see Figure 7.15.). This may be done three differ-
             ent ways: (1) After completion of the embankm ent, excavate a tren ch along the toe and
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             175


             place poly inside the trench a nd backfill the trench; (2) Place poly flat-out away from the
             toe and push earth over the flap ; and (3) Place poly flat-out from the toe and place one or
             more rows of sandbags over the flap. After anchoring the poly, unroll the poly up the slope
             and over the top, leaving enough excess to anchor with sandbags . The poly should be
             placed from downstream to upstream along the slopes and overlapping at least 2 feet. The
             poly is now ready for the “hold down” sandbags.

Figure 7.15. Anchoring Polyethylene.




             7.4.2.7.1.2. Slope Anchorage. Poly placed on raised embankments should be held down.
             An effective method of anchoring poly is a grid system of sandbags (Figure 7.16.), unless
             extremely high velocities of water, heavy debris, or a large amount of ice is anticipated. In
             that case, a solid blanket of sandbags over the poly should be used. A grid system can be
             constructed faster and requires fewer bags and much less labor than a total covering. Vari-
             ous grid systems include ver tical rows of lapped bags, 2” x 4” lumber held down by
             attached bags, and rows of bags held by a c ontinuous rope tied to each bag. Poly can also
             be held down by a system usi ng two bags tied with rope a nd the rope sadd led over the
             embankment crown with a bag on each slope.
176                                                                   AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 7.16. Slope Protection.




              7.4.2.7.1.3. Placement in the Wet. In many situations during high water, poly and sand-
              bags placed in the wet must provide the emergency protection. Wet placement may also be
              required to replace or maintain damaged poly or poly displaced by current action. Figure
              7.17. shows a typica l section of e mbankment covered in the wet. Sandbag anchors are
              formed at the bottom edge of the poly by bunching the poly around a fistful of sand or rock
              and tying the sandbags to this fist-sized ba ll. Counterweights consisting of two or more
              sandbags connected by a length of 1/4-inch rope are used to hold the center portion of the
              poly down. The number of counterweights willdepend on the uniformity of the levee slope
              and current velocity. Placement of the poly consists of first casting out the poly sheet with
              the bottom weights and then adding counterwe ights to slowly sink the poly sheet into
              place. The poly, in most cases , will continue to move down slope until the bottom edge
              reaches the toe of the slope. Suf ficient counterweights should be added to ensure that no
              air voids exist between the poly and the levee face and to keep the poly from flapping or
              being carried away by the current. For this reason, it is important to have enough counter-
              weights prepared prior to the placement of the sheet.
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                177


Figure 7.17. Placement of Polyethylene in the Wet.




             7.4.2.7.1.4. Overuse of Poly. In past floods, there has been a tendency to overuse and, in
             some cases, misuse poly on slopes. For example, on well compacted clay embankments in
             areas of relatively low velo cities, use of poly would be unnecessary. Also, placement of
             poly on landward slopes to prevent seepage must not be done. It will only force seepage to
             another exit and may prove detrimental. Poly has been used on the landside slope of levees
             to prevent rainwater from entering a crack wh ere slope movement has occurred, particu-
             larly in fat clay soils. Keeping water out of the cracks resulting from slope movements is
             desirable to prevent lubrication and additional hydrostatic pressure on the slip surface.
          7.4.2.7.2. Riprap. Riprap is a positive means of providing slope protection (Figure 7.18.) and
          has been used in a few cases where erosive forces were too large to effectively control by other
          means. Objections to using riprap when flood fighting are: (1 ) rather costly; (2) large amount
          necessary to protect a given area; (3) availability; and (4) little control over its placement, par-
          ticularly in the wet. In situations when suitablerock is not available within economical hauling
          distance, soil cement slope protection may be a viable option.
          7.4.2.7.3. Miscellaneous Measures. Several other methods of slope protection ha ve been
          used. Small groins, extending 3.05 m (10 ft) or more into the channel were effective in deflect-
          ing current away from the levees. Log booms ha ve been used to protect levee slopes from
          debris or ice attack. Logs can be cabled together and anchored with a deadman in the levee.
          The boom will float out in the current and, depending on log size, will deflect floating objects.
          Straw bales pegged into the slope may be s uccessful against wave action as well as straw
          spread on the slope and overlain with snow fence.

         7.4.2.8. Using Wire/Fabric Earth Filled Barriers. Earth filled barriers can be used for fast con-
         struction of a water dike wall. The walls need to be reinfo rced on the opposite side (landside) of
         the water with earthen material filled with organic/rock mixture for strength.
      7.4.3. Drainage Ditches and Channels. As previously addressed, drainage ditches and channels are
      also defined as a type of dike. They are used to control or enhance water runoff (Figure 7.19.) and are
      often employed after a flood to handle unwanted surface water. Sometimes requests are made to locate
      irrigation and/or drainage ditches in close proximity to the landside levee toe. This could lead to seri-
      ous seepage and/or slope stability problems. Th e location and depth of proposed ditches should be
      established by seepage and stability analyses. This requires information on foundation soil conditions,
      river stages, and geometry of the proposed ditch. Local engineers should be cons ulted before con-
      structing drainage ditches, es pecially if rais ed levees are in t he immediate area. See Chapter 2 for
      more information on expedient drainage construction measures.

Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)—A field operating agency (FOA) located at
Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Readiness Support Directorate (HQ AFCESA/CEX) acts as the Air
Force program manager for base civil engineer (BCE) contingency response planning.
AM-2 Matting—Developed during the V ietnam conflict, the AM-2 mat wa s used as a sur face for
runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons. Th e mat is crea ted by laying the interlocking aluminum
panels in an offset pattern, similar to that used in laying bricks. In smaller numbers, the AM-2 panels were
used to make an airfield damage repair patch.
B-1 Revetment—A galvanized metal revetment assembled us ing metal pins and filled with sand or
similar material. B-1 revetments ar e often capped with concrete to pr event water from entering the fill
material. They are primarily used to protect parked aircraf t; however, they can al so be used for facility
hardening.
Bare Base—An installation having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations
to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a
source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base conditions form
a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Beddown—The act of providing facilities , utilities, services, construction, operations, and maintenance
support to a deployed force with the overall intent of establishing a basic mission capability.
Bitburg Revetment—A fork lift-moveable revetment made of reinforced concrete usually us ed for
facility hardening.
Cannibalize—To remove serviceable parts from one ite m of equi pment in order to install them on
another item of equipment.
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and
control functions are performed th rough an arrangement of personnel, equipm ent, communications,

facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling
forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters,
located within North America between Canada and Mexico.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies
require plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel,
installations, and equipment.
Contingency Response Plan—A base civil engineer plan of action developed in anticipation of all types
of contingencies, emergencies, and disasters.
Conventional Weapons—A weapon which is neither nuclear, biological, nor chemical.

                       CRACK REPAIR USING EPOXY INJECTION METHOD

A2.1. Purpose. To provide guidance on use of epoxy injection to repair cracks in concrete. The following
information was extracted from Re pair, Evaluation, Maintenance, and Rehabilitation (REMR) Technical
Note CS-MR-3.9, Crack Repair Method: Epoxy Injection.

A2.2. Description. This method can be used to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 inch. The method gener-
ally consists of drilling holes at close intervals along the cracks, in some cases installing entry ports, and
injecting the epoxy under pressure. For massive structures, an alternative procedure consists of drilling a
series of holes, usually 7/8 inch in diameter that intercepts th e crack at a number of locations. T ypically,
holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals.

A2.3. Equipment, Tools, and Personnel Requirements. A concrete drill, an epoxy injection system, a
means of cleaning holes and cracks, and normal hand tools are required. One man can repair cracks using
this method, but a two- or three-man operation is more efficient. Epoxy injection requires personnel with
a high degree of skill for satisfactory execution.

A2.4. Applications and Limitations. Epoxy injection has been successfully used in the repair of cracks
in buildings, bridges, dams, and other types of conc rete structures. However, unless the crack is dormant
(or the cause of cracking is removed, thereby making the crack dormant), it will probably recur, possibly
somewhere else in the structure. If the crack is activeand the desired is to seal it while allowing continued
movement at that location, a sealant or other material that allows the crack to function as a joint must be
used. The ambient temperature may also limit application of this meth od. In the case of delaminated
bridge decks, epoxy injectio n can be an ef fective intermediate-term repair method. In this case, steps in
paragraph A2.5.1., A2.5.2., and A2.5.6. outlined below are omitted. The proces s is terminated at a spe-
cific location when epoxy exits from the crack at so me distance from the injection ports. This method
does not arrest ongoing corrosion.

A2.5. Step-By-Step Procedure.
      A2.5.1. Clean the cracks. Th e first step is to clean cracks that have been contaminated. Oil, grease,
      dirt, or f ine particles of conc rete prevent epoxy pe netration and bonding. Preferably, contamination
      should be removed by flushing with water or some other especially effective solvent. The solvent is
      then blown out using compressed air, or adequate time is provided for air-drying.
      A2.5.2. Seal the surface. Surface cracks should be sealed to keep the epoxy from leaking out before it
      has gelled. Where the crack face cannot be reac hed, but where there is backfill, or where a
      slab-ongrade is being repaired, the ba ckfill material or s ubbase material is often an adequate seal. A
      surface can be sealed by brushing an epoxy along the surface of the crack and allowing it to harden. If
      extremely high injection pressures are needed, the crack sh ould be cut out to a depth of 1/2 in. and
      width of about 3/4 in. in a V-shape, filled with an epoxy, and struck off flush with the surface. If a per-
      manent glossy appearance along th e crack is objectionable and if high injection pre ssure is not
      required, a strippable plastic may be applied along the crack. When the job is completed, the dry filler
      can be stripped away to expose the gloss-free surface.
      A2.5.3. Install the entry ports. Three methods are in general use:
AFPAM10-219V7 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                189


       A2.5.3.1. Drilled holes—fittings inserted. Historically, this method was the first to be used and is
       often used in conjunction with V -grooving of the cracks. The method enta ils drilling a hole into
       the crack, approximately 3/4 inch in diameter and 1/2 to 1 inch below the apex of the V -grooved
       section, into which a f itting, such as a pipe ni pple or tire valve stem, is bonded with an epoxy
       adhesive. A vacuum chuc k and bit are useful in preventing the cracks from being plugged with
       drilling dust.
       A2.5.3.2. Bonded flush fitting. When the cracks are not V-grooved, a method frequently used to
       provide an entry port is to bond a fitting flush with the concrete face over the crack. This flush fit-
       ting has a hat-like cross section with an opening at the top for the adhesive to enter.
       A2.5.3.3. Interruption in seal. Another means of providing entry is to omit the seal from a portion
       of the crack. This method can be used when special gasket devices are available that cover the
       unsealed portion of the crack and al low injection of the adhesive directly into the crack without
       leaking.
   A2.5.4. Mix the epoxy . This is done either by ba tch or continuous methods . In batch mixing, the
   adhesive components are premixed according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually with the use
   of a mechanical stirrer, like a paint mixing paddle. Care must be taken to mix only the amount of adhe-
   sive that can be used pr ior to commencement of gelling of the material. When the adhesive material
   begins to gel, its flow characteristics begin to change, and pressure injection becomes more and more
   difficult. In the continuous mixing system, the two liquid adhesive components pass through metering
   and driving pumps prior to passing through an automatic mixing head. The continuous mixing system
   allows the use of fast-setting adhesives that have a short working life.
   A2.5.5. Inject the epoxy.
       A2.5.5.1. Hydraulic pumps, paint pressure pots, or air-actuated caulking guns can be used. The
       pressure used for injection must be carefully selected. Increased pressure often does little to accel-
       erate the rate of injection. In fact, the use of excessive pressure can propagate the existing cracks,
       causing additional damage.
       A2.5.5.2. If the crack is vertical, the injection process should begin with pumping epoxy into the
       entry port at the lowest elevation until the e poxy level reaches the entry port above. The lower
       injection port is then capped, and the process is re peated at successively higher port s until the
       crack has been completely filled and all ports have been capped.
       A2.5.5.3. For horizontal cracks, injection should proceed from one end of the crack to the other in
       the same manner. The crack is fu ll if the pressur e can be main tained. If the press ure cannot be
       maintained, the epoxy is still flowing into unfilled portions or leaking out of the crack.
   A2.5.6. Remove the surface seal. After the inje cted epoxy has cured, the surface seal should be
   removed by grinding or other m eans, as appropriate. Fittings an d holes at entry ports should be
   painted with an epoxy-patching compound.

A2.6. Environmental Considerations. Reasonable caution should guide the prepar ation, repair, and
cleanup phases of any crack repair activities invol ving potentially hazardous and toxic chemical sub-
stances. Manufacturer's recommendations to protect occupational health and environmental quality
should be carefully followed. In in stances where the ef fects of a ch emical substance on occupationa l
health or environmental quality ar e unknown, chemical substa nces should be trea ted as potentially haz-
ardous and toxic materials.
