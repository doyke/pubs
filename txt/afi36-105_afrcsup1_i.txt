OPR: HQ USAF/DPCX (Jack G. Flowers)                   Certified by: HQ USAF/DPC (Mr John R. Graham)
Supersedes AFI 36-105, 28 January 1994, and                                                 Pages: 2

This instruction implements AFPD 36-1, General Civilian Personnel Provisions and Authorities. It
directs civilian personnel flights (CPF) to service activities outside of their own organization. The objec-
tive of a servicing CPF is to provide comparable services to all cust omers as d escribed in AFI 36-104,
Operating The Civilian Personnel Flight.
(AFRC) The OPR for this supplement is HQ AFRC/DPCE (Al Henderson). Th is supplement imple-
ments and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-105, 22 Mar 94, on developing support
agreements (SA) and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) pertaining to air reserve technicians (ART)
and other command unique programs. T he AFI is printe d word-for-word without editorial review. A ir
Force Reserve supplementary material is indicated by “(AFRC)” in boldface type. This supplement
describes Air Force Reserve Co mmandprocedures to be used in conjunction with the basic instruction.
Upon receipt of this integrated supplement, discard the Air Force basic.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication substantially revises AFR 40-105. It minimizes the use of intra-service agreements and
requires that all agre ements negotiated by major commands (MAJCOM) be approved by H Q USAF/
DPCX.
(AFRC) This r evision incorporates the procedures formerly in A FR 40-105/AFRES Sup 1, 30 Jun 8 6,
and aligns our supplement with current instructions within AFI 36-105.fied Current 18 August 2009

1. Personnel Servicing Arrangements. There are two basic types of civilian personnel servicing
arrangements. These are intra-Air Force and inter-agency arrangements. Only the inter-agency arrange-
ments require a written personnel servicing agreement. All written personnel servicing agreements must
be approved by HQ USAF/DPCX.
    1.1. Intra-Air Force Personnel Servicing Arrangements. All Air Fo rce civilian employees must
    be serviced by an Air Force CPF to make sure all are included in the Air Force Civilian Personnel Pro-
    gram. All Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force installation with a CPF, or in the same local-
    ity, must be serviced by that CPF. When an activity is not collocated, or near a CPF, services must be
    provided by the nearest CPF. Exceptions must be referred to HQ USAF/DPCX for resolution.
    1.1. (AFRC) HQ AFRC, in conjunction with other MAJCOMs, may develop, as required, SAs or
    MOUs to address unique requirements for servicing ARTs and other command unique programs.
    Since written servicing agreements are not required between Air Force units, a statement, in the base
    level SA, that the servicing Civilian Personnel Flight provides standard ser vice according to A FI
    36-104, Operating the Civilian Personnel Flight, and the requirements of the applicable AFRC/MAJ-
    COM MOU will suffice. MOUs developed at MAJCOM level addressing unique servicing for ARTs
    should be attached for clarification.
    1.2. Inter-Agency Personnel Arrangements . Air Force officials must be receptive to other Depart-
    ment of Defense (DoD) components and agencies requesting servicing by Air Force CPFs.
    Inter-agency personnel servicing agreements must identify the activity to be serviced and its location
    and approximate number of employees. Also, any special responsibilities of the serviced and servic-
    ing activities must be defined. The staffing authorized and the reimbursement arrangements should be
    negotiated locally. All servicing agreements must be reviewed every 3 years by the servicing and ser-
    viced activities. Functional responsibilities for personnel servicing arrangements are as follows:
        •HQ USAF/DPCX negotiates inter-agency personnel servicing agreements when Air Force CPFs
            of more than one MAJCOM is involved.
        •The MAJCOM Director of Civilian Personnel, on behalf of the Commander, makes inter-agency
            personnel servicing agreements when Air Force CPFs of only their c ommand are involved.
            These agreements must be consistent with DoD Directive 1400.16, Inter-Departmental Civil-
            ian Administration Support, October 30, 1970, wit h Change 1 a nd coordinated with HQ
            USAF/DPCX before final approval.

2. Designation To Act for Appointing Authority. The head of an agency or department cannot delegate
the basic authority to effect personnel actions to anyone outside of the agency or department. The civilian
personnel officer who is providing the service to another agency must be designated, not delegated, this
authority. Th is written design ation must be by position title and provide for administration of the tot al
Civilian Personnel Program.
