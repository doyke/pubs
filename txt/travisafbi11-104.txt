SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include:

action agencies within the wing.
1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. Current Operations (OSO) is responsible for publishing the WOP, Air Operations Directive
   (AOD), and Mission Information Supplements (MIS).
   1.2. Aircrew Training (60 OSS/OST) will coordinate local training events with the WOP planner no
   later than (NLT), 15th day of the month preceding the effective month. Individual squadrons are
   responsible for establishing their own local training sorties.
2                                                                  TRAVISAFBI11-104 16 MAY 2009


    1.3. Plans and Scheduling (60 MOS/MXOOS) will schedule aircraft as required to fill 60 AMW and
    349 AMW missions, local training, and any additional requirements listed in the AOD, MIS, and
    monthly WOP.
    1.4. Travis Command Post (60 AMW/CP) will coordinate and provide command and control
    required for all missions described in the AOD or MIS. During other than normal duty hours, 60
    AMW/CP will task by telephone any unscheduled mission requirements, after coordinating with the
    on-call Current Operations Director or “Barrel”. When the 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center
    (TACC) directs mission changes within 24 hours of departure time, 60 AMW/CP will coordinate the
    changes with all action agencies and inform the “Barrel”.
    1.5. Squadrons will provide appropriate personnel for their assigned missions, training flights, and
    any additional requirements as reflected in the AOD, applicable MIS, and monthly WOP.
2. Procedures.
    2.1. 60 OSS/OSO is the primary point of contact for all 60 AMW and 349 AMW missions, training
    flights, and additional requirements for the WOP, AOD, and MIS. OSO will coordinate with users,
    618th TACC, and action agencies to gather all required information for each mission. (Note:
    Except within 24 hours of departure; see paragraph 1.4.)
    2.2. OSO will develop and distribute all MIS’s after receiving additions, cancellations, or changes to
    the flying schedule.
    2.3. 60 AMW/CP will control all missions listed in the AOD starting 24 hours prior to launch until
    the mission terminates or is canceled. OSO will reschedule canceled training flights as required.
    2.4. The AOD is directive in nature and is the authority for 60 AMW/CP to employ all resources
    under its control to accomplish the requirements of the AOD.
3. Terms Explained.
    3.1. Wing Operations Plan (WOP) provides operational policies and guidance for advance planning
    on a monthly basis. WOP will outline responsibilities and tentative itineraries for scheduled
    missions. 60 OSS/OSO will distribute the WOP NLT seven days prior to the operating month in
    accordance with AMCI 11-206, Chapter 5.
    3.2. Air Operations Directive (AOD) is published each Monday. AOD summarizes all flying events
    occurring on Travis AFB. Prior to holidays, 60 OSS/OSO will publish the AOD for the period
    through the next two duty days. All squadrons and action agencies receive a copy of the AOD.
