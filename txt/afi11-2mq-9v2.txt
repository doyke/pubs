                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.

1.2. Procedures.
    1.2.1. Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria in this
    instruction for conducting all flight and emergency procedure evaluations. To ensure standard and
    objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation cri-
    teria.
    1.2.2. All evaluations fall under the Instrument (INSTM), Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN),
    Instructor (INSTR), or SPOT criteria in AFI 11-202V2. INSTM applies to pilots only. Schedule all
    evaluation activity to occur on one sortie to the greatest extent possible.
    1.2.3. FEs may use video recording (VR) devices to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
    1.2.4. FEs will brief examinees on the evaluation purpose, conduct and the evaluation areas prior to
    flight. Examinees will accomplish required flight planning for the evaluation IAW requirements for
    their crew position. Examinees will furnish FEs a copy of necessary flight logs, target folders, and
    other required mission materials.
    1.2.5. FEs should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations except when it would afford
    the best opportunity to conduct INSTR evaluations.
    1.2.6. Areas required to complete an evaluation are indicated with an "R" on applicable evaluation
    criteria tables. When a required area cannot be evaluated in flight, it will be evaluated by an Aircrew
    Training Device (ATD) or by oral examination in order to complete the evaluation. Document the use
    of alternate evaluation methods in the AF Form 8 comments section. If an alternate evaluation method
    was used in a flight evaluation required area, the next evaluation cannot use an alternate method for
    that area
    1.2.7. FEs will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. The debrief will include the examinee's
    overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and any recommended
    additional training.

1.3. Grading Instructions. Performance standards are in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction.
    1.3.1. FEs will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation
    with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area. FEs will
    derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observed
    events and tasks IAW this volume.
    1.3.2. FEs will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable air-
    craft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances provided the examinee applies prompt
    corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. FEs will consider cumulative
    deviations when determining an overall grade.
    1.3.3. When grading criteria specify evaluation of airspeed and the flight manual lists only a mini-
    mum/maximum airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed.
AFI11-2MQ-9V2 15 APRIL 2008                                                                                 5


   1.3.4. FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific situa-
   tions are not covered.
   1.3.5. An unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified by this instruction requires an overall
   unqualified grade.
   1.3.6. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
   1.3.7. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for specific
   events and instrument final approaches:
       1.3.7.1. Q:
           1.3.7.1.1. Altitude: +/-150 feet.
           1.3.7.1.2. Airspeed: +10/-5 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).
           1.3.7.1.3. Course: +/-20 degrees/1.5 nautical miles (NM) (whichever is greater).
       1.3.7.2. Q-:
           1.3.7.2.1. Altitude: +/- 200 feet.
           1.3.7.2.2. Airspeed: +15/-7 KIAS.
           1.3.7.2.3. Course: +/-30 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater).
       1.3.7.3. U: Exceeded Q- limits.

1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will use an ATD to conduct EPEs, if available and
EPE capable. If not using an ATD, administer the EPE orally. This evaluation will include areas commen-
surate with examinee's qualifications.
   1.4.1. Include the following items on all EPEs:
       1.4.1.1. Evaluate Pilots and Sensor Operators (SO) on general aircraft and mission systems
       knowledge as required by their crew position.
       1.4.1.2. Evaluate at least two emergency procedures and all CAP per applicable phase of flight,
       eight emergency procedures minimum. Crewmembers will not be evaluated on events in which
       they are not specifically trained (e.g. pre-takeoff, takeoff, landing emergency procedures and asso-
       ciated CAP will not be evaluated unless conducting a QUAL for Launch and Recovery (L/R)).
       Units will publish a list of EPs for which crew are responsible IAW above direction.
       1.4.1.3. Evaluate crew coordination where applicable.
       1.4.1.4. Evaluate unusual attitude recoveries on all pilot EPEs.
   1.4.2. Tailor MSN evaluation scenarios to unit tasking and include areas not normally evaluated in
   flight. FEs should include the following additional items on the EPE given as a requisite to the mis-
   sion evaluation.
       1.4.2.1. Basic sensor systems operation.
       1.4.2.2. Safe passage procedures/threat avoidance.
   1.4.3. Unqualified EPE
6                                                                     AFI11-2MQ-9V2 15 APRIL 2008


       1.4.3.1. Place examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade in supervised status until com-
       pleting recommended additional training and/or successfully accomplishing a reevaluation.
       1.4.3.2. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of unsatisfactory CAP accom-
       plishment will not be permitted to fly in their crew position until a successful reevaluation is
       accomplished.
    1.4.4. Use the following grading criteria to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.4.4.1. Q. Correct performance. Recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.4.4.2. Q-. Safe Performance, but limited in proficiency with errors of omission or commission.
       1.4.4.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.

1.5. Crew Resource Management (CRM). IAW AFI 11-202V2, CRM skills will be evaluated for all
crewmembers during all evaluations in the following areas (AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Man-
agement Training Program, may be used as a reference).
    1.5.1. Mission planning/briefing
    1.5.2. Crew coordination
    1.5.3. Situational awareness/task management.
    1.5.4. Risk management/decision making.
    1.5.5. Communication.
    1.5.6. Mission debriefing

1.6. Examinations.
    1.6.1. Closed book. All closed book questions will come from the MQ-9 Master Question File
    (MQF) or local/theater procedures. At least ten percent of the questions will be from local/theater pro-
    cedures (local area MQF is optional).
    1.6.2. Critical Action Procedures. This exam will be written from memory. Responses must contain
    all critical action items in proper sequence for all CAPs the crewmember is qualified in.
    1.6.3. Open book. Questions are derived from flight manuals and governing command directives.

1.7. Flight Publications Check. Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in the unit
supplement to AFI 11-202V2. Flight publications that will be checked for currency and proper posting
during all flight evaluations are (electronic copies are acceptable):
    1.7.1. T.O. 1Q-9(M)A-1CL-1, Flight Crew Checklist

                                  EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
    2.1.1. Evaluation Procedures. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2 and
    this volume. Before the mission briefing, the flight examiner will brief the examinee on specific eval-
    uation areas and, if applicable, will inform the pilot in command of any special requirements. Use cri-
    teria in the chapter for the appropriate crew position for evaluations. Units may modify evaluation
    profiles based on local operating considerations or FE judgment to complete the evaluation.
    2.1.2. Evaluation Requirements.
       2.1.2.1. FEs must evaluate all required areas in order to complete the evaluation.
           2.1.2.1.1. Document use of alternate evaluation methods in the AF Form 8, Comments sec-
           tion.
           2.1.2.1.2. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alter-
           nate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
       2.1.2.2. An asterisk (*) indicates critical areas (1, 2, 3, 4). A grade of U awarded in any critical
       area requires an overall Q-3 for the evaluation.
       2.1.2.3. Grade all observed areas.

2.2. Pilot Instrument Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules (IFR) (to the
extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM evaluation. The instrument flight phase will nor-
mally be combined with the qualification flight phase. Units may elect to administer this evaluation on
any compatible training mission or combined with the mission evaluation. (NOTE: For pilots not quali-
fying in aircraft L/R operations, certain elements of the INSTM evaluation are not required provided the
appropriate documentation is included on the AF Form 8, IAW Table 4.1.). Minimum ground phase req-
uisites are:
    2.2.1. Instrument examination.
    2.2.2. CAP examination.

2.3. Qualification Evaluation. A mission evaluating the examinee’s ability to safely and effectively
operate the aircraft and associated subsystems. This evaluation encompasses basic aircraft handling and
pattern work and basic operation of the sensors. For crewmembers not qualifying to perform aircraft L/R
operations, certain elements of the QUAL evaluation are not required provided the appropriate documen-
tation is included on the AF Form 8 IAW Table 4.1. and Table 5.1. Minimum ground phase requirements
are:
    2.3.1. Closed-book examination.
    2.3.2. Open-book examination.
    2.3.3. EPE.
    2.3.4. CAP examination.

2.4. Mission Evaluation. Mission profiles that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. Design the profiles to evaluate the mission qualifica-
tions as well as basic airmanship of Basic Mission Capable (BMC) and Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
examinees. Design profiles using current tactics, unit DOC tasking, and Area of Responsibility commit-
ments. Profiles will incorporate all appropriate evaluation requirements in Table 3.1., and will always
include weapons employment. Give initial MSN evaluations in the primary DOC of the unit. Evaluations
during exercises or deployments are encouraged.
   2.4.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.4.1.1. EPE (Mission scenarios).
       2.4.1.2. CAP examination.
   2.4.2. Evaluation Profiles. FE judgment may be used to modify evaluation profiles based on local/the-
   ater operating considerations.
       2.4.2.1. NT-ISR. Units should primarily fly NT-ISR evaluations during daytime to allow tasking
       of all sensor systems; however, units may fly night evaluations. Acquire pre-planned or ad-hoc
       targets and satisfy applicable essential elements of information (EEI). FEs may assign targets
       in-flight. The pilot is responsible for positioning the aircraft to allow EEI satisfaction. Targets not
       acquired due to adverse weather, verified sensor malfunction, or threat reaction will not be graded
       as misses.
       2.4.2.2. A-S. Crews will comply with appropriate provisions of AFI 11-214 and MAJCOM sup-
       plements.. Acceptable missions and their requirements to fulfill the A-S requirement include:
           2.4.2.2.1. Close Air Support (CAS) – Mission sortie flown in support of ground forces (actual
           or simulated) under the control of a Forward Air Controller (FAC), either air or ground, pro-
           viding air strike control for the attacks. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical
           mission planning, execution against actual or simulated threats, simulated or actual weapons
           employment against designated targets while under positive control of an air or ground FAC
           interfacing (actual or simulated) with the TACS/AAGS C2 network, and in-flight report
           (INFLTREP).
           2.4.2.2.2. Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR) – Coordinate one or more inde-
           pendent attacks by real or simulated strike aircraft, on or off range, with actual or simulated
           ordnance against lucrative targets identified and validated in specified geographic locations.
           Mission elements include: Target area reconnaissance and target identification, C3I network
           interface, RPA-to-striker brief, target marking and striker hand-off, battle damage assessment
           (BDA) and INFLTREP, as required.
           2.4.2.2.3. Surface Attack Tactics (SAT) – Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in
           SAT. Mission types include Strategic Attack (SA), Air Interdiction (AI), Time-Sensitive Tar-
           geting (TST), Offensive Counter-Air Air-to-Surface (OCA-S), and Destruction of Enemy Air
           Defenses (DEAD). Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning,
           execution against actual or simulated threats, simulated or actual weapons delivery against a
           tactical target, and INFLTREP. Simulated attacks may be conducted against realistic targets
           IAW local restrictions.
NOTE: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) crewmembers will only be evaluated on those missions routinely
performed by the examinee. Evaluate only those areas in which they are qualified.

2.5. Formal Course Evaluation. Fly evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile guidelines or on a mis-
sion profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Units may modify formal course guidelines
based on local operating considerations or FE judgment to complete the evaluation. Grade training objec-
tives and related areas using appropriate performance criteria.

2.6. Instructor Evaluations.
     2.6.1. INSTR flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of knowledge, judgment, instruc-
     tor ability (including error analysis of student activity) and use of grading documents, as well as pro-
     ficiency in their crew specialty. During the initial INSTR evaluation the examinee must demonstrate
     the ability to instruct in some phase of the unit's mission. The instructional topic/area will be anno-
     tated in the comments section of the AF Form 8. Except for requirements delineated in Table 3.2., the
     flight examiner will determine specific profiles and/or events. Subsequent periodic evaluations (for
     example, INSTM/QUAL, QUAL, or MSN) will include instructor portions during the evaluations.
        2.6.1.1. Instructors must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student (or qualified individual
        acting as a student). The evaluator may require the examinee to present verbal explanations of
        equipment operations, procedures, and techniques pertinent to crew duties and responsibilities.
        2.6.1.2. During any phase of the flight portion of the evaluation, the evaluator may require the
        examinee to demonstrate (not instruct) and/or present verbal explanations of system operations
        and/or procedures. Evaluators must ensure oral questions/instructions are clear, concise, pertinent
        to the individual's crew duties, and do not interfere with normal mission accomplishment.
     2.6.2. FEs may administer a periodic INSTR/MSN check on a Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructor
     during a FTU training sortie.
     2.6.3. Periodic FTU INSTR checks conducted with a FTU student will comply with the student FTU
     evaluation requirements.
     2.6.4. An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training in any graded area will
     not perform instructor duties until the required additional training is complete. This restriction will be
     written into the comments section and the restrictions block will be marked on the AF Form 8. Table
     3.2. and Chapter 3 contain specific INSTR evaluation requirements.
