1. AFSPC Workforce Management Philosophy
     1.1. AFSPC’s philosophy is to manage its contractor resources as an integral part of its total
     workforce. Military, DoD civilian, and contractor resources complement one another with
     unique skills, capabilities, and qualities critical to accomplishing the Command’s mission. In
     managing its total workforce, AFSPC strives to balance the organic and contractor elements
     in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible. To this end and consistent with
     assigned missions and workloads, AFSPC organizations annually review current and
     projected workloads against resources available to perform the workloads and develop
     estimates of, and program for, their organic manpower and contractor requirements budget
     lead time away from actual need. In this endeavor, it is important to consider the differences
     in the skill sets required for the Command’s research, development, acquisition, test,
     sustainment; mission systems operations and maintenance; base/infrastructure activities; the
     fluidity of new and existing workloads; and the need to maintain a core of organic capability
     and expertise. To ensure efficient and cost effective resource management, AFSPC
     organizations shall ensure a resource management process is in place to assess the
     organization’s current resource posture and future resource requirements and to ensure that:
     1.2. Organic resources and CSS are efficiently, effectively and judiciously utilized in light of
     workload requirements and priorities.
     1.3. Organic resources are not available prior to contracting for proposed CSS workloads.
     1.4. Use of CSS is in accordance with statutory and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
     provisions, AF and AFSPC policy and guidance unique to the types of services being
     acquired.
     1.5. Use of CSS is both cost effective and in the strategic interest of the requiring activity,
     AFSPC and the AF.
AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  3


   1.6. All measures are taken to minimize use of, and to reduce organizational reliance on,
   CSS.
2. Policy Application
   2.1. AFSPC/Commander (CC) has appointed the AFSPC/A8P as the AFSPC CSS
   Requirements Approval Process owner.
   2.2. The acquisition of all services ≥$150K (Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT))
   (including services in a Program Executive Officer (PEO) portfolio) shall be processed via
   the AFSPC Services Database, Requirements Approval Document (RAD).
      2.2.1. The services in a PEO Portfolio must be processed through the AFSPC RAD
      database, even though the approval rests at the PEO.
   2.3. All new contracted studies are to be entered into the Contract Studies Registry Program
   (CSRP) database maintained by AF/A9 per the VCSAF Memo, Air Force Contract Studies
   Registry Program, dated 7 June 2012.

      located on the AF Portal, Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21)
      page.
   2.4. For purposes of this publication, the term “Unit” refers to all AFSPC Directorates,
   Centers, NAFs and Wings.
   2.5. Acquisition of services <$150K (SAT) will be processed at the Unit level IAW Unit
   guidelines.
3. Organic Resources
   3.1. Use of organic resources is the preferred method for accomplishing AFSPC mission
   requirements. AFSPC Units shall thoroughly evaluate use of permanent and temporary (e.g.
   temporary or term appointees) organic resources before considering CSS.
   3.2. Each Unit shall maintain an organic capability that is technically able to prescribe and
   evaluate the work/support that the contractor is to perform.
4. Requirements Approval Procedures
   4.1. The RAD process is to verify a valid requirement exists. Units with CSS requirements
   shall appoint a primary and alternate Support Services Advisory Panel (SSAP) member to
   oversee the Unit's CSS activities. The SSAP member must be knowledgeable of the Unit's
   mission, functions, resource management process and current and future workload/resource
   posture. In addition, the SSAP member shall be responsible for advocating the Unit's CSS
   requirements at the AFSPC SSAP meetings.
      4.1.1. Support Services Advisory Panel (SSAP)—The SSAP members are the single
      point of contact for CSS requirements approval activities within the Unit. In this advisory
      capacity, the SSAP assists the AFSPC Corporate Process in fulfilling its oversight and
      recommendation responsibilities for AFSPC CSS requirements and facilitates the timely
      processing of CSS requirements through the AFSPC Corporate process. The SSAP will
      include membership from each HQ AFSPC Directorate, Wing, NAF and Center as
4                                                        AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013


       appropriate. The AFSPC SSAP is chaired by HQ AFSPC/A8P. The SSAP will meet as
       required to review RADs prior to Corporate Meetings.
       4.1.2. Unit SSAP members shall attend the AFSPC SSAP meetings (remotely or in
       person) as required and must be able to explain and defend the Unit's CSS requirements.
       If necessary, the SSAP member will invite the Program Manager (PM)/Requirements
       Initiator (RI)/Program Element Monitor (PEM), to the meeting to assist in advocating the
       Unit's CSS requirements and make administrative corrections as needed. The SSAP
       member will work with the PM/RI/PEM offline to make the corrections and be prepared
       for the next SSAP meeting. After review by the AFSPC SSAP, RADs >$1M shall be
       submitted by AFSPC/A8PK to the AFSPC Group for review.
       4.1.3. Key Member Attendance to SSAP meetings.              Representatives from HQ
       AFSPC/A8P, HQ AFSPC/JA, Servicing Contracting Office, Personnel Office, Small
       Business Office and others as required will act as subject matter experts (SMEs) during
       the initial review.
    4.2. The AFSPC Services Database (https://tdka-as02-pkn-n/RAD/services) is the official
    database in which the PM/RI/PEM, in coordination with the Unit SSAP member, shall
    document information for all CSS requirements (see paragraph 4.5.8 for Special Access
    Program (SAP) requirements).
    4.3. Approve CSS requirements in accordance with Table 4.1 The dollar value for the
    thresholds is the estimated value of the total service requirement for the performance period
    of the contract to include options. Requirements shall not be split to avoid these thresholds.
    The dollar threshold of the requirement will determine the approval authority. All CSS
    requirements ≥ $150K (SAT) shall be addressed in a RAD.

NOTES:
1. The threshold is the cost/price estimate for the total planned service acquisition.
2. Related task orders and/or options within an ordering vehicle shall be viewed as one effort for the
purpose of determining the appropriate threshold.
3. SDO for services elements embedded in supply or weapon system contracts is determined by the
S-CAT threshold corresponding to the cost/price of the embedded service.
4. SDO delegations: SDO for S-CAT I must be the PEO/TEO or a General Officer/Senior Executive
Service (GO/SES) unless waived by SMS. SDO for S-CAT II must be the PEO/TEO or an O-6/GS-
15 or higher. SDO for S-CAT III must be the PEO/TEO or an O-5/GS-14 or higher.
5. All SDOs must be within the PEO/TEO or requirements chain. PEO/TEO has authority only for
those requirements in that PEO/TEO’s portfolio.
6. Approval by an MDA for an ACAT program of record captured within program milestone decision
documents shall serve as requirements approval for embedded services. No further approval for those
services is required.
7. AFSPC/CC has delegated the Services Requirements Approval Authority for acquisitions <$1M
to Wing Commanders, Headquarters Directors and Space and Missile Systems Center (for A&AS)
having program responsibility and in the rank of O-6/civilian equivalent or above.

     4.4. Responsibility for obtaining approval rests with the requiring activity (i.e., the
     organization that "owns" the requirement). The PM shall provide the approved RAD to the
     Contracting Office executing the requirement as part of the initial purchase request or other
     appropriate acquisition request package.
        4.4.1. Approval for CSS requirements awarded on a non-AF contract (e.g. Military
        Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) issued to General Services Administration
AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013                                                              7


     (GSA), Navy, Army, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), etc.). The
     PM/RI/PEM shall obtain approval, via a RAD, for each requirement obtained via a non-
     AF contract. The RAD shall be included as part of the initial MIPR package submitted to
     the Contracting Officer. MIPRs shall not be forwarded to the Servicing Contracting
     Office without an approved RAD.
     4.4.2. Approval for CSS requirements awarded on an existing Indefinite Delivery
     Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or multiple award contract that has an approved
     RAD. The PM/RI/PEM shall not be required to obtain approval of task orders awarded
     against an IDIQ contract where the basic contract has an approved RAD.
        4.4.2.1. The only exception is for the Contract for Space & Missile Capabilities
        (CSMC) or any follow-on contract. Individual CSMC task orders must have an
        approved RAD to ensure HQ AFSPC leadership is aware of contractor support being
        provided to the HQ AFSPC staff.
  4.5. CSS Requirements. A flow diagram illustrating the AFSPC CSS Requirements
  Approval Process is provided at Attachment 2. The following paragraphs expand on this
  flow diagram.
     4.5.1. Establishing and Validating CSS Requirements. Each Unit shall develop internal
     management controls for efficient and effective workforce use and development. The
     Unit shall conduct an annual assessment of its current and future workload and resource
     requirements. This assessment shall support execution, planning and programming
     (Program Objective Memorandum [POM] or President’s Budget (PB) activities).
        4.5.1.1. Requirements for new contracts ≥$1M will be vetted through the AFSPC
        Corporate Process and approved prior to the Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP).
     4.5.2. Preparing the RAD. The PM/RI/PEM shall work with the resource advisor and
     user representative to identify funding and prepare a RAD in the AFSPC Services
     Database. (https://tdka-as02-pkn-n/RAD/services). SSAP members will be included in
     all coordination for continuity and proper database input procedures.
        4.5.2.1. The RAD shall be completed and staffed by government personnel only --
        support contractor personnel shall not prepare requirements for approval due to
        potential conflict of interest and inherently governmental function issues.
        4.5.2.2. All aspects of the RAD will be input via AFSPC Services Database. RADs
        >$1M will be heard by AFSPC Corporate Process. In addition to submitting the
        RAD via the Database, Units will submit the required briefing slides via email to
        AFSPC/A8PK Workflow to be added to the next round of Corporate Process
        meetings. (See template at Attachment 4.)
        4.5.2.3. Approval of the requirement through this process does not constitute funding
        approval or availability. Approval of an unfunded requirement may be requested in
        order to posture the requirement for potential fall-out funds.
        4.5.2.4. All service requirements shall be addressed in a RAD. Incomplete RADs
        shall be returned for rework.
        4.5.2.5. The PM/RI/PEM shall coordinate the CSS requirement with the Unit SSAP
        member before obtaining final validation, review and coordination by the Unit CC
8                                                   AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013


       and before presenting the requirement to the AFSPC Corporate Process for
       AFSPC/CC and/or SAF/AQ approval.
       4.5.2.6. Validation of the RAD signifies the approval authority: agrees the proposed
       service requirement is not inherently governmental; cannot be supported through
       additional training or development of the Unit’s organic workforce or through
       internal workload/resource realignment; and concurs with the proposed requirement.
       4.5.2.7. Once the RAD has received Unit CC coordination, the RAD will be
       electronically routed through the Unit SSAP member via the AFSPC Services
       Database to AFSPC/A8PK.
    4.5.3. The Unit shall process all CSS requirements valued ≥$150K (SAT) and <$1M
    using the AFSPC Services Database with appropriate approval levels within the Unit.
    4.5.4. Coordination and Approval of CSS Requirements. All AFSPC CSS requirements
    ≥$1M shall be processed via the AFSPC Services Database and will require
    coordination/approval by AFSPC/CC via the AFSPC Corporate Process (IAW
    AFSPCHOI 16-10, AFSPC Corporate Process).
       4.5.4.1. The first coordination step is for the SSAP member to ensure all necessary
       information has been input into the AFSPC Services Database (see paragraph 4.2).
       4.5.4.2. Once the RAD has been approved by the SSAP, AFSPC/A8PK will submit
       the RAD to the AFSPC Corporate Process for review (Group, Board and Council).
       (see paragraph 4.5.8. for SAP requirements). The SSAP member will coordinate read
       aheads and a briefer with A8PK. (see paragraph 4.5.2.2)
       4.5.4.3. At the AFSPC Corporate Group meeting, if approved, the RAD will receive
       3-letter coord within the MAJCOM. Documenting the coordination in the RAD
       database will be the responsibility of the SSAP member.
       4.5.4.4. Presenter at the Group and Board meetings. The PEM, RAD originator or
       suitable member will present the RAD to the Group and Board. If the RAD
       originator is selected to present, the PEM (located at Peterson AFB) will be prepared
       to present in case of a VTC malfunction or non-availability of the off-site presenter.
       The Unit's representative or PEM, must be able to explain and defend the Unit's CSS
       requirements at the Group and Board meetings. Note: Board and Council briefers
       must be consistent and approved by NAF or Center leadership.
    4.5.5. The AFSPC Group and Board shall review RADs as required. The review will
    result in one of the following recommendations to the next Corporate Process level.
       4.5.5.1. Approve, meaning the RAD is ready for the next Corporate level review.
       4.5.5.2. Revisit, meaning there is additional information necessary.              Unit
       representative or PEM shall prepare for the next scheduled meeting at that level.
       4.5.5.3. Recommend disapproval, meaning there is a fundamental problem with the
       requirement and further action is not appropriate.
    4.5.6. After receiving an approval recommendation from the Board, the RAD will be
    submitted for Council review/approval. At the Council meeting, A8P shall present all
    RADs to the Council as an overview. The Unit briefer will present the RAD to the
AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013                                                                9


     Council. The originating 2-letter Council member shall provide input as needed during
     meeting.
     4.5.7. The Unit’s SSAP member shall document the AFSPC/CC’s decision in the
     AFSPC Services Database. AFSPC/A8PK will submit approval memos for AFSPC/CC
     signature and return the memos to the Unit for processing. PM/RI/PEM may track the
     status of a requirement at any point in the process by checking the database. Information
     on CSS requirements that are not approved is retained in the AFSPC Services Database
     for historical purposes.
        4.5.7.1. After the RAD has been vetted through the Corporate Process, the SSAP
        Member shall ensure coordination is documented (for 2 and 3-letter coord) in the
        AFSPC Services Database prior to submission for final approval and submission to
        respective Contracting Office for processing.
     4.5.8. AFSPC/A8/9 has appointed the AFSPC/A8Z as the AFSPC Requirements
     Approval Process owner for SAP/SAR requirements.
        4.5.8.1. Special Access Program/Special Access Required (SAP/SAR) Service
        Requirements. SAP/SAR CSS requirements are not completely exempt from the
        unclassified RAD process. When it is determined by the PM, Program Security
        Office (PSO) and HQ AFSPC/A8Z that the requirement cannot follow normal
        procedures due to classification or security reasons and that inclusion in the database
        could compromise the program; the PM/RI/PEM shall follow a modified process
        using hard-copy forms and shall communicate via secure program channels only (see
        template at Attachment 3). The Unit CC shall coordinate on the RAD and shall
        process via appropriate program channels for approval based on the service
        acquisition thresholds defined in Table 4.1
        4.5.8.2. SAP access requires formal approval and receipt of a program brief. Access
        to SAPs shall not be granted to AFSPC personnel solely for the purpose of
        coordinating/processing a RAD. All documents must comply with classifications and
        markings IAW the Joint Air Force-Army-Navy (JAFAN) Manual, Chapter 4.
        4.5.8.3. Preparing the RAD for SAP/SAR requirements. The PM/RI/PEM shall
        prepare a hard-copy RAD following the format found in the AFSPC Services
        Database (https://tdka-as02-pkn-n/RAD/services). The PM/RI/PEM shall
        coordinate the CSS requirement with HQ AFSPC/A8Z via secure program channels
        before obtaining final validation, review and coordination by the Unit's CC and
        before processing the requirement for AFSPC/CC and/or AF SAE approval.
        4.5.8.4. HQ AFSPC/A8Z shall review all SAP/SAR RADs for accuracy and shall
        return all incomplete RADs to the PM/RI/PEM initiator for rework and re-
        submission. The HQ AFSPC/A8Z action officer assigned to the Unit shall represent
        the Unit’s CSS requirement if the field Unit is unable to provide a representative.
        4.5.8.5. Coordination and Approval of SAP/SAR CSS Requirements. All SAP/SAR
        AFSPC CSS requirements shall be coordinated/approved through a modified AFSPC
        Corporate Process. A modified AFSPC Group (HQ AFSPC A8/9, A8Z, and others as
        deemed necessary) is the initial entry point for all SAP/SAR RADs submitted for
        AFSPC/CC approval, in lieu of the SSAP review.
 10                                                    AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013


          4.5.8.6. Once the SAP/SAR RAD has received Unit CC coordination, a sanitized
          RAD shall be electronically entered into the AFSPC Services Database identifying
          HQ AFSPC/A8Z as the owner of the requirement. This is necessary in order to track
          the requirement through the process even though no classified information will be
          included in the RAD.
   4.6. CSS Requirements ≥$100M. For CSS requirements ≥$100M, the Unit SSAP member
   shall guide the RAD through the Corporate process as identified in paragraph 4.5. (4.5.8. for
   SAP/SAR requirements).
       4.6.1. Following coordination by AFSPC/CC, the RAD will be processed through
       AFPEO/CM for SAF/AQ review and approval. SAP/SAR requirements will be
       processed through SAF/AQL for SAF/AQ approval.
   4.7. For requirements ≥$100M. SAF/AQ review typically takes 45 working days from the
   time of receipt of a complete CSS requirement by the SSAP member facilitating the RAD. If
   review cannot be accomplished within this timeframe, the PM/RI/PEM shall be notified of
   the expected timeframe.
5. Acquiring CSS
   5.1. After the approval of a RAD, the PM/RI/PEM shall work with the cognizant contracting
   office and develop the Purchase Request (PR) package. All CSS purchase request/acquisition
   request packages must include an approved RAD prior to submission to the cognizant
   contracting office. All services contracts ≥$150K (SAT) must be traceable to an underlying
   RAD.
6. Responsibilities
   6.1. HQ AFSPC/A8/9 shall:
       6.1.1. Appoint AFSPC/A8P as lead to manage RADs process.
       6.1.2. HQ AFSPC/A8P shall chair and administer the AFSPC SSAP.

       services.
          6.1.3.1. HQ AFSPC/A8Z shall forward SAP/SAR requirements ≥$100M through
          SAF/AQL to process for SAF/AQ approval.
       6.1.4. HQ AFSPC/A8PK will be responsible for managing the AFSPC Services
       Database for processing RADs and will provide training for RAD database usage to
       SSAP members.
          6.1.4.1. HQ AFSPC/A8PK will collect annual SSAP member appointment memos
          and send out quarterly/semi-annual requirements.
          6.1.4.2. HQ AFSPC/A8PK will coordinate packages and briefers with Corporate
          Process Secretariat for submitted RADs.
          6.1.4.3. HQ AFSPC/A8PK will submit a quarterly report of service requirements
          approved during that quarter with an estimated annual value of $10M or more to the
          SMS. (per AFI63-138, 3.4.2)
AFSPCI63-138 24 DECEMBER 2013                                                             11

Terms
AFSPC Corporate Process (IAW AFSPCHOI 16—10)—The Corporate Process provides a
flexible means to vet major issues through HQ AFSPC and subordinate NAFs and centers. It is
the primary forum for corporate deliberations when timeliness and/or face-to-face deliberations
are essential. The AFSPC Corporate Process also facilitates the transition of programmatic
decision-making from a functional requirements view to a corporate AFSPC-framed,
capabilities-focused process. In addition, the process ensures the pros and cons for all major
decisions are captured to enable senior command leadership to make informed decisions.
Contract Services, Contract Support Services or Services—For the purposes of this policy,
these terms are the services covered in paragraph 1.2.1 of AFI 63-138. The contractor
performing these tasks can be either physically co-located with an organization, or
geographically separated.
Requirements Approval Document (RAD)—The RAD is the form on which all CSS
requirements ≥$150K (SAT) shall be documented. PM/RI/PEM shall use the AFSPC Services
Database to document CSS requirements. For access to the AFSPC Services Database, users will
need a Common Access Card (CAC) card. The AFSPC Services Database can be accessed at:
https://tdka-as02-pkn-n/RAD/services. This is the active database where all AFSPC CSS
requirements are captured. For initial logon: When prompted for a CAC card, select name with
the EMAIL certificate. The AFSPC Services Training Database can be accessed at: https://tdka-
as02-pkn-n/RAD/services. This is the site that is used for development testing and training of
the AFSPC Services Database. This is a training site only. Do not use this database to enter CSS
