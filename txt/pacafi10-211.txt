SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction was revised to reflect the merger of PACAF and 13 AF Headquarters reflected
in PACAF PPlan 11-02. Chapter 2 was revised to permit Osan and Kunsan civil engineers to
take Status of Resources and Training (SORTS) credit following Det 1 mobile Silver Flag
training IAW AFI 10-210; previously they did not. Chapter 4 was significantly revised to
include specific guidance on lodging during Silver Flag and Mission Essential Equipment
Training (MEET) at the PACAF SFES. This publication has been substantially revised to reflect
changes in the guidelines for simulated markers. This publication has been substantially revised
and needs to be reviewed in its entirety. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
