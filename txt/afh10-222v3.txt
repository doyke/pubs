                                  Chapter 1

                             INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Force Protection (FP) is an overarching concept that should
not be used synonymously with Antiterrorism (AT). AT is a sub-element of
combating terrorism, which is a subset of the broader FP concept. FP is in-
herent to command and must be a commander’s top priority at all times. This
handbook provides guidance on implementing FP measures in the expedi-
tionary environment. Many of the references listed throughout this handbook
are For Official Use Only (FOUO) publications. Planners should gain access
to these publications and download them to secure media to ensure they are
available throughout all phases of deployments.

1.2. Force Protection Defined. Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of
Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, defines FP as “actions
taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of Defense
(DOD) personnel and their families, resources, facilities, and critical informa-
tion.” This protection is necessary to ensure the force is fit and capable of
applying decisive and overwhelming force at the right place and time to
achieve US objectives. Concern for the health and welfare of the force must
always be paramount. FP efforts must be geared towards coordinated and
synchronized offensive and defensive measures which enable effective em-
ployment of forces while simultaneously degrading opportunities for the en-
emy. The DOD definition excludes actions to defeat the enemy or protect
against accidents, weather, or disease as elements of force protection. Air
Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-4.1, Force Protection, states that the AF
views FP as an integrated application of offensive and defensive actions to
deter, detect, preempt, mitigate, or negate threats against USAF air and space
operations and assets based on an acceptable level of risk. Key to the AF
view of FP is the protection of its people. It is important to note that the AF
considers prevention of accidents, along with protection against various
forms of disease, especially those induced through hostile action, to also be
elements of FP.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             8



1.3. Elements of Force Protection. Force protection includes efforts de-
signed to prevent attacks on DOD assets and interests and minimize the effect
of any attacks. It is unrealistic to assume every DOD asset can be protected.
For this reason, plans and preparations to recover from an attack must be fo-
cused on enabling the mission to continue and restoring confidence through-
out the unit and local population.

1.3.1. Deterrence. Seek to deter incidents by discouraging terrorists from
planning against, targeting, or attacking DOD interests. Measures civil engi-
neers can take include placing barriers and roadblocks, strategically locating
assets, and ensuring sufficient standoff to reduce the chances of an attack.

1.3.2. Countermeasures. Commanders employ an appropriate mix of coun-
termeasures, both active and passive, to prevent terrorists from attacking
DOD assets. A description of these countermeasures and their application are
outlined in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-10.1,
Integrated Base Defense.

1.3.3. Mitigation. Commanders employ the full range of active and passive
measures such as hardening and sidewall protection to lessen the impact of
terrorist events against DOD assets.

1.3.4. Recovery. Commanders design plans to recover from the effects of a
terrorist incident while continuing the mission. Air Force emergency man-
agement procedures are outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Man-
agement (EM) Program Planning and Operations.

1.4. Operations Security (OPSEC). OPSEC is a key element of FP and must
be integrated into all aspects of military operations to identify critical infor-
mation, which may be vulnerable to being collected and used by adversaries
to harm personnel or destroy mission-critical assets. Once an analysis of vul-
nerabilities is complete, OPSEC measures must be implemented for each
vulnerability identified. Refer to AFI 10-701, Operations Security, and JP 3-
13.3, Operations Security, for additional information on OPSEC measures.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                                        9



1.5. Force Protection Condition (FPCON) System. The FPCON system
standardizes threat identification, recommended preventive measures and
responses to terrorist threats against US personnel and facilities (Table 1.1).
FPCON measures are actions taken to deter and/or prevent terrorists from
conducting an attack. FPCON measures incorporate facilities, equipment,
trained personnel, and procedures into a comprehensive effort designed to
provide optimal protection to personnel and assets and should be tailored to a
specific site. FPCONs should not be confused with threat levels. Threat levels
are the result of threat assessments and are used to assist in determining local
FPCONs. The objective is to ensure an integrated approach to terrorist
threats. Baseline FPCON levels and measures are listed in DOD Instruction
(DODI) 2000.16, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards. Attachment 2 con-
tains examples of FPCON measures civil engineers may implement during
increased FPCON levels.

Table 1.1. Force Protection Conditions.
             A general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants
 Normal      a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control will be con-
             ducted at all DOD installations and facilities.
             Increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel
  Alpha      or facilities. Nature and extent of the threat are unpredictable. FPCON
             Alpha measures must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.
             Increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity. Sustaining
  Bravo      FPCON Bravo measures for a prolonged period may affect operational
             capability and military-civil relationships with local authorities.
             An incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of
 Charlie     terrorist action or targeting of personnel or facilities is likely. Pro-
             longed implementation of FPCON Charlie measures may create hard-
             ship and affect the activities of the unit and its personnel.
             Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or
  Delta      when intelligence is received indicating that terrorist action against a
             specific location or person is imminent. This FPCON is usually de-
             clared as a localized condition. FPCON Delta measures are not in-
             tended to be sustained for an extended duration.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                                     10



1.6. Terrorist Threat Levels. Terrorist threat levels reflect an intelligence
assessment of threats against US personnel and interests in foreign countries.
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DOD terrorism threat level
in a particular country, region, or locale. It is based on continuous intelligence
analysis of several factors such as a terrorist group’s existence, operational
capability, intentions, activity, and the operational environment. Geographic
combatant commanders also set terrorist threat levels for specific personnel,
family members, units, and installations within their areas of responsibility
using definitions established by the DIA. Terrorist threat levels should not be
confused with FPCONs set by commanders that affect the local security pos-
ture. Threat level assessments are provided to senior leaders to help deter-
mine local FPCONs. Terrorist threat levels should also not be confused with
threat conditions associated with the National Homeland Security Advisory
System. Table 1.2 describes the different threat levels and combination of
factors used to determine each threat level. Additional sources on terrorist
threat levels include DODI 2000.16; DOD O-2000.12-H (FOUO), DOD Anti-
terrorism Handbook; JP 3-07.2, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
for Antiterrorism; and AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards.

Table 1.2. Terrorist Threat Levels.
      Low        No group is detected or the group's activity is non-threatening.
                 Terrorists are present but there are no indications of anti-US activ-
   Moderate      ity. The operating environment favors the Host Nation/US
                 Anti-U.S. terrorists are present and attack personnel as their pre-
  Significant    ferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty-
                 producing attacks as their preferred method but has limited opera-
                 tional activity. The operating environment is neutral.
                 Anti-U.S. terrorists are operationally active and use large casu-
     High        alty- producing attacks as their method of operations. There is a
                 substantial DOD presence and the operating environment favors
                 the terrorist. An incident occurs or intelligence is received indicat-
                 ing some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or
                 facilities is likely.

1.7. Training. Training is essential to establishing an effective FP program.
DOD Instruction 2000.16 specifies minimum AT training requirements. To
enable commanders to make the most effective decisions possible, personnel
at all organizational levels should receive specialized FP training. The current
FP training for DOD personnel consists of four levels (Figure 1.1). Level I
training is an introduction to terrorism and terrorism operations and must be
completed by military, DOD civilians, and family members prior to deploy-
ment. It includes topics such as personal protective measures, terrorist sur-
veillance techniques, improvised explosive devices, and kidnapping and hos-
tage survival tactics. Level I training is available on the DOD Antiterrorism
website located at https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at. DOD O-2000.12-H and JP 3-
07.2 are additional sources that can be used to conduct Level I training. Level
II training is a resident course designed to prepare officers and NCOs to serve
as advisors to unit commanders on FP matters. Level III training is part of the
O5/O6 level pre-command course. Level IV training includes a senior com-
mander/executive-level seminar. Refer to AFI 10-245 to obtain training
sources for levels II through IV.

                                  Chapter 2

                       COMBATING TERRORISM

2.1. Overview. Combating terrorism within DOD encompasses all actions,
including antiterrorism (defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to
terrorist acts), counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to prevent, deter,
and respond to terrorism), terrorism consequence management (preparation
for and response to the consequences of a terrorist incident/event), and intel-
ligence support (collection and dissemination of terrorism-related informa-
tion), taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum, includ-
ing terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials or
high-yield explosive devices. Where counterterrorism is offensive, antiterror-
ism is defensive. Antiterrorism focuses on defensive measures taken to re-
duce the vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts. Air Force
civil engineers are relied upon to implement antiterrorism and counterterror-
ism measures, such as fence and berm construction (Figure 2.1), particularly
in expeditionary environments where the threat level is high due to ongoing
military operations.

Figure 2.1. Berm Construction.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             13



2.2. Antiterrorism (AT). AT refers to defensive measures taken to reduce
the vulnerability of personnel, facilities, and equipment to acts of terrorism.
As stated earlier, AT should not be used as a synonymous term with Force
Protection. Rather, AT is a sub-element of combating terrorism, which is a
subset of the broader FP concept. The AT program must be a collective, pro-
active effort focused on detecting and preventing terrorist attacks, preparing
to defend against attacks, and responding to consequences of terrorist inci-
dents. In the expeditionary environment, three key areas where civil engi-
neers contribute significantly to AT are: (1) ensuring sufficient standoff be-
tween identified threats and mission-critical assets, (2) perimeter security, and
(3) mitigation of blast and fragmentation effects through facility hardening
and other means. Reference JP 3-07.2 and AFI 10-245 for additional details
on AT standards and procedures.

2.3. Counterterrorism. Counterterrorism refers to offensive measures taken
to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism. US counterterrorism policy is
based upon four principles: (1) the government makes no concessions to or
agreements with terrorists; (2) terrorists must be brought to justice for their
crimes; (3) states that sponsor terrorists and terrorism must be isolated and
pressured so as to force a change of behavior; and (4) the counterterrorism
capabilities of countries allied with the US, and those requiring assistance in
fighting terrorism, must be bolstered. Civil engineers contribute to counterter-
rorism efforts in many ways similar to those actions taken to support antiter-
rorism efforts (i.e., ensuring effective standoff, placing barriers, etc). To sup-
port counterterrorism efforts, civil engineers also assist security forces in es-
tablishing a defense in-depth capability (also called a layered defense) as part
of the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) concept. These efforts provide addi-
tional deterrence and increases the time needed for security forces to respond
and neutralize threats in the event of an attack. Chapter 5 provides more de-
tails on civil engineer roles in IBD.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           14



2.4. Threat Assessment. The threat assessment is the process used to con-
duct an analysis and develop an evaluation of a potential threat. It is usually
conducted by intelligence personnel such as the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI). All available information concerning enemy activi-
ties is analyzed to determine if personnel and/or critical assets might be tar-
geted. The analysis includes factors such as a terrorist group's existence, ca-
pability, intentions, history, and targeting as well as the security environment
within which friendly forces operate. DODI 2000.16 contains guidance on
conducting threat assessments.

2.4.1. Identifying the Threat. The threat must be described in specific terms
and should include the types of aggressors (i.e., terrorists, saboteurs, spies,
extremist protestors, criminals, etc.) and the types of weapons, tools, and ex-
plosives likely to be used in an attack or an attempt to compromise a military
asset. The threat identification should also include tactics likely to be used,
such as stationary or moving vehicle bombs, bomb delivery via mail or sup-
ply shipments, airborne or waterborne contamination, forced or covert entry,
standoff or ballistic weapons, visual surveillance, acoustic eavesdropping,
and insider compromise. As an example, the threat might be described as a
moving vehicle bomb consisting of a 4,000-pound vehicle containing a 500-
pound explosive. Identifying the specific threat will help in determining asset
vulnerability. This information can then be used by civil engineers to develop
and implement protective measures to counter the specified threat.

2.4.2. Planning for the Threat. The threat level assigned to the country or
region where a unit may be deploying will help to plan protective measures
throughout all phases of deployments, including predeployment, initial bed-
down, sustainment, and redeployment. Upon notification of deployment, unit
commanders should immediately contact their servicing AFOSI detachment
and request a counterintelligence threat assessment. For planning purposes,
UFCs 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards For Buildings, and
4-020-01, DOD Security Engineering Facility Planning Manual, contain de-
tailed information on expeditionary site layout and protective measures de-
signed to mitigate the effects of attacks on expeditionary and temporary struc-
tures as well as existing structures.

2.5. Criticality Assessment. The criticality assessment is the process used to
systematically identify key assets (i.e., personnel, equipment, stockpiles,
buildings, etc.) deemed mission critical by commanders based on their impor-
tance to the mission or function. This assessment forms the basis for prioritiz-
ing assets requiring high levels of protection. It addresses the impact of tem-
porary or permanent loss of key assets, installation infrastructure, or a unit's
ability to perform its mission. The assessment considers resources needed
(i.e., time, funding, capability, infrastructure support, etc.) to recover or re-
constitute an asset to enable the mission to continue with minimum interrup-
tion. The commander appoints a team to conduct the assessment, taking into
consideration all of the factors mentioned above, and produces a prioritized
list of critical assets. Areas encompassing multiple critical assets are referred
to as critical areas. Detailed information on conducting criticality assessments
can be found in DOD O-2000.12-H and JP 3-07.2.

2.6. Vulnerability Assessment. Terrorists conduct surveillance of US assets
to determine a target's suitability for attack. Terrorists look for weaknesses in
FP measures and security procedures that provide opportunities to attack tar-
gets at their greatest vulnerability. A vulnerability assessment is an evaluation
of the site to determine if key assets are provided the appropriate level of pro-
tection. Minimum standards are applied where a specific threat has not been
identified. Higher levels of protection are provided where a specific threat has
been identified. During the assessment, the terrorist threat, including likely
tactics, must be analyzed to determine what assets are vulnerable to attack by
what means. Vulnerabilities are gaps in protection for key assets. They are
identified by considering tactics associated with certain threats and levels of
protection designed to defeat these tactics. Vulnerabilities may involve in-
adequacies in intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and barriers, inadequate
standoff distances, and building construction that cannot resist explosive ef-
fects at the established standoff distance. Where vulnerabilities are identified,
protective measures must be implemented to counter them. DODI 2000.16
contains guidance on conducting vulnerability assessments. The Defense
Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) website, located at http://www.dtra.mil/,
also contains a wealth of information and guidelines for conducting vulner-
ability assessments.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           16



2.7. Risk Management. Risk management is the process of identifying, as-
sessing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making
decisions to balance risk costs with mission benefits. This process is called a
risk assessment. Risk assessments provide commanders with a method to
assist them in making resource allocation decisions designed to protect their
personnel and assets from possible terrorist threats in a resource-constrained
environment. The risk assessment is based upon three critical components:
threat, criticality, and vulnerability assessments. It is conducted after com-
pleting all other assessments. Any plan that does not start with these assess-
ments will probably be too reactive and result in wasted efforts and resources.
Once vulnerabilities are identified, commanders manage risk by developing
strategies to deter terrorist incidents, employing countermeasures, and miti-
gating the effects and developing plans to recover from terrorist incidents.
Civil engineers participating in the development of FP and AT plans should
also participate in the risk assessment. The information collected during the
risk assessment is critical to developing effective FP and AT plans. For more
information on risk management, refer to AFTTP(I) 3-2.34, Multi-service
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Risk Management.

2.8. Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs). RAMs are random, multi-
ple security measures that consistently change the look of a site's FP posture.
RAMs introduce unpredictability into the site's overall force protection pro-
gram. By randomly selecting and implementing FPCON measures at different
levels, surveillance attempts by terrorists will be frustrated and difficult. It
will be harder for them to predict certain actions or discern patterns or rou-
tines that may reveal vulnerabilities. Other security measures not normally
associated with FPCONs (e.g., locally developed, site-specific) can also be
employed randomly to supplement the basic FPCON measures already in
place. A list of baseline FPCON measures can be found at Attachment 2 of
this handbook and in AFI 10-245 and DOD Instruction 2000.16. These meas-
ures must be exercised regularly and associated plans must be adjusted to
correct any inadequacies.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          17



                                  Chapter 3

                   FORCE PROTECTION PLANNING

3.1. Overview. Force protection planning should be conducted throughout all
phases of contingencies. (Figure 3.1). Key aspects of FP planning involving
civil engineers include site selection and site layout. Most protective meas-
ures applied in the expeditionary environment will be focused on site work.
Use the site survey to learn as much as possible about the deployed location.
Acquire necessary equipment, tools, and materials to implement protective
measures prior to deploying. Refer to UFC 4-020-01 when developing cost
estimates for expeditionary construction. Once deployed, some items may be
difficult if not impossible to obtain. To effectively address the requirements
of both site selection and site layout, civil engineers must first be familiar
with UFCs that address FP and AT standards. This chapter covers FP plan-
ning, site selection, site layout, and the criteria established to ensure mini-
mum AT standards are met while conducting these activities. Guidance on
attaining higher levels of protection when deemed necessary by commanders
is also covered.

Figure 3.1. Force Protection Planning.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          18



3.2. Force Protection Plan. The FP Plan consists of specific measures de-
veloped to protect personnel, facilities, and critical assets. It includes ele-
ments such as the threat assessment, threat level, vulnerability assessment,
criticality assessment, risk assessment, and FPCON measures. The com-
mander will usually establish a Force Protection Working Group to develop
the FP Plan. Civil engineers should focus on the physical security and IBD
aspects of the FP Plan. It should include elements that contribute to IBD and
the protection of key assets such as site layout, barrier placement, berm con-
struction, security lighting, backup power, water source protection, expedient
hardening, and terrain modification. Absolute protection against terrorist ac-
tivities is not possible. Therefore, protective plans and procedures must be
based on the threat identified by intelligence personnel. Considering the
threat, protective measures should strike a reasonable balance between the
protection required, mission requirements, available manpower, and available
resources. The FP Plan itself should not be an end state. The plan should be a
living document that is constantly reviewed and revised as threats, resource
requirements, and innovations cause changes in FP tactics.

3.3. Resource Constraints. Some of the resources needed to implement FP
plans include time, manpower, materials, equipment, and funding. Resources
can be committed to FP by the installation at anytime during the process of
conducting the threat, vulnerability, or criticality assessments. The commit-
ment of resources could also be delayed until all assessments are complete
and an analysis of the risks (risk assessment) can be examined. However,
commanders will most likely use risk management to allocate resources to-
wards those assets found to be most vulnerable to the identified threat and
that if damaged or destroyed, would have the most damaging effect on the
mission. Although FP is inherently a top priority for all commanders, limited
resources under certain circumstances during some stages of deployment may
cause risks to be high until additional resources can be obtained. Civil engi-
neers must be adamant and persistent in efforts to obtain additional resources
needed to apply the most effective FP measures needed to counter threats
identified by the intelligence community. Most of the efforts to obtain FP
resources should be accomplished during the predeployment phase and reas-
sessed immediately upon deployment.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             19



3.4. Site Selection. Civil engineers should participate in the site survey and
learn as much as possible about the region and specific location to assist in
selecting a site suitable to beddown the expected population, weapon sys-
tems, support equipment, and other assets. These factors must be considered
along with the need for standoff. Many expeditionary and temporary struc-
tures are composed of metal frames and fabric or wood frames and rigid
walls. These types of structures are generally impractical to harden or retrofit.
For this reason, standoff distance is the primary approach to FP in the expedi-
tionary environment, which drives the need for larger sites. Space should be
sufficient to allow for dispersal of certain functions and equipment and to
provide the commander the flexibility to increase the beddown population
and standoff distances if needed in response to higher threat levels. This is a
good time to develop a list of equipment, tools, and materials needed to im-
mediately implement protective measures upon arrival to the deployed site.

3.5. Site Layout. This is an extremely important process in FP planning. If
the site layout is not well thought out, it could be very difficult and costly to
rearrange assets to provide increased protection once beddown is complete.
Site layout must be based largely upon the known threat to personnel, mis-
sion-critical assets, support facilities and equipment from each likely enemy
tactic (i.e., standoff weapons, vehicle bombs, etc.). Some key planning as-
pects of site layout include standoff distances, orientation of facilities, layout
of roads, entry control points, layered defense tactics, physical barriers, side-
wall protection and facility hardening, dispersal, compartmentalization, ob-
servation posts, defensive fighting positions, and personnel bunkers. All of
these areas will be covered in more detail in Chapter 4. Attachment 3 con-
tains some key FP elements to consider during site selection and site layout
and can be used as a quick reference checklist. This list is not all-inclusive.
Every deployment is unique and therefore presents unique challenges. The
following paragraphs provide more details on site layout. While conducting
site selection and site layout functions, use available geographical informa-
tion system (GIS) tools to enhance FP plans. The data provided by GIS tools
can be used to enhance survivability efforts and ensure minimum AT stan-
dards are met.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                              20



3.5.1. Maximize Standoff Distance. Putting maximum distance between
personnel, critical assets, and potential threats is generally the easiest, most
economical, and most effective FP strategy. Maximizing distance provides
the flexibility to attain higher levels of protection to counter increased threats.
Standoff distances differ for base camps with controlled perimeters and those
without controlled perimeters. If a controlled perimeter does not exist, stand-
off distances will be greater. When standoff distances cannot be achieved,
structures should be analyzed by an engineer experienced in blast resistant
design. Install recommended hardening to mitigate potential blast effects.

3.5.2. Provide Effective Building Layout. Effective building layout and
orientation can significantly limit terrorist surveillance capabilities and target-
ing opportunities. This is particularly important when areas directly outside of
an installation are not under the installation's control. Ensure that the main
entrance to a facility/structure does not face the perimeter or other uncon-
trolled vantage points with direct lines of sight. Structures can also be ori-
ented in a manner that can reduce the amount of damage from a bomb deto-
nation in the area. This is covered in more detail in Chapter 5.

3.5.3. Provide Effective Road Layout. Although roads are often designed to
minimize travel time from one place to another, caution must be taken when
planning roads that provide straight line access to key facilities and other
critical assets. These types of access roads provide the ability for a vehicle to
gain the speed necessary to breach protective barriers or crash through facili-
ties. Roads should be designed to limit the maximum speed a vehicle can
attain before the driver loses control or draws attention. This can be accom-
plished by designing sharp curves in the roads or using barriers to create a
serpentine layout that forces the driver to negotiate a series of sharp turns.
Any vehicle driver attempting to leave the road in order to gain speed towards
a potential target risks the chance of early detection and response. Roads that
approach key facilities should be parallel to the facilities, versus a perpen-
dicular approach. Barriers, trees, and other methods can be used to reduce the
ability of drivers to leave the road or have a direct line of sight to the facility
from the road.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             21



3.6. Unified Facilities Criteria. This section focuses on UFCs which pre-
scribe antiterrorism standards for new, existing, temporary, and expeditionary
structures. The Undersecretary of Defense established guidance for develop-
ing and maintaining unified facilities criteria for planning, design, construc-
tion, sustainment, restoration, and modernization of DOD facilities in MIL-
STD-3007, Department of Defense Standard Practice for Unified Facilities
Criteria (UFC) and Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). UFC
and UFGS development is primarily a joint effort of the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), the Navy Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC),
and the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA). UFC and
UFGS are used by the military departments, the defense agencies and the
DOD field activities for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restora-
tion and modernization of facilities, regardless of funding source. These pub-
lications can be located at the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) web-
site at http://dod.wbdg.org. These publications can also be downloaded from
the     USACE       Protective    Design     Center     (PDC)     website    at
https://pdc.usace.army.mil. This site also hosts open forums where users can
post questions and collaborate on the latest protective designs and antiterror-
ism guidance.

3.6.1. Standards. Minimum DOD AT standards for new and existing inhab-
ited facilities and expeditionary and temporary structures are outlined in UFC
4-010-01. The standards established by this guidance are intended to mini-
mize the possibility of mass casualties in facilities where no known terrorist
activity currently exists. Since it would be cost-prohibitive to design facilities
that address every conceivable threat, the standards are designed to provide
an appropriate level of protection for all personnel at a reasonable cost. Each
DOD component may set more stringent AT building standards to meet the
specific threats in its area of responsibility. CENTAF, AFSOUTH, USAFE,
and PACAF have supplemental instructions regarding FP construction stan-
dards. Contact the theater-level A7/CE planner for more information. Where
more stringent local standards apply, detailed descriptions of the levels of
protection are provided in UFC 4-020-01.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                                 22



3.6.2. Levels of Protection. Levels of protection relate to the degree to which
assets (i.e., personnel, facilities, equipment, etc.) are protected based on
known and specified threats such as vehicle-borne improvised explosive de-
vices (VBIEDs), rockets, artillery and mortars. The primary strategy to
achieve an appropriate level of protection is to maximize available standoff to
keep potential or known threats as far away from personnel, inhabited facili-
ties, equipment, and other critical assets as possible. However, if space is
inadequate to achieve appropriate standoff distances, hardening and blast
mitigation techniques must be applied to achieve an acceptable level of pro-
tection based on the asset's criticality and the threat. Primary gathering facili-
ties (i.e., dining facilities, billeting, recreation facilities, etc.) should be hard-
ened, if practicable, or provided some type of blast and fragmentation protec-
tion, including overhead cover and compartmentalization. Unless adequate
planning is done to obtain the needed space to achieve appropriate standoff in
high-threat environments where expeditionary assets are employed, personnel
can be highly vulnerable to an attack. This potential vulnerability drives the
need for larger sites. In addition, hardened structures, such as bunkers and
foxholes with overhead cover, should be provided in the immediate proximity
of all areas where personnel live and work. Selecting levels of protection for
all key and critical assets involves a tradeoff for acceptable levels of risk.
There are different standards for new and existing buildings and expedition-
ary or temporary structures. Tables 3.1 and Table 3.2, excerpted from UFC
4-010-01, contains qualitative descriptions of potential damage to buildings
and structures at different levels of protection that may be applied. Table 3.1
applies to new and existing buildings and Table 3.2 applies to expeditionary
and temporary structures. Detailed quantitative descriptions of the levels of
protection can be found in UFC 4-020-02 (FOUO), Security Engineering
Facilities Design Manual.

3.6.3. Standoff Distances. The primary objective of design and site layout
strategy is to keep potential threats as far away from personnel and critical
assets as possible. Maximizing available standoff distance is the most cost-
effective solution for mitigating the effects of blasts and provides the capabil-
ity to increase distances to counter increased threats or achieve higher levels
of protection. Due to different types of construction, standoff distances vary
for new or existing buildings and expeditionary or temporary structures.

3.6.3.1. New and Existing Buildings. The standoff distances shown in Table
3.3 and illustrated in Figure 3.2 through Figure 3.5 were extracted from UFC
4-010-01. The applicable explosive weights (kg/pounds of TNT) indicated in
the table must be obtained from UFC 4-010-02 (FOUO). The standards were
developed for a wide range of conventionally constructed buildings. As pre-
scribed by UFC 4-010-01, the distances listed under the “Minimum Standoff
Distance” column of Table 3.3 must be provided except where doing so is
not possible. For new buildings, standoff distances of less than those indi-
cated are not allowed. For existing buildings, the UFC states that lesser
standoff distances may be allowed where the required level of protection can
be achieved through analysis of blast effects, building hardening, or other
mitigating construction or retrofit. This is done only when achieving mini-
mum standoff distances may not be possible.

3.6.3.2. Expeditionary and Temporary Structures. The standoff distances
shown in Table 3.4 and illustrated in Figure 3.6 apply to expeditionary and
temporary structures. These standoff distances were developed for TEMPER
Tents, Southeast Asia (SEA) Huts, General Purpose Shelters, and Small Shel-
ter Systems. The applicable explosive weights (kg/pounds of TNT) indicated
in the table must be obtained from UFC 4-010-02 (FOUO). An “*” in Figure
3.6 indicates the standoff distance varies by type of construction and that an
analysis of the structure by an engineer experienced in blast-resistant design
is required. Hardening will be applied as necessary to mitigate the effects of
explosives indicated. If the geographic combatant commander determines a
higher level of protection is required based on a known threat and an analysis
of vulnerability and criticality assessments, refer to UFC 4-020-01. This
manual outlines methods for achieving higher levels of protection.

                           PHYSICAL SECURITY

4.1. Overview. A key element of FP is physical security. DOD 5200.8-R
defines physical security as measures designed to safeguard personnel; to
prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and docu-
ments; and to safeguard these assets from espionage, sabotage, damage, and
theft. This chapter provides guidance and considerations for implementing
protective measures designed to eliminate threats or mitigate the effects of an
attack against personnel and critical resources. In the absence of a specific
threat, the minimum DOD FP standards in UFC 4-010-01 are applied.

4.2. Aspects of Physical Security. Physical security is built on the founda-
tion that baseline security and preparedness postures are established based on
the local threat, site-specific vulnerabilities, identification of critical assets,
and employment of available resources. Physical security focuses on physical
measures and procedures designed to safeguard assets from likely aggressors.
As discussed earlier, plans for implementing these physical security measures
begin far in advance of the deployment (including site selection and site lay-
out planning) and continue throughout all phases of the deployment, includ-
ing initial beddown, sustainment, and redeployment. Key physical security
tasks civil engineers will perform include the implementation of protective
measures designed to stop potential aggressors and mitigate the impact of an
attack on personnel and other critical resources. This requires, among many
other things, that security personnel be capable of detecting and identifying
an aggressor as far in advance of an attack as possible. Civil engineers team
with security forces to design and implement physical measures that will pro-
vide this early detection capability. The two broad areas of physical security
that civil engineers might dedicate the majority of time and resources in ex-
peditionary environments include perimeter security and internal security.
This chapter focuses on these two aspects of physical security.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          32



4.3. Perimeter Security. One of the most important FP tasks civil engineers
are involved with during the initial stages of deployment and beddown is es-
tablishing perimeter security. Working with security forces, civil engineers
must help establish a continuous physical barrier which clearly defines the
physical limits of the site to prevent unauthorized access. Figure 4.1 illus-
trates some aspects of perimeter security that should be addressed. This usu-
ally involves constructing fences, concertina wire, installing perimeter light-
ing, constructing berms and ditches, placing barriers, and assisting with the
installation of security cameras. Also key is ensuring both a primary and
backup source of power is available in the event systems requiring power are
disrupted by intentional or unintentional damage. Clear zones, which are
those areas beyond the perimeter, must be kept free of weeds, rubbish, or
other material capable of offering concealment or assistance to an intruder
attempting to penetrate perimeter security. In addition, secure any structures
originating from outside the perimeter, such as utility ducts, drainage cul-
verts, concrete trenches, and storm drains. This can be done using screens and
grates. Locks should be installed on manhole covers. Intrusion detection sen-
sors can be used along with surveillance equipment to provide greater secu-
rity. The next few paragraphs address how barriers, perimeter fences, entry
control facilities, berms and ditches, lights and sensors, obscuration screens,
and observation posts can be employed in the expeditionary environment.

Figure 4.1. Perimeter Security Measures.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             33



4.3.1. Barriers. One of the most important aspects of establishing effective
physical security is the ability to employ barriers. Barriers are used to main-
tain standoff distances, establish boundaries, limit and control pedestrian and
vehicular flow and access, channel movement in certain directions and to
certain points, obstruct line-of-sight views from outside the perimeter, protect
key facilities and mission-critical assets, and compartmentalize areas within
primary gathering buildings. Civil engineers are largely responsible for em-
ploying barriers as part of the physical security element of FP.

4.3.1.1. Barrier Plan. Developing and implementing a barrier plan is a criti-
cal FP function for civil engineers. The barrier plan (Figure 4.2) outlines
exactly how barriers will be employed continuously or during periods of
heightened alert. A prioritized list of key facilities and critical assets to be
protected forms the basis for the plan. This list should have already been de-
veloped during the threat, vulnerability, criticality, and risk assessments. The
barrier plan should summarize the number and types of barriers employed as
well as additional requirements, employment locations, if and where barriers
will be prepositioned, their intended purpose (i.e., traffic control, perimeter
security, etc.), and resources and equipment needed to move or relocate and
install the barriers when needed (i.e., anchors, cables, forklift, trailer, etc.).
Civil engineers work closely with security forces to identify resources needed
to adequately protect key facilities and assets. Some installations may prepo-
sition key assets and employ them upon heightened alert or during periods of
increased threat. In the expeditionary environment, limited resources may not
allow for maintaining barriers in storage or prepositioned status for height-
ened alert. Barriers may need to be continuously employed to provide protec-
tion in high-threat environments. This determination is made on site. A dedi-
cated barrier team should be appointed, trained, and exercised regularly.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           34



Figure 4.2. Typical Barrier Plan.




4.3.1.2. Types of Barriers. There are many barrier designs that can be used
for a variety of purposes (i.e., pedestrians, vehicles, weapons, etc.) and vari-
ous types of structures and natural features that can be used as barriers (i.e.,
trees, mountains, water, wood, concrete, etc.). Barriers are categorized as
either active (containing moving parts) or passive (non-moving parts). It is
important not to confuse the different types of barriers available with the pur-
pose for which the barrier is being used or will be used. For example, some
barriers may be used to mitigate the effects of blast and/or fragmentation in
the event of an attack and may sometimes be referred to as blast or fragmen-
tation barriers. These are passive-type barriers. A variety of passive barriers
can be found in the expeditionary environment (i.e., bitburg barrier, jersey
barrier, Alaska barrier, T-barrier, HESCO barrier, etc.). Some active barriers
commonly found in the expeditionary environment include bollards and arm
barrier gates. Barriers can be further characterized as moveable (may require
heavy equipment), fixed (permanently installed), or portable. Portable barri-
ers are normally used temporarily until either a moveable or fixed barrier
system can be employed. The following paragraphs further explain the types
of barriers and the purposes for which they are commonly used.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            35



4.3.1.2.1. Active Barriers. Active barriers are either electronically controlled
or manually operated to allow or restrict access to sites or certain areas within
a site. Examples include barricades, retractable bollards, beams, and gates.
Active barriers are normally employed at entry and exit points to the site or at
the entrance to a critical facility with a controlled perimeter. From a safety
standpoint, active vehicle barriers are capable of causing serious injury or
death, even when used for their intended purpose. This can be caused by
equipment malfunction, inadvertent activation, or operator error. If using
these types of barriers, make sure there are signs in place to alert vehicles to
their presence (i.e., warning signs, lights, bright colors, etc.). In addition,
these types of barriers should include backup power, emergency cutoff
switches, and adequate lighting. Figure 4.3 through Figure 4.7 are examples
of active barriers that can be used in the expeditionary environment.

4.3.1.2.2. Passive Barriers. Passive barriers have no moving parts and are
designed to absorb energy upon impact and transfer that energy into the
foundation. Examples include portable or permanent concrete structures, con-
crete bollards, posts, guardrails, ditches, and reinforced fences. Passive barri-
ers along the perimeter or interior fence line should be designed to allow little
or no penetration, especially if the available standoff distance is limited. Pas-
sive barriers are commonly found in the expeditionary environment, particu-
larly if the contingency operation is of a limited duration. Figure 4.9 through
Figure 4.14 are examples of passive barriers that can be used in the expedi-
tionary environment. For additional details on different types of barriers, refer
to UFC 4-022-02, Selection and Application of Vehicle Barriers, AFH 10-
222, Volume 14, Guide to Fighting Positions, Obstacles, and Revetments;
and the Joint Forward Operations Base Force Protection Handbook. This
handbook can be located on the Joint Staff Antiterrorism Portal (ATEP) web-
site at https://atep.dtic.mil (Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network

4.3.2. Perimeter Fences. Fences are used to define the boundary of a site or
structure, direct and control the flow of traffic and establish clear zones. They
are also used in conjunction with security lighting, intrusion detection sys-
tems, closed circuit television, and other means of integrating security. Chain
link fences are antipersonnel barriers. They are cost-effective, usually readily
available, and provide a moderate degree of protection. Chain link fences are
more effective if reinforced with cable or topped with outriggers and razor
wire or multiple strands of barbed wire (Figure 4.15). Since most fences can
be easily penetrated by a moving vehicle, they are not considered vehicle
barriers and will resist impact only if reinforced by barriers capable of ab-
sorbing the impact of moving vehicles. For additional details on security
fencing, reference MIL-HDBK-1013/10, Design Guidelines for Security
Fencing, Gates, Barriers, and Guard Facilities (will be replaced by UFC 4-
022-03).

4.3.3. Utility Openings. Large utility openings, such as drainage pipes, cul-
verts, vents, and ducts can provide an intruder with a means of entry or exit
across a site’s perimeter without triggering an alarm. These types of openings
can also be used to conceal weapons or plant explosives. For these reasons,
the number of culverts and other drainage pipes crossing a site’s perimeter
should be minimized. In addition, FP guidance states that these types of open-
ings, having a cross-sectional area greater than 96 square inches and whose
smallest dimension is greater than 6 inches, will be protected by securely
fastened, welded bar grilles (Figure 4.16). As an alternative, these structures
can be composed of multiple pipes with diameters of 10 inches or less. Mul-
tiple pipes of this diameter may also be placed and secured in the inflow end
of a drainage culvert to prevent intrusion into the area. If grilles or pipes are
installed in culverts or other drainage structures, ensure action is taken to
compensate for the diminished flow capacity and increased maintenance that
will be required. In addition, secure all manhole covers that could be accessed
and used to cross the site’s perimeter. For detailed information on securing
these types of structures, refer to UFC 4-020-03FA, Security Engineering:
Final Design. This document is FOUO and can be downloaded from the
USACE’s PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.

4.3.4. Entry Control Facility (ECF). The ECF is a physical boundary con-
trolling vehicle access at the perimeter of the site. Some guidance may also
refer to these boundaries as access control points (ACPs). The ECF is a secu-
rity checkpoint at or outside the secured perimeter of an installation that al-
lows for sufficient standoff from the perimeter to protected facilities and
critical assets. Security personnel use the ECF to control vehicle access to the
site using various methods such as guard shacks, vehicle barriers, and inspec-
tion points (Figure 4.17). Civil engineers team with security forces in deter-
mining the location and layout for ECFs and other structures needed to con-
trol vehicle access to the site. These determinations should be based on an
intelligence assessment of the threat.

Figure 4.17. Typical Entry Control Facility.




 Site
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           43



4.3.4.1. Location. ECFs should be located to provide maximum standoff dis-
tance between the ECF and critical facilities and equipment. Minimum stand-
off distances are outlined in UFCs 4-010-01 and 4-010-02. The geographic
combatant commander can increase these distances based on the known
threat for a particular area. Always refer to the specific operational order to
determine if prescribed standoff distances are more stringent than those out-
lined in UFCs.

4.3.4.2. Layout. The main ECF should be subdivided into zones and allow
enough queue space to prevent vehicles waiting to enter the site from ob-
structing traffic on main roads (Figure 4.18). ECF zones consist of an ap-
proach zone, access zone, response zone, and safety zone. The approach zone
is located at the interface between public roads and the site. Access zones
comprise the main portion of the ECF. This is where guard facilities and ve-
hicle inspection areas are located. Response zones extend beyond access
zones to the final barrier or entry point. This is usually where security forces
will set up an overwatch tower as a final denial point for vehicles attempting
to gain unauthorized entry. Overwatch towers are hardened firing positions
that provide coverage for vehicle entry, exit, and search areas. The safety
zones include all techniques (fences, barriers, etc.) used to maintain an ac-
ceptable standoff distance between the ECF and critical assets. Vehicles ap-
proaching the site should be channeled through a maze of barriers that force
drivers to decrease their rate of speed. Vehicles should be channeled into
search pits to allow security personnel to search for and detect explosives.
Search pits should be separated from local traffic by security fences and vehi-
cles barriers and located outside of the minimum prescribed standoff distance.
Civil engineers work closely with security and intelligence personnel in de-
signing and siting vehicle search pits. Separate points of access to the site
must be established for commercial trucks and delivery vehicles, outside the
standoff distance, where they can be searched prior to gaining access. De-
tailed guidance for constructing ECFs can be found in UFC 4-022-01, Secu-
rity Engineering: Entry Control Facilities/Access Control Points.

4.3.4.3. ECF Barriers. ECF barriers are used to maintain control. They ad-
dress the countermobility aspect of FP (preventing unauthorized vehicles
from entering the site) and are set up to channel vehicles and pedestrians into
or away from certain areas. The ECF is the point at which vehicles are either
cleared or rejected from accessing the site and must be a strictly controlled
area. ECF barriers define the boundaries and provide security personnel with
a visual assessment of a driver’s intent as a vehicle passes through certain
zones and reacts to barriers employed to control path, speed, and direction.
Barriers should be placed along main roads leading to the site from public
roads to establish an approach zone and throughout the rest of the ECF to
maintain control during the clearing process. Barriers should be anchored to
the surface and/or cabled together to provide increased resistance to penetra-
tion attempts (Figure 4.19). To slow speeds of approaching vehicles, place
barriers in a manner that produces a serpentine path drivers must negotiate to
reach the entry point. Desired speeds can be controlled by placing barriers at
certain distances apart. For example, to allow a maximum speed of 15 mph,
place barriers 30 feet apart in an alternating pattern as depicted in Figure
4.20. Creating 90-degree turns also forces drivers to reduce speeds. A vehicle
leaving these paths will draw attention and alert security personnel of a pos-
sible attempt to evade clearance procedures and gain unauthorized access to
the site.

4.3.5. Berms and Ditches. Berms and ditches can be constructed around the
site perimeter to slow or prevent vehicles from penetrating the restricted
boundary (Figure 4.21). Triangular ditches and hillside cuts are relatively
easy to construct and are very effective against a wide range of vehicles. Side
hill cuts are variations of the triangular ditch adapted to side hill locations and
have the same advantages and limitations. A trapezoidal ditch requires more
construction time but is more effective in stopping a vehicle. With this type
of construction, a vehicle will be trapped when the front end falls into the
ditch and the undercarriage is hung up on the leading edge of the ditch. For
additional information on constructing berms and ditches, reference AFH 10-
222, Volume 14.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            48



4.3.6. Lighting and Sensors. Security lighting allows personnel to observe
areas around the perimeter, at entry control points, and throughout the site
during hours of darkness without exposing themselves. It is best to use light-
ing that produces a glare upon individuals approaching a perimeter but does
not illuminate and expose security personnel, guard houses, or observation
posts. Avoid glare lighting if it will cause traffic hazards. Different types of
terrain and surfaces required to be illuminated should be analyzed to deter-
mine the brightness of security lighting needed to ensure personnel can ob-
serve all areas in and around the site and as far outside the perimeter as possi-
ble. The site commander may require some areas to be void of lighting during
certain times or at all times so as not to illuminate a potential target. To be
more effective, security lighting can be combined with an IDS as shown in
Figure 4.22. Numerous types of IDSs are currently being used in the expedi-
tionary environment (microwave, passive infrared, active infrared, seismic,
magnetic, motion detectors, closed circuit television, etc.). Certain factors
determine the type of system to install, including site location, terrain,
weather, manpower available for monitoring, etc. Regardless of the type of
lighting or IDS used, provide emergency backup power. For more informa-
tion on security lighting and IDSs, refer to the Illuminating Engineering Soci-
ety of North America (IESNA) HB-9, Lighting Handbook: IESNA G-1-03,
Guide for Security Lighting for People, Property, and Public Spaces: and
UFC 4-020-04, Electronic Security Systems: Security Engineering.

4.3.7. Obscuration Screens. Perimeter obscuration screens are used to block
direct lines of sight to sensitive areas or facilities from outside the perimeter
of a site in an effort to reduce targeting opportunities from direct fire weap-
ons. This can be done in various ways using trees, dense vegetation, chain
link fences with slats, wooden fences, camouflage netting, earth berms, etc.
Obscuration screens do not provide protection against direct fire weapons.
Another type of screen, referred to as a predetonation screen, can be used for
protection against these types of weapons. Predetonation screens are covered
later in this chapter. Install facility obscuration screens on the side of facilities
facing the perimeter of the site to reduce exposure. Obscuration screens can
also be placed on perimeter fences to block lines of sight into the camp area
(Figure 4.23). When using obscuration screens, make sure personnel inside
the site or facility are still able to see outside and observe any suspicious ac-
tivities.

4.3.8. Observation Posts, Guard Towers, and Defensive Fighting Posi-
tions. Civil engineers must work closely with security forces personnel in
siting and constructing hardened structures to be used for observation, over-
watch, and defensive fighting (Figure 4.24). Some of the construction plan-
ning factors to be considered include: location, terrain, height, maximum
number of personnel each structure is required to support, level of hardening,
number of gun ports, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning requirements,
plumbing requirements, lighting, electronic surveillance and communications
equipment requirements, etc. These structures should be placed at least 30
feet inside the perimeter of the site and provide a clear view of the inner and
outer clear zones and perimeter fence line. HESCO barriers (earth-filled con-
tainers) are commonly used in the expeditionary environment to construct
various types of structures and sidewall protection. These containers come in
various sizes and all have national stock numbers assigned (see Table 4.1 and
Figure 4.25). For details on constructing guard towers, observation posts,
defensive fighting positions, and bunkers, reference the Joint Forward Op-
erations Base Force Protection Handbook referred to earlier and AFH 10-
222, Volume 14. Detail drawings and construction details for these types of
structures can also be downloaded from the Theater Construction Manage-
ment System (TCMS) website at http://www.tcms.net.

4.4. Internal Security. The focus on internal security, from a civil engineer
perspective, generally involves such tasks as facility hardening, dispersal,
compartmentalization, revetment construction, bunker construction, and pro-
tection of utilities, to name a few (Figure 4.26). Existing facilities used in the
expeditionary environment may need to be hardened to provide an acceptable
level of protection from rockets, artillery, and mortars. In addition, expedi-
tionary structures, bunkers, observation posts, and fighting positions must be
constructed to support IBD objectives, covered in Chapter 5. The following
are some basic concepts and techniques that can be used to provide some
protection for existing and expeditionary structures. For construction details
and different options that can be employed, refer to the Joint Forward Opera-
tions Base Force Protection Handbook.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                         53



4.4.1. Mass Notification Systems. Mass notification systems provide imme-
diate notification to personnel during emergencies (Figure 4.27). Information
can be relayed regarding FPCONs, imminent threats, attacks in progress, etc.,
and personnel can be directed to take certain response actions (i.e., take
cover, evacuate, etc.). Civil engineers, especially Fire Emergency Services
and Emergency Management, must work closely with security and communi-
cations personnel to install and maintain a site mass notification system with
primary and backup power in the event the primary source of power is dis-
rupted. Details on mass notification systems can be found in UFC 4-021-01,
Design and O&M: Mass Notification Systems. Although there are many dif-
ferent systems available, the Giant Voice system is typically used in expedi-
tionary environments. However, this system is generally not suitable for noti-
fying personnel working or residing in permanent structures since the voice
messages are usually unintelligible. In these instances, civil engineers work
with security and communications personnel to develop alternative ways of
providing mass notification.

Figure 4.27. Mass Notification System.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            54



4.4.2. Facilities. Achieving appropriate levels of protection for facilities most
commonly used in the expeditionary environment, such as TEMPER tents
and SEA Huts (Figure 4.28) can be very difficult. This is why standoff is
particularly important in expeditionary environments. Personnel can be un-
usually vulnerable to certain threats during the initial stages of a deployment
when the site is still somewhat austere, resources are limited, and access to
permanently constructed facilities has not yet been negotiated. If US forces
occupy existing permanent facilities offered by the host nation (HN), civil
engineers may need to apply the standards outlined in UFC 4-010-01 for new
and existing buildings (Table 3.3). Where more stringent local standards ap-
ply, or where local commanders dictate additional measures as a result of
specific terrorist threats, these standards may be supplemented to achieve
higher levels of protection. If increased levels of protection are warranted,
detailed descriptions can be found in UFC 4-020-01. Also refer to AFH 10-
2401, Vehicle Bomb Mitigation Guide, for recommendations on increasing
protection against vehicle bombs. Both publications are FOUO and can be
accessed under the USACE website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil. Follow the
application instructions to obtain a userid and password. The following para-
graphs present techniques that can be used in conjunction with standoff to
mitigate the effects of blast/fragmentation on facilities in the expeditionary
environment.

Figure 4.28. Expeditionary Structures.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           55



4.4.2.1. Orientation. Buildings and structures can be oriented in a manner to
help reduce the effects of blast on the structure. Tests have shown that struc-
tures laid out with the smaller dimension of the structure facing the direction
of an anticipated blast (i.e., perimeter fence, ECP, etc.) receive less damage
than they would if the larger dimension were facing the direction of an antici-
pated blast. Also, tests with vehicle bombs have shown that the primary blast
field from the explosion tends to be outwards from both sides of the vehicle,
while the primary fragmentation field tends to travel more to the front and
rear of the vehicle (Figure 4.29). This information can be used to determine
how best to orient facilities during site setup. If possible, doors and windows
should be faced in a manner that does not provide a direct line of sight from
outside the perimeter. If this is not possible, cover the windows and consider
using obscuration screening to block visual access to the facility or structure.
For more details on vehicle bombs and their effects on all types of structures,
including expeditionary structures, refer to AFH 10-2401. This handbook also
provides safe standoff distances to defeat and mitigate the effects of vehicle
bombs.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          56



4.4.2.2. Clustering and Dispersal. Making the determination to cluster or
disperse assets can be based on several factors. Because each of these tactics
has both positive and negative aspects, the planner will need to strike a care-
ful balance between efficiency and survivability, with emphasis on surviv-
ability. Grouping high-risk activities and concentrating personnel and critical
functions in a cluster can provide opportunities to maximize standoff dis-
tances, reduce the perimeter area, minimize access points, and create defensi-
ble space. Conversely, asset dispersal is often necessary due to the difficulty
of hardening most temporary and expeditionary structures to mitigate the
effects of indirect fire weapons. Dispersal is a form of passive defense that
can be used to lessen the possibility that numerous critical assets could be
damaged or destroyed in a single attack. This effort would be used in addition
to other measures such as standoff distance, revetments, screening, and barri-
ers. Asset dispersal, however, can have an isolating effect that reduces the
effectiveness of existing security provisions, increases the complexity of
emergency response, and creates less defensible space. The tradeoff between
spreading out structures and equipment (past the minimum standoff distance)
versus grouping them together will have to be analyzed. This is a risk man-
agement decision that must be made by the site commander after considering
results of threat assessments, vulnerability assessments, criticality assess-
ments, and recommendations from intelligence personnel, security forces,
civil engineers, and other members of the staff. Regardless of where key as-
sets are sited, CE must do everything possible to provide physical protection
for these assets based on the identified threat. Reference AFH 10-222, Vol-
ume 1, Guide to Bare Base Development, for additional information on facil-
ity dispersal options.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            57



4.4.2.3. Hardening. Hardening the different types of temporary and expedi-
tionary structures used during the initial phases of a military operation can be
difficult or impractical. This is primarily due to the fact that these structures
are designed to be mobile. These structures offer limited protection from
threats when compared to permanent facilities constructed by conventional
means. Some degree of protection can be achieved by hardening the outer
perimeter of these types of structures. Figure 4.30 is an example of a com-
pacted soil berm being used to protect a structure. Earth-filled barriers such as
berms, concertainer units, and sandbags can also be employed around expedi-
tionary structures. Fragmentation barriers provide some degree of protection
from impacting primary and secondary debris. These barriers work extremely
well for fragment protection; however, they do not reduce blast damage sig-
nificantly for conventional and expeditionary structures. Concrete barriers of
sufficient height can be effective in stopping primary debris (debris from the
weapon). However, barriers may also become secondary debris hazards (de-
bris from the barrier itself) in the immediate area of an explosion, causing
additional damage to the asset being protected. AFH 10-222, Volume 14 con-
tains information on specific materials and techniques that can be used to
harden facilities and other assets to provide some degree of protection.

Figure 4.30. Compacted Soil Revetment.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             58



4.4.2.4. Windows. Window glass is usually the weakest part of a structure.
Glass fragments caused by blasts can result in significant injuries. Although
expeditionary structures usually do not contain glass windows, existing facili-
ties occupied by US forces may in fact contain glass windows. If possible,
these windows should be removed and the openings closed using plywood or
some other protective material. If this is not possible, there are some methods
that can be used to reduce hazards from broken glass. One of these is the in-
stallation of fragment-retention film (Figure 4.31). This is a plastic (polyester)
sheet of film that is adhered to the glass with a special adhesive. This modifi-
cation helps to keep the fragments caused by glass breakage together to pre-
vent the fragments from flying throughout the area and causing severe injury
and possibly death. Heavy drapes or a “catcher bar” (metal bar installed across
the window) is also needed to prevent the large piece(s) of glass being held
together by the retention film from flying through the room and causing blunt
trauma injury. Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 1110-3-501, Windows Ret-
rofit Using Fragment Retention Film with Catcher Bar System, contains de-
tails on retrofitting windows using fragment retention film. An engineer
trained to conduct an analysis that considers many factors (i.e., potential
charge weight, standoff distance, size of glass pane, thickness and type of
window glass, attachment of the pane to the window frame, and attachment of
the frame to the structure) must determine if windows can be properly retrofit-
ted. For this reason, use of protective film in the expeditionary environment
should be a last resort. As stated earlier, it is preferable to just remove glass
windows and replace them with plywood or some other material.

Figure 4.31. Fragmentation Retention Film.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            59



4.4.2.5. Compartmentalization. Compartmentalization is a technique used
to reduce casualties in high population areas, such as dining and recreation
facilities, as a result of fragmenting weapons detonating within the facility. It
involves a series of interconnected walls designed to divide large areas of
high occupancy into smaller protected areas to limit casualties from impacts
of rockets, artillery, and mortars (Figure 4.32). Since the primary threat of a
fragmenting weapon is its capability to generate fragmented projectiles, the
objective of compartmentalization is to contain these fragmentation effects.
Considering the weapons of concern in Iraq are the 120 mm mortar and 122
mm rocket, fragmentation effects pose a far more significant threat to com-
partment occupants than blast. Tests and analyses have shown that significant
blast hazard will not generally extend beyond the compartment in which the
weapon detonates. In addition to compartmentalization, fragmentation barri-
ers must be constructed around the outside of the facility to mitigate blast and
fragmentation from near misses. The minimum height for interior walls and
exterior walls is 5 feet and 8 feet, respectively.

Figure 4.32. Example of Compartmentalization.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            60



4.4.2.6. Predetonation Screens. A predetonation screen is a solid structure
that is built and placed in front of a facility or other asset for the purpose of
causing an anti-tank round to detonate before reaching its intended target,
thereby dissipating its effects within the distance between the screen and the
intended target (Figure 4.33). Predetonation screens may consist of wood
fences, expanded metal mesh, or heavy woven-fiber fabric. Wood fences can
be made of wood slats or plywood panels a minimum of 3/8-inch (9.4 mm)
thick. If they are made of slats, the slats should be spaced no more than ¼-
inch (6.4 mm) apart. Spaces in metal fabric screens must be 2 inches (50 mm)
by 2 inches (50 mm) maximum and the fabric a minimum of 9 gauge (3.8
mm). The residual effects of a predetonated round on a building are more
severe than the effects of a dudded round. After predetonation, the weapon’s
jet and the spent rocket engine from the rocket-propelled grenade continue
past the screen. The screen should be located away from the wall at a standoff
distance appropriate to the wall construction. For most materials, this is a
minimum of 40 feet (10 m). However, it is best to consult UFC 4-020-03 for
details on construction and standoff distances for predetonation screens.

Figure 4.33. Predetonation Screening.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           61



4.4.3. Revetments. Revetments are simply walls used to reduce the effects of
blast or fragmentation on facilities and equipment resulting from near miss
rockets, artillery, and mortars (Figure 4.34). They are used to protect parked
aircraft or other high-value resources. These structures are also referred to as
fragmentation or blast walls. Revetments can be constructed and configured
in multiple ways for multiple purposes, using different materials. Engineers
should identify revetment requirements through their servicing logistics func-
tion and the theater civil engineer staff. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 14 for
construction details and an overview of the different types of revetments. The
Joint Forward Operations Base Force Protection Handbook also contains
information on different types of revetments.

Figure 4.34. Revetments.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                         62



4.4.4. Personnel Protective Shelters. Personnel must be able to quickly
evacuate expeditionary-type structures in the event of an attack or when at-
tacks are imminent. Protective structures with overhead protection should be
sited strategically throughout deployed location, particularly near primary
gathering buildings and where large numbers of personnel live and work
(Figure 4.35). Once fortified with sandbags or enough soil cover, these shel-
ters can provide protection against direct and indirect weapons fire. Sidewall
barriers can be constructed using sandbags, earth-filled container structures,
earth-filled wire mesh bastions, or concrete walls constructed by civil engi-
neers. Sidewalls must be thick enough to resist direct fire weapons or a near
miss from an indirect fire weapon. Covers must be capable of supporting the
dead weight from sandbags or earth-filled containers. Only bunker designs
approved by the USACE’s Engineer Research Development Center should be
constructed. Predetonation screens can also be placed above shelters to cause
weapons to detonate upon impact, thereby reducing the effects upon the
structure. More detailed information on personnel protective shelters can be
found in AFH 10-222, Volume 14; the Joint Forward Operations Base Force
Protection Handbook, the USACE’s website, and the TCMS.
Figure 4.35. Personnel Protective Shelter.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             63



4.4.5. Utilities. Vulnerability assessments should include the potential for
aggressors to damage, destroy, or tamper with site utilities, particularly at
those sites where utility lines actually cross the site perimeter. In addition to
screening, sealing, and securing utility lines to prevent unauthorized access to
the site, civil engineers must focus on providing redundant utility service,
eliminating vulnerabilities identified in relation to the threat, and securing all
utility production and distribution systems.

4.4.5.1. Electrical Power. Power plants are one of the most critical assets in
the expeditionary environment (Figure 4.36). Protect power plant resources
by using revetments, barriers, concertina or barbed wire (entanglements),
camouflage, and berming. Depending on the population and size of the instal-
lation, power plant dispersal (having two or more plants established and in-
terconnected) may be an option to ensure some degree of power generation
capability remains after an attack. Also, power distribution cables should be
buried 12-18 inches and spaced at least 6 inches apart. Position mobile elec-
trical power generators near critical facilities and assets they support and
harden them against attack. For details on power plant installation, see AFH
10-222, Volume 5, Guide to Contingency Electrical Power System Installa-
tion.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            64



4.4.5.2. Water Production and Supply. Water sources, water purification
and distribution equipment, and water supplies must be kept under constant
surveillance and tested frequently for contamination. Water transfer pipes can
be tapped under pressure using hot-tapping tools, providing aggressors the
opportunity to introduce contaminants into the water supply. Civil engineers
must work closely with Bioenvironmental Engineering, Public Health, and
Safety personnel to ensure water supplies are protected from intentional or
unintentional contamination. Water sources must be guarded, water produc-
tion equipment must be reveted, and water lines must be buried at the first
opportunity (Figure 4.37). Roving patrols can establish surveillance points
that can be used to alert personnel to the possibility of tampering. An emer-
gency response plan should be developed in the event the water supply is
contaminated. The plan should include a map indicating the location of all
potential water sources, water production equipment, water storage areas, and
alternative approaches to supplying safe water (i.e., boiling, special treatment,
alternative water supply points, procedures for having bottled water brought
in from other sources, etc.). For specific guidance on establishing and main-
taining a potable water production capability during deployments, refer to
AFI 10-246, Food and Water Protection Program; AFPAM 10-219, Volume
5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide; and the US Army’s Technical Bul-
letin (TB) MED 577, Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water Sup-
plies.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           65



4.4.6. Camouflage and Concealment. Camouflage and concealment are
additional tactics used to enhance FP. All personnel should use whatever
natural or artificial materials available to hide, blend, and disguise potential
military targets. The key to camouflage is to alter the appearance of the asset
being protected in a manner where it becomes part of the natural background.
Natural cover could include materials such as trees, brush, grass, leaves,
rocks or boulders. When using natural cover for concealment, be careful not
to disturb the look of the natural surroundings. Use materials commonly
found in the area where an asset is to be concealed. Also, natural cover, such
as brush and leaves, will have to be changed whenever its appearance no
longer looks natural and begins to change from that of its surroundings. Arti-
ficial cover could include burlap or netting applied to critical assets (Figure
4.38). Military assets can also be painted in a manner so that the asset blends
in with the surrounding area. Camouflaging and concealing assets in a desert
environment can be challenging. In the end, it is creativity and ingenuity that
lead to effective disguises. Camouflage and concealment tactics should be
used after hardening and cover are applied to the assets to be protected.

    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          66



4.4.7. Contract Support. Once hostilities level off and the initial beddown
phase moves towards sustainment, contract support is available to implement
and sustain base support operations (Figure 4.39). This capability allows
military forces to focus more exclusively on achieving military objectives.
The Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) is a contingency
contract vehicle established as a force multiplier option to augment civil en-
gineer and services capabilities during worldwide contingency planning and
deployment operations. AFCAP can provide construction support at overseas
locations and can support recovery operations after natural disasters, acci-
dents, or terrorist attacks. The Navy’s Global Contingency Construction
(GCC) and Global Contingency Services (GCS) contracts are designed to
provide worldwide construction and engineering services in response to natu-
ral disasters, military conflicts, humanitarian assistance, and a wide range of
military operations unrelated to conflicts. The US Army Materiel Command
(USAMC) support contract provides engineering, construction, and general
logistic services. USAMC is supported by USACE for engineering and con-
struction contract management and by the Defense Contract Management
Agency for logistic services contract administration. Contact the MAJCOM
Civil Engineer or HQ AFCESA for assistance in getting contract support.

                                  Chapter 5

                 INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE (IBD)

5.1. Overview. One of the most vital capabilities a base must have to counter
threats, especially in an expeditionary environment, is the ability to apply an
IBD concept. IBD is defined as the integrated application of offensive and
defensive action, both active and passive, taken across the ground dimension
of the FP battlespace to achieve local and area dominance in support of FP.
The IBD battlespace encompasses airfields, priority resources, personnel can-
tonment areas, base facilities, and accommodation areas, and it extends be-
yond the physical perimeter. The objectives that guide IBD forces seeking to
dominate the battlespace are to see first, understand first, and act first. The
conditions influencing IBD are points in the operational spectrum defined by
the strategic, operational, and tactical situations. While the methods used to
achieve battlespace domination will vary depending on prevailing conditions,
the enduring components for success are people and technology. This chapter
outlines actions civil engineers must take to support effective application of
the IBD concept.

5.2. Essential Capabilities of IBD. Essential capabilities for IBD are those
actions deemed critical to successfully plan, program for, and execute combat
support operations. They are shown in Figure 5.1. The application and meth-
ods through which the IBD essential capabilities can be achieved are variable.
They depend on the prevailing threat, the operating environment, friendly
forces available, rules of engagement, and other factors that characterize the
battlespace. For additional information on IBD, refer to AFTTP 3-10.1.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          68



5.2.1. Assessment. As stated in Chapter 2, an assessment of the threat, in-
cluding vulnerability, criticality, and risk assessments, must be conducted to
determine how best to employ defensive measures. This assessment is usually
done by intelligence personnel with assistance from other functional areas,
such as security forces and civil engineers. These assessments help to ensure
effective application of limited FP resources. Otherwise, time and material
could be wasted in an effort to provide total protection for every asset, which
is not practical.

Figure 5.1. Essential Capabilities of Integrated Base Defense.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          69



5.2.2. Delay. Forcing a delay in an adversary's actions increases the risks for
the adversary and provides security personnel time to react and respond. Tac-
tical guidance states that delay cannot be achieved unless there is depth to
IBD. The obstacles and elements of security should be employed in layers,
forcing the adversary to breach several layers of defense (active and passive)
to reach a certain target. The concept of defense in depth does not rely on a
single failure point, but rather employs different types of defenses and redun-
dancies to ensure a nearly impenetrable perimeter. Early identification of a
threat increases the capability to quickly make a determination of intent and
neutralize the threat by applying multiple defensive measures. An example of
layered defense would be the ECF zone concept covered in Chapter 4. The
ECF is laid out in zones, where security personnel perform different func-
tions. As vehicles move through the zones (approach, access, response, etc.),
certain security measures are taken. An attempt to breach the ECF would be
immediately noticeable and would give security personnel time to detect and
react to the attempt and employ a range of measures to stop the vehicle, using
deadly force if necessary in the response zone. Civil engineers work closely
with intelligence and security personnel to determine how best to establish a
layered defense and employ the techniques covered in Chapter 3 and
Chapter 4 (i.e., site layout, perimeter security, internal security, etc.).

5.2.3. Denial. Denial is achieved by taking from the adversary the time,
space, and means to conduct an attack. This can be done in many ways, such
as blocking culverts and other potential avenues of approach, eliminating or
modifying terrain that offers vantage points, employing barriers, constructing
berms, ditches, and walls, and installing bollards or other types of vehicle
barriers when and where they are needed. This element of IBD also includes
all efforts to deny the adversary information through the use of existing secu-
rity programs such as operations security, communications security, computer
security, and information security (also referred to as OPSEC, COMSEC,
COMPUSEC, and INFOSEC, respectively).
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           70



5.2.4. Detection. Detection can be enhanced by employing TTPs that allow
us to become aware of an enemy's covert attempts. Several ways to enhance
detection include the use of electronic surveillance systems, security lighting,
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detection equipment, and
alarm systems. Also, constructing elevated observation posts provides secu-
rity personnel with a clear view of all areas on the site and the surrounding
clear zone. In addition, routine checks of critical equipment such as power
and water production equipment, storage and distribution equipment, and the
like are conducted to quickly uncover any evidence of tampering.

5.2.5. Anticipation. Anticipation involves determining options adversaries
might take in order to be prepared to respond. Civil engineers employ and
implement FP measures during site layout and site buildup based on the
threat identified by the intelligence community; not just threats in general.

5.2.6. Deterrence. The goal of deterrence is to discourage adversaries from
taking offensive action by making the consequences for their actions clear. In
addition to consistent execution of RAMs, civil engineers support deterrence
by employing obstacles and barriers, hardening facilities, and posting warn-
ing signs to make adversaries understand that a successful attack is unlikely.

5.2.7. Deception. The goal of deception is to distort the adversary's view and
to mislead. Civil engineers support this element of IBD through the employ-
ment of decoys (when warranted) and the use of camouflage and other tech-
niques to conceal critical assets. In addition, critical assets can be relocated
throughout the site periodically to complicate an adversary's attempt to gain
knowledge of military operations through surveillance.

5.2.8. Mitigation. Civil engineers use the results of intelligence analyses and
guidance from intelligence and security forces in determining how best to
mitigate the effects of an attack should aggressors breach defenses and attack
a site or target. As covered earlier, mitigation is accomplished by maximizing
standoff, providing effective site layout, hardening facilities where practical,
constructing barriers, and using techniques such as window film and com-
partmentalization.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             71



5.2.9. Deployment. Rapid response to an attack or an attempted breach of
base defense measures must be second nature. Even personnel who are not
considered first responders must be prepared to relocate to safer positions or
augment first responders as needed. Roads may need to be blocked; power,
ventilation, or water distribution systems may need to be temporarily shut-
down or re-routed; or heavy equipment may be required to assist first re-
sponders. There are many possible scenarios to IBD that will involve not only
civil engineers, but every individual on the site or base. Deployment must be
constantly rehearsed and exercised to be effective.

5.2.10. Neutralization. Neutralization involves all measures necessary to
render the adversary or any other threats ineffective. First responders are
heavily involved in efforts to neutralize threats to personnel, facilities, or key
assets, but require support from all areas.

5.3. Prescribed Forms:

None.

5.4. Adopted Forms:

None.

Terms
Access Control—Any combination of barriers, gates, electronic security de-
vices, and/or guards used to deny entry to unauthorized personnel or vehicles.
Access Road—Any road (i.e., maintenance, delivery, service, emergency,
etc.) that is necessary for the operation of a building or structure.
Antiterrorism—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of in-
dividuals and property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and con-
tainment by local military forces. Also referred to as AT.
Antiterrorism Plan—An AT Plan is the specific measures taken to establish
and maintain an AT Program.
Billeting—Any building or portion of a building, regardless of population
density, in which 11 or more unaccompanied DOD personnel are routinely
housed, including Temporary Lodging Facilities and military family housing
permanently converted to unaccompanied housing. Billeting also applies to
expeditionary and temporary structures with similar population densities and
functions.
Building Hardening—Enhanced conventional construction that mitigates
threat hazards where standoff distance is limited. Building hardening may
also be considered to include the prohibition of certain building materials and
construction techniques.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           78



Building Separation—The distance between closest points on the exterior
walls of adjacent buildings or structures.
Combating Terrorism—Combating terrorism within the DOD encompasses
all actions, including antiterrorism (defensive measures taken to reduce vul-
nerability to terrorist acts), counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to
prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism), terrorism consequence management
(preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist inci-
dent/event), and intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terror-
ism-related information), taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire
threat spectrum, to include terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear materials or high-yield explosive devices (CBRNE).
Communications Security—Measures and controls taken to deny unauthor-
ized persons information derived from telecommunications and ensure the
authenticity of such telecommunications. Communications security includes
cryptosecurity, transmission security, emission security, traffic-flow security,
and physical security of COMSEC material.
Computer Security—Measures and controls that ensure security and avail-
ability of the information processed, stored, and transmitted by a computer.
Controlled Perimeter—A physical boundary at which vehicle access is con-
trolled at the perimeter of an installation, an area within an installation, or
another area with restricted access. A physical boundary will be considered as
a sufficient means to channel vehicles to the access control points. At a
minimum, access control at a controlled perimeter requires the demonstrated
capability to search for and detect explosives. Where the controlled perimeter
includes a shoreline and there is no defined perimeter beyond the shoreline,
the boundary will be at the mean high water mark.
Counterintelligence—Information gathered and activities conducted to pro-
tect against espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassina-
tions conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof,
foreign organizations, or foreign persons or international terrorist activities.
Counterterrorism—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond
to terrorism. Also called CT.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          79



Criticality Assessment—Process used to systematically identify key assets
(i.e., personnel, equipment, stockpiles, buildings, etc.) based on their impor-
tance to the mission or function and deemed mission critical by commanders.
Deterrence—The prevention from action by fear of the consequences. Deter-
rence is a state of mind brought about by the existence of a credible threat of
unacceptable counteraction.
DOD Building—Any building or portion of a building (permanent, tempo-
rary, or expeditionary) owned, leased, privatized, or otherwise occupied,
managed, or controlled by or for DOD. DOD buildings are categorized within
these standards as uninhabited, inhabited, primary gathering and billeting.
Entry Control Facility—The entry point for all personnel, visitors, and ve-
hicles to the site or installation. Also referred to as the entry control point
(ECP) or access control point (ACP).
Expeditionary Structures—Structures intended to be inhabited for no more
than one year. This group typically includes tents, Small and Medium Shelter
Systems, Expandable Shelter Containers (ESC), International Organization of
Standards (ISO) and Container Express (CONEX) containers.
Force Protection—Commander's program designed to protect service mem-
bers, civilian employees, family members, facilities, information, and equip-
ment in all locations and situations; accomplished through planned and inte-
grated application of combating terrorism, physical security, operations secu-
rity, and personal protective services and supported by intelligence, counter-
intelligence, and other security programs.
Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs)—A DOD-approved system stan-
dardizing the DOD and Military Services' identification of and recommended
preventive actions and responses to terrorist threats against US personnel and
facilities. The system is the principal means for a commander to apply an
operational decision on how to protect against terrorism and facilitates inter-
Service coordination and support for antiterrorism activities.
FPCON NORMAL—This condition applies when a general global threat of
possible terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            80



FPCON ALPHA—This condition applies when there is an increased general
threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature
and extent of which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full
implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary
to implement certain measures from higher FPCON measures resulting from
intelligence received or as a deterrent. Measures taken under this FPCON
must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.
FPCON BRAVO—This condition applies when an increased or more pre-
dictable threat of terrorist activity exists. The measures in this FPCON must
be capable of being maintained for weeks without causing undue hardship,
affecting operational capability, and aggravating relations with local authori-
ties.
FPCON CHARLIE—This condition applies when an incident occurs or
intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting
against personnel or facilities is likely. Implementation of measures in this
FPCON for more than a short period probably creates hardship and affects
the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel.
FPCON DELTA—Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has
occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a
specific location or person is imminent. Normally, this FPCON is declared as
a localized condition.
Force Protection Working Group (FPWG)—The commander's cross-
functional working group made up of wing and tenant units. Working group
members are responsible for coordinating and providing deliberate planning
for all antiterrorism/force protection issues. The FPWG should include repre-
sentatives from relevant disciplines across the installation, including civil
engineering, intelligence, AFOSI, security forces, public health, bioenviron-
mental, disaster preparedness, plans, communications, and other agencies as
deemed necessary by commanders, including tenant units.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          81



Giant Voice System—A system typically installed as a base-wide system to
provide a siren signal and pre-recorded and live voice messages. It is most
useful for providing mass notification for personnel in outdoor areas, expedi-
tionary structures, and temporary buildings. It is generally not suitable for
mass notification to personnel in permanent structures because of the diffi-
culty in achieving acceptable intelligibility of voice messages.
Improvised Explosive Device (IED)—Device fabricated in an improvised
manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary
chemicals designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incor-
porate military stores but is usually made from nonmilitary components.
Information Security—Protection of classified information stored on com-
puters or transmitted by radio, telephone, or any other means.
Inhabited Building—Buildings or portions of buildings routinely occupied
by 11 or more DOD personnel and with a population density of greater than
one person per 40 gross square meters (430 gross square feet). This density
generally excludes industrial, maintenance, and storage facilities, except for
more densely populated portions of those buildings, such as administrative
areas. The inhabited building designation also applies to expeditionary and
temporary structures with similar population densities. In a building that
meets the criterion of having 11 or more personnel, with portions that do not
have sufficient population densities to qualify as inhabited buildings, those
portions that have sufficient population densities will be considered inhabited
buildings while the remainder of the building may be considered uninhabited,
subject to provisions of these standards. EXAMPLE: a hangar with an admin-
istrative area. The administrative area would be treated as an inhabited build-
ing and the remainder of the hangar could be treated as uninhabited.
Integrated Base Defense—The integrated application of offensive and de-
fensive action, both active and passive, taken across the ground dimension of
the force protection (FP) battlespace to achieve local and area dominance in
support of force protection.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          82



Intelligence—Product resulting from the collection, processing, integration,
analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of available information concerning
foreign countries or areas. Information and knowledge about an adversary
obtained through observation, investigation, analysis, or understanding.
Internal Security—Measures used to protect personnel or assets located on
the interior of the base.
Level of Protection—The degree to which an asset is protected against in-
jury or damage. This would include personnel and equipment. Levels of pro-
tection can be defined as low, medium, or high. For a low level of protection,
the structure would be near collapse, a medium level of protection would
result in a damaged but repairable structure, and a high level of protection
would cause superficial damage to the structure. Selecting the level of protec-
tion means trading-off an acceptable level of risk.
Mass Notification System—A system that provides real-time information to
all building occupants or personnel in the immediate vicinity of the building
during emergency situations.
Obscuration Screen—A physical structure or some other element used to
block the line of sight to a potential target.
Operations Security—An analytic process used to deny an adversary infor-
mation - generally unclassified - concerning friendly intentions and capabili-
ties by identifying, controlling, and protecting indicators associated with
planning processes or operations.
Passive Defense—Measures taken to reduce the probability of and to mini-
mize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of
taking the initiative.
Perimeter Security—Elements that form the first line of defense for an in-
stallation. Elements include standoff, physical barriers, access control, entry
control points, security lighting, hardened fighting positions and overwatch
towers, intrusion detection and surveillance systems, and security forces.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                              83



Physical Security—That part of security concerned with physical measures
designed to safeguard personnel; to prevent unauthorized access to equip-
ment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard them against
espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.
Predetonation Screen—A structure designed to protect a critical asset by
causing a weapon to detonate prior to hitting the primary target, causing its
effect to dissipate in the distance between the screen and the target.
Primary Gathering Building—Inhabited buildings routinely occupied by 50
or more DOD personnel. This designation applies to the entire portion of a
building that meets the population density requirements for an inhabited
building. For example, an inhabited portion of the building that has an area
within it with 50 or more personnel is a primary gathering building for the
entire inhabited portion of the building. The primary gathering building des-
ignation also applies to expeditionary and temporary structures with similar
populations and population densities and to family housing with 13 or more
family units per building, regardless of population or population density.
Proactive Measures—In antiterrorism, measures taken in the preventive
stage of antiterrorism designed to harden targets and detect actions before
they occur.
Random Antiterrorism Measures—Random, multiple security measures
that consistently change the look of a site's force protection posture and intro-
duce uncertainty into the site's overall force protection program. These meas-
ures make it difficult for terrorists t predict actions or discern patterns or rou-
tines.
Risk Management—The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk
costs with mission benefits.
Standoff Distance—A distance maintained between a building or portion
thereof and the potential location for an explosive detonation.
Structure Group—A cluster of expeditionary or temporary structures con-
sisting of multiple rows of individual structures with 200 or fewer DOD per-
sonnel.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                              84



Temporary Structures—Structures erected with an expected occupancy of
three years or less. Typically includes wood frame and rigid wall construction
and such things as Southeast Asia (SEA) Huts, hardback tents, ISO and
CONEX containers, pre-engineered buildings, trailers, stress-tensioned shel-
ters, Expandable Shelter Containers (ESC), and Aircraft Hangars (ACH).
Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful
violence to inculcate fear. It is intended to coerce or to intimidate govern-
ments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious,
or ideological.
Terrorist—An individual who uses violence, terror, and intimidation to
achieve a result.
Terrorism Threat Analysis—In antiterrorism, threat analysis is a continual
process of compiling and examining all available information concerning
potential terrorist activists by groups that could target a facility. A threat
analysis will review factors of the presence of a terrorist group, operational
capability, activity, intentions, and operating environment.
Threat Assessment—The process used to conduct a threat analysis and de-
velop an evaluation of a potential terrorist threat; the product of a threat
analysis for a particular unit, installation, or activity.
Terrorist Group—Any element, regardless of size or espoused cause that
commits acts of violence or threatens violence in pursuit of its political, reli-
gious, or ideological objectives.
Terrorist Threat Level—Scale used by DOD intelligence agencies to de-
scribe the severity of a terrorist threat. Established by DIA and the geographic
combatant commander; only applies to threats against DOD interests.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                               85



Unified Facilities Criteria—The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) system is
prescribed by MIL-STD 3007 and provides planning, design, construction,
sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria and applies to the mili-
tary departments, the defense agencies, and DOD field activities in accor-
dance with USD(AT&L) memorandum dated 29 May 2002. UFCs will be
used for all DOD projects and work for other customers where appropriate.
UFCs are living documents and will be periodically reviewed, updated, and
made available to users as part of the Services' responsibility for providing
technical criteria for military construction. Headquarters, US Army Corps of
Engineers (HQ USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC), and the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)
are responsible for administration of the UFC system.
Vulnerability—The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action
by any means through which its war potential or combat effectiveness may be
reduced or its will to fight diminished. The characteristics of a system that
cause it to suffer a definite degradation (incapability to perform the desig-
nated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of effects
in an unnatural (manmade) hostile environment. In information operations, a
weakness in information system security design, procedures, implementation,
or internal controls that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to
information systems.
Vulnerability Assessment—A Department of Defense-, command-, or unit-
level evaluation (assessment) used to determine how vulnerable an installa-
tion, unit, exercise, port, ship, residence, facility, or other assets might be to a
terrorist attack. Identifies areas of improvement to withstand, mitigate, or
deter acts of terrorism or other types of threats.
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a
high order of destruction and/or of being used in such a manner as to destroy
large numbers of people. Weapons of mass destruction can be high explo-
sives or nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude
the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a
separable and divisible part of the weapon.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                            86



                                Attachment 2

                     BASELINE FPCON MEASURES

A2.1. FPCON NORMAL. Applies when a general threat of possible terrorist
activity exists but warrants only a routine security posture. Commanders em-
ploy Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) during this and all FPCONs to
enhance FP.

A2.2. FPCON ALPHA. Applies when there is a general threat of possible
terrorist activity against personnel and installations, the nature and extent of
which are unpredictable. These measures must be capable of being main-
tained indefinitely.

A2.2.1. At regular intervals, remind all personnel to be suspicious and in-
quisitive of any strangers on or near the site. Watch for suspicious packages
or abandoned parcels, suitcases, etc.

A2.2.2. Secure and randomly inspect buildings, rooms, and storage areas not
in regular use.

A2.2.3. Conduct random security spot checks of vehicles and persons enter-
ing facilities under the jurisdiction of the United States.

A2.2.4. Limit access points for vehicles and personnel commensurate with a
reasonable flow of traffic.

A2.2.5. Identify critical assets and high occupancy buildings.

A2.2.6. Continue or introduce all FPCON NORMAL measures.

A2.2.7. Ensure all personnel are briefed on the threat, and remind them to be
alert for and to report suspicious activities, such as the presence of unfamiliar
personnel and vehicles, suspicious parcels, and possible surveillance at-
tempts.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             87



A2.2.8. Key personnel required to implement civil engineer FP measures
should be placed on call.

A2.2.9. Conduct spot checks of vehicles, equipment, supplies and facilities.

A2.2.10. Conduct spot checks of water production equipment and supplies.

A2.2.11. Conduct spot checks of power production equipment and supplies.

A2.2.12. Conduct spot checks of heating, air conditioning, and ventilation
equipment and supplies.

A2.2.13. Secure all hazardous material storage areas, particularly where large
quantities are stored (i.e., hazardous material storage area, hazardous waste
storage area, POL storage areas, etc.).

A2.2.14. Test communication procedures and verify key personnel can be
contacted quickly if needed to implement additional protective measures.

A2.2.15. Train personnel on individual protective measures.

A2.2.16. Train and exercise personnel on how to react to an attack and where
to take shelter (i.e., shelter in place, protective bunkers, etc.).

A2.2.17. Review all plans (i.e., barrier plans, dispersal plans, equipment sur-
veillance plans, etc.) and identify resource requirements.

A2.2.18. Ensure personnel assigned to all emergency response teams are
trained, on call, and capable of responding immediately.

A2.2.19. Consult with HN personnel if applicable, to verify any mutual sup-
port agreements.

A2.2.20. Review all higher FPCON measures and be prepared to implement
measures of the next higher FPCON level.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             88



A2.3. FPCON BRAVO. Applies when an increased and more predictable
threat of terrorist activity exists. These measures must be capable of being
maintained for weeks without causing undue hardship or extreme traffic de-
lays, affecting operational capability, or aggravating relations with local au-
thorities.

A2.3.1. Fully implement all measures of lower FPCON levels.

A2.3.2. Review contingency plans to ensure all resources required for imple-
mentation are available and all equipment is fully operational. Keep all per-
sonnel involved in implementing site contingency plans on call.

A2.3.3. As needed, erect and emplace barriers; construct berms, ditches, re-
vetments, and predetonation screens; and install obscuration screening.

A2.3.4. Enforce control of entry into critical facilities, lucrative targets, and
high-profile locations; and randomly search vehicles entering these areas.
Particular scrutiny should be given to vehicles that are capable of concealing
a large IED (i.e., cargo vans, delivery vehicles, etc.) sufficient to cause catas-
trophic damage to property or loss of life.

A2.3.5. Keep cars and objects (e.g., crates, trash containers) away from build-
ings to reduce vulnerability to bomb attacks. Apply this criterion to all critical
and high-occupancy buildings. Consider applying to all inhabited structures
to the greatest extent possible.

A2.3.6. Review current level of protection for all facilities (particularly pri-
mary gathering facilities and expeditionary structures) and critical assets;
determine if levels of protection may need to be increased.

A2.3.7. Review standoff distances to ensure they meet minimum require-
ments, and consider the need to increase standoff distances.

A2.3.8. Consider centralized parking and implementation of barrier plans.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                              89



A2.3.9. Secure and periodically inspect all buildings, rooms, and storage ar-
eas not in regular use. At the beginning and end of each workday, as well as
at random intervals, inspect the interior and exterior of all buildings for suspi-
cious packages.

A2.3.10. Screen all mail packages to identify suspicious letters and parcels.

A2.3.11. Randomly inspect commercial and delivery vehicles.

A2.3.12. Randomly inspect water production, storage, and distribution
equipment and lines for evidence of tampering or contamination.

A2.3.13. Patrol the site landscape looking for evidence of suspicious activity.

A2.3.14. Identify and brief personnel who may augment guard forces. Re-
view specific rules of engagement including the use of deadly force.

A2.3.15. As deemed appropriate, verify identity of personnel entering all
buildings.

A2.3.16. Review status and adjust as appropriate operations security, com-
munications security, and information security procedures.

A2.3.17. Erect barriers/guard structures at entrances to airfields if needed.

A2.3.18. As appropriate, take actions to mitigate the threat of surface-to-air
missiles or standoff weapons that can be delivered from beyond the airfield
perimeter.

A2.3.19. Routinely inspect the perimeter fence and barriers to ensure there is
no break in the fence line and that barriers have not been breached.

A2.3.20. Review all higher FPCON measures.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          90



A2.4. FPCON CHARLIE. Applies when an incident occurs or intelligence
is received indicating some form of terrorist action against personnel and
installations is imminent. Implementation of this measure for more than a
short period may create hardship and affect the peacetime activities of the
unit and its personnel.

A2.4.1. Fully implement all measures of lower FPCON levels.

A2.4.2. Recall additional required personnel. Ensure armed augmentation
security personnel are aware of current rules of engagement and any applica-
ble Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA). Review types of weapons and am-
munition issued to augmentation security personnel. Heightened threats may
require employment of different weapon capabilities.

A2.4.3. Be prepared to react to requests for assistance from both local au-
thorities and other installations in the region.

A2.4.4. Limit access points in order to enforce entry control.

A2.4.5. Randomly search vehicles.

A2.4.6. Ensure or verify the identity of all individuals entering food and wa-
ter storage and distribution centers, use sign-in and sign-out logs at access
control and entry points, and limit or inspect all personal items.

A2.4.7. Initiate monitoring activity for chemical, biological, and radiological
contamination as required. An alternate locally developed measure should be
implemented when contractors are responsible for water supplies or when
water is provided by local (non-DOD) sources or agencies.

A2.4.8. Increase standoff distances from sensitive buildings based on the
threat. Implement barrier plan to hinder vehicle-borne attack.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             91



A2.4.9. Increase patrolling of the installation/facility/unit including waterside
perimeters, if appropriate. Be prepared to assist local authorities in searching
for threatening actions and persons outside the perimeter.

A2.4.10. Protect all infrastructure deemed critical to the operational mission.
Give special attention to and coordinate with local authorities regarding infra-
structure located outside of the perimeter that may affect operations being
conducted inside the perimeter.

A2.4.11. To reduce vulnerability to attack, consult local authorities about
closing public (and military) roads and facilities and coordinate any other
precautionary measures taken outside the installation perimeter.

A2.4.12. Randomly inspect suitcases, and briefcases, packages being brought
onto the installation through access control points, and consider randomly
searching them as they are taken off the installation.

A2.4.13. Review access procedures for all non-US personnel and adjust as
appropriate. For airfields, consider terminating visitor access to the flight line
and support facilities.

A2.4.14. Review all FPCON DELTA measures.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           92



A2.5. FPCON DELTA. Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist at-
tack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action
against a specific location is likely. Normally, FPCON DELTA is declared as
a localized warning and is not intended to be sustained for lengthy periods of
time.

A2.5.1. Fully implement all measures of lower FPCON levels.

A2.5.2. Augment guards as necessary.

A2.5.3. Identify all vehicles within operational or mission support areas.

A2.5.4. Control facility access and implement positive identification of all
personnel with no exceptions.

ages, backpacks) brought on site or into a facility.

A2.5.6. Make frequent checks of the exterior of buildings and of parking ar-
eas.

A2.5.7. Restrict all nonessential movement.

A2.5.8. Be prepared to barricade roads and facilities throughout the site and
leading to the airfield, if necessary.

A2.5.9. Begin continuous monitoring for chemical, biological, and radiologi-
cal contamination.

        SITE SELECTION AND LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS

A3.1. Site Selection. It may not be possible to select sites that meet all re-
quirements needed to implement effective force protection measures; never-
theless, a list of considerations should be developed and used during the site
selection process. The following are examples of some elements that should
be considered.

A3.1.1. Consider the threat throughout the entire site selection process.

A3.1.2. Consider minimum antiterrorism standards established by DOD and
whether the site will support or inhibit efforts to attain and maintain antiter-
rorism standards.

A3.1.3. Consider force protection standards established by the geographic
combatant commander and whether the site will support or inhibit efforts to
attain and maintain these standards.

A3.1.4. Select a site that provides the opportunity to maximize standoff dis-
tances.

A3.1.5. Site beddown areas away from public roads and uncontrolled areas.

A3.1.6. Avoid areas where terrain features provide too many vantage points.

A3.1.7. Avoid areas that do not provide enough space to achieve sufficient
standoff.

A3.1.8. Consider future need for additional space to support a population
increase.

A3.1.9. Consider future need to increase standoff distances as a result of
higher threat levels.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           94



A3.1.10. Consider space needed for protective construction (i.e., bunkers,
overwatch towers, defensive fighting positions, revetments, sidewall protec-
tion, blast and fragmentation barriers, vehicle barriers, perimeter barriers,
etc.).

A3.1.11. Consider the need to establish a defense-in-depth posture for inte-
grated base defense.

A3.1.12. Consider adjacent land use and direct lines of sight or access to the
site.

A3.1.13. Consider the need to modify terrain outside of the established pe-
rimeter to provide clear zones and eliminate potential hiding places.

A3.1.14. Consider support needed from the local area (i.e., utilities, sanita-
tion, indigenous materials, equipment, etc.) and how this will impact force
protection efforts.

A3.1.15. Consider site elevation to ensure the elevation of the proposed site
does not provide an advantage for potential aggressors (i.e., lines of sight,
targeting opportunities, etc.).

A3.1.16. Consider the use of existing facilities and efforts needed to retrofit
the facilities to meet minimum antiterrorism standards or standards estab-
lished by the geographic combatant commander as a result of a known threat.

A3.1.17. Evaluate potential use of existing roads to enhance force protection
efforts.

A3.1.18. Consider the need to establish separate ECPs for delivery vehicles.

A3.1.19. Consider the need for vehicle queue space and search pits.

A3.1.20. Consider the need to disperse key facilities and critical assets.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                           95



A3.1.21. Select a site that lends itself to establishing an effective controlled
perimeter.

A3.1.22. Consider the need to bury utility lines.

A3.1.23. Consider the need to orient facilities to avoid direct line of sight
from the perimeter.

A3.1.24. Consider the need to site high-value facilities and assets near the
center of the site.

A3.2. Site Layout. Some key areas to consider during site layout include
standoff distances, layered security, minimum and separate ECPs, redundant
utilities, protection of all key assets, ammunition storage, hazardous material
and hazardous waste storage, and protective shelters throughout the site.
Maintain maps that indicate, in detail, where every asset will be placed and
where all protective construction (i.e., revetments, bunkers, etc.) will take
place. Following are some elements to consider during site layout.

A3.2.1. Use the threat assessment to determine how best to site facilities in
relation to existing roads and the controlled perimeter.

A3.2.2. Consider minimum antiterrorism standards established by DOD when
siting facilities and critical assets.

A3.2.3. Consider force protection standards established by geographic com-
batant commanders when siting facilities and critical assets.

A3.2.4. Maximize standoff distance between the controlled perimeter and
inhabited buildings and other key assets.

A3.2.5. Limit entry control points to an absolute minimum, and establish a
separate entry control points for trucks and delivery vehicles at an appreciable
standoff distance from inhabited facilities, primary gathering buildings, and
other key assets.
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                             96



A3.2.6. Consider terrain, elevation, and space available when determining
where to site the ECF. Include space for approach zones, access zones, and
response zones, queue space; parking space, and space for vehicle search pits.
Use AFH 10-2401 and UFC 4-022-01 as guidance for ECF layout.

A.3.2.7. Clear dense vegetation that can be used by adversaries to hide and
conduct surveillance, attempt to gain access to the site, or target a particular
facility or critical equipment.

A3.2.8. Avoid having straight-line roads or roads that are perpendicular to
critical facilities or assets.

A3.2.9. Construct berms and ditches to enhance perimeter security.

A3.2.10. Avoid siting structures and critical equipment in areas where terrain
offers vantage points from which terrorists might target facilities and other
critical assets.

A3.2.11. Site key facilities and critical assets towards the center of the site to
attain maximum standoff distance from the perimeter.

A3.2.12. Provide redundant utility systems and bury all utility lines.

A3.2.13. If the threat warrants, disperse facilities and key assets to reduce the
possibility of collateral damage to multiple assets from a single attack.

A3.2.14. If key assets can be better protected if clustered and force protection
resources are available to increase their level of protection, consider this op-
tion.

A3.2.15. Orient facilities in a manner that reduces a direct line of sight from
outside the perimeter and in a manner that limits the amount of damage from
a blast (end-on towards the area of the potential blast versus the sides facing
the area of the potential blast).
    AFH 10-222 Volume 3 1 May 2008                                          97



A3.2.16. Compartmentalize primary gathering facilities to limit damage and
injuries from fragmenting weapons in the event of an attack.

A3.2.17. Site areas where revetments and other protective structures
(blast/fragmentation walls) must be constructed (i.e., critical assets and key
primary gathering facilities, etc.).

A3.2.18. Site facilities that will receive bulk deliveries and other structures
that may be more vulnerable to an attack (i.e., industrial areas, hazardous
waste/hazardous storage areas, refuse collection areas, etc.) in areas away
from the main inhabited portion of the site. These areas must still be secured.

A3.2.19. Assist security personnel in constructing layers of defense to support
the IBD effort.

A3.2.20. Ensure parking areas are constructed to provide the minimum stand-
off distance from facilities as determined by DOD standards or the geo-
graphic combatant commander.

A3.2.21. Site areas for placing trash containers away from facilities and other
key assets (at least 10 m/33 ft).

A3.2.22. Site personnel bunkers strategically throughout the site (particularly
in highly populated areas) to provide shelter in the event of an attack.

A3.2.23. Site mass notification system components in all areas so that voice
notification can be heard throughout the entire site and outside the perimeter.

A3.2.24. Outline the plan to apply hardening, camouflage, and concealment
to all key facilities and critical assets once the assets are sited.

A3.2.25. Outline the plan to block lines of sight and lessen the severity of
damage to key facilities/assets in the event of an attack (i.e., obscuration
screens, predetonation screens, window film application, etc.).
