SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the third publication of AFI 90-401. The initial publication superseded AFR 11-7, 22

investigations, hearings, or visits. This revision establishes the Office of Legislative Liaison,
Congressional Action Division, SAF/ LLZ, as the OPR to provide support to wing commanders
during visits with members of Congress and their staffs. SAF/LLZ will provide support to wing
commanders in coordination with the Office of Bud- get and Appropriations Liaison,
SAF/FMBL, as appropriate. This document also establishes the appropriate routing for
Congressional Correspondence. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary responsibility (OPR), SAF/LLZ, using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for

                                            Chapter 1

                                RELEASING INFORMATION

1.1. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard classified
information in the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Department of
Defense Information Security Program Regulation, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management). In accordance with DoDI 5230.29 and DoDI 5400.04,
Prepared Statements, Transcripts, QFRs, IFRs, Advance Policy Questions, Selected Acquisition
Reports, and Budget Documents will be submitted to the DoD Office of Security Review for
security and policy review with the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force before going to
Congress. The Secretary has designated the Security and Policy Review office (SAF/PA) as the
approval authority for release of Air Force classified information to the Congress. Refer
congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PA through SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL.
Air Force officials may not disclose classified information to the Congress for release to a
congressional constituent.
1.2. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302,
Freedom of Information Act Program, Air Force officials may generally not disclose For Official
Use Only (FOUO) information to the public that falls within exemptions 2 through 9 of the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). However, the Air Force may release such information to
chairpersons or ranking members of congressional committees or subcommittees if the
information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides the
information should not be released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional
request for information with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through
SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL as appropriate. Requests from Members of Congress not seeking
records on behalf of a Congressional Committee, Subcommittee, either House sitting as a whole,
or made on behalf of their constituents shall be considered the same as any other requester.
1.3. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only general
information according to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program which sets
forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records
without the individual’s consent when requested by a chairperson or ranking member of a
congressional committee or subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their
jurisdiction. When making such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or
subcommittee members about any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
1.4. Information for Air Force Personnel. Air Force personnel have the legal right to petition,
furnish information to, or communicate with Congress (Title 5, United States Code, Section 7102
and Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
1.5. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on significant changes in the status of Air
Force units, installations, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional
districts. Therefore, Air Force officials must not release any information governed by AFI 10-
503, Strategic Basing, September 27, 2010, without the proper authorization. For any other
information not governed by AFI-10-503 basing actions concerning changes in status of AF
units, installations, and industrial facilities that might have an impact (positive or negative) on

the local community/congressional district; local commanders should check with SAF/LL or
SAF/FMBL prior to release.
1.6. Congressional Security Clearances and Special Access. Per OSD Policy, Congressional
Member clearances are automatic once the Member is elected into their current position in the
United States Senate or U.S. House of Representatives. Once a Member is elected as a seated
member of Congress, the Member is automatically read into SCI and any other classification
needed. To verify the security clearance and special access information of congressional staff
members, contact the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office
(OSD/LA), or SAF/LL Security for proper direction.
     1.6.1. In accordance with Hamre, John, J., Memo to the Honorable Jerry Lewis, United
     States House of Representatives, Washington D.C., 22 June 1999, “Members of Congress
     assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence committees only for intelligence
     SAPs) are accessed to all DoD SAPs, except for a limited number of programs judged to be
     of extreme sensitivity, referred to as waived SAPs.
     1.6.2. Acting on behalf of the Chairman and the Ranking Member, only the Majority and
     Minority Staff Directors will granted access to waived SAPs. Chairmen and Ranking
     Members may request the Deputy Secretary of Defense to grant exception to this restriction
     on a case by case basis.
     1.6.3. Access to non-waived SAPs by professional staff members of the defense and
     intelligence committees will be determined by the Staff Director and the Minority Staff
     Director, respectively, on behalf of the Chairman and Ranking Member. Accesses will be
     coordinated with the Defense Department’s Special Access Program Coordination Office
     (SAPCO) to ensure compliance with personnel security requirements.
     1.6.4. Members of Congress not assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence
     committees only for intelligence SAPs) will be granted access to DoD SAPs (non-waived
     SAPs only) with the concurrence of the DoD after consultation with the Chairman and
     Ranking Member of the defense committees.
     1.6.5. The personal staff of a Member of Congress shall not be granted access to DoD SAPs.
1.7. Industry and Contract Information. Information concerning contractor proprietary
information must be safe-guarded. Special care must be exercised when releasing information
during the source selection process. Proper use of non-disclosure statements must be exercised.

3.2. Communications with Congress. Communications with Congress and the Executive
branch of government are extremely sensitive; therefore, it is imperative the Air Force response
be both prompt and accurate. If there is a problem meeting the suspense, the Secretariat or Air
Staff action officer must notify, no later than 48 hours from suspense date, the SAF/LL or
SAF/FMBL action officer that an interim letter is needed. The OPR is responsible for writing the
interim response.
3.3. Inquiries. Inquiries are received and tasked to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff
office, or Air Force Agency. That office or agency may subsequently send the inquiry to another
coordinating office (OCR) or MAJCOM. The proposed response is sent back to SAF/LLI who
sends the response to the constituent. The entire process should take 30 days or less.
3.4. Congressional Inquiries to Commanders.
   3.4.1. Air Force policy is to respond promptly and factually to direct requests for
   information from Members of Congress and their staffs IAW Headquarters Operating
   Instruction (HOI) 33-10, Suspense and Control of Congressional and White House
   Correspondence.      Commanders will designate an appropriate point of contact for
   Congressional inquiries and visits and provide that information to their respective MAJCOM
   Legislative Affairs Function. Commanders will establish appropriate procedures to:
   3.4.2. Comply with paragraphs 1.1 to 1.7 of this instruction.
   3.4.3. Inform SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL and parent MAJCOM of all congressional inquiries.

   24 hours of receipt or by the first duty day following a weekend or holiday (see Attachment
   2 for phone numbers and email addresses). Include contact information for the person filing
   the inquiry.
   3.4.4. Send the MAJCOM Legislative Affairs function and SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL a copy
   of all congressional communications, including original inquiries and proposed replies.

     3.4.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) The 100 ARW Commander has designated 100
     ARW/IG as the RAF Mildenhall focal point for all high-level inquiries.
       3.4.5.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Any 100 ARW organization/staff agency or
       partner unit receiving a high-level inquiry will immediately notify the 100 ARW/IG
       of the request, the action officer, nature of the inquiry, and higher headquarters
       suspense. Primary method of notification is telephone, followed immediately with an
       e-mail. If the office receiving the high-level inquiry is not the appropriate office to
       respond, the 100 ARW/IG will determine the action office
       3.4.5.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) The 100 ARW/IG will notify the 100 ARW/CC
       and/or CV of the high-level inquiry.
       3.4.5.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) The action officer will formulate the response in
       final format ready for immediate release once signed by the 100 ARW/CC or CV.
       Format the response as desired by the requester. If no for- mat is specified, follow the
       format in Attachment 3 (Added) to this supplement. NOTE: Partner unit inquiries
       will be provided to the 100 ARW/CC for his/her coordination prior to responding if
       the inquiry involves host base, 100 ARW organizations or facilities, or if the 100
       ARW/CC has directed coordination when informed IAW Paragraph 3.4.5.1 (Added)
       above.
          3.4.5.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Do not divulge contents of the high-level
          inquiry to other than those with a need to know, and never to the individual who
          filed the high-level inquiry. These inquiries are sensitive and will be handled
          accordingly.
          3.4.5.3.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) Responding unit is responsible for ensuring
          timely and accurate responses. Under no circumstances should accuracy be
          overlooked in order to meet suspense.
          3.4.5.3.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) If the final response will not meet the
          suspense date, it is the responding unit’s responsibility to contact the 100
          ARW/IG who in turn will contact the agency originating the inquiry and request
          an extension.
          3.4.5.3.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) Ensure the final response answers all of the
          questions contained in the inquiry.
          3.4.5.3.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) Responses should be prepared as a separate
          document. Although supporting documentation will be included in the prepared
          package, the response should enable the reader to grasp the situation without
          having to refer to the supporting documentation.
       3.4.5.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) The response will be coordinated utilizing an
       Electronic Staff Summary Sheet (ESSS) in the format contained in Attachment 3
       (Added), or similar 100 ARW approved ESSS. The response will be coordinated
       through the following offices and in the order indicated: (1) squadron
       commander/staff agency chief, (2) group commander, (3) 100 ARW/IG, (4) 100
       ARW/JA, (5) 100 ARW/CCC, (6) 100 ARW/CCE, (7) 100 ARW/CV, and (8) 100
       ARW/CC. The action for the 100 ARW/CC will be to “Sign” for 100 ARW units and

           to “Coordinate”, if applicable under Paragraph 3.4.5.3 (Added), for partner units. The
           package will then be returned to the 100 ARW/IG who will then forward the
           approved response to the requestor, USAFE/IGQ, and USAFE/CCX.
           3.4.5.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) Responses requiring changes or further
           clarification will be returned to the squadron commander. Reworked packages will
           require the same coordination as the first iteration.
           3.4.5.6. (Added-MILDENHALL) The 100 ARW/IG will maintain a protected file
           copy of documentation related to the high-level inquiry for one year. This may be
           accomplished by opening a case file in ACTS and uploading all pertinent documents.
3.5. Status of Forces Agreements. Because of their sensitive nature, process all inquiries about
cases dealing with Status of Forces Agreements, individual privileges or rights while stationed
outside the continental United States, legal or policy problems, or issues that may become
sensitive or controversial in the same manner as all other Congressional Inquiries.

                                             TRAVEL

4.1. Invitation to Travel. The Secretary of Defense or Secretaries of the Military Departments
may extend invitations for sponsored travel within the United States to Members and employees
of Congress. DoD 4515.12 assigns the responsibility for approving and coordinating requests for
transportation from the Congress to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs
(OSD/LA). DoD 4515.12 also describes the procedures for travel at the invitation of the
SECDEF or Service Secretaries.
4.2. Visiting Bases. Members of Congress and their staffs may need to visit Air Force
activities. The Air Force fully supports and encourages these visits. With Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) approval, the Air Force may provide transportation for congressional visits.
   4.2.1. Requests for travel by SECAF invitation should be based on significant
   interest/benefit to the Air Force. Examples of valid requests would be to visit a base to
   assess the capabilities of a Composite Wing or to visit HQ Air Combat Command for updates
   on fighter upgrades. Travel to joint organizations or locations of interest to other services
   may not be completed under SECAF invitation.
4.3. Travel Support. Congress may request DoD support for worldwide travel under the
auspices of public law (31 USC 1108 (g)).
4.4. Transportation Approval. Do not commit the Air Force to providing transportation until
SAF/LLO provides notification transportation is approved. SAF/LLO will issue invitational
travel orders authorizing travel and expenditure of funds related to congressional travel.
4.5. Trip Progress. Escorts will email or call SAF/LLO on a regular basis to provide updates
on trip progress and receive any message traffic from home station.
4.6. Schedule Changes. Escorts will coordinate each schedule change with SAF/LLO (and
SAF/FMBL, if applicable) and with all affected facilities, activities, and personnel to avoid
unannounced arrivals. Cancellations should be reported immediately to SAF/LLO.
4.7. Government Funds. Through coordination with SAF/LLO, escorts will be issued
government funds to be used in support of congressional travel. For CONUS travel, member and
staffer expenses directly related to official trips (meals, hotels, airline tickets, etc.) will be paid
by the escort. Base support agencies or private organizations that provide meals or other
authorized services must be reimbursed for those expenses. Expenses related to travel (or
Congressional Visits) completed without invitational travel orders will not be paid using funds
issued through SAF/LL.
4.8. Unescorted Trips. Unescorted trips completed under invitational travel orders will be by
exception only. For unescorted trips, the host commander notifies SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL of
pending visits, itinerary changes, and any new or changed requests. The host will coordinate
directly with all affected facilities, activities, and personnel regarding briefings, transportation,
quarters, or other support.

  4.8.1. Upon completion of unescorted trips, the host commander should inform SAF/LL or
  SAF/FMBL about the outcome of the visit or investigation. Field commanders should also
  provide information to other interested echelons at their discretion.
  4.8.2. Convey the following information to SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL: the site and length of
  the visit, names of visiting Members of Congress and staff representatives, deficiencies
  disclosed by the visit, requests for information, and corrective action.

Secretary of the Air Force on all congressional requests for inspection, investigation, and
summary reports that require the Secretary’s attention.
5.2. Controlled Area Access. Commanders must ensure all personnel fully cooperate with
committees during hearings and investigations. Allow access to controlled areas in accordance
with DoD 5200-1.R and AFI 31-401. Proper identification admits Members to any base, field
installation, or facility and allows them to use private working space and facilities at a central
location.
5.3. Official documents. When a committee wants to examine official documents, files, or
records within its area of interest or pertinent to its investigation, provide the material in a room
set aside for the committee unless release of these materials is not allowed under paragraph 1.1

   5.3.1. Refer any requests from a congressional committee to copy, remove, or retain official
   files, documents, or records (or copies of these documents) to SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL.
   SAF/LL or SAF/ FMBL, as appropriate, will coordinate requests to remove files with the
   appropriate agencies.
   5.3.2. Coordinate with Office of the General Counsel (SAF/GC) concerning release of
   documents related to congressional investigations when there are legal issues involved such
   as the Privacy Act and claims of privilege.
5.4. Deficiencies. If a committee notes any deficiencies in Air Force operations or procedures
during its field investigation and if the Air Force can take immediate corrective action, do so and
advise the committee and either SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL.
5.5. Unescorted Investigations. If SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL personnel do not escort members of
the Congress or their staffs, field commanders should inform SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL about the
outcome of the visit or investigation. Field commanders should also provide information to
other interested echelons at their discretion.
   5.5.1. Convey the following information to SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL: the site and length of
   the visit, names of visiting Members of Congress and staff representatives, deficiencies
   disclosed by the visit, requests for information, and corrective action.

invitation and a cover letter explaining the details of the event 60 days in advance. If 60 days
notice is not possible, call the SAF/LLH or SAF/LLS to determine the best way to extend the
invitation to Members of Congress. Call the Air Force Congressional Inquiry Division
(SAF/LLI) for the best way to extend the invitation to the Executive Office of the President or
the Office of the Vice President.
   6.4.1. MAJCOM/CCs may extend invitations to members and their staffs to join them on a
   planned base visit in their respective Congressional district. These invitations must not
   include the promise of transportation. The MAJCOM Legislative Affairs function will

   or SAF/FMBL confirms the guests will attend. Do not mention transportation of members,
   employees, or spouses in the invitation.
   6.4.2. Coordinate with SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL and parent MAJCOM when Members of
   Congress or staff plans to visit an Air Force activity. At Joint Bases where the Air Force is
   not the lead agency, SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL will also notify the appropriate sister service
   legislative affairs office. When a request for a Congressional visit is received at the
   installation level, the affected MAJCOM will forward the details of the request to SAF/LL.
   SAF/LL will forward the information to SAF/FMBL if applicable.
6.5. Candidates. Commanders should encourage and welcome visits by candidates seeking to
receive briefings, tours, or other official DoD information. However, DoD personnel acting in
their official capacity may not engage in activities that associate DoD with any partisan political
campaign or election, candidate, cause, or issue. Interaction with candidates for political office
must not imply or appear to imply sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of any such candidates
or political views; including, the use of installation facilities by any candidate for political
campaign or election events. This prohibition does not apply to the President, Vice President, or
Speaker of the House of Representatives. Contact SAF/LL or the Office of Public Affairs
(SAF/PA) with questions regarding these restrictions.
