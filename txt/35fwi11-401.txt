SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision amends the incentive allocation table, corrects the designation of the PACAF supplement,
changes the submission and review process, changes the weekly approval process, changes the
authorization of familiarization flights, adds the spouse taxi ride program and corrects other minor
errors.
1. GENERAL GUIDANCE:
   1.1. This instruction defines the local implementation of AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and,
   per AFI 11-401, delegates the authority for certain orientation flights to the level of, but not lower
   than, the wing commander. In line with the USAF objective, the purpose of the 35 FW Orientation
   Flight Program is to provide commanders of the air base units a means to 1) reward and motivate
   individuals (incentive orientation flights only), 2) ensure assigned Airmen have a better
   understanding of a particular weapon system and its role, and 3) acquaint visitors and delegated
2                                                                        35FWI11-401 20 APRIL 2009


    personnel with the capabilities of 35 FW assets. All of these flights will be conducted within the
    best interests of the United States Air Force.
2. ORIENTATION FLIGHT PROGRAM:
    2.1. Approval Authority. Approval authority is in accordance with AFI 11-401 and PACAF
    guidance. Also, unless otherwise stated, approvals for all categories of orientation flights are one-
    time only for a specific individual. No person should offer flights or imply approval until the
    appropriate authority has actually approved the flight. Incentive and familiarization flights will be
    flown in conjunction with regularly scheduled training sorties. No additional hours will be allocated.
    2.2. Selection Authority. Group and associate unit commanders are the designated Office of
    Primary Responsibility (OPR) for orientation flight selections. Number of annual allocations, OPRs,
    and their assigned units are identified in Attachment 1, Organization/Group Incentive Flight
    Allotments.
    2.3. General Guidance. Though orientation flights give military and civilian personnel the
    opportunity to witness USAF missions firsthand, some restraint must be imposed on the scope of the
    program. Orientation flights have the potential to reduce training effectiveness, consume critical
    flying hours, and expose non-flying personnel to certain risks. Specific categories of orientation
    flights are described in Paragraph 3. Categories of Orientation Flights.
    2.4. Selectee Cancellation/Change. Those selected for orientation flights will automatically be
    removed from the approved list if they cancel their scheduled flight more than once for reasons other
    than medical disqualification. Requests to change selectees, or reprioritize them against remaining
    unit slots (see Attachment 1), will be accomplished semi-annually via a memorandum for record
    signed by the selectee’s Group Commander. Electronic submissions are authorized.
    2.5. Disclosure. When planning and preparing for foreign orientation flights on USAF aircraft, it
    must be determined what will and will not be disclosed. For guidelines to foreign disclosure
    requirements, reference AFI 11-401 and PACAF guidance.
    2.6. Responsibilities – All Categories. For an effective orientation flight program, responsibilities
    will be shared among the nominating unit (via the unit orientation flight monitor), the operational
    fighter squadrons, 35 OSS/OSOS, wing and squadron Aircrew Flight Equipment office, the selectee
    and the mission pilot in command (PIC).
       2.6.1. Group and associate unit commanders will:
           2.6.1.1. Submit incentive orientation requests per Attachment 2 and Attachment 3. All
           authorized incentive slots plus three alternates may be submitted in accordance with
           Attachment 1.
           2.6.1.2. Review and reprioritize selectees against remaining group slots semi-annually.
       2.6.2. 35 OSS/OSOS (Wing Scheduling) will:
           2.6.2.1. Manage the overall orientation flight program.
           2.6.2.2. Brief the orientation flight status at the weekly 35 OG and Wing Scheduling
           Meetings.
           2.6.2.3. Coordinate orientation flight scheduling with the flying squadrons.
           2.6.2.4. Assign selectees to available flights in accordance with Attachment 1.

           2.6.6.3. Provide escort (if required) to and from the squadron and a qualified mission pilot to
           conduct the orientation flight.
       2.6.7. Mission Pilot In Command (PIC) will:
           2.6.7.1. Brief all aspects of the flight to preclude passenger apprehension. This brief will
           include (as a minimum): the non-qualified passenger checklist in the current 35 FW Pilot’s
           Guide; glove/sleeve requirements and air sickness bag use/storage.
           2.6.7.2. Conduct rear-cockpit orientation. This will be conducted in/at the aircraft and, as a
           minimum, cover rudder adjustment, leg position, stick interference, oxygen equipment
           review and egress procedures.
    2.7. Restrictions – All Categories. Most personnel will not be physically or physiologically prepared
    for the stresses that can be encountered, therefore these flights usually restrict normal mission
    training. The following restrictions apply to all categories of orientation sorties:
       2.7.1. Mission pilot (pilot in command) will, at minimum, be a flight lead or an experienced
       pilot, current and qualified in the 35 FW primary aircraft (F-16C).
       2.7.2. Aircraft in a test program or functional check flight (FCF) will not be used.
       2.7.3. Minimum age for passengers in aircraft equipped with ejection seats is 18 years old.
       2.7.4. Passenger will occupy the rear seat and will not be given control of the aircraft unless the
       pilot has access to the controls and only during non-critical phases of flight. With an Instructor
       Pilot (IP) aboard, approved indoctrination flyers who are rated-pilot general/flag officers may fly
       in the front seat provided the following is accomplished: Senior Officer Course, Critical Action
       Procedures (CAPs) Test, monthly SEPT and appropriate normal/emergency procedures training
       in a simulator.
       2.7.5. Critical phases of flight are takeoff, rejoin, close formation, instrument departures and
       approaches, air-to-air refueling, Air Combat (ACBT), air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons
       delivery (simulated or actual), traffic pattern and landing.
       2.7.6. Back seat occupants may fly the aircraft only when above 5,000 feet AGL. If the
       Orientation flight passenger is civilian or a non-rated military individual, no portion of the flight
       (except takeoff and landing) will be flown below 1,000 feet above ground level.
       2.7.7. FS/CC must approve all mission profiles.
       2.7.8. Aerobatic flight will only be performed if requested by the passenger.
       2.7.9. Abrupt or unexpected maneuvers will not be accomplished unless safety of flight requires
       it.
35FWI11-401 20 APRIL 2009                                                                              5


     2.7.10. Excessive G-loading and extended negative-G should be avoided. Unit desires and
     passenger requests to demonstrate maximum aircraft performance should be weighed to ensure a
     positive flight experience is obtained. G-LOC and preventative measures will be briefed for
     every orientation flight in a high-performance aircraft regardless of the planned G-loading.
     2.7.11. Flights above 18,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) require a valid AF IMT 1274,
     Physiological Training). In the absence of AF IMT 1274, flights will remain below 18,000 feet
     MSL.
     2.7.12. Weather minimums will be the mission pilot’s weather category.
     2.7.13. Anti-exposure suits will be worn IAW AFI 11-301V1/PACAF Sup 1, 18 Jul 03, Air
     Aircrew Flight Equipment Program.
3. CATEGORIES OF ORIENTATION FLIGHTS:
  3.1. Incentive Orientation Flights. These flights provide a visible reward to military personnel for
  outstanding service and should motivate others to similar performance levels. EXAMPLE: Reward
  to the Airman of the Year.
     3.1.1. Operating Procedures – Incentive Specific. Squadron schedulers will make every effort to
     reserve F-16Ds flown on Fridays for incentive orientation flight purposes (operational
     requirements permitting). Operational training requirements will take priority over all incentive
     training sorties.
     3.1.2. Selection Criteria. Individuals should be selected based on outstanding performance or
     significance of their contribution to the unit’s overall mission. Seniority, or time on station,
     should not influence the selection. Competition for the available slots is very keen and the
     quality/content of an airman’s performance is always important as a deciding factor in the
     selection process. Incentive flight selectees should have at least 90 days retainability to ensure
     the flight can be scheduled prior to PCS from Misawa AB. Selectees will be flown in order of
     nearest DEROS date.
     3.1.3. Restrictions – Incentive Specific.
         3.1.3.1. Profiles will not include (D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT, BSA, SAT, SEAD, FP or
         participation in flag or large force exercises. FS/CC must approve all mission profiles.
     3.1.4. Specific Guidance.      Adhere to the following guidelines when conducting incentive
     orientation flights.
         3.1.4.1. Incentive orientation flights will be dedicated sorties with a profile structured so as
         not to exceed the passenger’s comfort level. The objective is to reward outstanding
         performance. The profile will be planned in a low-risk environment.
         3.1.4.2. All (IAW AFI 11-2F-16V3, Operations Procedures) authorized aerobatic maneuvers
         may be conducted above 5000 feet.
         3.1.4.3. If appropriate, conduct a G-Awareness (positive) demonstration.
         3.1.4.4. Supersonic runs are authorized if in approved airspace and with a compatible
         configuration.
         3.1.4.5. Practice instrument and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) patterns may be flown (no
         simulated emergency patterns).
6                                                                         35FWI11-401 20 APRIL 2009


           3.1.4.6. Weapons delivery and intercepts are authorized at unclassified level (Heads Up
           Display (HUD) tape will not be made available).
           3.1.4.7. The mission pilot or the crew chief will assist with passenger strap-in.
           3.1.4.8. Accomplish all before-start procedures IAW 1F-16C-1CL-1 (front and rear seat).
           3.1.4.9. 35 OG/CC approval is required for maneuvers/events not listed above.
    3.2. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Orientation Flights: Flights to prominent citizens whose ties with
    the public could lead to greater support for Air Force activities. Their purpose is to increase public
    knowledge of Misawa’s missions and capabilities.
       3.2.1. Operating Procedures – DV Specific. If possible, squadrons should try to use F-16Ds
       flown on Fridays. However, DV schedules may not allow this to happen, giving the squadrons
       minimum time to plan. Squadrons will do their best to accommodate, but not at the expense of
       operational requirements.
           3.2.1.1. All prerequisites need to be coordinated by fighter squadron schedulers and are the
           same as those in the above Paragraph 2.4.
       3.2.2. Selection Criteria. AFI 11-401 and PACAF guidance further describe the intent of DV
       orientation flights and considerations in selecting candidates. The 35 FW is limited to two civic
       leader flights per year. DV orientation flights are authorized per AFI 11-401. (See Attachment 6
       for sample Distinguished Visitor request).
       3.2.3. Restrictions – DV Specific. Adhere to all restrictions and guidelines in Paragraphs 3.1.3.
       and 3.1.4. above. In addition:
           3.2.3.1. No air-to-air weapons capabilities will be demonstrated (i.e., no Dynamic Launch
           Zones (DLZs) are to be displayed at any time).
           3.2.3.2. Only Level 1 radar will be used.
           3.2.3.3. No High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) or Harm Targeting System (HTS)
           capabilities employed/demonstrated.
           3.2.3.4. No Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capabilities employed by any flight member.
    3.3. Familiarization Orientation Flights. Familiarization flights are an important tool for providing
    individuals who have aviation-related responsibilities with a first-hand look at Misawa missions.
    Commanders should use these flights for military members of their unit and other eligible
    individuals listed in AFI 11-401. In addition, recognizing the unique composition of the Misawa
    installation, sister service/associate units assigned to Misawa AB may participate in the
    familiarization orientation flight program. Familiarization flights may be one-time events or
    recurring.
       3.3.1. Operating Procedures – Familiarization Specific.
           3.3.1.1. These flights will be flown using normal training profiles for the specific weapon
           system. Therefore, squadrons can conduct these flights anywhere an available F-16D falls in
           the schedule. Disclosure considerations still apply.
           3.3.1.2. This program is run directly through the 13th and 14th Fighter Squadrons. Once
           personnel have been approved by the 35 FW/CC for a familiarization flight, the squadrons
           are responsible for coordinating and ensuring all prerequisites listed in Paragraph 2.4. are
35FWI11-401 20 APRIL 2009                                                                                7


          complete. The squadrons will return notify OSOS of familiarization flights and will return all
          completed paperwork to OSOS after the completion of the sortie.
      3.3.2. Selection Criteria. Individuals may be nominated for familiarization flights in an effort to
      enhance their aviation-related skills and better acquaint them with Misawa’s mission. The 35
      FW/CC will approve familiarization nominees in the same fashion as incentive nominees.
      Normally, these flights are one-time events. Familiarization flights will be flown in order of
      approval date. These individuals have aviation related duties and include:
          3.3.2.1. Officers Awaiting Permanent Change of Station Training (APT) scheduled to attend
          Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training or Pilot Training.
          3.3.2.2. Wing electronic warfare officer (EWO)
          3.3.2.3. Wing and Squadron Intelligence and Space personnel
          3.3.2.4. 35 FW Flight Physiologist/Technician
          3.3.2.5. 35 FW Dedicated Crew Chiefs
          3.3.2.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment Personnel
          3.3.2.7. Wing Safety Personnel
          3.3.2.8. Members of sister service/associate units with aviation backgrounds.
          3.3.2.9. Individuals listed in Paragraph 3.3.2.2 through 3.3.2.4 are authorized recurring
          familiarization flights. These flights will not exceed one per calendar quarter IAW PACAF
          guidance, but this restriction will change based on updated supplements.
      3.3.3. Restrictions.
          3.3.3.1. Familiarization orientation flights may include (D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT, BSA,
          SAT, SEAD, FP and may participate in flag or large force exercises. FS/CC approval of
          mission profiles is still required.
   3.4. Spouse Orientation Taxi Rides. Spouse Orientation Taxi rides will be conducted IAW AFI 11-
   401 and PACAF guidance. Taxi Rides will be organized by the fighter squadrons. A list of names
   will be submitted to 35 OSS/OSOS NLT 72 hours prior to the planned taxi rides. IAW PACAF
   guidance, taxi rides will be limited to spouses of the following USAF personnel: aircrew members,
   flight authorized crew chiefs, flight authorized mission-support personnel, and critical specialties in
   direct support of flying operations. The OG/CC determines personnel considered critical specialties
   and will not expand the program to an all-skills program for all members.
4. Exposure Suit Procedures:
   4.1. In an effort to conduct orientation/familiarization/incentive flights year-round, the following
   procedures will be followed.
      4.1.1. During winter months when exposure suits are required, 35 OSS/OSOS will assign 10
      selectees (5 selectees to each squadron) for exposure suit fitting no later than the last Thursday of
      the month.
      4.1.2. 35 OSS/OSOS will coordinate with Aircrew Flight Equipment office and escort selectees
      to the respective squadron the following Friday for measuring. If 35 OSS/OSOS is unavailable
      to escort, they will coordinate with a squadron representative to escort selectees from the Entry
      Control Point (ECP) to the squadron. If Aircrew Flight Equipment shop is unavailable to

      measure selectees, 35 OSS/OSOS will solicit appropriate measurements from selectees directly
      and forward the measurements to Aircrew Flight Equipment Shop.
      4.1.3. Selectees will be measured for an exposure suit and these measurements will be used to
      determine if pilot spare exposure suits are available for the selectee to borrow. If required,
      selectees will try on suits to determine the fit of the wrist seal. 35 OSS/OSOS will escort
      selectees back to the ECP following measuring/fitting.
      4.1.4. On weeks in which incentives are scheduled, on Monday 35 OSS/OSOS will e-mail each
      Aircrew Flight Equipment shop with the prioritized list of available selectees for that week.
      Each squadron Aircrew Flight Equipment shop will reply indicating the number of suits
      available for each individual on the list.
      4.1.5. Based on the number of suits available for each person, 35 OSS/OSOS will make the final
      determination and notify each Aircrew Flight Equipment shop and the selectees in accordance
      with Paragraph 2.6.2. no later than close of business. Selectees will try on the exposure suit at
      their normally scheduled equipment fitting time.
      4.1.6. If a suit does not fit, or subsequently becomes unavailable (i.e. required by a pilot), then
      the incentive flight will be rescheduled for a later date in accordance with these same procedures.
      Such cancellations will not count against the selectee.

A1.2. Incentive Flight Allocations. 35 FW/CC allotments are as required (A/R). Each applicable
group/organization (i.e. MXG, OG, MSG, MDG, MSOC) will normally receive five incentive flight
allotments per calendar year. The NAF may request incentive flights on an “as available” basis with the
35 FW/CC.
A1.3. OPRs will submit their selections to 35 OSS/OSOS in March for that calendar year. Units may
nominate a number of individuals equal to their allocated annual slots, plus three alternates. Submissions
should be submitted via memorandum (see Attachment 3) and should be in priority order. Nominations
may be submitted electronically.
A1.4. In January, 35 OSS/OSOS will send unit commanders the current incentive list, indicating slots
already flown and slots remaining for the calendar year. Unit commanders may reprioritize their
allocated slots and alternates, or rescind and submit different names as appropriate. The revised slot
allocation will be resubmitted (via Attachment 3) in January and 35 OSS/OSOS will update the
incentive list.
A1.5. Selectees and alternates remaining on the incentive list at the end of the calendar year will be
forwarded to unit commanders, and may be prioritized into the next calendar year if desired.

     ADDITIONAL ORIENTATION FLIGHT INFORMATION HANDOUT/ADDITIONAL
                    ORIENTATION FLIGHT INFORMATION

A5.1. Basics: Your flight will be geared to your level of personal comfort. Although the F-16 is a high
performance combat aircraft, capable of maneuvers exceeding 9 times the force of normal gravity, the
purpose of the ride is to familiarize you with the aircraft and its capabilities. For most non-flyers, this
ride is a “once in a lifetime” opportunity. There are a variety of maneuvers the pilot can perform during
your flight. The pilot will discuss them with you and tailor your mission profile to accomplish an
effective mission.
A5.2. Escorts: The Fighter Squadrons are responsible for escorting you to F-16 parking ramp restricted
areas. If you would like to have your spouse/family to accompany you to your flight, you must notify
us.
A5.3. Cameras: No cameras are allowed in the F-16. Cameras are not allowed in the 13 FS and 14 FS
HAS areas unless coordinated with the squadron ops desks and MOC.
A5.4. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Safety Basics: Wear cotton underwear and combat boots
(preferably without steel toe) during your flight. Do not wear an under-wire bra, oil-based cosmetics,
hairpins / barrettes, or any jewelry.
A5.5. Eat Something: It is highly recommended that you eat something prior to your flight. A piece
of fruit is great. It’s light and provides the sugars and quick energy your body will need during your
flight. Do not assume an empty stomach will prevent it from getting upset. This is an incorrect
assumption and usually the opposite holds true. Drinking water can help fill your stomach and keep you
hydrated. Sorties in fighter aircraft will dehydrate you so be preventive.

SAMPLE DISTINGUISHED VISITOR ORIENTATION FLIGHT REQUEST MEMORANDUM

Table A6.1. Sample Distinguished Visitor Orientation Flight Request Memorandum.
MEMORANDUM FOR 35 OG/CC
FROM: Your Unit
SUBJECT: Distinguished Visitor Flight Request
1. Request Col John Doe receives an orientation flight in the F-16D. Col Doe is an intelligence
officer deployed to Misawa AB. He has a current flight physical and is current in physiological
training.

2. Col Doe is a highly motivated intelligence officer. Since most of Col Doe’s flight experience
has been limited to the P-3 aircraft and helicopters; therefore he has limited exposure to the
unique physiological aspects of the tactical fighter world. An opportunity to fly in the F-16
would be an invaluable contribution to Col Doe’s professional development as an intelligence
officer.

3. It is understood an approval for Col Doe to fly with 35 FW will be for a single sortie;
subsequent sorties will be requested through normal channels. Furthermore, all requirements
listed in AFI 11-401/ PACAF Sup 1 will be met. Aircrew Flight Equipment training will be
accomplished through the wing Aircrew Flight Equipment office.
