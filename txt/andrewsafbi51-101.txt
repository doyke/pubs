This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-9, Civil Law for Individuals, and
provides the framework for the disposition of juvenile misconduct cases and the treatment of
juvenile offenders. The purpose of this instruction is to establish responsibilities and procedures
for the administrative disposition of misconduct committed by juveniles on Andrews Air Force
Base and to establish the Andrews Air Force Base Youth Intervention Program (YIP). The YIP
will hear all cases in which a juvenile is alleged to have engaged in misconduct or cases referred
to it by 316th Security Forces Squadron (316 SFS) through the installation legal office (316
WG/JA). The YIP will determine the appropriate disposition of the case by weighing the best
interests of the juvenile and Andrews Air Force Base community. The action taken will be
designed to attain the primary goal of maintaining good order and discipline on Andrews Air
Force Base and, if possible, to rehabilitate the juvenile offender. This instruction applies to
juveniles who engage in misconduct on Andrews Air Force Base and are dependents of
personnel assigned to a unit on Andrews Air Force Base to include all personnel assigned to
supported units, including Air Force Reserve, Navy, and Air National Guard (ANG) units,
except where noted otherwise and dependents of active duty or retired military personnel using
the Andrews Air Force Base facilities. This instruction also applies to the sponsors of juveniles
who engage in misconduct on Andrews Air Force Base. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will
convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. See

Act statement, either incorporated in the body of the document or in a separate statement
accompanying each document.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been completely revised and must be reviewed.
1. Authority:
     1.1. Public Law 94-415, Juvenile Justice and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
     Prevention Act of 1974 (18 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 5031-5042), applies to
     Andrews Air Force Base. The statute provides that misconduct committed by a juvenile
     should be disposed of outside the federal courts whenever feasible. Accordingly, this
     instruction establishes an administrative system in lieu of juvenile delinquency proceedings
     or prosecution in U.S. Federal Magistrate Court.
     1.2. Moreover, the installation commander is charged with the responsibility for maintaining
     law and order on the base (AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program). To
     achieve this goal, the commander may demand that any juvenile charged with misconduct
     explain why base privileges should not be limited or revoked. Privileges subject to revocation
     include, but are not limited to, the following: Base Exchange privileges, commissary
     privileges, housing privileges, shoppette privileges, base driving privileges, and the privilege
     of entering or using any part (or all) of the base. This instruction complies with the foregoing
     law and instruction by ensuring that an offense involving a juvenile is identified, adjudicated,
     and disposed of in a manner that maintains good order and discipline while stressing
     deterrence and rehabilitation of the juvenile.
2. Purpose of the YIP:
     2.1. The YIP is designed to:
        2.1.1. Maintain good order and discipline on Andrews Air Force Base.
        2.1.2. Educate juveniles and their sponsors on the consequences of misconduct and crime
        (i.e., the impact crime has on the juvenile offender, the offender’s family, the victims, the
        community and mission effectiveness).
        2.1.3. Rehabilitate juveniles through counseling, education, community service,
        restitution, and other means of corrective action as recommended by the YIP and ordered
        by the installation commander. Therefore, all actions should be designed to prevent
        further misconduct and instill respect for the law in Andrews Air Force Base’s young
        people.
        2.1.4. Protect the best interests of both the juvenile and the Andrews Air Force Base
        community. Accordingly, the system avoids labeling the juveniles with the stigma of
        “criminal” or “delinquent.” Rather, the term “juvenile offender” is used in this
        instruction.
        2.1.5. For the purposes of this instruction, the term juvenile or juvenile offender only
        refers to persons under the age of 18. All persons 18 years of age or older, regardless of
        marital/ dependent status, will be treated as adults and their cases will not be handled
        under this instruction. The term youth is interchangeable with juvenile in this respect.

   2.2. Participation in the YIP Program. Participation by the juvenile in the YIP Program is
   voluntary. However, certain administrative sanctions may be taken against a juvenile
   offender even if the juvenile refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the YIP. (For example,
   the installation commander, 316 WG/CC, retains the authority to bar the juvenile from base.)
   Conversely, certain rehabilitative measures, such as referral to counseling, performance of
   community service, or participation in a work program by the juvenile offender, may only be
   undertaken if the juvenile agrees to submit to the YIP’s jurisdiction. Rescission of
   administrative sanctions (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the
   juvenile’s consent to the jurisdiction of the YIP and satisfactory completion by the juvenile
   offender and/or his or her sponsor of such rehabilitative measures ordered by the YIP.
       2.2.1. Typically traffic offenses will be handled by the U.S. Federal Magistrate Court.
   2.3. Composition of the YIP:
       2.3.1. The Deputy Commander, 316th Mission Support Group (316 MSG/CD), shall
       serve as the YIP Chairman.
       2.3.2. The council will consist of representatives, as approved by the YIP Chairman,
       from the following member organizations:
          2.3.2.1. Chaplain (316 WG/HC).
          2.3.2.2. 316th Security Forces Squadron Commander (316 SFS/CC).
          2.3.2.3. Staff Judge Advocate (316 WG/JA) or an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate
          (ASJA) appointed by the SJA.
          2.3.2.4. Family Advocacy (779 MDOS/SGOMHF).
          2.3.2.5. Special invited guests, such as a representative from the Airmen and Family
          Readiness Center (316 FSS/DPF), the sponsor’s Commander, and/or the sponsor’s
          First Sergeant.
   2.4. YIP Members. Members will endeavor to provide continuity of attendees (i.e., avoid
   turnover of YIP member representatives whenever possible).
3. Responsibilities:
   3.1. 316th Security Forces (316 SFS) will:
       3.1.1. Prepare an AF Form 3545, Incident Report, Security Forces Management
       Information System (SFMIS) Report, or a Report of Investigation (ROI).
       3.1.2. As appropriate based on severity, issue the juvenile a memorandum signed by the
       Commander, 316th Mission Support Group (316 MSG/CC), that immediately limits the
       juvenile’s on-base privileges (see Attachment 2).
       3.1.3. Notify the juvenile’s sponsor’s Unit First Sergeant or Commander.
       3.1.4. Send the AF Form 3545/SFMIS Report/ROI and a copy of the limited privileges
       letter to the Staff Judge Advocate.
       3.1.5. Refer to YIP or U.S. Federal Magistrate Court based on 316 WG/JA
       determination.

       3.1.6. Issue a notification memorandum (see Attachment 3), signed by the YIP
       Chairman (316 MSG/CD), to the juvenile, and serve a copy on the juvenile’s parents or
       sponsor informing them of the charge via certified mail. An information copy will be sent
       to the sponsor’s unit commander and 316 WG/JA.
       3.1.7. Annotate on the notification the date, time, and location of the meeting of the YIP.
       The meeting date on the memorandum shall be the next available meeting date from the

       3.1.9. Provide copies of the AF Form 3545/SFMIS Report/ROI and the limited privileges

       will prepare a decision memorandum (see Attachment 4) for the 316 WG/CC’s signature
       or designee, addressed to the juvenile offender, announcing the final disposition of the
       case. The memorandum shall also include information regarding community service,
       counseling referrals, etc., if applicable. Once signed and returned by the installation
       commander or designee, the installation legal office will ensure the signed memorandum
       is mailed to the juvenile offender and his or her sponsor and a copy forwarded to Security
       Forces Reports and Analysis (316 SFS/S5AR) and Military Personnel Flight
       Administrative Support (316 FSS/DPMPS).
       3.2.3. If any of the juvenile offender’s privileges, which are reflected on their DD Fm
       1173, Dependent Identification Card, are to be revoked, the installation legal office will
       prepare a revocation memorandum (see Attachment 5) for the appropriate signature
       authority, addressed to the sponsor, directing the sponsor to apply for a replacement
       identification card for the juvenile offender with limited privileges. Once signed and
       returned by the appropriate signature authority, the installation legal office will ensure the
       signed memorandum is mailed to the juvenile offender and his or her sponsor and a copy
       forwarded to 316 FSS/DPMPS.
    3.3. The YIP will:
       3.3.1. Meet as directed by the YIP Chairman to review cases of juvenile misconduct. The

        such programs.
4. Conducting YIP Meetings:
     4.1. The YIP Chairman shall conduct YIP meetings (see Attachment 6).
     4.2. The YIP may arrange for the appearance of any witness deemed necessary for the
     resolution of the case. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. The YIP may rely on relevant
     hearsay evidence that is considered reliable (to include Security Forces reports).
     4.3. YIP meetings shall be closed to the public. Information discussed will be disclosed to
     the public per the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

     sponsor has the right to legal counsel during the meeting, to question their own witnesses, or
     to cross examine any witnesses called by the YIP. Moreover, nothing in this instruction shall
     be construed to grant any rights to the juvenile or his or her sponsor. Proper military decorum
     and courtesies will be maintained at all times by all personnel.
     4.7. In order for the juvenile to be found Guilty of the alleged offense(s) with which he or
     she is accused, two-thirds of the YIP Hearing members in attendance at the meeting must
     cast their vote as Guilty using a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. If two-
     thirds of the YIP Hearing members do not cast their vote as Guilty, then the YIP must find
     the juvenile Not Guilty of the alleged offense(s). Regardless of the outcome, the findings
     and/or recommendations of the YIP will be submitted to the installation commander or
     designee for approval.
     4.8. The YIP will discuss such other matters (e.g., follow up on previous misconduct cases)
     as directed by the YIP Chairman.
5. Records Management:
     5.1. The installation legal office acts as recorder for the YIP. The installation legal office
     shall maintain the records of the YIP and ensure the confidentiality of the records subject to
     the Privacy Act of 1974. In accordance with, the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
     (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil, units are responsible for the maintenance and
     disposal of electronic or paper records created.
     5.2. No incident system of records will be generated or kept by YIP members. However, the
     installation legal office will maintain the records of the meetings (i.e. the minutes) and the
     recommended sanctions to be administered to the juvenile, if any. This is necessary to
     ensure accuracy and to ensure compliance by the juvenile and his or her sponsor with the
ANDREWSAFBI 51-101 14 May 2010                                                                7


   sanctions administered. All correspondence to the juvenile or his or her sponsor will be hand
   delivered or mailed.

 SAMPLE SCRIPT FOR YOUTH INTERVENTION PROGRAM (YIP) PROCEEDINGS

CHAIR: This Hearing will come to order. I am _______________________, chairperson. This
Hearing is convened under the provisions of AAFBI 51-101, by order of
___________________________, 316th Wing Commander. The juvenile is/is not present. The
juvenile’s sponsor is present.
CHAIR: The purpose of this Hearing is to make Findings of Fact regarding the juvenile’s
alleged misconduct ___________________________. The Hearing is to explore alternative
solutions and recommend corrective action(s) to the 316th Wing Commander. When selecting
appropriate administrative sanctions to recommend, the Hearing board will evaluate the
juvenile’s prior record of misconduct, the seriousness of the misconduct, the degree of parental
guidance and discipline evident and the availability of community agencies to support any
corrective action/sanctions recommended.
JA: My name is _________________________, from the 316 WG Legal Office. I am the Legal
Advisor for this proceeding. As Legal Advisor, I ensure that you receive a fair, impartial, and
orderly Hearing. The Chairperson will now introduce the other members of the Hearing.
CHAIR: [introduces the other members of the Hearing]
CHAIR: The YIP is not bound by formal rules of evidence prescribed for criminal trials.
Furthermore, an administrative hearing does not employ the “beyond-a-reasonable-doubt”
standard. On the contrary, administrative hearings seek to find all the relevant facts from the best
evidence that is available and they employ a “preponderance-of-evidence” test in making their
findings. Preponderance of the evidence means that based upon all of the evidence presented, it
is more probable than not that a certain incident actually occured.
CHAIR: I will now advise you of the procedures for this hearing:
CHAIR: First, you have the right to appear before all open sessions of this hearing in person.
CHAIR: You may or may not provide sworn testimony before the hearing. This is your
decision. If you do not elect to provide sworn testimony, you may make an unsworn statement to
the hearing either personally or through your sponsor, orally, in writing, or both. If you do not
choose to testify or make a statement, the hearing will not consider your silence as an admission
of truth of the evidence that has been presented against you.
CHAIR: Finally, you have the right during the proceedings of this hearing to submit evidence,
including matters in extenuation and mitigation. Extenuation means those facts or circumstances
that lessen the impact of your misconduct. It is also appropriate to share with us those things that
will impact you and your family or actions that you have taken to correct your behavior.
Mitigation means those facts and circumstances that you think could reduce the severity of
recommendations made by this Board. You may submit any evidence you desire to the hearing to
consider, including sworn or unsworn statements, affidavits, certificates, or stipulations.
However, this is not an adversarial hearing. However, it is a full discussion of the circumstances
that took place. You will be permitted to explore the information that is presented.
CHAIR: In order for the YIP to find you guilty of the alleged offense(s), two-thirds of the
Hearing members present at this meeting must cast their vote as Guilty. If two-thirds of the
Hearing members present do not cast their vote as Guilty, then the YIP must find you Not Guilty
of the alleged offense(s). Regardless of the outcome of this Hearing, the YIP’s findings and/or
recommendations will be submitted to the installation commander or designee for approval. It
will be him alone that makes the final decision on the imposition of sanctions, if any.

discussion of these questions between the juvenile and Hearing members, or your admission of
misconduct, you will be given the opportunity to present evidence in defense. As I advised you
earlier, you do not have to make a statement yourself, nor can any inference be drawn from your
silence.

actions:
         a. Sponsor counseling
