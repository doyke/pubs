                                           Chapter 1

                                  POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction. This AFI provides guidance on AFFOR staff organization, processes, and
training to accomplish assigned missions. It describes basic and tailored organizational
constructs which the commander Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) may use to accomplish his/her
role as the Air Force service component commander assigned or attached to a joint force
commander (JFC) at the unified combatant command, subunified command, or joint task force
(JTF) level. When directed by the JFC, the Air Force service component commander and staff
will be prepared to accomplish the tasks of the Combined/Joint Force Air Component
Commander (C/JFACC), Joint Special Operations Air Component Commander (JSOACC), Area
Air Defense Commander (AADC), Airspace Control Authority (ACA), Space Coordinating
Authority (SCA), joint electronic warfare coordinator, and form the core of a Joint Task Force
Headquarters (JTF HQ) IAW Joint Pub (JP) 3-33, Joint Task Force Headquarters. During
smaller-scale contingencies or day-to-day operations, the COMAFFOR may choose not to
employ some of the capabilities or teams described herein. However, if a team or process is
employed then this guidance will apply with the various AFFOR staff constructs defined in this
publication, unless a deviation has been granted by AF/A3O-CS or other designated authority.
The function of the AFFOR staff is to support the COMAFFOR in service component functions.
They assist the COMAFFOR in Theater Security Cooperation, joint and combined exercises,
campaign planning, force bed-down and sustainment activities. The AFFOR staff is also
responsible for operational and administrative support functions IAW PAD 06-09. The AFFOR
staff consists of a command element, A-staff (A1 through A9), and a personal staff. This AFI
outlines the AFFOR staff organizational structure and distinct responsibilities. Other functional
and specialty processes, not provided in this AFI, may be prescribed based on combatant
command (CCMD) operations and activities.
1.2. General.
     1.2.1. Readiness Reporting. AFFOR staff readiness is reported IAW AFI 10-252, Defense
     Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).
     1.2.2. Higher headquarters (HHQ) inspections and staff assistance visits (SAV). HHQs
     inspections will be scheduled and conducted IAW AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection

     1.2.3. Manning. The AFFOR staff must be properly established to support all phase 0/1
     requirements in accordance with Guidance for Employment of the Force/Joint Strategic
     Capabilities Plan. The AFFOR staff must establish responsive active and Air Reserve
     Component (ARC) augmentation to provide exercise and contingency support across the full
     range of military operations. The Air Force Component Headquarters (AFCHQ) must be
     prepared to use available resources until augmentation arrives and is integrated, making
     maximum use of total force integration (TFI), and support relationships. Personnel should be
     designated and formally trained to support assigned missions.

           AIR FORCE COMPONENT HEADQUARTERS ORGANIZATION

2.1. Introduction. The Air Force component is responsible for supporting combatant
commander requirements across the range of military operations and at all levels of war
(strategic, operational and tactical). A C-MAJCOM or C-NAF will be the Air Force component
to each unified combatant command. Organizational variances in Figure 1 should be specified in
a unit supplement to this AFI.
   2.1.1. C-MAJCOM. The C-MAJCOM is the AFCHQ (Table 1). A C-MAJCOM will
   normally be organized and function similar to one of the examples listed below.
       2.1.1.1. Case 1. The C-MAJCOM is the senior AFCHQ and is commanded by the
       COMAFFOR. The C-MAJCOM includes the supporting staff (C-MAJCOM staff), one
       or more C-NAFs (with an AOC or applicable operations center (OC) and AFFOR staff)
       and all assigned and attached forces. The C-MAJCOM staff supports the AF component
       commander at the strategic level in developing policy, formulating strategic level
       guidance, conducting administrative management functions, and executing (through the
       C-NAF where applicable) combatant commander (CCDR) Title 10 responsibilities to
       organize and train assigned and attached forces to accomplish CCDR assigned missions.
       The C-MAJCOM will integrate, at the strategic level, component activities across all
       phases of conflict, with a primary focus on phases 0 (shape) and 1 (deter). The C-
       MAJCOM will minimize its role in managing Service Secretary assigned Title 10
       functions (e.g., organize, train, equip, etc.) as necessary when these roles do not directly
       contribute to the C-MAJCOM’s ability to support phase 0/1 operational mission
       requirements or impact the AFCHQ staff’s ability to support the combatant commanders.
       The C-MAJCOM staff should not duplicate the functions of the C-NAF AFFOR staff or
       AOC. When the C-NAF is part of the C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF, with its AOC/OC and
       AFFOR staff, is the primary operational level headquarters element designed to support
       the AF component commander through the range of military operations. The C-NAF
       commander will be prepared to provide command and control of those forces in
       contingency operations as a COMAFFOR, JFACC and/or JTF/CC as required.
Note: Some MAJCOMs are both C-MAJCOMs and Lead MAJCOMs and must support both
CCDR and SECAF functions respectively.
       2.1.1.2. Case 1a. The C-MAJCOM is a matrixed staff (C-MAJCOM personnel are
       trained and capable of conducting Title 10 duties and AFFOR duties), includes one C-
       NAF (with and AOC) and all assigned and attached forces and supports two combatant
       commanders.
       2.1.1.3. Case 2. The C-MAJCOM is the sole AFCHQ and accomplishes required
       AFCHQ functions. The C-MAJCOM will include a C-MAJCOM staff, an AFFOR staff,
       and an AOC (or applicable OC). C-MAJCOM Commanders may elect to combine C-
       MAJCOM and C-NAF functions within one headquarters to achieve enhanced efficiency,
       effectiveness or responsiveness to Combatant Commands.
Note: While most CCMDs only have one C-MAJCOM assigned as the AF component (only one
COMAFFOR at the AF component level), USSTRATCOM has two AF components (two
 12                                                            AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014


COMAFFORs); AFGSC and AFSPC. Although this violates the doctrinal principle of a single
COMAFFOR for each JFC, unity of command is preserved by mission area deconfliction.
AFGSC is the AF component for global strike and AFSPC is the AF component for space and
cyber. AFSPC/CC is the COMAFFOR for assigned or attached AF space and cyber forces,
while AFGSC/CC is the COMAFFOR for assigned or attached strike forces. Further, a
subunified command has been established under USSTRATCOM, United States Cyber
Command (USCYBERCOM). AFCYBER (24 AF) is the Air Force component to
USCYBERCOM and AFCYBER/CC is the COMAFFOR for Air Force forces under the
operational control of USCYBERCOM. It is the responsibility of each COMAFFOR to ensure
sufficient integration and no unnecessary duplication of effort between the multiple AFFOR
staffs.
   2.1.2. C-NAF. The C-NAF is the AF component to specific combatant commands that
   supports the MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM as the AF component (Table 1).
       2.1.2.1. Case 3. When the C-NAF is the component to the unified combatant command
       (Table 1, case 3), the C-NAF commander is the COMAFFOR, and provides all
       component support across the range of military operations at the strategic, operational
       and tactical levels as described above for the C-MAJCOM and C-NAF.
Note: Refer to AFFOR C2 Enabling Concept for more discussion on Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3.

2.2. AFFOR Staff. The AFFOR staff comprises assigned and attached personnel tailored to the
specific needs of the COMAFFOR. A command section, personal staff, A-staff and a variety of
cross-functional teams may be used to support the COMAFFOR. The AFFOR staff coordinates
across the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF, AOC/OC when assigned, and with the CCMD staff as required,
to help fulfill the COMAFFOR’s full range of responsibilities and to synchronize overall Service
component staff efforts within the COMAFFOR’s battle rhythm. Depending upon level/type of
mission, configure each AFFOR staff appropriately and integrate various disciplines in a cross-
functional team approach for planning and execution.

Note: AMC, AFSPC, AFGSC, USAFE-AFAFRICA, and PACAF have their AFFOR staff
embedded in the MAJCOM staff.
   2.2.1. Command Section. The command section is comprised of the chief of staff (CS) and
   command chief master sergeant. A commander support staff (CSS) may be established under
   the supervision of the CS. See Chapter 3 of this document for a list of command section staff
   responsibilities.

  staff responsibilities.
  2.2.3. The AFFOR staff requires highly qualified and experienced leadership in its key
  positions. Experience and grade requirements should apply as follows:
     2.2.3.1. The AFFOR staff chief of staff should be a general officer or of the rank
     commensurate to command responsibility.
     2.2.3.2. A-staff director positions should be an experience level commensurate to the
     scope of the position. Hiring authorities can consider graduated group or wing
     commanders depending on the scope of mission and responsibility.

                             AFFOR STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Introduction. Air Force component tasks and responsibilities may include command
section support, public affairs office, protocol office, legal section, strategic level theater security
cooperation planners, and base operating support liaisons (as required to ensure the component
receives the required support). The AFFOR staff must establish processes to ensure integration
with the CCMD staff, other service component staffs, the C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF, partner
nations, governmental and non-governmental agencies for all phases of military operations.
Command relationships should be highlighted. Perhaps the greatest single challenge for the
AFCHQs is the transition to contingency/combat ops. Establishing a sound transition plan to
include command structures prior to a crisis scenario is essential to continuity of operations. As
an example, the formation/reception of new units (coalition, joint, service) within a theater and
the ability to effectively command and control those units is an essential element of planning.
The AFFOR staff’s primary function is to support the COMAFFOR at the operational level as
the Air Force service component to a JFC.
3.2. AFFOR Staff. The AFFOR staff, in coordination with the AOC/OC, supports USAF
requirements and integrates air component capabilities into the CCDR’s joint force planning.
The AFFOR staff implements and establishes COMAFFOR policies and procedures
(supplemental to CCDR policies and procedures) within the theater of operations. The AFFOR
staff also plans, organizes, conducts and assesses steady-state campaign activities in support of
the CCDR’s campaign plan and conducts service, joint and multinational exercises. Refer to
members designated to perform these functions as ASO or ASP.
                                        Command Section
   3.2.1. The Chief of Staff (CS). The CS is a member of the C-MAJCOM or C-NAF,
   AFFOR staff, command section and coordinates, prioritizes and promulgates the
   COMAFFOR direction for the daily activities of the AFFOR staff. The CS responsibilities
   include:
       3.2.1.1. Approve actions, orders, and plans, as authorized by the COMAFFOR.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure COMAFFOR decisions and concepts are implemented by directing and
       assigning staff responsibilities.
       3.2.1.3. Formulate staff policies, review staff actions for adequacy and proper
       coordination, and ensure required liaison is established with the JFC, host nations,
       supporting agencies and commands, as well as the other components.
       3.2.1.4. Act as COMAFFOR’s commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR)
       process manager.
       3.2.1.5. Coordinate between the AFFOR staff and AOC to de-conflict HHQ taskings
       (MAJCOM, Air Staff and CCDR staff).
       3.2.1.6. Approve COMAFFOR daily operations cycle or battle rhythm.
       3.2.1.7. Provide support and guidance toward synchronizing and integrating operational
       planning processes.

        3.2.1.8. Manage Air Force component Knowledge Operations Management (KOM)
        processes and appoint a knowledge management officer (KMO).
Note: The Joint Enabling Command (JECC) KOM TTP appendix E contains a KMO
qualifications checklist (located on the AFFOR community of practice [CoP]). This TTP
suggests the KMO be an O-4 equivalent staff officer, with operations, planning, and intelligence
experience/background.
            3.2.1.8.1. Knowledge Management Officer. The KMO coordinates processes
            between staffs and ensures accurate and focused information is delivered in a timely
            manner. The KMO coordinates actions and processes to satisfy essential information
            needs. Under the direction of the CS, the KMO works closely with higher HQ KMOs
            to ensure required reports are up-channeled and consistent with the COMAFFOR
            battle rhythm. The KMO leads the knowledge management staff to perform the
            below functions:
            3.2.1.8.2. The KMO functions as the Air Force component chief KMO.

            appropriate for use during exercises and contingencies and provide functional
            oversight and support to the KMO for the Air Force component to include the AOC.
            3.2.1.8.5. Use commander’s CCIRs, request for information (RFI) procedures and
            collaborative planning tools to ensure information is translated into focused
            knowledge that facilitates decision making.
            3.2.1.8.6. Coordinate with the JTF KMO, joint knowledge management board, and
            other component KMOs, as well as publish the COMAFFOR’s KMP.

                                             Chapter 4

                                  AFFOR STAFF OPERATIONS

4.1. Overview. The AFFOR staff uses tools, systems and processes to ensure complete
integration with theater capability providers to assist the COMAFFOR in exercising C2 of Air
Force forces. This chapter prescribes AFFOR staff processes that support operational level C2.
4.2. Operational Planning. The COMAFFOR uses the Joint Operation Planning Process for
Air (JOPPA) found in AFDD 3-0, Operations and Planning and JP 3-30, Command and Control
of Joint Air Operations to assist the CCDR in developing OPLANs/CONPLANs/campaign plans
to guide forces made available to accomplish missions assigned by the JFC. For crisis action
planning or execution, the COMAFFOR relies on the OPG (figure 2) to explore the full range of
adversary and friendly options and to analyze and compare friendly air, space and cyberspace
capabilities. Both the OPG and LRPG must occur in a collaborative manner with the AOC/OC
and other components. Team composition (e.g., numbers, specialties, and skill levels) is tailored
to unique mission demands for geographic and functional CCMD’s.
       4.2.1. OPG. The OPG is typically led by the A3 or the division with the expertise on the
       subject/situation being discussed/analyzed and is responsible for translating strategic
       direction into operational requirements and tactical action. Smaller planning teams (e.g.,
       operational planning team [OPT], battle staff, etc.) may be formed to support operations
       (e.g., crisis/contingency response, forward deployed C2 operations, etc.). Operational
       planning applies Air Force resources with joint/multinational/interagency effort for current
       and iterative action to achieve the desired end state. The OPG develops and/or executes
       deliberate and crisis action plans to provide planning estimates for combat support and
       calculate force deployment data.
          4.2.1.1. The OPG is formed to provide the COMAFFOR with operationally relevant
          planning information.
          4.2.1.2. The OPG recommends force application and movement, maintains situational
          awareness, and develops responsive COAs and adaptive plans in support of C2 of Air
          Force assets.
       4.2.2. LRPG. The LRPG is led by the A5 and consists of a cross-functional team
       established to help integrate complex contingency and steady state plan elements.
       Individuals from the staff are detailed, not assigned, to support the LRPG and should have
       the skills necessary to help the A5 refine the commander’s estimate, develop COAs, and
       recommend forces for execution of the COAs.
Note: Some planning functions do not apply to functional CCMD’s component staff. For
example, AMC may not write OPLANs/CONPLANs as a component of USTRANSCOM.
However, AMC may write annexes or support plans to the CCDR’s plans.
       4.2.3. The AFFOR Staff OPG/LRPG provides support as required to the AOC strategy
       division to develop the joint air operations plan (JAOP). The AFFOR staff develops Air
       Force component OPLANs, OPORDs, and other plans and orders.
AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                         39


Figure 2. OPG/LRPG Composition.




   4.2.4. Campaign Planning. The AFFOR staff will develop a COMAFFOR campaign
   support plan and individual USAF country support plans to support CCDR theater campaign
   plans and will include the enterprise related activities in these plans that are required to
   achieve theater and individual country objectives.
4.3. Operations. The Air Force component commander, as COMAFFOR, C/JFACC or (if
designated) air-centric JTF/CC, executes C2 of assigned/attached forces across the full ROMO
(table 2). Responsibilities include:
   4.3.1. Manage USAF requirements for the CCDR’s execution of force flow.
   4.3.2. Provide timely total force accountability and force closure visibility at the tactical and
   operational level for all AFFOR theater force beddown locations.
   4.3.3. Ensure readiness of assigned/attached forces through exercises and assessments.
   4.3.4. Provide oversight and guidance on the sustainment and resupply of assigned and
   attached forces.
   4.3.5. Interface with USAF commands as necessary to ensure assigned/attached forces are
   trained, organized and equipped to conduct theater operations.

   4.3.7. Provide reachback support to deployed teams conducting security cooperation
   activities.
4.4. Command and Control (C2). The COMAFFOR will always retain the AFFOR staff C2
capability. The AFFOR staff supports the COMAFFOR with uninterrupted collection,
integration, synchronization, and fusion of operational data. The Air Force component C2
processes are executed through an arrangement of personnel, telecommunications and computing
technology, facilities, systems, and procedures employed by the COMAFFOR through planning,
directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the
mission.
      4.4.1. COMAFFOR’s Decision Cycle. The AFFOR staff contributes to the COMAFFOR’s
      decision cycle by participating in activities directed in AFPD 13-1, Command and Control
      Enterprise depicted in figure 3 and defined in JP 3-33, Joint Task Force Headquarters.
AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                       41


Figure 3. COMAFFOR’s Decision Cycle.




      4.4.1.1. Monitor. The AFFOR staff monitors ongoing activities that may impact the
      operational area or future operations. The current plan or plans is/are the standard for
      measuring ongoing activities. Although staff members monitor their individual staff
      functions to maintain current staff estimates, the preponderance of inputs come from the
      AOC/OC, logistical support representatives, DoD agencies, and host-nation
      representatives. Outputs of monitoring provide inputs for the assessment process. These
      outputs are communicated throughout this cycle, within the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF and
      with higher, lateral, and subordinate commands. Individual functional monitoring is
      merged into a common operational picture to enable the Commander to assess and
      determine new efforts or to prioritize ongoing efforts. The AFFOR staff typically
      monitors:
         4.4.1.1.1. CCIRs and RFIs.
         4.4.1.1.2. Operational situation.
         4.4.1.1.3. Critical subordinate unit actions.
         4.4.1.1.4. Critical supporting force actions.
         4.4.1.1.5. Protection information throughout the force (threat levels and threat
         warnings).
         4.4.1.1.6. Unit strength, current and projected.
         4.4.1.1.7. Adversary actions and reactions.
         4.4.1.1.8. Logistics status.
         4.4.1.1.9. Status of national, theater, and organic intelligence and intelligence-related
         assets.
         4.4.1.1.10. ACS capability thresholds.
42                                                             AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014


        4.4.1.1.11. Status of communications systems (confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability).
     4.4.1.2. Assess. The AFFOR staff judges progress in designated mission areas as
     measured against the plan to assess impact of events as they relate to overall mission
     accomplishment. These judgments allow the COMAFFOR and the AFFOR staff to
     determine where adjustments must be made to operations and serve as a catalyst for
     planning. Key tenets of the assessment process are:
        4.4.1.2.1. Measuring the overall effectiveness of forces and capabilities during
        military operations, using measures of performance (MOPs) and measures of
        effectiveness (MOEs).
        4.4.1.2.2. Assessing the progress toward accomplishing a task, creating an effect, or
        achieving an objective, using MOPs and MOEs.
        4.4.1.2.3. Analyzing the security, effectiveness, and potential of an existing or
        planned intelligence activity.
        4.4.1.2.4. Judging the motives, qualifications, and characteristics of present or
        prospective enemy forces.
     4.4.1.3. Plan. During planning, the commander and staff make adjustments to the
     current plan or develop new plans with the purpose of successful completion of the
     broader mission. Commander’s planning guidance normally follows mission analysis
     and sets the conditions for successful COA development. It provides the staff insight into
     how the commander wants to plan and conduct operations. As the staff continues to plan,
     the commander provides additional guidance such as refining COAs, identifying items
     requiring further analysis, or modifying parts of the draft OPORD. For more information
     on planning, refer to JP 5-0, Joint Operations Planning.
        4.4.1.3.1. The AFFOR staff supports the AOC/OC strategy plans team during
        strategy development and other planning processes.
        4.4.1.3.2. The AFFOR staff assesses potential impacts to beddown decisions, impacts
        of TPFDD, feasibility, and force closure estimates.
     4.4.1.4. Execute. The execution process converts the commander’s decisions into
     effective action by subordinate organizations.         Execute functions may occur
     independently or in parallel with AOC/OC operations (e.g., execute plans such as force
     beddown). This direction is done with the broader purpose of achieving the overall
     mission. The outputs of the execution process allow the COMAFFOR to direct actions to
     ensure that current orders and directives are completed as intended. The AFFOR staff
     supports operational missions by:
        4.4.1.4.1. Guiding the AFFOR toward mission accomplishment.
        4.4.1.4.2. Making recommendations to assign missions.
        4.4.1.4.3. Making COA recommendations defined during planning (COMAFFOR’s
        battle rhythm and decision cycle).
        4.4.1.4.4. Prioritizing and allocating resources.
AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                       43


           4.4.1.4.5. Assessing and mitigating risks.
           4.4.1.4.6. Assessing the situation and deciding when and how to make adjustments.
           4.4.1.4.7. Synchronizing out-of-theater support to the joint AOC’s or OC’s
           intelligence efforts.
           4.4.1.4.8. Making recommendations to organize assigned and/or allocated/attached
           forces.
           4.4.1.4.9. Making recommendations to synchronize/de-conflict the actions of
           subordinate commanders.
   4.4.2. COMAFFOR’s Battle Rhythm. The method to setting an operations tempo is referred
   to as battle rhythm. The JTF headquarters establishes a battle rhythm and, within this, the
   COMAFFOR and subordinate commanders nest their battle rhythm. The battle rhythm is
   regulated by the flow and sharing of information that support the commander’s decision
   cycle. The COMAFFOR’s battle rhythm consists of the scheduling of a series of meetings,
   report due times, and other activities. The AOC/OC director and A-staff chief/director of
   staff collaborates to develop a synchronized battle rhythm to provide the commander a
   timeline for receiving critical information and establish set decision points on which to
   operate. The chief/director of staff is the OPR for managing battle rhythm.
       4.4.2.1. The AFFOR staff supports the COMAFFOR’s battle rhythm by requesting
       information updates and providing data to:
           4.4.2.1.1. Plan the most effective use of assigned, attached and supporting forces to
           achieve the JFC’s strategic, operational, and tactical objectives.
           4.4.2.1.2. Deploy, beddown, and sustain forces when and wherever needed to
           conduct the full range of military operations.
           4.4.2.1.3. Disengage, redeploy, and reconstitute forces as needed.
           4.4.2.1.4. Submit reports based on situations and as required by Air Force directives.
           4.4.2.1.5. Develop strategy and planning documents from phase 0 through phase 5
           that meet COMAFFOR objectives and guidance.
           4.4.2.1.6. Conduct operational-level assessments to determine mission and overall
           effectiveness as required by the JFC to support the theater assessment.
           4.4.2.1.7. Develop COA alternatives for the COMAFFOR.
           4.4.2.1.8. Communicate capabilities to fully integrate strategic and operational
           planning and execution processes to ensure consistency between intent and effect.
4.5. Air Force Component Reporting. The C-MAJCOM and C-NAF staffs processes and
creates various reports that are essential for effective C2 of air and space forces. AFI 10-206,
Operational Reporting, provides guidance on operational reporting.
   4.5.1. The Air Force operational reporting system (AFOREPS) provides AF and
   intermediate commands with information necessary to make timely operational decisions.
   Within AFOREPS, operational report type-3 (OPREP-3) is used to immediately notify
 44                                                             AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014


   commanders of any significant event or incident that should rise to the attention of
   MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or DoD.
   4.5.2. A commander’s situation report (SITREP) is used to send information in one direction
   to enable senior echelons to directly support forces, enable service management during
   adverse situations, and enable HHQs to advocate solutions. The tactical/operational situation
   dictates the level of Air Force component staff participation in formulating the SITREP.
4.6. COMAFFOR Support Capabilities.
   4.6.1. Agile Combat Support (ACS). The AFFOR staff utilizes tools, systems and
   processes to manage theater-wide apportionment, allocation and distribution of resources in
   support of operational requirements. ACS provides capabilities to support operational
   missions at the C-MAJCOM and C-NAF. At the tactical level, commanders and their staffs
   forecast the consumption of resources associated with conducting operations over extended
   distance and time. Refer to attachment 4 for a link to the AFFOR C2 Toolkit which includes
   ACS systems utilized by the AFFOR staff. ACS systems support phase 0 through phase 5
   operations and provide a key component of AFFOR staff support. If required, the
   COMAFFOR should identify an organization on the Air Force component to lead ACS
   integration and synchronization.

                        AFFOR STAFF READINESS AND TRAINING

5.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance for Air Force component and designated
ARC AFFOR staff training programs. It establishes training policy, management criteria, and
administrative practices required for personnel to achieve and maintain ASO and ASP
certifications. For the purposes of training, the AFFOR staff is not considered a weapons system.
    5.1.1. AFFOR Staff Officer. The ASO is responsible for mission planning, monitoring,
    execution, and assessment on behalf of the COMAFFOR through an arrangement of
    personnel, telecommunications and computing technology, facilities, systems, and
    procedures. The ASO should be trained and certified to develop COMAFFOR strategy,
    conduct operational planning, develop campaign plans, and execute operations.
    5.1.2. AFFOR Staff Planner. The ASP is responsible for translating strategic direction into
    operational requirements and tactical action; applying AF resources and then synchronizing
    with the joint/coalition/interagency effort through concurrent and iterative action to achieve
    the desired end state. The ASP must be knowledgeable in major aspects of Air Force, or Air
    Force portions of joint war, mobilization, and contingency plans. The ASP should be trained
    and certified to develop and/or execute campaign/contingency plans to achieve strategic
    objectives within theaters or other operational areas.
    5.1.3. The AF component OPR approves unit training objectives for AFFOR staff training
    (AFGSC/A3O; AFSPC/A3O; AFSOC/A3O; AMC/A3C; PACAF/A3O; USAFE-
    AFAFRICA/A3C; 1 AF (AFNORTH)/A3T; 7 AF (AFKOR)/A3T; 12 AF (AFSOUTH)/A3C
    and USAFCENT/A3T in coordination with HQ ACC/A3C. NGB/A3YH is the OPR for ANG
    training and AFRC/A3T is OPR for AFRES training. ARC training requirements should be
    based on the gaining Air Force component training programs.
Note: Due to the nature of their organizational structure and differing processes, functional Air
Force component staff training program requirements should be addressed in functional
MAJCOM/unit supplements.
5.2. Individual Training Waivers. AF/A3O delegates individual training waiver authority to
AFGSC/A3; AFSOC/A3; AFSPC/A3; AMC/A3; PACAF/A3O; USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3; and
ACC/A3. ARC aligned units submit individual training waivers through NGB/A3Y or
AFRC/A3T.
5.3. AFFOR Staff Training. The AFFOR staff training program is a sequential phased
program required to attain and maintain certification status. Training may involve online courses,
MTTs, on-the-job training with applicable SMEs, classroom academics, or self-study. Training
phases are ICT, MCT, and CT.
    5.3.1. AFFOR Staff Directors. AFFOR staff directors (A1-9), deputy directors, chiefs of
    staff, command chiefs, senior level personal staff will complete training at first opportunity,
    preferably before assignment but NLT 6 months after assignment to Air Force component.
    5.3.2. Designated A5 or A8 personnel should attend JCIDS training provided by the Defense
    Acquisition University (DAU).
 46                                                             AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014


   5.3.3. Initial Certification Training.
       5.3.3.1. Definition. ICT is the first phase of the AFFOR staff training program designed
       to provide baseline knowledge on operational level planning and AFFOR staff functions.
       5.3.3.2. Purpose. ICT provides minimal baseline training of newly assigned AFFOR staff
       by presenting foundational knowledge in order to provide the COMAFFOR with
       specialized expertise to support Air Force operational missions and activities.
       5.3.3.3. ICT Methodology. ICT requirements are met once the trainee completes the on-
       line AFFOR staff training or modules 1-4 of the USAF Steady-State Campaign Support
       Planners’ Course.
Note: Members are not eligible for ASO/ASP designations until after ICT requirements have
been completed.
          5.3.3.3.1. For ASP (A3, A5 and A8) personnel assigned to a security cooperation,
          and/or steady-state campaign support planning billet, the complete USAF Steady-
          State Campaign Support Planners’ Course is required to meet ICT requirements. Air
          Force component OPRs will designate personnel for training.
          5.3.3.3.2. ICT is required for personnel identified on the UMD to ensure only trained
          personnel are matched to those positions.
          5.3.3.3.3. ICT is required for ARC aligned personnel to ensure units are trained to
          support augmentation in an AF component if required.
       5.3.3.4. ICT Timeline. ICT should be complete not later than (NLT) 45 days from date
       assigned to ASO or ASP position. ICT must be completed within 120 days of entry into
       training for active duty personnel and 12 months for ARC personnel.
       5.3.3.5. Certification.
          5.3.3.5.1. Certify ICT complete for ASO at the completion of initial training.
          5.3.3.5.2. Certify ICT complete for ASP at the completion of USAF Steady-State
          Campaign Support Planners’ Course.
   5.3.4. Mission Certification Training.
       5.3.4.1. Definition. MCT is theater-specific training or functional training designed to
       prepare the AFFOR staff to accomplish Air Force component assigned missions. In
       addition, MCT provides training in those processes and functions identified in chapter 4
       of this AFI. Air Force component OPRs (AFGSC/A3O; AFSPC/A3O; AFSOC/A3O;
       AMC/A3C; PACAF/A3O; USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C; 1AF (AFNORTH)/A3T; 7AF
       (AFKOR)/A3T; 12AF (AFSOUTH)/A3C and USAFCENT/A3T) are responsible for the
       C-MAJCOM/C-NAF MCT program. NGB/A3YH and AFRC/A3T are OPRs for ARC
       training.
       5.3.4.2. Purpose. MCT provides the training necessary to certify or recertify AFFOR
       staff for ASO/ASP positions. Completion of MCT is a prerequisite for either the ASO or
       ASP SEI.
AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                   47


     5.3.4.3. Methodology. During MCT, ASO and ASP personnel receive certifications and
     designations. MCT may involve tailored training and on-the-job training with applicable
     SMEs, classroom academics, self-study, and practice as necessary.
     5.3.4.4. MCT Timeline.
        5.3.4.4.1. AFFOR Staff Officer. AFFOR staff identified for ASO may be certified
        MCT complete after completing Air Force component theater specific or functional
        component training programs.
        5.3.4.4.2. AFFOR Staff Planner. ASP may be certified MCT complete after
        completing courses identified in paragraph 5.3.4.5.3.
        5.3.4.4.3. Start MCT for regular Air Force (RegAF) NLT 45 days from ICT
        completion. MCT must be complete within 180 days of start of MCT.
        5.3.4.4.4. Start MCT for ARC NLT 90 days after ICT and must be completed NLT
        365 days after training start.
        5.3.4.4.5. MCT is complete when all unit training requirements are met.
     5.3.4.5. SEI Award.
        5.3.4.5.1. ASO (AO1) SEI Award. ASO personnel may be awarded SEI (AO1) upon
        completion of MCT training.
        5.3.4.5.2. ASP Planner (AP1) SEI Award. AFFOR staff planner certification is
        mandatory for A5 and designated A2 and A3 personnel. Certified/SEI designated
        planners provide the COMAFFOR flexibility in developing strategy, long range plans
        and operational plans for Air Force operations and activities.
        5.3.4.5.3. AP1 SEI Award. ASP personnel may be awarded SEI (AP1) upon
        completion of ICT, MCT and the additional courses listed below. Awarding of the
        SEI will be accomplished by respective MAJCOM A1s IAW this AFI or applicable
        directives.
            5.3.4.5.3.1. CWPC for A-Staff A5 and designated A2 and A3 personnel
            (recommended for all other A-Staff)
            5.3.4.5.3.2. JAOPC for A-Staff A5 and designated A2 and A3 personnel
            (recommended for all other A-Staff)
            5.3.4.5.3.3. Joint Operations Planning and Execution (JOPES) Support Planner
            Course (JSPC)
  5.3.5. Continuation Training (CT).
     5.3.5.1. Definition. CT provides ASO and ASP with the mix of training necessary to
     maintain proficiency in assigned staff positions. CT begins after the member is certified
     ASO/ASP.
     5.3.5.2. Purpose. CT accomplishes two purposes: maintaining ASO/ASP certification
     (MCT status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT is the
     COMAFFOR’s tool to ensure that ASO and ASP members are prepared to support
     CCDR and COMAFFOR as required at all times.
 48                                                                 AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014


         5.3.5.3. Methodology. Annual exercise participation is required for ASO/ASP and
         mission certified ARC personnel. This requirement may be met by participating in a real
         world planning event as ASO/ASP. Units may supplement this CT requirement.
         5.3.5.4. CT Timeline.
            5.3.5.4.1. CT requirements begin NLT 30 days after the individual is certified
            ASO/ASP.
            5.3.5.4.2. CT requirements specific to functional AFFOR staff is addressed in
            unit/MAJCOM supplement.
            5.3.5.4.3. ARC units accomplish CT training over a one-year period.
      5.3.6. Training Exceptions.
         5.3.6.1. Training Extension. Parent MAJCOMs approve individual training extensions
         (IAW paragraph 5.2). An O-6 or equivalent may grant a one-time 30-day extension (180
         days for ARC units) for the extension. If the unit level extension lapses, the commander
         or designated representative has three options: Re-enter the individual into training
         (restart the clock), re-assign the member to a non-operational level staff function, or
         allow the individual to continue duties for 180 days and complete training requirements
         with a waiver requested through Air Force component OPR for AFFOR staff training.
         All options are mandatory reporting items to the AF component OPR.
         5.3.6.2. Extension Methodology. Based upon recommendation of the training manager
         and supervisor, the commander or designated representative may grant a one-time
         training extension (30 AC/180 ARC), allow the individual to continue duties with a
         waiver IAW waiver limits established in 5.3.6.1., or take appropriate action to remove the
         individual from ASO/ASP duties. Maintain all waivers in the individual’s training
         record. If no waiver is granted, the Air Force component/CC or designated representative
         may take appropriate action to remove the individual from the ASO/ASP position.
         Individuals with waivers subsequently assigned to other Air Force components should be
         reevaluated for reentry into training or extension of that waiver within 30 days of arrival.
         The commander or designated representative may direct a downgrade of an AFFOR staff
         member’s training status if he/she deems circumstances warrant it. The individual should
         then re-enter the directed level of training with the same time requirements from that
         downgrade date. Removal from ASO/ASP duties may include coordinating reassignment
         within the Air Force component to another duty position.
5.4. Training Documentation.
   5.4.1. ASO/ASP Documentation. Document all training and maintain training records to
   include the following milestones: date assigned station, training start dates, ICT and MCT
   training dates, ICT graduation/completion date, MCT training completion date, deployment
   dates and CT, and any other significant training dates. For example, AF Form 4141 or 4142
   may be used to annotate training milestones.
         5.4.1.1. ARC aligned units maintain their own records.
   5.4.2. Maintain a copy of all waivers in an individual’s training records.
AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                   49


   5.4.3. Use the official memorandum format established in Air Force Handbook 33-337,
   Tongue and Quill for mandatory reporting.
5.5. Reportable Items to MAJCOM OPR.
   5.5.1. ICT timeline exceeded (including extensions). Training managers report actions taken
   quarterly.
   5.5.2. MCT failure to progress. Training managers report action taken quarterly.
   5.5.3. Training limiting factors (LIMFACS) and shortfalls to include CT: Training managers
   report LIMFACS and shortfalls annually.
 50                                                               AFI13-103 19 AUGUST 2014

AFFOR Staff Toolkit:

The AFFOR staff C2 Toolkit consists of systems/applications identified by the AFFOR staffs
required to support the COMAFFOR in exercising C2 of assigned and attached forces.
Additionally there are tailored breakouts by: individual staff areas (e.g., AFNORTH/A1 Toolkit),
C-MAJCOM/C-NAF (e.g., AFNORTH Toolkit), an overall staff area (e.g., A1 Toolkit), or by
functional category (e.g., Munitions - Management). ACC/A5C maintains version control of the
toolkit and facilitates the annual validation by the AFFOR staff. AFCHQ (C-MAJCOM/C-
NAFs) staff areas (A1-A9 and PS) are responsible for coordinating updates or changes in tool
usage with ACC/A5C. For further information and to access the AFFOR staff C2 toolkit and
tailored breakouts, select the link below to the AFFOR SharePoint and open the Toolkit

    RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE CONSULTED INFORMED (RACI) MATRIX

The Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) matrix identifies major stakeholders
for providing DOTMLPF-P solutions to the AFFOR C2 program. This is a high-level matrix; a
more detailed RACI matrix may be needed to breakdown tasks/functions within a particular
organization.




Legend for key responsibilities:
Responsible [R]: Those who complete the task and are responsible for action / implementation.
Accountable [A] (Approver or final Approving Authority): The agency ultimately answerable
for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one from whom
“responsible” is delegated the work. In other words, an “accountable” must sign off (approve) on
work that “responsible” provides. This includes ""yes"" or ""no"" authority and veto power.
"There must be only one “accountable” specified for each task or deliverable.
Consulted [C] (sometimes “counsel”): They are to be consulted prior to a final decision or action.
Input from the designated position is required.
Informed [I]: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or
deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication. The one who needs
information after a decision or action is taken.
