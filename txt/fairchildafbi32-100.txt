This instruction establishes procedures for implementing best management practices and pollution pre-
vention measures for aircraft deicing and anti-icing operations. It outlines the regulatory compliance
responsibilities of personnel involved in the deicer application process. This instruction applies to all 92d
Air Refueling Wing organizations and tenants, the 141st Air Refueling Wing, Washington Air National
Guard and all transient aircraft and their crews. Maintain and dispose of records according to the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule, accessible on-line at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/.


1. RESPONSIBLITIES:
   1.1. 92d Civil Engineer Squadron Environmental Flight (92 CES/CEV):
       1.1.1. Identify federal, state and local regulations/policies applicable to air and ground crews with
       regard to aircraft deicing/anti-icing. Notify applicable organizations of any change in these
       requirements.
       1.1.2. Advise 92d Maintenance and 141st Maintenance Groups on best management practices for
       deicing/anti-icing aircraft as they relate to preventing contamination of groundwater and surface
       water systems.
       1.1.3. Provide training, as required or requested, on regulatory requirements impacting the deic-
       ing/anti-icing process.
       1.1.4. Review shop records required by section 2.6. on a periodic basis to determine if they are
       complete and accurate. Recommend changes for improvement and/or regulatory compliance.
       1.1.5. Inspect the deicing/anti-icing process on a periodic basis to assure compliance with envi-
       ronmental regulations.
       1.1.6. Review and update this operating instruction on an annual basis.

       1.1.7. Ensure spent deicer not used during the winter months is disposed of via a recycling com-
       pany.
    1.2. 92d Maintenance Group and 141st Maintenance Group:
       1.2.1. Ensure all personnel responsible for operating deicing equipment receive initial and annual
       aircraft deicing/anti-icing training and that the training is documented. Training will include the
       contents of this instruction as well as the references listed in Attachment 1.
       1.2.2. The aircraft maintenance production superintendent will evaluate weather conditions and
       determine if dry weather conditions exist (see Attachment 1 for definition). If so, steps will be
       taken to prevent deicing/anti-icing fluid from entering the storm water drains (see Attachment 2
       for map of affected parking stubs).
    1.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF). Evaluate personal exposure hazards associated
    with deicing/anti-icing activities and assign appropriate personal protective equipment.

2. PROCEDURES:
    2.1. The discharge of deicing/anti-icing fluids into the storm water collection system under dry
    weather conditions is strictly prohibited. Deicing/anti-icing fluid will not be allowed to flow into the
    storm drains under its own power during deicing/anti-icing applications. Storm drains in the vicinity
    of aircraft parking stubs (i.e., down gradient of deicing activity) must be in “valve closed” position
    before aircraft deicing begins (see Attachment 2 for actual drain valve locations).
    2.2. Puddles of deicer solution must be removed from the pavement with the vacuum trailer (or suit-
    able equivalent may be used). The aircraft maintenance unit performing the deicing/anti-icing opera-
    tion is responsible for removing the spent fluid. The vacuum trailer is an AR Plus T750 Ramp Ranger
    with a storage capacity of 750 gallons. The AR Plus T750 is maintained by 92 Aircraft Maintenance
    Squadron (AMXS) Raptor Flight Vehicle section. All recovered deicer must be delivered to the
    7500-gallon-capacity storage tank located in the equipment storage yard maintained by 92 CES/
    CEOH (located at the corner of Gate 35 road and Huyser St.).
       2.2.1. The quantity of deicer fluid transferred into the 7500-gallon storage tank must be recorded.
       The 92 AMXS Raptor Flight Vehicle section will maintain copies of delivery logs and provide the
       recorded data to 92 CES/CEV at the end of each month.
    2.3. Prior to applying deicing fluid, physical removal of accumulated ice and snow shall be accom-
    plished. Physical removal shall include, but not be limited to, the use of brooms, ropes, squeegees and
    hot air blasters.
    2.4. Personnel servicing deicing equipment shall be trained in the proper mixing of fluid for use. Indi-
    viduals authorized to operate deicing/anti-icing equipment shall be trained in the efficient application
    of deicer/anti-icer so as to minimize the amount of fluid applied.
    2.5. Any inadvertent spill/runoff of deicing/anti-icing fluid resulting in a flow into the storm water
    system requires immediate notification of the 92 CES Environmental Flight. 92 CES Environmental
    Flight will contact Bioenvironmental Engineering to conduct storm water detention pond sampling in
    accordance with the current multi-sector storm water permit if necessary. After duty hours, contact the
    Base Fire Department (911).
    2.6. Inspection and Record-keeping Requirements:
FAIRCHILDAFBI32-100 26 OCTOBER 2004                                                                    3


      2.6.1. All organizations responsible for applying deicer/anti-icer shall maintain records of
      monthly quantities of chemicals applied. These records shall include amounts of chemicals used,
      date, location and weather conditions at the time of application (see FAFB IMT 260, Monthly Air-
      craft Deicing Fluid Usage). Additionally, the 92 AMXS Raptor Flight Vehicle section will record
      and maintain transfer logs from the T750 Ramp Ranger to accurately account for amount of fluid
      recovered each month.
      2.6.2. Aircraft parking areas where deicing/anti-icing fluid might be applied shall be inspected at
      least once per week during chemical application periods by the owning organization supervision
      personnel. The requirements of this inspection (Attachment 3) are outlined in a sample checklist
      (Attachment 4) developed by 92 CES/CEV. Records of these inspections shall be maintained and
      submitted to 92 CES/CEV at the end of each month. Tracking or follow-up procedures shall be
      initialed by 92 CES/CEV to ensure that appropriate actions are taken in response to these inspec-
      tions.

Terms
Best Management Practice (BMP)— Work procedures/precaution that serve to eliminate or minimize
contact between deicer fluids and the surrounding environment (i.e., storm water and soil/groundwater
systems).
Deicing—The spraying of a liquid deicing agent on aircraft surfaces to remove already formed ice and
collected snow. This application lowers the freezing point of the snow/ice so that it melts.
Anti-icing—The spraying of a liquid anti-icing agent directly to aircraft surfaces before snow or ice are
present for the purpose of lowering the freezing point at which snow or ice will form.
Discharge—Includes but is not limited to any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying or
dumping of a solid or liquid substance into the environment.
Dry Weather—The absence of precipitation (i.e., rain, snow or sleet) occurring at the time of the deicing/
anti-icing process. The presence of accumulated snow or ice on the ground surface does not constitute
“precipitation occurring at the time of chemical application”.
Wet Weather—The presence of precipitation occurring at the time of the deicing/anti-icing process.
Snowmelt (occurring naturally, i.e. above 32 degrees Fahrenheit ambient) is to be considered as a

precipitation event.
Dry Weather Discharge—A release or discharge of pollutants or deicing solution into the storm water
system during periods of no precipitation, i.e. deicer fluid flowing on its own.
Pollution Prevention—Practices that reduce/eliminate the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant
or contaminant released into the environment.
Runoff—That part of precipitation, snowmelt or irrigation water that runs off into the ground or storm
water collection system. It can carry pollutants from the air and land into groundwater/surface water
systems.

         GUIDANCE CRITERIA FOR WEEKLY INSPECTION OF DEICING AREAS
Sector S of the Fairchild AFB Multi-Sector Storm water Permit requires weekly inspection of areas where
aircraft are deiced. The following criteria should be used as guidance for this inspection.
   1. Training: The primary criteria is the training of the individual carrying out the application of
      deicer/anti-icer substance. As per the requirements outlined in T.O. 42C-1-2, all personnel should
      be properly trained in application procedures, have a fundamental understanding of the chemicals
      used in this process, and be aware of the environmental precautions and procedures used to mini-
      mize environmental impact. The weekly inspection will include the validation of training for the
      individuals deicing the aircraft on any given day.
   2. Mechanical Means of Snow Removal: In order to minimize the use of chemical, check to ensure
      snow is first removed from the aircraft by mechanical means or with the use of a hot air blower.
   3. Record keeping: Deicing personnel must accurately record the amount of chemical used at each
      particular parking stub. This data will be used to gain understanding of deicer usage in various
      areas and the potential impact upon the groundwater and surface water systems.
   4. Collection of Deicer: Precautions must be taken when deicing under dry weather conditions to
      ensure there is no discharge of chemical into the storm water system. Check to ensure deicer has
      been removed from the pavement and verify that it did not inadvertently enter the storm water
      collection system.
