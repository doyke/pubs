                              DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
GENERAL. The objective of this Operating Instruction (OI) is to ensure a safe airfield
operating environment for aircraft and motor vehicle traffic. To help achieve this goal, unit
commanders should ensure personnel assigned to their units are thoroughly familiar with the
rules for operating on the airfield. Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety
standards are the primary reasons of aircraft/vehicle collisions and/or incidents involving motor
vehicles on the airfield.

All references to training for airfield drivers extend to those using any mode of motorized or self-
propelled transportation. Training is required for any person with a need to go on the airfield.

Personnel assigned duties on the airfield will be knowledgeable of and comply with the rules for
airfield driving.

Airfield experience (operating vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of airfield
driving training and testing requirements.

1.1. Wing Commander (5 BW/CC).

1.1.1. 5 BW/CC has delegated waiver authority for policies in this instruction to 5 OG/CC
except the authority to reinstate airfield driving privileges following suspension/revocation of
base driving privileges.

1.1.2. Designate personnel and agencies to support the airfield driving program.

1.1.3. May reinstate airfield driving privileges to perform mission essential duties following
suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM)
must coordinate with the Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM) to finalize reinstatement. ADPM
must provide a copy of the 5 BW/CC approval letter for record.

1.2. Unit Commander. Appoint a primary and alternate unit Airfield Driving Program
Manager (ADPM), to conduct training for all unit personnel where duties require operating a
vehicle on the airfield.

Note: See Attachment 5 for format and forward a copy to 5 OSS/A3AA, Deputy Airfield
Manager (DAFM).

1.2.1. Through their unit ADPMs, conduct training for all personnel required to drive on the
airfield.

1.2.1.1. Appointees must have duties that are performed on the airfield to qualify as ADPM, unit
trainer, or certifier.

1.2.2. Screen and carefully select unit ADPMs (primary and alternate), unit trainers, and
certifiers.
1.2.3. Through the ADPMs, ensure personnel driving on the airfield are qualified. All base
assigned personnel who operate a vehicle on the airfield must complete all training and testing
requirements.

1.2.4. Limit the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the absolute minimum
necessary to accomplish the mission.

1.2.5. Upon suspension/revocation of a unit member’s base driving privileges, suspend/revoke
the member’s airfield driving authorization and notify the unit ADPMs and DAFM in writing.

Note: Requests for reinstatement of airfield driving privileges to perform critical or mission
essential duties must be processed through the 5 BW/CC and Airfield Management (AM).

All vehicle passes must be validated annually. The AFM, DAFM and their designated
representatives are responsible for issuing vehicle passes/decals.

1.2.7. Inform personnel that each annual POV/GOV leased vehicle pass allows only the airfield
driver annotated on the approved justification letter, to drive his/her POV/GOV leased vehicle(s)
(Attachment 3).

1.2.8. Instruct unit personnel to remove annual POV/GOV leased vehicle passes prior to a PCA,
PCS, sale and/or transfer of vehicle, or as deemed necessary, and notify the unit ADPM and
DAFM, in writing.

4.1.5.2. The maximum towing speed for Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) such as
compressors, ground power units, oxygen carts, and similar equipment: 15 MPH. General
purpose vehicles will not be used to tow this equipment unless properly equipped with hitches
designed for that purpose. Pintle hook safety or cotter pins will be used during all towing
operations. Safety chains are not required to tow AGE. Towing allowances (number/type of
AGE) will be IAW AFOSHTD 91-100, Aircraft Flightline Ground Operations and Activities.

4.1.5.3. Do not use ropes, chains, cables or other flexible means of towing ground servicing
equipment.

4.1.5.4. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
completes hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE towing vehicle by hand to
align the pintle and hook. Drivers must shut off the vehicle, set the parking brake, and place the
vehicle in park or reverse if the AGE equipment will not be towed immediately following hook-
up.

4.1.6. Emergency War Order (EWO) response vehicles: 50 MPH on Taxiway Echo and 25
MPH elsewhere.

4.1.7. When passing an extremely slow-moving vehicle on the airfield, your overtaking speed
must not exceed the authorized speed limit imposed for your vehicle type.

4.1.8. Speed limit exceptions - The following vehicles may exceed speed limits only when
personnel and property are not endangered (will travel at a safe rate of speed). Drivers will use
23                                                          MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


good judgment (not all emergencies require exceeding the speed limit) when exceeding the speed
limit and will use any/all emergency lights and sirens to help alert nearby drivers.

4.1.8.1. Emergency response vehicles responding to real-world emergencies.
4.1.8.2. Snow removal vehicles performing snow removal operations.

4.1.8.3. “Follow Me” vehicles to accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft.

4.1.8.4. AM, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), 5 BW/CC, 5 BW/CV, 5 OG/CC, and 5 MXG/CC
vehicles in the performance of official duties.

4.1.8.5. Any vehicle when the Control Tower advises you to “expedite” or uses the term
“immediately.”

4.2. Right of Way Procedures.

4.2.1. Vehicle operators will yield to aircraft, either taxiing or being towed, by moving to a
position clear of the intended path of the aircraft.

4.2.2. Under no circumstances will vehicles halt in front of, drive between, or drive into the path
of taxiing aircraft.

4.2.3. Airfield drivers must be cautious for aircraft with engines operating, and scan the
immediate area for the presence of a marshaller. At no time will any vehicle pass between an
aircraft and a ground marshaller in position.

4.2.4. Vehicles in traffic lanes will have right of way over other non-emergency vehicles.

4.2.5. Vehicles responding to an emergency have the right of way over all non-emergency
vehicles. The Control Tower may notify ground traffic to "HOLD POSITION" when emergency
(crash) equipment moves out to cover the emergency. AM vehicles are exempt from this
restriction but must give way to Emergency Vehicles. Normally, ground operations will resume
after the emergency has been terminated. Ground movements may be approved on a case-by-
case basis, such as snow removal operations, prior to emergency termination after coordination
with the on-scene commander/fire chief. These requests may be made by AM, Snow Control or
Control Tower.

4.2.6. Proximity to Aircraft (including helicopters).

4.2.6.1. Vehicles will not be backed, parked, or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet
to the rear of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or unloading,
servicing, towing, or as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook.

4.2.6.2. Helicopter operations. A clear zone of 200 feet either side of helicopter operations is
required to permit a safe departure or approach route. A minimum clearance of 100 feet should
be maintained around helicopters that are parked with rotors turning.
24                                                          MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


4.2.6.2.1. Personnel will avoid operating vehicles in the vicinity of the helicopter landing areas
because of the inherent hazards involved (e.g. high velocity down wash and small rotor blade to
ground clearance). Personnel outside of vehicles with no eye or hearing protection are more
vulnerable when near operating helicopters.
4.2.6.2.2. Anytime an airfield vehicle operator observes a helicopter landing or departing, or
preparing to depart, they will immediately stop to determine its intended direction/intentions.
Vehicle operators may turn on their emergency flashers to indicate to the helicopter pilot that the
driver has observed the helicopter. Under no circumstances will vehicles drive under or across
the flight path of a departing or arriving helicopter. If in doubt as to what a helicopter is doing,
always err on the side of caution and choose another route that will take you away from it.

Note: Stop bars have been painted on Taxiway Echo in the vicinity of the helicopter operation
area. Vehicle operators will “stop” and check for departing/arriving helicopters in this area.

4.3. Vehicle Operations and Safety Procedures. Vehicles will not be parked in the immediate
vicinity of any aircraft, except as authorized for support. A spotter will be used when a vehicle is
backed towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from
being backed into aircraft. Vehicles will be parked in a manner to allow departure without
backing unless a spotter is used.

4.3.1. Vehicles shall only park in non-designated areas when the mission requires it. All
vehicles parked in non-designated areas must ensure vehicles do not impede the flow of traffic
and be parked only long enough for the occupants to perform necessary actions.

4.3.2. All vehicles will approach parked aircraft with the driver's side of the vehicle toward the
aircraft.

4.3.3. All personnel will use seat belts/shoulder harness (when provided) while the vehicle is in
motion.

4.3.4. Military and Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel will not ride in the back of
or in/on other areas of any vehicle not normally intended for occupants. However, in unique
situations where military necessity dictates, personnel may ride in these areas provided the
following rules are complied with:

4.3.5. Remain seated while the vehicle is in motion and keep arms and legs within the vehicle
body.

4.3.5.1. Do not ride in the doorways or sit on the engine cover of metro vans (also called step
vans or bread trucks). Rear door nets will be in place while passengers are transported while the
doors are open.

4.3.5.2. Keep side doors on passenger vans closed when the vehicle is in motion.

4.3.5.3. Do not ride on tugs or towing vehicles unless a suitable seat with back and side guard or
other safety device is installed.
25                                                            MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


4.3.5.4. All cab positions with seat belts will be occupied before anyone is placed in the utility
box.

4.3.5.5. Before personnel sit in the bed of a pickup truck, they will ensure any objects that might
cause unsafe footing are removed. All occupants will sit only on the floor of the bed with their
backs against the cab, or the sides of the bed (not against the tailgate). No portion of any
occupant’s body will overhang the vehicle’s sides or rear.

4.3.6. Using the airfield for convenience is prohibited.

4.3.7. Vehicles will not pass an aircraft that is taxiing or being towed.

4.4. Unattended Airfield Vehicles.

4.4.1. The vehicle must be turned off, the keys left in the ignition, and doors unlocked.

4.4.2. Vehicles will not be left unattended with the engine running except by 5th Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron and 5th Maintenance Squadron personnel under the following
circumstances:

4.4.2.1. Personnel will actively be performing aircraft maintenance.

4.4.2.2. The ambient air temperature, not the wind chill, is zero degrees Fahrenheit or colder.

4.4.2.3. The vehicle is in park.

4.4.2.4. One of the vehicle’s drive wheels is chocked in front of, and behind the tire.

4.4.2.5. The vehicle is pointed in a direction that poses the least risk to nearby aircraft if it were
to begin moving.

4.4.3. Set the parking brake, or position chocks under the rear wheel (front wheel if front wheel
drive), drivers side.

Note: The use of chocks instead of the parking brake is highly encouraged when the temperature
is at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

4.4.4. The gear will be put in reverse (manual transmissions), or park (automatic transmissions).

4.4.5. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral
braking system when left parked on the aircraft-parking ramp.

4.4.6. Vehicles can be parked in the left lane of the marked traffic lane located in the MPA
when supporting aircraft. When parked, the keys will be left in the ignition, the parking brakes
and/or chocks will be used. Vehicles operators are responsible for making sure their vehicle
does not impede the movement of aircraft.

4.4.7. In the APA and OPA unattended vehicles outside the path, or possible path, of an aircraft.

4.4.8. Wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will be braked or chocked.

4.4.9. A vehicle that has a malfunction/broken down, preventing operation under its own power
shall:

4.4.9.1. Make every effort to move vehicle from blocking the flow of traffic.

4.4.9.2. Use all available means to alert taxiing aircraft that the vehicle has broken down if it is
located in an area of the airfield where it may impede the progress of taxiing/towed aircraft.

4.4.9.3. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on if a malfunction occurs.

4.4.9.4. Immediately use any means available (two-way radio, cell phone, etc.) to contact your
duty section and AM, state the nature of the problem and your location on the airfield.

4.4.9.5. Stay with the vehicle and try to flag down another vehicle for assistance.

4.4.10. Vehicles transiting taxiways will not drive on the centerline unless they are specifically
checking the pavement condition or looking for foreign objects.

4.4.11. Vehicles will operate right of taxiway centerline in reference to the direction of travel.
Remain on concrete portion between centerline and asphalt shoulders (Attachment 9).

4.4.12. Under no circumstances will vehicles park, block, or drive in the path of taxiing aircraft
or one that is being towed. When a vehicle must avoid interfering with the progress of a towed
or taxiing aircraft, they will reverse direction or pull onto the nearest available access road and
remain behind the wing tip safety clearance lines/vehicle stop sign. As a last resort, vehicles
should be driven off prepared surfaces (taxiway shoulders) to ensure adequate clearance (60 feet
from the edge of the taxiway shoulders) for the aircraft.

Note: Vehicles leaving paved surfaces must complete a FOD check immediately upon
reentering the pavement.

4.4.13. Vehicle operators will not leave vehicles unattended on taxiways or aprons. Vehicle
operators also will not leave vehicles parked within 200 feet of taxiway centerlines nor within
125 feet from the edge of aprons.

4.4.14. Vehicle operators will not drive/park beneath any portion of an aircraft, unless required
for the performance of duty. Exception: Operation of Bobcats for snow removal under and
around aircraft. Use of a spotter for these vehicles is mandatory. When backing a vehicle during
loading or unloading, a spotter must be used and pre-positioned wheel chocks will be placed
between the aircraft and approaching vehicle to prevent vehicles from striking the aircraft.

4.4.15. Vehicle operators will not operate a vehicle within 50 feet of any fueling or defueling
operation unless specifically authorized by MAJCOM directives, and never if a fuel spill has
27                                                      MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


occurred.

4.4.16. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and Runway Condition Reading (RCR) checks. In
winter conditions, RSC/RCR checks are done on the runway, taxiways, and parking ramps by
AM personnel. The purpose of these checks is to determine the braking action for aircraft
operations for takeoff, landing and during taxiing operations. During these checks, the 4-way
flashers and/or rotating beacon lights will be used. CAUTION: All vehicles must yield the
right-of-way to, and remain clear of, the AM vehicle while RSC/RCR checks are in progress.

4.5. Jet Blast. Watch for jet blast/rotor hazards due to parked aircraft with their engines
running. Propeller/rotor wash and jet blast can propel debris and objects causing damage to
other aircraft or injuring personnel.

immediate area for the presence of a marshaller. At no time will any vehicle pass between an
aircraft and a ground marshaller in position or between an aircraft and “Follow Me” vehicle.

5.1.3. Under no circumstances will vehicles halt in front of, drive between, drive past, or drive
into the path of taxiing aircraft. Transient Alert “Follow Me” vehicles may drive in the path of
taxiing aircraft during the performance of their duties.

5.1.4. Vehicles will not be backed, parked, or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to
the rear of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or unloading,
servicing, towing, or as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook.

5.1.5. Vehicles will not be operated within 50 feet of any fueling operations unless specifically
authorized and never if a fuel spill has occurred.

5.1.6. At any time when approaching an aircraft, operators will position the driver’s side of the
vehicle closest to the aircraft. A spotter will be used when a vehicle is backed towards an
aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into
aircraft.

5.2. Vehicle Lighting.

5.2.1. Vehicle flashers or emergency lights (rotating beacons) will be used when on the active
runway.

5.2.2. At night or in inclement weather. Flashers/parking lights will be used by all vehicles
parked on the airfield at night, or in inclement weather, when the vehicle location could cause a
hazard to aircraft movement. This does not apply when vehicles are parked in a designated area.

Note: Use of headlights is highly encouraged during reduced visibility and inclement weather to
improve visibility of the vehicle being driven.

5.2.3. During hours of darkness, when approaching a moving aircraft to preclude interference
with the pilot’s vision vehicles shall:
29                                                          MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010



5.2.4. Turn headlights off and use parking lights when aircraft are approaching to show position
of vehicle. After the aircraft has passed, headlights shall be turned back on.

5.2.5. Vehicle operators will exercise caution to ensure headlights (to include those with
daytime running lights) do not point toward taxiing aircraft of towing operations, so aircraft or
tow vehicle operators are not blinded.

5.3. Vehicle Traffic Lanes/Routes.

5.3.1. Vehicles shall use designated traffic lanes to the maximum extent possible where
available.

5.3.2. Vehicle operators will drive to the immediate right of the taxiway centerline and avoid
driving on taxiway shoulders unless in direct support of an aircraft. Normal traffic flow will be
used as much as possible (see Attachment 9).

5.3.3. Personnel crossing taxiways or aprons must give way to taxiway traffic (aircraft and
vehicles). All vehicles will stop prior to entering the airfield (regardless of where they enter) or
crossing a taxiway; and visually determine that the area is clear of taxiing/towed aircraft and
vehicles before proceeding.

5.3.4. All vehicles will come to a complete stop when entering the airfield or crossing taxiways
and at the designated “stop” signs and conduct a check of the tires and vehicle for FOD/loose
debris.

5.3.5. With the exception of “Follow Me” vehicles, vehicles will not be driven into the path of
taxiing aircraft.

5.3.6. Emergency vehicles may deviate from normal traffic patterns when responding to an
emergency.

                            FOD PREVENTION AND CONTROL

6.1. FOD Prevention and Control Measures.

6.1.1. To reduce the potential of FOD to aircraft and support equipment, vehicles will remain on
paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible.

6.1.2. Vehicles that must operate on unpaved areas will enter and depart paved surfaces at a 90-
degree angle and at the slowest possible speed to reduce the spread of potential FOD. A FOD
check of all tires will be performed immediately when entering a taxiway or runway from an
unpaved area.

6.1.3. All airfield personnel have a responsibility in the FOD Control Program to remove FOD
from the airfield when it is observed.

6.1.4. All vehicle operators have a specific responsibility to ensure the vehicle they’re driving is
clean and all the equipment carried in/on the vehicle is properly stored and secured to prevent a
FOD hazard.

6.1.5. All personnel will stop vehicles and check for FOD at FOD checkpoints and any other
entrance onto an aircraft movement area. Checks will ensure the vehicle and its tires are free of
debris (rocks, mud chunks, etc.). Debris must be removed before proceeding.

Note: Rollover FOD checks are mandatory.

6.1.6. Vehicle operators encountering a large amount of debris (rocks, dirt, pavement material,
etc.) while on the airfield will notify AM to have a sweeper sent to the area. AM will notify the
airfield sweeper of requests to remove FOD.

                                         CHAPTER 7

              CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA (CMA) PROCEDURES

7.1. Runway Access Procedures.

7.1.1. All vehicles/personnel requesting entry onto the runway will remain north of the runway
VFR hold lines on Taxiways Bravo, Charlie, Delta, as well as North of the Instrument hold line
on Taxiway Alpha, or south of the Instrument hold line on Taxiway Juliet. Establish radio
contact with the Control Tower (state “Minot Tower and Call Sign”) via the airfield FM “Ramp”
net. Fire Department vehicles are permitted to use the “crash” FM net. Specific Control Tower
approval is required for runway access. Only the Control Tower can give approval for access.
When communicating with the Control Tower, airfield drivers will clearly state their request, and
read back all Control Tower instructions verbatim. Airfield drivers must ensure they wait for
confirmation and approval from the Control Tower before entering the runway.

7.1.2. Maintain radio contact with the Control Tower the entire time while operating within the
CMA. Monitor the radio to ensure that radio failure has not occurred. If radio contact is lost,
vehicle operators will exit the CMA immediately and will stay out of the CMA until
communication with the Control Tower is restored. A request for approval back into the CMA is
required.

7.1.3. Notify the Control Tower as soon as vehicles, personnel, and/or equipment have departed
the CMA.

7.1.4. When told by the Control Tower to "Exit the Runway," immediately remove all
equipment and personnel at least 100 feet either side of the runway paved edge, unless a greater
distance is specified. Advise the Control Tower when the withdrawal is complete.

7.1.5. Emergency signals/procedures to exit the runway.

7.1.6. When the Control Tower needs a vehicle to depart the runway and the vehicle is
unresponsive to radio calls/Tower light gun signals, the Control Tower will apply the following
procedures:

7.1.6.1. When the runway lights are on, increase and/or decrease brightness by one or more
steps and then return them to the original setting.

7.1.6.2. When the runway lights are off, turn them on and then turn them off again.

7.1.6.3. Upon observing the above procedures, vehicles/personnel will immediately depart the
runway via the nearest taxiway, taking any equipment with them, and remain behind the hold
line. Once the vehicle/personnel are safely off the runway, attempt contact with the Control
33                                                         MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


Tower. Do not delay exiting the runway in order to find out “why.”

7.1.6.4. Unconditional instructions or blanket clearances e.g. “the airfield is yours, approved on
all surfaces,” are not authorized at MAFB. Vehicle operations must report on and off each time
they enter or exit the CMA.

7.1.7. Vehicle operators or persons on foot are prohibited from attempting to obtain Control
Tower clearance onto the runway or into the CMA through a third party, such as Command Post
or Maintenance Operations Center, during published airfield operating hours.

Note: When the airfield is closed (after published operating hours) and the Control Tower is not
manned, operators will notify the Command Post by phone prior to accessing the CMA and/or
runway.

7.1.8. Vehicles equipped with rotating lights will have them on while on the runway or within
the CMA. Vehicles not equipped with rotating lights must have emergency flashers illuminated.

7.1.9. If the vehicle operator exits a vehicle while on the runway or within the CMA, a portable
hand-held radio will be used for monitoring at all times.

7.1.10. Entering the CMA and crossing the runway merely for convenience is strictly prohibited.

7.1.11. Maintenance crews may work in the grass infield areas with prior coordination with AM,
but must request approval to proceed within 100 feet either side of the runway pavement edge
from the Control Tower. Direct two-way radio communication with Control Tower must be
maintained at all times.

7.1.12. Non-controlled movement area consists of all remaining portions of the airfield (i.e.,
taxiways the parking ramps and perimeter road). Control Tower approval is not required to
operate in these areas.

7.1.13. Vehicle operators driving on any portion of the airfield must possess a valid AF IMT
483.

7.2. Radio Communications with the Control Tower.

7.2.1. Vehicle operators shall look both ways for aircraft landing, departing, or taxiing prior to
calling the Control Tower.

7.2.2. Normal communications to the Control Tower will be initiated.

Note: The Control Tower is often busy on other frequencies and may take some time to respond.
Vehicle operators should be patient and pause before repeating initial call up.

7.2.3. All vehicle operators will ensure the Control Tower uses their exact call sign. Hearing the
correct location of your vehicle but the wrong call sign does not give approval for your request.
For example, if your vehicle’s call sign is OPS 1 and you are requesting access on the runway or
34                                                           MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


CMA and the Control Tower gives approval for OPS 4 to proceed on runway, you would not
have approval to enter the runway until the Control Tower states the correct call sign, even if it
appears obvious that you are the only vehicle at that location.

7.2.4. Prior to moving the vehicle, operators must repeat all instructions verbatim.

7.2.5. Due to the complexity of air traffic control, other instructions may also be given, so it is
imperative that vehicle operators listen carefully and repeat exactly the instructions they are
given.

7.2.6. The only word that authorizes a vehicle to operate near or enter the controlled movement
area or runway is “PROCEED”. The word “PROCEED” may be accompanied with other words
or phrases.

7.2.7. “HOLD” will indicate disapproval of an operator’s request. “HOLD” may be
accompanied with other words or phrases; however, if this word is used, the vehicle operators
will NOT ENTER the runway or CMA, will read back hold instructions, and will standby until
approval is granted.

Note: Operators must transmit what they are holding short of e.g. “HOLD SHORT OF
RUNWAY”. Simply saying “HOLD SHORT” alone is not enough.

7.2.8. When reporting off the runway, the vehicle operator will ensure receipt of a response
indicating the Control Tower understands they are no longer on the controlled movement area or
runway.

7.2.9. To help eliminate miscommunication and possible compromise of safety, it is imperative
that proper radio phraseology be adhered to. At no time will personnel use the words
“CLEAR,” “CLEARED” or “CLEARANCE.”

7.2.10. Immediately leave the runway or CMA should a communication failure occur between
you and the Control Tower using the most direct route. Stay out of the area until
communications are restored with the Control Tower.

7.3. Escort Responsibilities for Runway and CMA Access.

7.3.1. The escort will brief drivers on route, speed, procedures, etc.

7.3.2. Vehicles or persons without two-way radio communication with the Control Tower must
be escorted by an individual who is certified and has the proper radio equipment.

7.3.3. The escort will obtain proper permission for all vehicles/personnel from the Control
Tower prior to proceeding on or across the runway or CMA.

7.3.4. The escort should say the word, “plus” and the number that will be accompanying, for
example:
35                                                         MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


7.3.4.1. Calling party: “Minot tower” “OPS 1” (your call sign)

7.3.4.2. Control Tower: “OPS 1, Minot tower; go ahead”

7.3.4.3. Calling party: “Minot tower, OPS 1 plus 2, requests permission to cross the active
runway” or “on the runway from Taxiway Alpha to Taxiway Juliet.”

7.3.4.4. Control Tower will respond with either approval or hold instructions or standby
instructions. If hold or standby instructions are given, only the call sign will be repeated by
Control Tower. For example:

7.3.4.4.1. Control Tower: “OPS 1 plus 2, proceed onto the runway from Taxiway Alpha. Report
when off.” Alternatively, the response may be “OPS 1, hold short of the runway” or “OPS 1,
standby.”

7.3.4.5. Once given permission from the Control Tower, escort must communicate this approval
to the escorted party.

7.3.4.6. Escorts shall maintain a close formation at all times and the escort will remain with the
other vehicles/personnel while on the runway or within the CMA. The escort will maintain
positive control of the other vehicles/personnel and should depart the runway last behind the
convoy.

7.3.4.7. The Control Tower’s light gun signals will be used in the event radio communication is

                                           CHAPTER 8

                                AIRFIELD NOMENCLATURE

8.1. Airfield Nomenclature (Terms and Definitions).

8.1.1. Airfield - All areas, to include; facilities, pavements, and grounds designed to support the
movement of aircraft operations and the perimeter road.

8.1.2. Runway 11/29 - 13,197’ x 300’ (length by width). Concrete pavements used routinely for
takeoff, landing, and taxi operations.

8.1.3. Overruns - Paved portion extending outward from each end of the runway.

8.1.4. Taxiways - Alpha (North and South), Bravo (North and South), Charlie, Delta, Echo,
Foxtrot, Golf, India, Juliet, Kilo. All Taxiways are 75 feet wide with 50-foot shoulders, except
for Taxiway Alpha North, which is 75 feet wide with no shoulders. Taxiways are provided for
the ground movement of aircraft. They connect the parking and maintenance areas of the airfield
with the runway and provide access to aprons (APA, MPA, OPA, Skid Row, Sierra, T38 pad,
and Hot Cargo Pad), hangars, docks, and various parking locations.

8.1.5. Parking Aprons (also known as ramps and or pads) - (MPA, APA, OPA, Skid Row/Sierra
Ramp, Helicopter Ramp, Hot Cargo Pad).

8.1.5.1. Parking Aprons are paved areas provided for aircraft parking, servicing, and loading.

8.1.5.2. When aircraft are parked on aprons/ramps, entry control points will be utilized and
vehicle operators must exercise extreme caution while driving near aircraft.

8.1.6. Airfield entry points - designated point used to enter the airfield.

8.1.7. CMA - The area of the airfield that requires aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain
specific Control Tower approval for access via two-way radio contact. Two-way radio contact
with the Control Tower is mandatory for anyone wanting to operate within the CMA. The CMA
is a large rectangular area surrounding the runway and both overruns. It extends 100 feet from
the edge of the runway and both overruns in all directions. Vehicles will not normally operate
past the runway VFR hold lines or closer than 100’ either side of the runway edge without
approval from the Control Tower. Only those having official business within the CMA will be
approved access.

8.1.8. Airfield markings - Markings allow for the safe movement and operation of aircraft and
vehicle traffic. They include:

8.1.8.1. Runway side stripes - A solid white line running the length of the runway, on each side
of the runway centerline, that identifies the runway edge.

8.1.8.2. Runway centerline stripes - A dashed white line extending down the center of the
39                                                         MINOTAFBI 13-213 7 JUNE 2010


runway.

8.1.8.3. Hold lines.

8.1.8.3.1. Runway hold position markings (figure 8.1.9.3.1.1).




                                     Figure 8.1.9.3.1.1
                                Runway Hold Position Marking

8.1.8.3.1.1. Description. Four parallel yellow stripes that extend across the entire width of a
taxiway, located a minimum of 100 feet from the runway edge. The two lines closest to the
runway are dashed and the other two lines are solid. These markings can be found on Taxiways
A, B, C, D, and J.

8.1.8.3.1.2. Purpose. Lines mark entry to the runway environment and must not be crossed
without prior approval from the Control Tower. When directed to hold short of the runway,
remain behind these lines (exception: hold short of the runway behind the Instrument hold
position markings on Taxiways Alpha and Juliet).

8.1.8.3.2. Runway Instrument (INST) Hold Position Markings (Figure 8.1.9.3.2.1.).

                                           INST

                       Runway Instrument (INST) Hold Position Marking

8.1.8.3.2.1. Description. Double parallel yellow stripes that extend across the entire width of a
taxiway and have yellow perpendicular dashes within the double lines. These markings can only
be found on Taxiways Alpha and Juliet.

8.1.8.3.2.2. Purpose. Lines mark the holding point required to protect the signal integrity of the
Instrument Landing System (ILS) during poor weather conditions. Instrument hold lines are
located on Taxiways Alpha and Juliet and are established to protect the RWY 29 glide slope
signal. Vehicles are required to hold short of the INST hold markings at Taxiways Alpha and
Juliet, and contact the Control Tower for permission onto the runway prior to proceeding.

8.1.8.4. Taxiway Markings - A single solid yellow line denotes the taxiway centerline. Solid
double yellow lines denote the edge of the taxiway.

8.1.8.5. Airfield Signs.

8.1.8.5.1. Runway Hold Position Signs. The VFR and IFR hold signs augment the markings on
the pavement. These signs are lit and help drivers identify the entrance to the runway
environment, at night and when the taxiway markings are covered with snow.

8.1.8.5.1.1. VFR. Red signs with white letters, located adjacent to the runway holding position
markings (Figure 8.1.9.5.1.1.1.).


                                        29 - 11

                                   Mandatory Hold Short Sign

8.1.8.5.2. Taxiway Location Sign. This sign has a black background with a yellow inscription
and yellow border (Figure 8.1.9.5.2.1.). The inscription is the designation of the runway on
which the aircraft is located. These signs are intended to complement the information available
to pilots through their magnetic compass and typically are installed where the proximity of two
or more runways to one another could cause pilots to be confused as to which runway they are
on.



                                       Figure 8.1.9.5.2.1.
                                     Taxiway Location Sign

8.1.8.5.3. Direction Signs. Direction signs have a yellow background with a black inscription
(Figure 8.1.9.5.3.1.). The inscription identifies the designation(s) of the intersecting taxiway(s)
leading out of the intersection that a pilot would normally be expected to turn onto or hold short
of. Each designation is accompanied by an arrow indicating the direction of the turn.

8.1.8.5.4. Direction signs are normally located on the left prior to the intersection. When used on
a runway to indicate an exit, the sign is located on the same side of the runway as the exit.

8.1.8.5.5. The taxiway designations and their associated arrows on the sign are arranged
clockwise starting from the first taxiway on the pilot's left.

                                     Taxiway Direction Sign

8.2. Airfield Lighting.

8.2.1. Runway edge lights - White lights located on the edges of the runway, except for the final
portion. The last 2,000 feet are color coded for landing rollout information. These high intensity
lights run the length of the runway and identify the runway edge.

8.2.2. Taxiway edge lights - Blue lights used to outline taxiways and parking aprons. These
lights are dispersed throughout the airfield in both raised and flush positions.

8.2.3. Taxiway end lights - Amber lights spaced two feet apart at the intersection of two
taxiways where an aircraft must turn left or right.

8.2.4. Airfield Rotating Beacon: Green and split (double peaked) white light, located on top of
the water tower near the PRIDE Building.

8.3. Obstacles.

8.3.1. Obstacle Criteria - An obstacle is anything that poses a threat to aircraft movement.
Obstacles pose an immediate hazard to aircraft taxiing and towing operations. Identifying these
hazards is essential to ensuring the safety of aircraft.

8.3.2. Mobile Obstacles - Moving and parked vehicles, construction equipment, fire
extinguishers, aircraft/vehicle chalks, maintenance stands, power carts, etc.

8.3.3. Mobile ground support equipment can normally be positioned on the airfield (taxiways,
aprons, arm/de-arm areas, etc.) no sooner than three hours before an arrival and must be moved
no later than three hours after a departure.

8.3.4. Obstacles must remain at least 200 feet from taxiway centerlines. Anyone who notices an
obstacle within these distances must immediately report it to AM personnel.

8.4. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). The POFZ is an 800 feet wide by 200 feet long
rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the
threshold, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and
other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 feet, or visibility is less than ¾ statute mile (or
runway visual range below 4,000 feet).

                                           CHAPTER 9

                             MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

9.1. Restricted Areas and Entry Control Point (ECP).

9.1.1. Minot AFB has three aprons with restricted area markings. These areas are identified
with permanent red lines painted on the pavement. Entry into these areas is by crossing the
“Entry Control Point” box painted on the taxi lead-in lines. They are located on the APA, OPA,
MPA, and (Attachment 9).

9.1.2. The MPA is always a restricted area regardless whether aircraft are currently parked there
or not. When no aircraft are parked on the APA and OPA they are not considered restricted
areas.

9.1.3. Access to restricted areas is limited to holders of a restricted area badge authorizing entry.
Unless one has the appropriate area identified on his/her restricted area badge these areas will be
avoided unless accompanied by an escort. Restricted area markings are painted on the hammer
heads for Taxiways Alpha and Delta.

9.1.4. Crossing restricted areas lines may only be accomplished after coordinating and obtaining
approval from SFS.

9.2. Night Vision Devices (NVD)/Blackout Operations.

9.2.1. NVD drivers will always have a safety observer in the vehicle when driving on the
airfield. The observer is there to survey the surrounding area and blind spots of the NVD wearer
to mitigate any hazards that may cause an accident.

9.2.2. NVD wearers will never drive the vehicle while using the NVDs when a safety observer is
not available. Stopping the vehicle and donning the NVD is permitted without a safety observer
only during emergency situations.

9.2.3. Individual units are responsible for ensuring their personnel are aware of the procedures
for driving on the airfield and how to properly drive using the NVDs.

9.2.4. All NVD trained individuals will have an AF IMT 483 (separate from the one stamped
“AUTH, MAFB FLIGHT LINE”) stamped “NVD QUALIFIED”. Annual qualification/refresher
training will be annotated on the back side of the AF 483.

9.2.5. NVD users are subject to the same rules/procedures as other airfield drivers. Accidents
involving the use of NVDs will be reported to the unit ADPM and AM.

9.2.6. Units wanting to perform NVD/blackout operations must coordinate their intentions with
and obtain approval from AM. This will ensure there is no conflict with aircraft operations.

9.3. Visual and Radio Blind Spots. There are no visual blind spots on the airfield. Radio blind

spots are located on the hammerheads of Taxiways Alpha and Delta. Vehicle operators may
need to move to a different area on those two taxiways if contact with the Control Tower cannot
be established.

9.4. Wear of Hats.

9.4.1. In accordance with Minot AFB Supplement 1 to ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 21-101
Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, uniform hats and organizational baseball caps
are not authorized for wear on the flight line. However, cold weather gear is authorized per AFI
36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel.

9.4.1.1. To minimize the risk of a potential FOD hazard, common sense will prevail when wind
conditions exist that increases the possibility of hats being blown off an individual’s head.

9.4.1.2. Hats will be removed and secured within 50 feet of operating aircraft engines.

9.4.1.3. Distinguished visitors and their escorts will not be required to remove metal insignia
prior to entering the ramp, but will comply with the rules when within 50 feet of operating
engines.

9.5. Procedures for Vehicle Equipped with Tracks/Chains, and etc. Operators must obtain
written permission from the AFM/DAFM/NCOIC AM Operations to operate a steamroller and
vehicles with tracks and/or chains on the airfield.

9.6. Cell Phone Use on the Airfield. Vehicle operators will not use cell phones unless the
vehicle is safely parked or they are using a hands–free device.

9.7. Smoking Areas. Smoking is prohibited on the airfield.
