the AMC Global Mobility and Global Reach Missions. The command policy ensures AMC personnel are
armed, qualified, and proficient when required to support military operations other than war or wartime
tasking. Medical personnel will follow arming policy IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and
Training, and chaplains will follow arming policy IAW AFI 52-101, Planning and Organizing. Ensure all
records in this publication are maintained and disposed of in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Manage-
ment of Records, and the Air Force Records Disposition (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision updates information from AFI 31-101, 1 March 2003 which supersedes AFI 31-101,
1 December 1999. It incorporates Interim Change (IC) 04-01, which provides guidance on establishing a
field armory during IG – generated exercises. Explains deployment Posturing Codes. Addresses profi-
ciency ammunition utilization prior to deployment. Corrects munitions category for day-to-day operating
munitions. Requires AFTO Form 105 to be shipped with each weapon. Updates HQ office symbols. Addi-
tionally, instructional references are updated. A bar (|) indicates changes since the last edition.


1. Air Mobility Command Policy:
   1.1. Equip and train all AMC personnel deploying to hazardous duty locations on small arms to pro-
   tect themselves and resources.
   1.2. Equip and train all AMC aircrews, combatant personnel deploying overseas and identified to
   deploy IAW AFI 10-403, AMC Sup 1 Deployment Planning, to use small arms.
       1.2.1. All AMC personnel will receive weapons familiarization and proficiency skills training,
       weapon qualification training, and arming and use of force training within 120 days of assignment
       to a deployment ( DWS, DXS, or DWX-postured) position. Posturing Codes: D= Deployable;
       W=Wartime Available; S=Steady State Available; and X=Home-Station Required.
2                                                                      AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005


       1.2.2. Personnel receiving initial or recurring weapons qualification training will attend classes
       conducted by Combat Arms (AFSC: 3P0X1B) personnel. Training and qualification courses of
       fire will be IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Program, and
       AFM 36-2227, Volume I, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance Program Rifle, Handgun,
       Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, M72 Light Antitank Weapon, Submachine gun, and M249 Squad
       Automatic Weapon Training Programs. Personnel must attain either "qualified" or "expert" status
       on the identified weapon before being considered certified to carry firearms. Proficiency training
       is in addition to weapons qualification training and is provided within the unit to maintain profi-
       ciency with identified firearms.
       1.2.3. Combatant AMC personnel identified to deploy (assigned to a DWS, DXS, or DWX-pos-
       tured position) require training but do not require a dedicated weapon. All other AMC personnel
       subject to deploy (holding an AFSC which is in any Air Force UTC) require small arms training
       when tasked to deploy.
    1.3. Arm AMC aircrew members for personal defense only when there is a reasonable expectation the
    aircrew will be isolated from friendly forces (e.g., combat sorties), for antihijacking duties, and final
    denial. See Aircrew Arming section by volume of AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3, AFI 31-207, Arming and
    Use of Force by AirForce Personnel, AFI 11-229, Nuclear Airlift Operations, and AMC Aircrew Bro-
    chure.
       1.3.1. Arm AMC aircrew members during prime nuclear airlift missions. Reference AFI 31-207,
       Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, AMCR 55-37, Air Operations Security, AFI
       11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations, and AMCI 11-2C-17V3, C-17 Operations Procedures .
    1.4. Home-station commanders will ensure personnel are organized, trained, and equipped to comply
    with this and all other applicable arming and weapons handling instructions in preparation for deploy-
    ment. Deployed commanders will develop plans, guidance, and procedures for using and arming per-
    sonnel at deployed locations.
    1.5. The local combat arms section will provide weapons operations inspections and routine weapons
    repair functions.
    1.6. Individuals who have a medical condition seriously affecting their ability to safely carry and
    operate a weapon, or are taking medication(s) that could adversely affect weapon safety will not be
    issued weapons.
       1.6.1. Deployed personnel on mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis will not consume alcohol
       within 24 hours of being issued weapons, for the duration of the deployment.

2. Air Mobility Command Requirements:
    2.1. Deployment Arming. HQ AMC/A4 is the command focal point for deployment weapons and
    equipment issues described in AMCI 10-403, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Force Deployment.
    AMCI 10-403 provides policy regarding weapons authorization, distribution and training for deploy-
    ments. Non-Combatants: Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM) are considered non-com-
    batants. AECMs can be armed; by arming, AECMs do not forfeit their protected status. AECMs may
    use weapons to defend themselves and the wounded against attacks by anyone violating the laws of
    war. NOTE: AECMs should arm IAW the most current edition of the Theater SPINS and Aircrew
    Brochure depending on deployed location.
AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005                                                                                3


   2.2. Personnel identified to deploy have priority for training. Wing plans (XPL) establishes a priority
   training plan for TDYs with less than 120 day notice. Personnel that are not short notice will be
   included in the Combat Arms prioritization letter outlined in AFI 36-2226, para 1.14.30. This letter
   will be signed by the installation commander as to avoid conflict on the base.
      2.2.1. Commanders will coordinate with wing plans before exceeding the identified to deploy
      level of training. Exceeding this quota significantly impacts combat arms training and the muni-
      tions supply system available for training all other organizations. Wing commanders will establish
      a weapons familiarization and proficiency program to ensure all weapons qualified personnel can
      handle a weapon responsibly on the job or in a deployed environment. Recommend a coordinated
      training effort incorporating deployment planning (wing plans), combat skills training and weap-
      ons qualification (security forces), and ability to survive and operate (civil engineers).
   2.3. Wing commanders will establish procedures to ensure personnel being armed are not affected by
   a medical condition which makes carrying a weapon dangerous, or taking medication which impairs
   their ability to safely carry and operate a weapon IAW AFI 31-207, Para 2.6.

3. Weapons Familiarization and Proficiency Training:
   3.1. Weapons familiarization and proficiency training can be conducted within the unit by the training
   officer/NCO. Familiarization training ensures all weapons qualified personnel can handle weapons
   responsibly at home station and in a deployed environment. Familiarization and proficiency training
   will be “hands-on.” Minimum familiarization training includes the following:
      3.1.1. Weapon safety
      3.1.2. Loading and clearing procedures
      3.1.3. Clearing barrel procedures
      3.1.4. Weapon disassembly and assembly
      3.1.5. Function check
      3.1.6. Care and cleaning
      3.1.7. Visual inspection
   3.2. Skills degradation in marksmanship should be a concern for all personnel, particularly those per-
   sonnel who are armed. To reinforce marksmanship skills taught during previous weapons qualifica-
   tion training, units authorized to maintain proficiency ammunition on their accounts should consider
   requiring personnel deploying overseas to fire their authorized munitions prior to a
   deployment. Combat Arms personnel will forecast ‘zero’ fire munitions IAW AFCAT 21-209 v 1.
   The forecast formula will be based on number of deploying personnel x 16 rounds per person. Zero
   fire is only authorized for personnel deploying with dedicated weapons.
   3.3. Proficiency training includes weapons combat skills. Local combat skills training is essential for
   deploying personnel as it prepares them for self-protection and can be integrated into the defense plan
   of the deployed location. Failure to train Airmen in skills beyond weapons qualification endangers
   personnel at deployed locations. Combat survivability unit continuation training, at a minimum, will
   cover the following areas:
4                                                                      AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005


       3.3.1. Arming, Use of Force and Weapons Safety, Group A & B only. Group C personnel receive
       briefing on applicable theater rules of engagement (AFI 31-207)
       3.3.2. Tactical Movement/Assault (AFH 31-302, STP-21-1-SMCT, FM 7-8)
       3.3.3. Blocking/Counter Attack (AFH 31-302, FM 7-8)
       3.3.4. Threat Levels (AFI 31-101, AFI 10-245)
       3.3.5. Defensive Fighting Positions (STP-21-1-SMCT)
       3.3.6. Combat Arms Instruction, Targeting/Firing with Gas Mask (AFI 36-2227, Vol 2)
    3.4. Weapons familiarization and proficiency training will include arming and use of force training
    and can be found in AFI 31-207, Attachment 7. Minimum use of force training is:
       3.4.1. The USAF Use of Force Policy
       3.4.2. Use of Deadly Force
       3.4.3. Special Considerations for the Use of Deadly Force
    3.5. Commanders should develop a training schedule to incorporate TDY attendance of deployment
    personnel to respective training/evaluation centers or exercises to fulfill off-station training require-
    ments. These programs provide unit continuation training for all UTCs, enhanced weapons familiar-
    ization and proficiency, and are tailored to specific AFSCs and missions.

4. Weapons Qualification Training:
    4.1. AMC personnel will be trained IAW AFI 36-2226, AFM 36-2227, Volume I, and AFI 11-2MDS
    Volume 1 (as appropriate). The installation combat arms section will coordinate with the squadron/
    unit training monitor to arrange for scheduling squadron personnel. Combat arms sections prepare
    either monthly or quarterly schedules for initial and recurring weapons qualification training and zero
    firing. Contact your training monitor to schedule rifle or handgun training.
       4.1.1. Munitions availability is central to training deployment personnel. Unit commanders will
       develop and monitor a deployment weapons training plan, which ensures limited munitions condi-
       tions are not exacerbated by excessive live fire weapons training. Obtaining munitions is the
       responsibility of the unit deployment monitor or weapons custodian. Obtaining munitions
       involves establishing an account with the munitions AFK office on base and submitting an order
       form for category "B" or "T" munitions. Justification for munitions is located in AFCAT 21-209,
       Ground Munitions. The document will list the number of rounds and type of munitions needed.
       Ammunition custodians must forecast annually for all types of munitions in all categories.
           4.1.1.1. Category "A" munitions are REPLACEMENT munitions.
           4.1.1.2. Category "B" munitions are MOBILITY munitions.
           4.1.1.3. Category "T" munitions are DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING munitions.
           4.1.1.4. Category "D" munitions are CONSUMABLE TRAINING munitions.
    4.2. Commanders may incorporate the firearm training simulators into their unit's training schedule.
    Simulator training can be conducted by the squadron training officer/NCO once the individual(s) is
    qualified on the system by local combat arms personnel. Simulator training is conducted in a class-
AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005                                                                                5


  room environment and is not constrained by weather, ammunition, safety, or availability of ranges and
  training areas.
     4.2.1. Simulators provide immediate or delayed on-screen feedback as well as printed feedback.
     4.2.2. Simulators are adaptable to any weapon or shooting course and can support training in an
     NBC environment or reduced visibility.
  4.3. Weapons qualification is prioritized by firing category/group with formal training conducted
  IAW AFI 36-2226.
     4.3.1. The primary option for recurring qualification training for Group A, B, and C personnel is
     live fire training on base or in the local area. Other options include the unit commander extending
     qualification to a maximum of 120 days, the installation commander extend qualification for 12
     months, or the MAJCOM extending qualification for more than 12 months. Temporary duty to
     live fire at another installation should also be considered. This should be done only in rare circum-
     stances and IAW AFI 31-207, para 2.11.2. NOTE: Do not grant qualification extensions to person-
     nel identified for deployment to areas where weapons qualifications are required to coincide with
     AFI 36-2226. Their firearms qualification (live-fire) must be current throughout the tour length.
  4.4. Combat arms personnel will provide initial and recurring weapons qualification firing for all
  weapons. They will conduct zero firing for deploying personnel.
     4.4.1. Combat arms personnel are responsible for conducting pre-embarkation weapons inspec-
     tions for all weapons deployed for exercises or real world contingencies. Upon notification to
     deploy weapons, the owning unit will notify the local combat arms section as soon as possible.
     Combat Arms will determine weapons inspection requirements IAW AFI 36-2226, para 6.5.6.,
     and schedule the inspection if required. Supply and CATM personnel will establish local proce-
     dures to complete pre-embarkation inspections IAW AFI 36-2226.

5. Weapons Movement:
  5.1. Guidance for the protection of firearms is AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Pro-
  gram, Chapter 23. The control of weapons and ammunition during deployment operations is IAW AFI
  10-403, Deployment Planning, Chapter 4. The guidance provided in this pamphlet is primarily for
  deployment situations.
  5.2. Hand-Carried Weapons and Ammunition Procedures. When directed by competent authority
  (operations plan, operation order, or tasking order), units (e.g., security forces, prime beef, combat
  control, etc.) may transport hand-carried weapons and ammunition on Department of Defense and
  civilian contract aircraft during deployment contingencies. When movement originates at a commer-
  cial airport, the troop movement must be coordinated with AMC representatives and/or airport author-
  ity. Troops will not enter the commercial airport terminal with uncrated weapons without prior
  clearance and will be escorted by AMC Gateway personnel or airport authorities.
     5.2.1. Bases will issue weapons to units for reissue to individuals to hand-carry or bulk ship weap-
     ons per direction of the tasking authority. Units conduct deployment processing with weapons per
     direction from the tasking authority or at the installation level if so delegated. Units will ensure
     each weapon is issued at their respective unit issue point on an AF Form 629, Small Arms Hand
     Receipt.
6                                                                       AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005


       5.2.2. At the deployed location, if not turned in to a field armory, security of weapons will be the
       assigned individual’s responsibility.
    5.3. When weapons and ammunition cannot be hand-carried, bases should issue weapons to units for
    bulk shipment as cargo. Units will secure deployment weapons in shipping containers sealed in a
    manner that prevents removal of weapons without leaving visible signs of tampering.
       5.3.1. Shipping containers should be of a hard material—metal, wood, hard plastic (gun case)—
       and constructed to exceed the tare weight of the weapons being transported inside. Identify any
       special packaging instructions.
       5.3.2. Secure containers by locking, nailing, or banding to prevent inadvertent opening during
       transit. Banding is the preferred security method and should be planned for and used. Affix steel
       bands tightly to the container.
       5.3.3. Affix seals so they break if the container is opened.
       5.3.4. The outside of the weapons container must not indicate its contents when shipped and con-
       tainers are to be removed before marshaling.
       5.3.5. Package weapons to consolidate shipments in order to prevent threat/theft vulnerability.
       5.3.6. Clean, clear, and package weapons to prevent damage.
       5.3.7. Packaged weapons should be easily lifted by two personnel (approximately 100-150
       pounds per container, or 70 pounds when transiting a commercial airport).
       5.3.8. Weapons should be placed in the center of a pallet and covered by materials which prevent
       detection and removal.
    5.4. Move weapons with the personnel assigned to them. Doing so ensures constant security of the
    weapons and ammunition and the capability of deployed personnel to protect themselves upon reach-
    ing the deployed location.
    5.5. Do not place ammunition and weapons in the same container. When possible, place ammunition
    and weapons on the same pallet. If ammunition must be contained with weapons (e.g., due to field
    conditions), do not place ammunition with the same caliber weapon being transported (e.g., M16s
    with 5.56mm, M9s with 9mm, and M60/M240s with 7.62mm ammunition).
    5.6. Maintain a listing of all transported firearms by type and serial number. Copies of this listing will
    be maintained by the weapons/munitions courier, applicable crew member and the troop commander.
    Ensure a copy of the AFTO Form 105 is shipped with each weapon.
    5.7. Attend/protect/secure deployment weapons at all times.
       5.7.1. Arm persons charged with custody of weapons and provide the capability to sound the
       alarm if a forceful theft is attempted.
       5.7.2. Armed persons will guard weapons until they are accepted by a commercial carrier or are
       aboard military aircraft. The weapons/munitions courier(s) are responsible for palletized weapons/
       munitions until relieved by the deployed commander. They will coordinate security requirements
       with the aircraft commander during transit.
       5.7.3. There is a ratio of 16:1 for high-risk weapons (e.g., M16, M60, M203, etc.) to escorts.
       Weapons escorts below this ratio are dictated by local threat conditions. Protection of high-risk
AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  7


       weapons requires at least one armed guard when stationary and two guards (one armed) during
       movements.
   5.8. At en route stops when the aircraft is not continuously attended, remove the weapons cargo from
   the aircraft and place it in an approved storage facility or security cage (e.g., customs or bonded cou-
   rier). During unit moves, user personnel will provide surveillance when a secured storage area is not
   available.
       5.8.1. Aircraft parked in a restricted area containing Protection Level (PL) 1, 2, or 3 resources do
       not require weapons removal. Secure aircraft entry panels to the aircraft and check at least every 4
       hours in PL 1 and 2 areas and hourly in PL 3 areas.
       5.8.2. The aircraft commander is responsible for protecting weapons during stops at locations
       where DoD protection is not available.

6. Field Armories.
   6.1. Field armories provide deployed commanders weapons and ammunition accountability positive
   weapon control and protection. Field armories provide weapons security when the continuous han-
   dling of weapons by personnel is impractical (e.g., airfield operations) but when the ability to arm rap-
   idly is required. Consideration of mission requirements and weapon security requirements can
   produce a field armory system, which is highly efficient and secure without undue stress on personnel.
   Field armories can be operated and maintained by personnel of any AFSC who are properly trained.
   Deployed commanders may appoint a detail to perform deployed armorer duties. Using security
   forces personnel to solely constitute this detail is not recommended due to the manpower required to
   post critical positions in support of air base defense. However, knowledgeable security forces person-
   nel should check the armory once established to ensure compliance with established procedures and to
   answer any questions armory personnel may have. Commanders should consider inclusion of weapon
   security training during normal training cycles by select personnel.
   6.2. Operations.
       6.2.1. Attachment 2 , Field Armory Checklist, contains further guidance for the operation of a
       deployed armory.
       6.2.2. The on duty armorer is responsible for safeguarding all resources within his or her estab-
       lished armory. Due to the sensitive nature of the firearms, ammunition, and other equipment, the
       on duty armorer will be armed with a M9 handgun and 30 rounds of ammunition or an M16 rifle
       with 120 rounds of ammunition.
NOTE: FOR AMC IG - GENERATED EXERCISES, field armorers will not be armed. Security for
the armory will be provided by the Real World Security Forces that are positioned outside of the “Exer-
cise Play Area.” Field armorers will be given a hand held radio and have direct contact with real world
security forces to sound the alarm in the event of an emergency.
       6.2.3. At the beginning and end of each shift, the oncoming and off-going armorer will conduct a
       100% physical inventory of all firearms, munitions, radios, keys, and other equipment items
       stored within the armory. The inventory will be documented on an AF Form 1473, Gun and
       Equipment Room Inventory (a local/electronic version is permissible) and the armorer will sign
       the inventory sheet annotating the date and time of the inventory.
8                                                                     AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005


       6.2.4. If weapons are in a sealed shipping container, the container need not be opened for daily
       inventories. If bulk ammunition is stored in the armory, it will be maintained in sealed containers.
       If there is sufficient room within the armory, keep munitions separated by account. Armorers
       should stack ammunition with lot number and quantities facing out so the information can be read.
       If possible, stack ammunition on pallets and no higher than five cases.
          6.2.4.1. In permissive environments that do not require weapons or in countries which do not
          authorize weapons to be exposed/visible, consider using empty ISU-90 or similar shipping
          containers for locked storage of weapons secured in racks. These containers should be placed
          so that they are under constant surveillance to prevent unauthorized access attempts and
          require hourly security checks.
       6.2.5. During inventory, the armorer will inspect all seals on the bulk ammunition containers.
       Whenever a sealed container has been broken on a container, the contents must be reinventoried
       and recorded. Document the seal breakage, perform a new inventory, seal the container, and then
       record the new seal number.
       6.2.6. All weapons removed from shipping containers for daily use will remain locked in weapon
       racks. When racks are open for issue and turn-in purposes, the locks will be secured to the rack to
       prevent surreptitious replacement or loss of the lock.
          6.2.6.1. Secure weapons racks to each other to create one larger mass and attach them if pos-
          sible to some solid structure to preclude movement for safety and security. Use chains made of
          heavy duty hardened steel or welded, straight link, galvanized steel, 5/16-inch thick, or equiv-
          alent.
       6.2.7. Before issuing any firearms for arming purposes, the armorer will ensure a clearing barrel
       attendant is present.
       6.2.8. Clearing barrel construction will be IAW AFM 31-229, para 3. A commercial grade clear-
       ing barrel may be used as long as it meets the intent of the above directive.
       6.2.9. If a clearing barrel is not available, the ground defense force commander may designate an
       area or areas where weapons handling can be performed.
    6.3. The armorer must use the following procedures when issuing an M16/M-4 rifle or GAU-5A,
    GAU-5A/A, GUU-5P submachinegun:
       6.3.1. Remove the rifle from its storage rack or container, and proceed to the issue-point clearing
       area with the weapon in the “port-arms” position.
       6.3.2. Visually inspect the rifle to ensure a magazine is not inserted. Do not place fingers into the
       trigger guard.
       6.3.3. Pull the charging handle to the rear while depressing the lower portion of the bolt catch, and
       lock the bolt to the rear (open) position.
       6.3.4. Place the selector lever in the “Safe” position and visually inspect the chamber and receiver
       area to ensure no ammunition is present.
       6.3.5. Hand the weapon to the person being armed “butt” first, muzzle elevated, bolt locked to the
       rear (open) position, and selector lever in the “Safe” position. Do not place fingers on the trigger

  6.4. The armorer must use the following procedures when issuing an M9 handgun.
     6.4.1. Remove the pistol from its storage rack or container and proceed to the issue-point clearing
     area with the barrel pointed up and slide forward (closed).
     6.4.2. Visually inspect the pistol to ensure there is no magazine inserted and the decocking/safety
     lever is in the “Safe” (down-red dot not showing) position. Do not place fingers into the trigger
     guard.
     6.4.3. With the muzzle in the clearing barrel aiming point, lock the slide to the rear and visually
     inspect the chamber and receiver area to ensure there is no ammunition present.
     6.4.4. Hand the pistol to the individual being armed “butt” first, muzzle elevated, decocking
     (safety lever) in the “Safe” (down-red dot not showing) position, and slide locked to the rear
     (open).
  6.5. Individuals being armed will proceed to clearing barrel or designated clearing area and load their
  weapons in accordance with AFM 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. Attachment 2 and
  Attachment 4 of AFM 31-229 have specific loading, unloading, and clearing procedures for the M9
  handgun, M16/M-4 rifle, and GAU/GUU series submachinegun.
     6.5.1. Armorers should post weapons loading, unloading, and clearing procedures adjacent to the
     clearing barrel or designated clearing area.
  6.6. The armory is a CONTROLLED AREA in accordance with AFI 31-101 chapter 22, and all secu-
  rity requirements should be adhered to. Armories can be a room, tent, shed, bunker, or mobility ship-
  ping container. The armory will have limited entrance and exits, CONTROLLED AREA signs, and
  should be roped off. Armories will be hardened (e.g., sandbags or revetments) and a clearing barrel
  provided. The guidance contained in AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, para 2.35. will be
  reviewed and considered when siting/licensing a deployed armory. A deployed Weapons Safety Man-
  ager (WSM) or other or other Ground Safety professional will provide assistance when available.
     6.6.1. Sectioned off unit control centers or continually manned operations centers create ideal
     locations for field armories. Alternative locations are adjacent to the living quarters of the unit
     commander, OIC or NCOIC. This provides control as well as dispersal within a tent city which
     should ideally be a US-only living area.
     6.6.2. Wherever armories are established, the deployed commander must approve their location
     use and operating instruction for the explosives facility license IAW AFMAN 91-201.
  6.7. Limited access to personnel is granted by the authority of the deployed commander or their des-
  ignated representative (OIC/NCOIC). Personnel not on official business will be denied access to the
  armory. Visitors will be escorted at all times and must be signed in and out via AF Form 1109, Visitor
  Log. Physical barriers are required to limit access.
  6.8. Provide landline and radio communication capability to the host Security Forces Desk, Security
  Forces Control Center, deployed SRC/WOC or BDOC. Armory guards must be able to sound an
  alarm if under duress (AFI 31-101, paragraph 23.3.4.1.3.).
  6.9. Weapons couriers will turn in weapons and ammunition to the OIC/NCOIC of the armory and
  will be issued a receipt, AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. The armorer will assign each
  weapon a butt number and maintain a record of the serial number and matching butt number. Add
  marked and recorded weapons to master inventory. Sign over weapons on a temporary basis (AF IMT
10                                                                   AMCPAM31-1 3 AUGUST 2005


     522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data; AF Form 629, Small Arms Hand Receipt; or AF
     IMT 1297) for each shift and maintain weapon accountability through an exchange card system. The
     OIC/NCOIC should issue AF Form 629 to deployed personnel. The form simplifies the exchange
     between armory guards and personnel receiving weapons and identifies personnel, weapon, butt num-
     ber, ammunition, and qualification.
        6.9.1. The unit commander/OIC/NCOIC will designate to their armorers personnel authorized to
        draw a weapon during routine and emergency arming. The deployed installations commander, unit
        commander, OIC or NCOIC must inform armorers if they withdraw authority to draw a weapon.
     6.10. Recommended equipment for approximately 100 personnel for unknown duration:
        6.10.1. Label maker with tape
        6.10.2. AF Form 629, Small Arms Hand Receipt (1000)
