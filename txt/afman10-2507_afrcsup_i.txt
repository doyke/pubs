                                            Chapter 1

    READINESS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FLIGHT STRUCTURE AND
                          MANAGEMENT

1.1. Purpose. The R&EM Flight is an emergency response component within the Air Force
Incident Management System (AFIMS).All R&EM Flight personnel and Readiness Support
Team (RST) members are considered emergency responders under the AFIMS implementation
of the National Response Framework (NRF) and the National Incident Management System
(NIMS) as directed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5), Management of
Domestic Incidents. The R&EM Flight is the installation commander’s Air Force Emergency
Management (EM) program office of primary responsibility (OPR) and is the Installation Office
of Emergency Management. As such, the intention of this AFI is that the R&EM Flight, under
the Base Civil Engineer (BCE), is the only EM Flight on an installation. The flight executes and
assists in the training and education of people and protection of assets before, during, and after
disasters, major accidents, civil emergencies, humanitarian operations, terrorist events, or hostile
action at either home station or at a deployed location. Protection for people includes all assigned
military, civilian (Department of Defense (DOD) and host-nation), and contract personnel,
dependents, and guests. Flight personnel provide on-scene and Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) command and control (C2) support, as well as specialized detection and contamination
control support. The R&EM Flight provides guidance to installation units to mitigate the effects
of disasters and hostile incidents and to ensure rapid response to and recovery from these
incidents. This manual expands on duties contained in AFI 10-2501.This manual does not repeat
R&EM Flight responsibilities covered in AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
(BEEF) Program. This manual expands upon the AFI 10-210 guidance for Category II Status of
Resources and Training System (SORTS) reportable items.
1.2. R&EM Flight Responsibilities. The R&EM Flight within the installation Civil Engineer
Squadron manages the Prime BEEF program for the BCE and the AF EM program for the
installation commander. As such this flight:
   1.2.1. Establishes and manages the CE Prime BEEF program IAW AFI 10-210 and Air
   Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-219, Volume 8, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
   (BEEF) Management. See Figure 1.1.
   1.2.2. Serves as the installation commander’s OPR for the EM program and is appointed as
   the Installation Office of Emergency Management IAW AFI 10-2501. A tenant Air Reserve
   Component (ARC) R&EM Flight is not responsible for installation program management.
   1.2.3. Establishes and manages a single, installation-wide EM program including planning,
   organizing, training, and equipping, IAW AFI 10-2501.A tenant ARC R&EM Flight is not
   responsible for installation program management.
   1.2.4. Manages the AF Installation Protection Program (AF IPP), which is also known as the
   Guardian Program. A tenant ARC R&EM Flight is not responsible for installation program
   management.

NOTE: Civilianized (civilian and contractor) R&EM Flights are "offices" and usually will not
have an Expeditionary Engineering section. MAJCOM/A7 will determine the best structure for
the civilianized flights.

   1.3.1. (AFRC) AFRC EM personnel at tenant wings and units must understand the AFIMS
   disaster response structure and their responsibilities as an Emergency Operations (EOC)
   Manager when deployed and during operational readiness exercises and inspections.
   1.3.2. Coordinate installation EM support and Prime BEEF support with MAJCOM R&EM
   Staff.
   1.3.3. Ensure Prime BEEF planning, organizing, training and equipping are completed IAW
   AFI 10-210 and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 8. Ensure a unit Prime BEEF Working Group is
   established IAW AFPAM 10-219, Volume 8.

        EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PLANNING AND OPERATIONS

2.1. Planning Objectives, Roles, and Responsibilities.
   2.1.1. Planning Objectives. EM planning includes all installation personnel, resources, and
   missions, including geographically separated units (GSU) and off base facilities supported by
   the installation. Planning for personnel includes all military, DOD, and host nation civilians,
   contractors, dependents, and guests. Training and equipping will be IAW AFI 10-2501.
   2.1.2. R&EM Flight Planning Roles and Responsibilities.
   2.1.2. (AFRC) Paragraph 2.1.2.4 thru paragraph 2.1.2.16 are performed by the host R&EM
   Flight and the EM Office at AFRC host installations and stations. Traditional Reservists (TR)
   perform these duties when deployed.
       2.1.2.1. Serve as the CE plans representative for plans other than the CEMP 10-2, as
       assigned by the CE commander. Provide the installation plans office with the
       representative’s contact information.
       2.1.2.1. (AFRC) This paragraph does not apply to the AFRC EM Personnel.
       2.1.2.2. Consider the use of cross-functional teams to develop, coordinate, and review
       plans as tasked.
       2.1.2.3. Maintain documentation of completed plan reviews. Use a tracking method

                    EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) TRAINING

4.1. Training Programs. This chapter provides guidance for the R&EM Flight to conduct
required EM training. The flight provides installation-wide Air Force EM program training and
internal flight training as part of the EM Proficiency Program. The flight schedules and reports
Prime BEEF training IAW AFI 10-210.
4.2. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program Training. The R&EM Flight
provides courses to installation personnel to support the Air Force EM education and training
program. These courses provide the required knowledge and skills to prepare for, prevent,
respond to, recover from, and mitigate emergency events requiring Air Force response IAW AFI
10-2501. The R&EM Flight will:
   4.2.1. Conduct installation EM training IAW AFI 10-2501. All instructors must be task
   certified in a course before they can teach it. Use AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
   (JQS) Continuation/Command JQS, as prescribed by AFI 36-2201, Volume 3 to document
   task certification. The Air Force Civil Engineer has mandated the use of the Air Force
   Training Record (AFTR), which is the enlisted OJT record system for personnel in upgrade
   training.
   4.2.1. (AFRC) AFRC R&EM Flight provides EM specialized team training for deployed
   mission. AFRC personnel will utilize the AFRC Instructor Evaluation and Certification
   checklist posted on the AFRC R&EM CoP to evaluate and certify their personnel. To
   complete the certification process the evaluator must coordinate with the trainer and ensure a
   valid AF From 623A entry (On the Job (OJT)Training Continuation Sheet) is made in the
   individuals training record in AFTR.
   4.2.2. Develop an annual training schedule and post it on ACES-PR Unit Scheduler Module
   for units to view and use. Consider scheduling a majority of CBRNE defense classes within
   the AEF training windows. Units will use ACES-PR Unit Scheduler Module to schedule
   personnel for classes.
   4.2.3. Minimum class size for CBRNE defense will be 10 students, unless determined
   otherwise by the installation EMWG. Determine the minimum class size for all other courses
   the flight instructs. Publish minimum class sizes and any "no show" policies approved by the
   installation EMWG in the installation supplement to AFI 10-2501. The number of classes
   required will depend upon many factors, such as the number of specialized team members
   assigned and the turnover rate of the team members.
   4.2.3. (AFRC) AFRC Tenant units will coordinate minimum class size and no show
   policies through the local EM forum with the host R&EM Flight.
       4.2.3.1. (Added-AFRC) The primary method for accomplishing the CBRN Defense
       Awareness Course is the Advance Distributed Learning System (ADLS). If the ADLS is
       not operational, the tenant R& EM Flight will request course instruction from the host
       R& EM Flight. At tenant locations, CBRN Defense Survival Skills remains the
       responsibility of the host R&EM Flight.
24                                     AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011


  4.2.4. Develop an instructor schedule for all installation and in-house training. Consider
  implementing instructor-to-student ratios of one instructor for every 30 students. The
  exception is the CBRN Survival Skills Course which requires one instructor for every 10-15
  students. Coordinate the installation training schedule through the EM branches, and gain
  approval through EM leadership and the EMWG prior to publicizing.
  4.2.4. (AFRC) AFRC R&EM Flights will provide the host R&EM Flight an instructor
  schedule. AFRC tenant units will use ACES-PR Unit Scheduler to submit requests for
  classes.
  4.2.5. Maintain and publish training statistics for all courses conducted. Provide trend
  analysis on unit scheduling, attendance, and classroom utilization rates to the EMWG and
  higher headquarters as required by MAJCOM direction.
  4.2.5. (AFRC) Maintain and publish training statistics for CBRN Awareness and Survival
  Skills and any other EM focused training conducted by the tenant unit.
     4.2.5.1. (Added-AFRC) Provide trend analysis on unit scheduling, attendance, and
     classroom utilization rates to the local EM Forum. AFRC host and tenant EM flights will
     provide HQ AFRC/A7XEM an annual trend analysis.
  4.2.6. Schedule RST, CCT, and SMT team members for specialized equipment training.
  4.2.7. Update the ACES-PR database with training conducted.
  4.2.8. Determine requirements for training, such as training sites, facilities, classroom
  furniture, audio-visual equipment, supplies, and student materials.
  4.2.9. If used, provide O-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile (CS) or other training agent
  requirements to the munitions account custodian.
  4.2.10. Develop and maintain master lesson plans for instructor-led courses. Lesson plans
  should be tailored to local conditions. Review and update lesson plans annually or when
  guidance, such as publications or TOs, changes. Readiness Training Plans (RTP) must be
  used until they are superseded by web-based training. The RTP format can be used for any
  locally developed courses.
  4.2.10. (AFRC) Tenant R&EM Flights may use host lesson plan as long as lesson plans are
  tailored to unit's mission. At AFRC installations and stations, the EM Office develops the
  master lesson plans for instructor lead courses.
  4.2.11. Evaluate EM instructors annually using Sample Instructor Evaluation Checklist,
  located on the R&EM Flight CoP. All assigned Emergency Management, AFS 3E9X1, must
  teach at least one class a quarter to maintain proficiency. Air Force Reserve and Air National
  Guard EM instructors must teach at least one class per year.
  4.2.11. (AFRC) AF Reserve EM personnel will not conduct more than one CBRN Defense
  Training (CBRN Defense Awareness Course /CBRN Defense Survival Skills) class per
  calendar year. The primary mission of the EM TR is to acquire the knowledge and
  proficiency required to fight and operate in a contingency environment. The primary method
  for accomplishing the CBRN Defense Awareness Course is the ADLS. If the ADLS is not
  operational, the AFRC tenant R&EM Flights will request course instruction from the host
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       25

   4.2.16. Develop a flight in-house training (IHT) schedule to meet the established objectives
   for the EM Proficiency Program and task qualification. Assign instructors based upon flight
   personnel expertise and experience. Consider providing the training schedule to RST
   members, ARC EM personnel and Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) personnel who may
   benefit from the training. This program increases personnel’s overall level of competence by
   providing training on skills and knowledge of contingency tasks and ensures personnel
   maintain proficiency. Proficiency training enhances flight personnel’s ability to perform
   wartime duties.
   4.2.17. Where assigned, AF IPP CLS personnel will conduct training on AF IPP equipment
   for EM and cross-functional communities (Fire, Hazardous Material Response Teams,
   Security Forces, Command Post, etc).
4.3. R&EM Flight Internal Training – In-House Training.
   4.3.1. All R&EM Flight personnel will complete 16 hours of in-house proficiency training
   monthly, of which 8 hours are SORTS reportable capabilities listed in Attachment 2 .ARC
   and ANG personnel will complete 16 hours of in-house proficiency training quarterly, with 9
   hours being SORTS reportable. Minimum levels of proficiency are listed in the 3E9X1
   CFETP. When assigned, CLS employees shall be included in the flight’s in-house training
   program.
   4.3.1. (AFRC) Training emphasis for EM personnel must be on preparing them to perform
   the duties on the career field approved 1098 located on the EM CoP.
   4.3.2. Proficiency training may be in-residence, exportable, or OJT. Evaluated elements of
   an EET exercise and annual CE bivouacs provide additional venues for EM proficiency
   training.
   4.3.3. EM personnel progress through three levels of certification to meet deployment
   challenges. These levels use a building block approach that requires certification at each level
   before personnel can advance to a higher level. Lower levels are task-oriented, while the
   manager level is knowledge-oriented. The levels represent the proficiency levels that all EM
   personnel must complete. Minimum levels of proficiency are listed in the 3E9X1 CFETP.
   Regardless of rank, all EM personnel must begin at the Readiness and Emergency
   Management Flight Tasks and CBRN Tactical Tasks level and maintain training records to
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          27


   show proficiency commensurate with grade. See Figure 4.1, which displays a typical career
   path.
   4.3.3. (AFRC) To facilitate specific upgrade training requirements, AFRC EM personnel at
   the 3-skill level will not teach CBRN Defense Courses until all 5-level upgrade requirements
   are met and they have been evaluated and certified to teach utilizing the established process
   and criteria IAW paragraph 4.2.1. Once met, the supervisor has the option of allowing the 3-
   levels to instruct with or without the supervision of a qualified instructor (5-level or higher).
   Additionally, once the 5-skill level is achieved AFRC personnel may instruct courses
   unsupervised, but must be evaluated and recertified biennially.

   4.3.4. EM Proficiency Program Certifiers. The unit commander appoints OJT certifiers.
   These individuals may also be EM Proficiency Program certifiers if they are recommended
   by the flight leadership. AFI 36-2201, Volume 3 lists task certifier qualifications and
   responsibilities.
   4.3.5. EM Proficiency Documentation. Use AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and
   Recurring Training, (or electronic equivalent), to list Air Force, MAJCOM-specific, and
   installation- specific EM Proficiency training requirements and to document training. This
   form may be overprinted and filed in the AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder,
   as prescribed by AFI 36-2201, Volume 3.
   4.3.6. Where assigned, AF IPP CLS employees will maintain proficiency for inspection,
   maintenance, and training on all AF IPP equipment.

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV) PROGRAM

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides the guidance and procedures for installation-level EM
SAVs. It also directs a self-inspection for the R&EM Flight and each installation unit.The
installation SAV program is an installation commander’s tool to help units support the AF,
MAJCOM, and installation EM program.
5.2. Emergency Management (EM) Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Guidance.
   5.2.1. The R&EM Flight is the OPR for the installation EM SAV Program.
   5.2.1. (AFRC) Tenant R&EM Flights conduct SAVs to each reserve unit.
   5.2.2. The objective of SAVs is to enhance the organization’s ability to execute its assigned
   mission. SAVs should be used to identify and resolve problems in the EM program.
   5.2.3. The SAV program provides a method to review compliance with directives and
   evaluate problem areas. The MAJCOM SAV provides additional training to the R&EM
   Flights and the installation SAV provides additional training to the unit EM representative.
   5.2.3. (AFRC) IAW AFI 10-2501, AFRC supplement, MAJCOM level SAVs are
   conducted by the respective NAF.
   5.2.4. Use MAJCOM guidance for SAV report formats, requirements for formal replies,
   routing, and suspense dates for correcting deficiencies. Deficiencies noted in SAVs should be
   tracked within established self-inspection programs.
   5.2.5. R&EM Flights will program funding for any necessary travel expenses associated
   with conducting SAVs on GSUs.
   5.2.6. Where assigned, AF IPP CLS personnel may assist in the development of checklists
   and concepts of operation (CONOPS), and assist in conducting SAVs to ensure AF IPP
   assets are properly managed and integrated into response plans.
5.3. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Schedule.
   5.3.1. R&EM Flight Operations personnel will develop, coordinate, and distribute a SAV
   schedule on an annual basis and conduct annual SAVs on units identified by the installation
   EMWG. The schedule must include a copy of the SAV checklist.
   5.3.1. (AFRC) Tenant units will coordinate SAV schedule through the local EM forum.
   IAW AFI 10-2501, AFRC supplement, the unit SAV is conducted every 24-months.
   5.3.2. Align units functionally, depending upon the installation organizational structure. For
   example, perform SAVs on all units within a group or on all groups within a wing.
   5.3.3. Balance the SAV schedule with AEF training windows and other areas of high
   workload, such as installation exercises or higher headquarters inspections.
   5.3.4. The annual SAV schedule is tentative. Each visit must be coordinated with the unit
   EM representative and commander at least two weeks before the visit.

   5.3.4. (AFRC) If not initiated by the unit/CC, notify the commander of the unit to be visited
   at least two UTAs before the SAV. Provide the visit date and names of SAV team.
5.4. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Checklist.
   5.4.1. R&EM Flight Operations personnel will develop a localized SAV checklist based
   upon the Sample Installation SAV checklist located on the R&EM Flight CoP. Once the
   installation has developed its SAV checklists, ensure that each unit EM representative
   receives a copy.
   5.4.2. Unit EM representatives should use the SAV checklist to perform semi-annual self-
   inspections, two to four weeks before and six months after the unit’s scheduled annual SAV.
   Additional self-inspections may be required by MAJCOM or determined locally.
   5.4.2. (AFRC) The R&EM Flight uses the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT)
   EM checklists in the Self-Inspection section to conduct the SAV.
   5.4.3. Unit EM representatives must track open deficiencies until closed. Open items will
   have a plan and an estimated completion date to resolve the deficiency.
5.5. Conduct the Staff Assistance Visit (SAV).
   5.5.1. Before conducting the SAV, review supporting documents such as:
       5.5.1.1. The unit’s CEMP 10-2 taskings.
       5.5.1.2. Previously documented SAV results.
       5.5.1.3. The unit’s quarterly EM Report.
       5.5.1.4. Exercise and evaluation reports.
       5.5.1.5. Unit EM training statistics.
   5.5.2. Provide a formal in-brief to the unit commander and the unit EM representative.
   Formal out-briefs are at the commander’s discretion, but the unit EM representative must be
   out-briefed. Leave a list of observations and recommendations with the unit visited.
   5.5.3. When conducting the visit, observe and review unit EM accomplishments and
   activities. Identify commendable areas and problems. Explain how to correct problems that
   cannot be corrected immediately.
   5.5.4. Flight leadership will submit the written SAV report to the CE commander within five
   duty days. After the CE commander signs the report (signature may be electronic), forward
   the report to the unit commander. The report should include commendable areas,
   improvement areas, problems identified, suggested solutions and assistance provided.
   5.5.4. (AFRC) Reserve EM Offices & R&EM Flights will provide a written report within
   two UTAs of the SAV. Route the SAV report through the Mission Support Group CC and
   appropriate Directorate Chief to the Unit/CC.
   5.5.5. Provide and document follow-up visits as required by the MAJCOM.
   5.5.5. (AFRC) If a problem is beyond the unit’s ability to correct, arrange for follow-up

                                          Chapter 6

                   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) BUDGETING

6.1. General. The R&EM Flight uses budgeting guidance provided by AF/A7CXR through
MAJCOM to develop budgets. AF/A7CXR distributes guidance in the form of a Program
Objective Memorandum (POM) Data Call for each Program Element (PE) that AF/A7CXR
manages. The POM Data Call provides specific instructions on use of funding such as initial
purchases, sustainment funding, central funding and funding limitations. Flight leadership
budgets for non-medical equipment and supply items, home station response to terrorist use of
CBRNE, and flight operations and maintenance (O&M). The budget formulation process
primarily involves preparing an Execution Plan when directed by installation and MAJCOM to
build an executable budget and to identify unfunded requirements. Flight leadership must
develop and submit resource requirements and justifications within the parameters established by
the POM Data Call.
   6.1.1. In addition, the installation comptroller must establish and maintain a financial
   management structure for installation level and subordinate units. The R&EM Flight may
   receive budgeting guidance and assistance from the installation comptroller through the unit
   Resource Advisor (RA) and may be tasked to provide budget inputs to the unit RA as part of
   the installation budget process.
   6.1.2. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, explains procedures for
   using budget authorizations and allocations for other than operations.AFI 65-601, Volume 2,
   Budget Management for Operations, explains procedures for using budget authorizations and
   allocations for operations. Governing Air Force policy on the use of the Government
   Purchase Card (GPC) can be found in AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-wide Purchase
   Card Program.
   6.1.3. Items that are required, but not funded, can be placed on memo due out status to
   establish the requirement. Flight leadership should address shortages with the unit
   commander and the EMWG for additional funding support.
6.2. Budgeting for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense. PE
27593, CBRN Defense; PE 55165 (ANG); or PE 55166 (Air Force Reserve) are used for CBRN
Defense items. See Attachment 5.
6.2. (AFRC)Budgeting for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
Defense. See Attachment 4, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense
Program Element (PE) Guidelines.
   6.2.1. These budget items include CBRN-related manpower authorizations, peculiar and
   support equipment, and necessary facilities, including the associated costs specifically
   identified and measurable to chemical and biological defense equipment items to equip the
   forces. Such items enhance the survivability of personnel and enable units to continue
   primary mission operations in a CBRN-contaminated environment.
   6.2.2. Manpower will provide installation units, including EM, with information to support
   manpower budgeting. See AFI 38-205, Manpower and Quality Readiness and Contingency
   Management.

6.3. Budgeting for Home Station Response to Terrorist Use of CBRNE. Equipment for
home station response to terrorist use of CBRNE is listed in the installation CBRN response
equipment and AF IPP Family of Systems Basis of Allocation and funded via PE 27574F,
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Threat Response (non-medical).These assets are designed
to equip the local installation emergency response agencies with the ability to detect, assess,
contain, and provide limited recovery from an event. These assets are not all-inclusive but reflect
the minimum equipment necessary to respond to CBRNE incidents. Coordinate and consolidate
funding requirements with the installation Fire Emergency Services (FES), Security Forces (SF),
and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) offices. The consolidated listing should be reviewed by
the installation EMWG and elevated to MAJCOM for submission to HQ AFCESA and Air Staff
for placement in the POM.
6.4. Budgeting for Operations and Maintenance (O&M). The flight O&M budget should
consider Prime BEEF training and contingency requirements including ESL items,
administrative supplies, Temporary Duty (TDYs) not covered in PE 27593, including Silver Flag
if not command funded, printing costs, and GPC purchases. The O&M budget also covers most
AF IPP and installation CBRN response equipment non-asterisked items and some sustainment
items.
6.5. Budgeting for Global War on Terrorism (GWOT)-funded Materials. Track GWOT-
funded materials under the Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code assigned by Financial
Management IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1 for reimbursement. Examples include items purchased
for AEF support and homeland defense. One-time requirements include items such as
communications equipment. Burn rate requirements are limited to specific categories, such as
civilian personnel costs or transportation.
6.6. Budgeting for Unfunded Priorities. Flights will maintain an unfunded priority listing.
Work with the resource advisor to implement short-notice execution procedures.
6.7. Depot Funded Items. Depot funded items should be ordered as directed by MAJCOM. Do
not use unit funds to purchase depot-funded items.

Terms
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions of
the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational
capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The
ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil
support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD
directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate
the requirements of HSPD-5, the NIMS, the NRP, and Office of the Secretary of Defense
guidance while preserving the unique military requirements of the expeditionary Air Force.
AFIMS provides the Air Force with an incident management system that is consistent with the
single, comprehensive approach to domestic incident management. AFIMS provides the Air
Force with the coordinating structures, processes, and protocols required to integrate its specific
authorities into the collective framework of Federal departments and agencies for action to
include mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery activities. It includes a core
set of concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command
system, EOCs, incident command, training, identification and management of resources,
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         45


qualification and certification, and the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information
and incident resources. The AFIMS methodology is incorporated into current operating practices
through revised instructions and manuals, training products, and exercise and evaluation tools.
Air Force Installation Protection Program (AF IPP)—Air Force Program established to
implement the DOD direction to protect AF missions and personnel against terrorist use of
WMDs. Specifically AF IPP (aka Guardian Program) is designed to plan, organize, equip, and
train forces through Joint and Air Force CBRN detection, identification and warning, protection
and restoration capability enhancements.
CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either
individually or in combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces "NBC" when used
in reference to operations or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and HAZMAT are
considered part of the "C" in "CBRN."
CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
high-yield explosives, either individually or in combination. "CBRNE" is used any time that
reference is not being made to WMD or "NBC-only" operations or incidents
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and
controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission
Consequence Management—Actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and
manage and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes, including natural,
manmade, or terrorist incidents.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation,
contingencies require plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and
readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment.

States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, US possessions and territories, or
any political subdivision thereof, as a result of enemy attack, insurrection, civil disturbance,
earthquake, fire, flood, or other public disasters or equivalent emergencies that endanger life and
property or disrupt the usual process of government. The term domestic emergency includes any
or all of the emergency conditions defined below:
 a. Civil defense emergency. A domestic emergency disaster situation resulting from devastation
 created by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations during and following that
 attack. It may be proclaimed by appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.

 b. Civil disturbances. Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions, assemblages
 or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term civil disturbance includes all
 domestic conditions requiring or likely to require the use of Federal Armed Forces pursuant to
 the provisions of Chapter 15 of Title 10, USC.

 c. Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in
 the determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity and magnitude to
 warrant disaster assistance by the Federal Government under Public Law 606, 91st Congress
 (42 USC 58) to supplement the efforts and available resources of State and local governments
 in alleviating the damage, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.

 d. Natural disaster. All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of enemy attack
 or civil disturbance.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2
support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and
after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander.
The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when
on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s
cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and joint
information activities. According to the NRF, the EOC is defined as ―"The physical location at
which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and incident
management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or may be
located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of
organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such
as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination thereof."
Emergency Responders—The response element of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene
after the First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders
include follow- on elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel,
and emergency medical technicians, as well as R&EM Flight personnel, EOD personnel,
physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, readiness officers,
public health officers, bioenvironmental engineering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel.
Emergency Responders also include specialized teams such as the RST or SMT. Not all
Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders are Emergency
Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict with
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                           47


their emergency duties. For the purposes of AFIMS, EOD personnel are considered Emergency
Responders but not First Responders.
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an
organizational structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and
services that are most likely to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary
operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident.

initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement,
security personnel, and key medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to a
CBRNE incident. All First Responders are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency
Responders are First Responders. First Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to
additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties.
Force Protection Executive Council (FPEC)—The FPEC is the commander’s cross-functional
working group made up of installation and tenant units. Working group members are responsible
for coordinating and providing deliberate planning for Antiterrorism and Force Protection issues.
Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department
of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP. (JP 1-02)[An integrated application of offensive and
defensive actions that deter, detect, pre-empt, mitigate, or negate threats against or hazards to Air
Force air and space operations and assets, based on an acceptable level of risk.](Definition in
brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.) See also AFI 10-245.

     A2.3.1.3. Plume Modeling: This capability is contained within the CBRN Control
     Center and operates either in the EOC, the R&EM Flight Control Center, and/or the
     MEOC/MCC. This capability provides hazard analysis activities, vulnerability
     assessment, and risk assessment for CBRN. It can assess and analyze estimated CBRN
     contamination contours, direct activities of CBRN specialized teams, determine actual
     contours of hazards through collection of survey/post attack data, and develop hazard
     duration estimations (persistency). The CBRN Control Center provides plume
     modeling/hazard analysis data to CBRN forces for associated activities of DHA, cordon
     reduction or expansion, ground surveys, and CBRN sampling. It provides the ability to
     reduce hazard areas allowing critical mission continuation. It protects responding forces
     from primary and secondary hazards through inputs to the local common operating
     picture for commanders and UCCs.
     A2.3.1.3. (AFRC) As a minimum all military reserve 3E9X1’s will maintain ATP 45
     NBC, JWARN and JEM plotting, prediction, and reporting proficiency along with
     CBRN detection, survey, and marking qualifications regardless of assigned duty or
     deployment status.
     A2.3.1.4. MEOCandMCC: This capability serves as a self-sustaining mobile
     communications center, capable of operating in an environment with little to no basic
     services, facilitating communications between multiple entities using an array of fixed
     and/or wireless communications equipment, providing appropriate work space for routine
     support functions, and providing basic services for personnel in short-term or long-term
     deployments. The MEOC or MCC will be equipped to achieve these requirements IAW
     AFI 10-2501.
         A2.3.1.4.1. Maintain Site Security: Personnel performing this capability can actively
         engage enemy forces with small arms and can conduct defensive operations as
         required. If available, personnel can assist in securing the site from spectators,
         terrorists, or criminals on the installation.
         A2.3.1.4.2. Provide Situational Awareness Reports: Capturing information at the
         incident scene and forwarding to the IC and EOC as situation reports. Use automated
         data bases or checklist actions to provide and send updates to the EOC. Using plume
         modeling software, provide a COP to the EOC and ICC as necessary.
  A2.3.2. Active CBRN Response (ACR): This group of capabilities provides the IC or
  deployed installation commander with flexible and scalable capabilities to assist with CBRN
54                                    AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011


  response requirements enhancing the installation’s ability to respond to smaller weaponized
  CBRN attacks and/or terrorist use of improvised CBRN devices.
     A2.3.2.1. Staging Area Survey: This capability performs an initial assessment of the
     staging area either prior to or after arrival of response forces during increased threat
     levels or unexplained incidents (e.g., explosions, unexplained symptomatic personnel,
     etc.). It ensures the incident command post, entry control point, and logistical staging
     area(s) are set up in an area free of contamination. It protects responding forces from
     primary and secondary hazards. In addition, this capability performs airborne
     (vapor/aerosol) CW, BW, toxic industrial chemical (TIC), toxic industrial material
     (TIM), and radiological detection.
     A2.3.2.2. Staging Area Detection Grid: This capability confirms or denies the
     presence of hazards at the responder staging area during increased threat levels or
     unexplained incidents (e.g., explosions, unexplained symptomatic personnel, etc.). It
     provides warning of hazards if weather or other circumstances change. This capability is
     critical to assessing the safety of the staging area. In addition, it protects responding
     forces from primary and secondary hazards.
     A2.3.2.3. Downwind Hazard Analysis (DHA): This capability locates, detects, and
     quantifies the levels of contamination within an open area or facility. The primary focus
     of this capability is locating ground or surface CBRN contamination. A secondary
     capability is the use of aerosol or vapor detection capability; however, due to the
     dynamics of wind currents and movement of agent, detailed mapping of such hazards is
     limited. Provides a contamination footprint by using automated programs like Hazard
     Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC), Vapor, Liquid and Solid Tracking
     (VLSTRAC), Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), and Computer-
     Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO). Can conduct airborne CW,
     BW, TIC and TIM airborne (vapor or aerosol) detection; capable of performing ground
     contaminating CW, BW, TIC, TIM, and radiological detection monitoring. Confirms or
     denies the location of hazards and what risks are involved with personnel re-entering the
     area or facility. Uses vehicle support and can navigate around geographical objects.
     Personnel performing this capability can actively engage enemy forces with small arms
     and can conduct defensive operations as required.
     A2.3.2.4. Initial Cordon Definition: This capability locates, detects, and quantifies the
     levels of contamination within an open area outside (e.g., air field, taxiway, industrial
     area, etc.). The primary focus of this capability is locating ground or surface CBRN
     contamination. A secondary capability is the use of aerosol or vapor detection capability;
     however, due to the dynamics of wind currents and movement of agent, detailed mapping
     of such hazards is limited. Of particular interest is the focus area of creating a COP in
     relation to contamination. As such, this capability interacts with the plume modeling
     CBRN Control Center capability to ensure a viable COP in relation to contamination and
     supports installation mission continuation. In addition, this capability provides airborne
     (vapor or aerosol) CW, BW, TIC, TIM and radiological detection. It is capable of
     performing ground contamination detection for CW, BW, TIC, TIM and radiological.
     A2.3.2.5. Reduce/Expand Isolation Perimeter: This capability refines the cordon size
     based on actual hazard contours allowing commanders the ability to continue mission
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       55


     critical operations close to hazard area. Protects the population beyond the estimated
     hazardous areas if weather or other circumstances were to change. Locates/detects edge
     of contaminated areas ensuring cordon encompasses the contamination. Provides
     information to the C2 element and supports critical mission continuation. This capability
     performs both vapor/aerosol and liquid/solid contamination detection. The team is
     capable of detecting the full spectrum of CW, BW, TIC, TIM and radiological
     vapor/aerosol/particulate and solid/liquid contamination.
     A2.3.2.6. Ground Survey: This capability locates, detects, and quantifies the levels of
     contamination within an open area outside (e.g., air field, taxiway, industrial area, etc.).
     The primary focus of this capability is the location of ground/surface CBRN
     contamination. A secondary capability is the use of aerosol/vapor detection capability;
     however, due to the dynamics of wind currents/movement of agent, detailed mapping of
     such hazards is limited. Of particular interest is the focus area of creating a COP in
     relation to contamination. As such, this capability interacts with the plume modeling
     CBRN Control Center capability to ensure a viable COP in relation to contamination and
     supports installation mission continuation. The area reconnaissance provides a detailed
     information set for C2 decisions in relation to development of recovery plans and
     associated IPE requirements.
     A2.3.2.7. Establish Hazard Control Zones: This capability will assist in locating and
     quantifying hazards within the cordon so the IC can establish the hazard control zones.
     The primary focus of this capability is locating ground/surface CBRN contamination if
     possible. A secondary capability is the use of aerosol/vapor detection capability;
     however, due to the dynamics of wind currents/movement of agent, detailed mapping of
     such hazards is limited. It is capable of performing ground contamination detection for
     CW, BW, TIC, TIM, and radiological. Personnel performing this capability can actively
     engage enemy forces with small arms and can conduct defensive operations as required.
     A2.3.2.8. Initiate Public Protective Actions: Assist the IC in identifying relocation
     facilities recommendations using checklists, CEMP 10-2, and automated data bases. EM
     personnel would pass on situation reports to the ECC, ICC and if operating, the EOC for
     notification and alerting of facilities to evacuate or shelter in place.
     A2.3.2.9. Estimate Operational Risk: Based on reconnaissance and initial entry teams’
     assessments and CBRN detection grid results an operational risk assessment is given to
     the commander. The assessment will be based on mission criticality and the risk to
     personnel. EM personnel will consult with BEE on the health risks to personnel based on
     existing information prior to providing the commander an operational risk assessment on
     reducing individual protective equipment requirements or allowing personnel to re-enter
     the area or facility.
     A2.3.2.10. Site/Facility Survey: This capability performs initial (and follow-on)
     assessment within the immediate area of an incident/release, building, or room. This
     capability categorizes, diagrams, maps, and documents the CBRN incident/event site or
     facility and assesses extent of primary and secondary hazards. It can detect, identify,
     quantify, and preserve evidence for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (and other
     federal agencies) or theater Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) supporting international
     legal matters. It can distinguish between TICs, TIMs and traditional CBRN warfare
56                                     AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011


     agents. This capability allows further verification/identification of CBRN contamination
     through use of instruments too sensitive for use in the hazard area.
     A2.3.2.11. Identification of Unknown Substances: This capability is used in those
     instances when a small package or container is presented (or discovered) by "non-
     responders" in a non- emergency setting. For example, Office of Special Investigations
     (OSI) or SF personnel find a vial or container containing a liquid and bring it to the
     R&EM Flight for identification. This capability provides the ability to distinguish
     between TICs, TIMs and traditional warfare agents and provides identification of the
     substance. The main thrust is to validate that an item is not a traditional CBRN agent; this
     assists OSI agents and other authorities regarding unknown substances. As such, this
     capability performs airborne (vapor/aerosol) CW, BW, TIC, TIM and radiological
     detection to include liquid or solid CW, BW, TIC, TIM and radiological detection
     capability. The personnel performing this capability can quickly determine if the size and
     scope of a package or container requires an emergency response approach employing
     aspects of the CBRN active response capabilities.
     A2.3.2.12. Determine Responder Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and
     Individual Protective Equipment (IPE): Provides the responding 3E9X1 personnel
     with appropriate PPE/IPE based on CBRN situation. Provides recommendations for IPE
     along with the BEE to the EOC director to protect base populace, as well as, responders.
     A2.3.2.13. Develop Incident Action Plan (IAP): Assist the IC in developing the IAP
     by identifying and quantifying the material at the incident. Provide research material to
     determine hazards and quantities of the material using data bases and other research
     materials. Provide plume models based on known materials to provide a preliminary
     assessment to determine incident priorities and actions.
     A2.3.2.14. Collect and Manage Evidence: The team will provide pictures or sketches
     of the scene and location of the evidence and the layout of the room or area. The team
     will record site information and collect samples using tactics, techniques, and procedures,
     such as chain of custody and evidence preservation guidelines.
  A2.3.3. Detection Grid: The detection grid provides sensors capable of detecting airborne,
  ground or surface CBRN and TIC/TIM contamination during wartime operations for the
  entire installation. Detection grid requirements are driven by the type of installation or
  facility. The installation type determines what type of equipment an installation has to
  employ for detection grid operations. Plume modeling also impacts the detection grid plan
  development. The detection grid plan must consider the highest priorities, such as mission
  critical areas, facilities and population centers.
  A2.3.4. Personnel Decontamination:
     A2.3.4.1. Establish/Operate Contamination Control Area (CCA): This capability
     provides the ability to decontaminate personnel exposed to CBRN warfare agents in
     liquid, solid, aerosol, and vapor form. Although the equipment and procedures are
     primarily designed for CBRN warfare agents, the procedures can be modified to
     decontamination personnel exposed to TICs or TIMs. Provides installations the capability
     to process personnel contaminated during or after a CBRN attack in a centralized
     location.
AFMAN10-2507_AFRCSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        57


       A2.3.4.2. Radiological Decontamination: This capability provides the First
       Responders and the Initial Response Force to a nuclear weapons accident the ability to
       ensure radioactive contamination is not transferred from an area that is already
       contaminated to an area that is not contaminated through the orderly processing of
       personnel, equipment, and vehicles entering and leaving the contaminated area as
       described in DOD 3150.8-M, Nuclear Weapon Accident Response Procedures.
       A2.3.4.3. Establish/Conduct Technical Decon: Provides decontamination to responders
       who are contaminated while performing their duties. This capability can be set up to
       process first responders who are returning from conducting initial hazard identification
       tasks. Within this capability is the task to set up of a contamination control station to
       process responders during a nuclear accident or an attack with a radiological source.
       A2.3.4.4. Establish/Conduct Emergency Decon: This is the physical process of
       immediately reducing the contamination of individuals in potentially life-threatening
       situations with or without the establishment of a decontamination corridor. EM personnel
       will assist FES personnel in conducting emergency decontamination operations.
       A2.3.4.5. Establish/Conduct Mass Populace Decon: The process of decontaminating
       large numbers of people in the fastest time to reduce surface contamination to safe levels.
       If needed EM personnel will assist FES in conducting mass decontamination of personnel
       leaving the incident site before going to a safe area.
   A2.3.5. Advanced CBRN Capabilities: The following capabilities are low-density assets.
   Each capability enhances ACR and/or detection grid capabilities previously described.
   Flights with deployed in-place assets will integrate these systems into their capabilities.
       A2.3.5.1. Future ACR platforms: These systems in development will provide the
       capability to enhance active CBRN response and detection grid capabilities. It provides
       the capability to detect, identify, warn, and report CBRN, TIC and TIM hazards resulting
       from wartime enemy attack or Releases Other Than Attack (ROTA).
       A2.3.5.2. Automated BW Detection Systems: These systems provide the capability to
       enhance active CBRN response and detection grid capabilities.
A2.4. The equipment for executing the flights capabilities is identified within the HQ AFCESA
R&EM installation CBRN response equipment and the 4F9D and W series UTCs. The flight
uses assigned installation CBRN response equipment and UTC equipment to conduct
contingency response to include training and exercises in relation to the SORTS-reportable

                                Attachment 5 (Added-AFRC)
             AFRC TENANT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

A5.1. (AFRC) Purpose. This attachment outlines the purpose, functions, staffing,
organization, and duties of AFRC EM personnel. This attachment also applies to the CES
R&EM Flight on an AFRC installation (except where noted by "Tenant Locations Only").
A5.2. (AFRC) General Functions. The R&EM Flight Air Reserve Technician (ART) and the
EM civilian assigned to tenant AFRC units manage the wing/group EM program according to
their personnel document and support the host EM program according to local directives. The
tenant R&EM Flight reservists plan and train for deployment (contingency) operations.
A5.3. (AFRC) Manning. The manpower for the tenant R&EM Flight is determined by the
tasked unit type code (UTC) and associated skill levels of the UTCs. The full-time flight
manning is shown in the applicable Part A UMD under FAC 44EB. The reservists authorized for
the flight and the applicable UTC are shown in the Part B UMD under FAC 44EB.
A5.4. (AFRC) Organization:
   A5.4.1. (AFRC) During unit training assemblies (UTA), the tenant R&EM Flight reports to
   the CES/CC. The R&EM Flight Superintendent assigns internal flight duties as necessary.
   A5.4.2. (AFRC) -(Tenant Locations Only) During the week, the EM ART is the Reserve
   wing EM Program Manager and reports to the Mission Support Group commander.
   A5.4.3. (AFRC) During deployments, the flight becomes a part of the deployed location
   R&EM Flight or Emergency Management function. EM personnel report according to
   deployed location plans and man additional posts as required.
A5.5. (AFRC) Plans and Operations.
   A5.5.1. (AFRC) Prepare and/or track all planning documents which task the flight or
   support wing/group EM and CBRN operations.
   A5.5.2. (AFRC) Develop checklists supporting the EM program and generic emergency
   action guides, procedures, or checklists to support war and contingency plans. Review
   annually.
   A5.5.3. (AFRC) -(AFRC Installations Only) The EM ART provides input to the EM office
   so that updates, issues, and problems can be presented to the installation readiness council or
   other program review forum. NOTE: (Tenant Locations Only) For problems beyond the
   flight’s capability to resolve, request assistance from the appropriate EM office.
   A5.5.4. (AFRC) -(Tenant locations only) In the absence of a host base information
   program, develop a program. This program reinforces the information covered in the BEPO
   training. At least quarterly, the R&EM Flight furnishes materials to commanders to train
   their units. Use all available media to disseminate information: handouts, posters, base
   bulletin, electronic media, base newspapers, etc. (ART Duty only). The program emphasizes:
      A5.5.4.1. (AFRC) Applicable seasonal hazards and protective actions.
      A5.5.4.2. (AFRC) The types of attacks, major accidents, and natural disasters likely to
      occur at the installation.
