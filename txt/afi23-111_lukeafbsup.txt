SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Paragraphs were re-numbered to coincide with the changes in AFI 23-111 and the prescribed
forms for the 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron (56 LRS) were added in paragraph 2.4.10.
1.1. All active duty military and civilian personnel assigned, or on temporary duty (TDY), to
Luke AFB are prohibited from leaving government property in their vehicles, including the
trunk, except for the sole purpose of transporting such property from base to a designated
location. When packing government property for a TDY, do not pack it in your vehicle until the
day that you leave.
2.4.10. The 56 LRS Fuels Management Flight prescribes the use of Luke AFB Form 339,
Expeditor Daily Tool Inventory; Luke AFB Form 340, PM Daily Tool Inventory; and Luke AFB
Form 341, Cryogenic Daily Tool Inventory, to account for tool accountability.
2.5. When transporting property, never leave it in a vehicle overnight. Failure to follow this
policy may result in the imposition of financial liability and/or administrative corrective action.
