                                             INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assist
Otolaryngology Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the task. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each
subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each
module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn
each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as
you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately
in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas
needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.
After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier
should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will
meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them. The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was:

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                   Audiometer
                                      Headset (Ear Phones) or insert earphones with foam plugs
                                      Otoscope
                                      Appropriate Forms


OBJECTIVE:                            In a clinical setting, perform air conduction testing on a patient.




EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the
trainee dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.




                                                       1

                               PERFORM BASIC AUDIOLOGY PROCEDURES

                                         PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST

                  PERFORM AIR-CONDUCTION HEARING TEST                                        SAT    UNSAT
PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Check the Audiometer calibration date IAW AFOSHSTD 48-20 and ANSI Standard
    S3.6-1996.
2. Position the patient comfortably with his/her profile toward you, but facing slightly
away from you. (This reduces the chance that the patient will detect any inadvertent
cues from you, but still permits you to observe his/her facial expressions).
3. Thoroughly explain the procedure to the patient. Instruct the patient to respond when
    he/she just barely hears the stimulus. Tell the patient he/she should respond even if
    he/she only thinks that he/she heard the sound.
4. Use an otoscope to inspect each ear for any evidence of abnormality.
5. Position the headset on the patient ensuring the left and right ear phones are over the
    correct ears. If using foam plug earphone inserts, pull gently up and back on the
    pinna (this straightens the ear canal) and insert the foam plug into the external ear
    canal with a slight twisting motion. Look closely at the fit to verify that the foam
    plug is well within the ear canal and filling the meatus. When using earphone
    inserts, ensure the red tube is connected to the right transducer and blue tube is
    connected to the left transducer. Reversing the tubes may result in reversal of the
    earphones when assessing a patient.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Begin testing with the better ear first, if known, utilizing the following
sequence of audiometric frequency presentation: 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz,
6000Hz, 8000Hz, 500Hz, 250Hz. Use pure tone signals of 1 to 2 seconds in duration.
2. Begin the testing at 30dB. If the patient does not respond, increase the stimulus
    intensity by 15dB until the patient does respond.
3. Decrease the intensity level of stimulus presentations in 10 to 15 dB increments until
    the patient no longer responds. Begin the search for threshold when the patient
    doesn’t respond to two presentations at an intensity level.
4. Increase the intensity level in 5dB increments and continue ascending until the patient
    responds.
5. Go back another 10 dB and present the stimulus once more. Increase the intensity
    level again in 5 dB increments, seeking a response. The patients threshold for the
    stimulus frequency is found when he/she responds three times at an intensity level.
6. Annotate results on a local hearing test form, as appropriate. Red X for right ear,
    blue O for left ear.
7. Repeat steps for the next frequency until all required frequencies are completed.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 for opposite ear.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Inform patient that test is complete.
2. Remove patient headset or earphone inserts. If inserts are used, discard the
    disposable foam plugs.
3. Return audiometer to the “neutral” position (meaning the earphone output, and not
    the bone conduction or speaker, should be selected).
4. Provide the test results to the referring physician or audiologist.
FINAL RESULTS/NOTES: If the patient experiences pain or bleeding, evaluation by
the credentialed provider is indicated.

FEEDBACK: Using this checklist as a source of information, discuss the trainee’s performance indicating
strengths, weaknesses, suggested improvements, etc.

REMARKS/NOTES:                       Be alert, when using suction in a mastoid bowl, to the possibility of
                                     causing caloric induced dizziness.

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Thoroughly explain the procedure to the patient and your expectations of
    him/her. Instruct him/her to sit quietly without responding to any sounds
    he/she may hear. Inform your patient to tell you if he/she feels any pain. You
    may discontinue the test if your patient experiences pain or discomfort at any
    time.
2. Use otoscope to ensure tympanic membrane is visible, as well as tympanic
membrane (TM) perforations or pressure equalization (PE) tubes.
3. Perform ear cleaning if necessary.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1 Select a clean probe tip that is appropriate for the patient’s ear canal and place it
    on the probe assembly.
2. Pull gently up and back on the pinna (this straightens the ear canal) and insert a
    clean probe tip into the external ear canal with a slight twisting motion. Look
    closely at the fit to verify that the probe tip is well within the ear canal and
    filling the meatus.
3. Adjust equipment controls, per manufactures instructions, to test desired ear.
4. Perform test.
5. Print results. If unable to print results, record the ear canal volume, peak
    amplitude of the tympanogram, and pressure point of peak.
6. Repeat above steps for opposite ear, if required.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Inform patient test is complete.
2. Provide the test results to the referring physician or audiologist.
FINAL RESULTS/NOTES: If the patient experiences pain or bleeding,
evaluation by the credentialed provider is indicated.
