                                               Chapter 1

                            CIVIL ENGINEER SELF-HELP PROGRAM

1.1. General. Self-help is a very significant force multiplier in today’s shrinking budget environment.
Self-help offers an effective alternative means for providing labor in accomplishing minor repair,
maintenance and construction. The result of a successful self-help program is improved facilities and a
greater feeling of pride and ownership.

1.2. This Pamphlet and You. This publication is dedicated to providing the basic information needed to
support your program. This pamphlet is written as a procedural guide and not intended as an instruction
or as a mandatory procedure. It is a guide only to be used by ANG Civil Engineers for local self-help
programs. It is not all-inclusive and some of the suggestions and checklists may or may not apply to your
self-help program. As with any program it requires the support of all functional managers within civil
engineering and the base populace.

1.3. The Concept. The concept of the self-help program is allowing the customer to plan and complete
minor maintenance, repair, and/or construction, which the customer is technically capable of completing.
Civil Engineering may provide material support and may provide planning assistance, training as
necessary, and shop support when required.
1.3.1. For minor repair or maintenance projects (i.e. replacing electrical receptacle covers, touch up
painting of a wall blemish, or re-gluing rubber cove base), the building manager may be allowed to
request material support from base civil engineering supply system without submitting AF Form 332,
Base Civil Engineer Work Request, or appropriate base level electronic work request. NOTE:
Electrical work must be completed only by a certified electri

1.3.2. Any request for chemical based products, must be accompanied with Material Safety Data Sheets
(MSDS). Again, we cannot place enough emphasis on Safety. NOTE: Electrical work is to be
completed only by certified electricians. Mechanical systems also require some assistance from civil
engineering, especially where Freon needs to be recycled. Any fire alarm or sprinkler work needs to be
accomplished by personnel.
1.3.3. For more involved projects, the customer must submit AF Form 332 for review andapproval. The
desired project should be coordinated with the building manager and the deputy/squadron commander
prior to submittal by the customer. This is to ensure that the appropriate individuals are aware of the
proposed project and planned commitment of self-help (customer) labor. Another consideration should
be the estimated time frame that the project would require to complete. This time frame should be
adhered to, so projects are not allowed to drag on.
1.3.4. Work shall commence only when the work request has been approved at the appropriate level and
all funding for the work has been secured. Depending on the size of the work request the work request
may require approval by the Facility Utilization Board (FUB). Civil Engineering staff is responsible for
ensuring that the work is necessary and that the work does not conflict with other work ongoing or
programmed for the same area.

1.4. Base Participation. The Base Civil Engineer with support of the Commander, should publicize the
program, expedite customer requests, and provide “one-stop service.” Ensure that all base organizations
are aware of the purpose of the self-help program, hours of operation, and the various types of work that
can be done by self-help by using the bulletin boards, base newspaper, and building manager training.

1.5. Self-Help Training. Proper training of personnel is essential to quality work. The following
training resources may be made available to the customer.
1.5.1. How-To Pamphlets. Have available step-by-step instructions for completing various projects (see
Attachment 1). Your literature rack should also include information on energy conservation, safety, fire
prevention, and work place security.
1.5.2. Video instruction is an excellent teaching method. There is a wide range of how-to videos that are
commercially available, and Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA), also produces a wide
range of videos and these are maintained in the CE library. If you can’t find any commercial tapes you
like, consider working with your audiovisual staff and shop craftsmen to make your own.
1.5.3. As numerous how-to books are readily available, make a small selection for reference. Many
commercial publishers such as Time-Life publish excellent series of home repair and construction
manuals. These books may also be available through local bookstores and home improvement centers.

1.6. Self-Help Tools.
16.1. When Civil Engineering provides loaner tools and other items needed to do support self-help work,
CE shall:
1.6.1.1. Ensure that the tools and equipment are in a safe working condition.
1.6.1.2. Ensure that the requestor is trained on the proper safe operation of that tool.
1.6.1.3. Ensure that the member is aware of tool accountability and return policies.
NOTE: Some high pressure or explosive tools, along with other shop tools, require special training and
require a certification card. Only authorized personnel may use these types of tools or equipment.
1.6.2. Base Safety Officer/NCO will ensure that the member has received training on the use of personnel
protective equipment and that this equipment is available.

                                                 Chapter 2

                             SELF-HELP WORK ORDER PROCESSING

2.1. Overview. The procedures listed below will provide the basic concept of processing self-help work
requests. Development of local procedures is authorized and encouraged. When considering a self-help
project from a tenant organization, an evaluation should be made to determine if the requestor has the
necessary qualifications to perform the work to standards. Example: Electrical work requires a licensed
electrician to make final inspection and connections. HVAC is also a specialty.

2.2. Work Request Approval:
2.2.1. It is recommended that customers use AF Form 332 for all self-help requests. Customers are
required to provide a detailed description of work to be done; i.e., justification, applicable sketches, site
plans, list of materials, etc. Consider having self-help customers complete a questionnaire (Attachment
2), and submit with AF Form 332. The customer must coordinate with the building manager and obtain
the signature of requesting organization deputy/squadron commander.
2.2.2. Upon receipt of AF Form 332, Operations Management (formally Production Control) shall
review and if necessary assist the customer in determining additional requirements. It is recommended
that Operations Management be delegated the authority to approve and authorize work requested up to a
specified dollar amount.
2.2.3. Customers are required to coordinate work requests with Base Fire, Safety, Bioenvironmental,
Environmental, and Communications, as deemed necessary. Operations Management will ensure that the
coordination is complete.
2.2.4. Operations Management will also coordinate with Facility Manager and Real Property Tech, to
ensure that the work does not conflict with any future scheduled/authorized projects for this location and
that the work is being performed on authorized real property.
2.2.5. Operations Management will also ensure that any work request received does not interfere with
any warranty items. Any work request that involves real property, which is under warranty, should be
disapproved, as this may void the warranty on the item.
2.2.6. Operations Management will ensure that all self-help work must abide by any adopted base
standards and also be consistent with any established basewide systems.

2.3 Material Support:
2.3.1. Operations Management should maintain a good audit trail of materials issued by facility by using
the proper documentation for accountability.
2.3.2. For accounting purposes, charge items to the individual work order authorizing the work or use the
appropriate work order for self-help not requiring an AF Form 327, Base Civil Engineer Work Order,
or an electronic version of a AF Form 327 or facsimile.
2.3.3. Retain material issue documentation and cost transfer data for at least 2 years for audit purposes.
2.3.4. Establish turn-in procedures for unused material.
2.3.5. Ensure that hazardous materials are properly tracked and handled in accordance with local or
current Hazmat Pharmacy requirements.

2.4. Tool Control. It is essential to maintain positive, auditable control over tools utilized by self-help
customers.
2.4.1. Authorized Items. An authorized/approved list of tools is needed as the basis of any tool control
program. Large items such as carpet cleaners, shop-vacs, etc. could be included as part of your tool
program.
4                                                                   ANGPAM 32-1002 6 October 2000


2.4.2. Inventory Control. The requesting individual must sign for all tools issued. Use of the AF Form
1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, or similar locally developed hand receipt can be used. Establishment
of a firm returns date is essential to having tools available for other customers. Follow-up on delinquent
returns should be the first day after agreed upon return date.
2.4.3. Quarterly Inventory. A complete inventory should be accomplished quarterly to determine
location of tools.

2.5. Project Start. As materials become available, work force management should call the customer for
the required briefings with the work order point of contact (POC) who will monitor the work. Issues of
materials are accomplished based on the scope of work and the ability of the customer to utilize and store
the materials. In some circumstances all materials are issued at the time of receipt and in other agreed
upon instances materials are issued in phases. The following should be accomplished at project start:
2.5.1. Tool Safety Briefing. See Attachment 3 for possible format.
2.5.2. Self-Help Project Briefing. See Attachment 4 for possible format.
2.5.3. Periodic Inspection. In-progress and final inspections of self-help work are vital steps in
avoiding delays. Inspection ensures quality workmanship and timely problem identification. The
requestor or building manager is responsible to request spot or in-progress inspections and all inspections
will be coordinated with fire, safety, communications, environmental and bioenvironmental as
applicable. A reasonable time frame should be worked out before work starts as to the lead-time required
for inspections and other requests. See Attachment 5 for possible format. Identification and coordination
of in-progress inspections is encouraged prior to project start. At anytime during a spot inspection or
scheduled inspection, any safety violation or other violations found during the inspection, the Base Civil
Engineer or designated representative has the authority to issue a stop work notice until the deficiencies
are corrected.
2.5.4. If this is a large project, or a project that is going to generate demolition/construction
debris, requestor should request through CE, a dumpster or other method to dispose of debris. Requestor
should also be aware of generating any controlled waste, which may require special handling.

2.6. Project Completion:
2.6.1. When work is complete, the requestor or building manager should schedule a final inspection.
Any punch list items should be agreed upon and corrected as soon as possible.
2.6.2. Project close out should include return of unused material, as built drawings, and turn-in of tools
and equipment. See Attachment 5.
2.6.3. If projects are capitalized, total project cost (both funded and unfunded) is to be considered (see
AFI 32-9005).
2.6.4. At the close of the project the requestor or building manager shall provide to CE the
labor hours spent on the project. The labor hours shall be recorded at the standard shop rate and applied
to the cost of the project.

2.7. Program Management. Periodically review your self-help program to ensure that you are
following procedures and to find better ways to serve your customers. See Attachments 6 and 7 for
examples of self-inspection and critique formats.

A3.15. _____ Use the correct tool. The right tool will do the job better and safer.

A3.16. _____ Dress properly. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry, as these can be caught in moving
parts; rubber gloves and nonskid footwear are recommended when working outdoors, and wear
protective hair covering to contain long hair.

A3.17. _____ Use required personnel protective equipment. Ensure that this equipment is clean and
worn properly. If you are not sure what’s required, contact your installation safety office. Do not wear
face shields as a substitute for required safety glasses/goggles. Also use face or dust mask if cutting
operation is dusty. NOTE: Facemask must be fit-tested by BioEnvironmental prior to use. Some dust
masks are obsolete, check with safety or bioenvironmental office for the most current information.

A3.18. _____ Don’t abuse cord. Never carry tool by cord or yank it to disconnect from receptacle.
Keep cord from heat, oil, and sharp edges.

A3.19. _____ Secure work. Use clamps or a vise to hold work. It’s safer than using your hand and it
frees both hands to operate tool.

A3.20. _____ Don’t overreach. Keep proper footing and balance at all times.

A3.21. _____ Maintain tools with care. Keep tools sharp and clean for better and safer performance.
Follow instructions for lubricating and changing accessories. Inspect tool cords periodically and if
damaged report to self-help personnel before using the tool! Inspect extension cords periodically and
report any changes to self-help personnel. Keep handles dry, clean and free from oil and grease.

A3.22. _____ Disconnect tools. When not in use, before servicing, and when changing accessories,
such as blades, bits, cutters.

A3.23. _____ Remove adjusting keys and wrenches. Form a habit of checking to see that keys and
adjusting wrenches are removed from tool before turning it on.

A3.24. ______ Avoid unintentional starting. Don’t carry plugged in tool with finger on switch and be
sure switch is off when plugging in.

A3.25. ______ Stay alert. Watch what you are doing; use common sense; and do not operate tool when
you are tired.

A3.26. ______ Check damaged parts. Before further use of the tool, a guard, or other part that is
damaged should be carefully checked to determine that it would operate properly and perform its
intended function. Check for alignment of moving parts, binding of moving pairs, breakage of parts,
mounting and any other conditions that may affect its operation. A guard or other part that is damaged
should be reported to self-help personnel. Do not use tool if switch does not turn it on and off.
