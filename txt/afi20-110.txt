                                          GENERAL

1.1. Scope of Guidance and Procedures. NWRM is defined by the Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD) “for the purpose of accountable inventory controls” as “classified or unclassified
assemblies and subassemblies (containing no fissionable or fusionable material) identified by the
Military Departments that comprise or could comprise a standardized war reserve nuclear
weapon (including equivalent training devices) as it would exist once separated/removed from its
intended delivery vehicle.” Furthermore, OSD defines delivery vehicle “as the portion of a
weapon system that delivers a nuclear weapon to its target. This includes cruise and ballistic
missile airframes as well as delivery aircraft.” The guidance and procedures prescribed in this
document apply to all nuclear sustainment activities directly or indirectly involved in NWRM
management. This includes Air Force supply (base, depot), transportation, maintenance (base,
depot contract/organic), munitions, depot storage, disposal and demilitarization.
1.2. Systems. AF NWRM is classified and managed using multiple Accountable Property
Systems of Record (APSR). In addition to AFI 20-110 requirements, Integrated Logistics
Systems - Supply (ILS-S)/D035A Stock Control Management System users will follow existing
policies found in AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management and procedures found in
AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures to manage and account for NWRM. CAS
users will use procedures outlined in AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Management and this
instruction to manage and account for CAS managed NWRM. CAS processing procedures for
CAS-managed NWRM will be IAW AFI 21-201.
1.3. Personnel Security Requirements. Personnel who require physical access to NWRM
designated as Restricted Data (RD) or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) must meet the following
requirements:
   1.3.1. Access Requirements to RD and FRD for Department of Defense (DoD) personnel are
   governed by DoDD 5210.02, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data and Formerly
   Restricted Data, as implemented by the AF in AFPD 16-14, Security Enterprise Governance.
   1.3.2. Access requirements to RD and FRD for contractors are outlined in DoDD 5220.22-
   M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, as implemented by the AF in
   AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management.

3.1. Designating items as NWRM:
   3.1.1. Biennially or when criteria in Attachment 2 changes, AFNWC will task Weapon
   System Program Offices (SPO)/System Directorates (SD) to review and provide
   recommended changes to the current NWRM listing based on identification criteria, decision
   matrix and scorecards in Attachment 2. AFNWC will forward recommended changes to
   AF/A4LW and utilize the NWRM SharePoint site for scorecard processing. This process
   also applies to unscheduled list updates. (T-1)
      3.1.1.1. The consolidated list must be in a spreadsheet (one per NSN) which includes a
      new scorecard (Figure A2.6) for each item currently on the NWRM list (remain or delete)
      and a new scorecard for each suggested new addition. (T-1)
      3.1.1.2. Upon receipt of the candidate list, AF/A4LW will review, evaluate and provide a
      recommendation for each item to AF/A4L to include an effective date for the changes.
      AF/A4LW will coordinate with each MAJCOM affected by the changes prior to
      submitting the list to AF/A4L. AF/A4L may approve the list in its entirety or portions
      thereof based on information provided in the scorecards. However, AF/A4L may
      disapprove the entire list and/or request AFNWC provide additional input for items in
      question. The approved list will be posted to the NWRM SharePoint IAW paragraph
      2.1.3 of this Instruction on the effective date of the changes and the following AF
      organizations will be notified:

                                          Chapter 7

       DEPOT/FIELD/CONTRACTOR LEVEL MAINTENANCE PROCESSING

7.1. Maintenance Processing
   7.1.1. Ensure S/N tracking and control are maintained for all NWRM through the entire
   maintenance process from the time it is accepted from supply/stock until it is either expended
   in-use or placed back on the APSR. (T-0)
      7.1.1.1. Any NWRM not subsequently reinstalled or reassembled in the same
      maintenance action will be placed on the APSR to update the stock record account (a
      change of physical possession is not required to place items on APSR) within 24 hours of
      disassembly or removal. Local procedures/operating instructions will be developed to
      ensure NWRM is placed on the APSR. (T-0)
          7.1.1.1.1. All disassembled or removed NWRM no longer required will be properly
          tagged to ensure, at a minimum, item identification, S/N tracking and condition code
          status. (T-0)
          7.1.1.1.2. Personnel will utilize the applicable TO to positively identify NWRM and
          complete required documentation (DD Form 1500 series tag, AF Form 4387, AF
          Form 2005, AFTO Form 350, etc.). Discrepancies between technical order and asset
          markings will be identified using the applicable technical assistance process IAW TO
          00-25-107 or AFMCMAN 21-1, Chapter 5. (T-1)
      7.1.1.2. NWRM disassembled or removed during the maintenance process are not
      required to be placed on the APSR when the item is intended to be reassembled or
      installed during the same maintenance action (e.g. 24-month inspection, reentry system
      recycle, depot overhaul, etc.). Local procedures/operating instructions will be developed
      to ensure S/N tracking and accountability is maintained throughout the entire
      maintenance process. (T-1)
          7.1.1.2.1. For NWRM in a maintenance/install status, ensure internal tracking, work
          control documents, build up sheets or configuration records reflect the fact that
          NWRM is involved. Completed documents/records shall reflect the involved S/N of
          the NWRM and be reported IAW 00-20-series TOs and/or AFI 21-XXX series
          instructions. (T-1)
          7.1.1.2.2. When NWRM higher level assemblies are disassembled, ensure that the
          S/Ns of embedded NWRM undergoing a maintenance action are recorded on/in the
          applicable Work Control Document/Work Order for the action, the appropriate AF
          Maintenance Information Systems and/or the approved AFMC depot maintenance
          system for depot maintenance actions. (T-2)
      7.1.1.3. Maintenance processing for CAS-managed NWRM will be IAW AFI 21-201.
      S/N tracking and accountability for CAS-managed NWRM in maintenance will be done
      on CAS stock record account throughout the entire maintenance process. Use DIFM
      issue procedures in AFI 21-201 for munitions NWRM that are issued to replace installed
      components. (T-1)

  7.1.2. Continue tracking of NWRM assets due to partial demilitarization, removal of lower
  assemblies and/or parts for repair or safing even if the asset is no longer able to perform the
  function that led to the item being identified as NWRM. (T-1)
     7.1.2.1. If the partially demilitarized, safed or incomplete asset is reassigned a different
     NSN per technical data, the data plate of the item is removed and replaced with a data
     plate reflecting the new NSN and the tracking and/or APSR is updated to show the new
     NSN, then the new item does not need to be tracked as NWRM, unless the new NSN is
     identified on the NWRM listing. (T-1)
     7.1.2.2. If the partially demilitarized, safed or incomplete item is reassigned a different
     NSN then create and process a Demilitarization Certificate, IAW Chapter 10 of this
     Instruction, for the original item. (T-1)
  7.1.3. Unserviceable NWRM will be promptly marked with the correct condition and will
  not be co-mingled with serviceable items or other unserviceable items of another condition.
  (T-0) Segregate using ropes, tape, placards and/or painted lines.
AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    27


                                         Chapter 8

                              INVENTORIES AND AUDITS

8.1. Inventories: Inventories must be performed, by S/N and/or UII, on all NWRM to ensure
asset balances are accurately reflected on accounts. (T-0)
   8.1.1. Inventory Intent and Timeframe. A complete physical inventory count of NWRM by
   S/N and/or UII will be conducted semiannually in Mar/Apr and Sep/Oct. All NWRM must
   be identified in the APSR and must be inventoried. (T-1)
   8.1.2. Specific dates will be determined through a coordinated effort between HQ AFMC
   and the affected MAJCOMs.
   8.1.3. Inventory Procedures and Reporting. In addition to procedures in this AFI, supply
   managed NWRM inventories (executed by the NWRMAO) will be conducted IAW the
   procedures in AFI 23-101 and CAS managed NWRM inventories (ensured by the MASO)
   will be conducted IAW AFI 21-201. The reporting of these inventories, to include
   discrepancies, will be accomplished IAW with this instruction and AFMAN 23-122. AFMC
   will produce an annual report in January for the previous year’s semi-annual inventories.
   The report will include any NWRM inventory adjustments made during the previous year.
      8.1.3.1. Weapons/Missiles that contain NWRM installed assets on the APSR will not be
      grounded or disassembled for the purpose of conducting an inventory. In this case,
      records checks will be performed to validate the installed asset by S/N and/or UII and
      reported to account for these items. (T-1)
      8.1.3.2. Installed NWRM not on the APSR are not subject to this NWRM inventory
      requirement until end item disassembly and recording of the NWRM asset. (T-1)
      8.1.3.3. NWRM accounted for as installed but disassembled as part of an on-going
      maintenance action IAW Chapter 7 of this Instruction are subject to inventory. (T-1)
      8.1.3.4. All NWRM end items/Line Replacement Unit (LRU) on the APSR (e.g. mock-
      ups, trainers, those LRUs used in a testing and/or maintenance environment) requiring
      disassembly or where disassembly prevents the operation of the end item will not be
      physically counted during this inventory. In this case, records checks will be performed
      to validate these assets by S/N and/or UII and reported to account for these items. (T-1)
      8.1.3.5. NWRM issued on an AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, must be
      physically inventoried and matched to the item record. The AF IMT 1297 will not be
      used in place of physical asset verification during the inventory. (T-1)
      8.1.3.6. The semiannual inventory requires a visual verification of NWRM by both the
      inventory officer and verifying individual. Banded, crated and/or sealed assets showing
      no signs of tampering must be opened and inventoried every 3 years. Obtain component
      S/N/UII from the exterior packaging/tag (DD Form 1500 series), to include any leading
      alpha character and zeroes. When a container must be opened, qualified personnel
      identified in paragraph 2.12.4 of this Instruction will inspect NWRM property to verify
      the identity, quantity and S/Ns. The inventory officer and the verifying officer will sign
      the inventory count cards or CAS inventory count sheets. (T-0)
 28                                                           AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014


8.1.4. Change of NWRMAO or MASO.

8.1.4.1. Each time a new NWRMAO is assigned, the gaining and losing NWRMAO must
conduct a complete inventory of NWRM within the stock record account IAW AFI 23-101 and
report all discrepancies found IAW this instruction. (T-1)

      8.1.4.2. Each time a new MASO is assigned, the gaining and losing MASO must conduct
      a complete inventory of NWRM managed in CAS IAW procedures in AFI 21-201 and
      report all discrepancies found IAW this instruction. (T-1)
   8.1.5. Change of Custody. Each time a new Equipment/SPRAM custodian is assigned, the
   gaining custodian must conduct a complete inventory of items issued to his/her custody
   account, IAW AFI 23-101. Report any unresolved discrepancies to the NWRMAO and the
   appropriate commander to initiate a Report of Survey (ROS) (or other appropriate actions)
   prior to signing the Custody Receipt listing and assuming responsibility for the account. (T-
   1)
   8.1.6. World Wide Inventory (WWI) will be done in concert with the Semiannual Inventory
   Report (SIR) if any supported units conduct NWRM WWI IAW TO 11N-100-3150, Joint
   Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports, to include the supported geographically
   separated units. Requests to change a unit’s SIR month must be processed IAW AFI 21-203.
   (T-1)
      8.1.6.1. Units that do not conduct a SIR IAW TO 11N-100-3150 will conduct the
      NWRM inventory in the months of March and September. (T-1)
      8.1.6.2. The inventory month may be adjusted for valid nuclear surety criteria. To
      request a waiver to change the inventory month, submit a request through your
      appropriate chain of command to the waiver tier authority IAW AFI 33-360. Waiver
      requests must state the impact on the unit or supporting rationale and will be submitted
      NLT 45 calendar days prior to the scheduled inventory start date. (T-1)
   8.1.7. Reportable discrepancies found during the NWRM semiannual inventories will be
   reported IAW criteria in Chapter 11 of this Instruction. (T-1)
      8.1.7.1. Causative research is required on any inventory discrepancies (gains or losses)
      found. Adjustments to the accountable record as a result of the causative research must
      have a ROS accomplished IAW AFMAN 23-122 and be approved at the Flag
      Officer/Senior Executive Service level regardless of dollar value. All causative research
      must be included with the NWRM discrepancy template, ROS, CAS reports IAW AFI
      21-201 and the ILS-S reports IAW AFMAN 23-122. (T-1)
   8.1.8. Inventory Documentation.
      8.1.8.1. The NWRMAO or MASO will ensure AFMAN 23-122 required documentation
      along with the following documents relevant to inventories are maintained IAW AFMAN
      33-363 and disposed of IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS (T-1):
          8.1.8.1.1. Certificate of Inventory
          8.1.8.1.2. Inventory Officer and Verifying Individual appointment letter.
AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       29


          8.1.8.1.3. Inventory count cards and worksheets, or the CAS Inventory Count Listing
          (AM427G).
          8.1.8.1.4. Certificate of audit and audit checklist.
   8.1.9. HQ AFMC will manage the reporting process to ensure MAJCOM NWRM inventory
   results are consolidated and reported to AF/A4L (and info copied to AF/A10) IAW AFMAN
   23-122 and AFI 23-101.
8.2. Account Auditability. The term "audited" as it applies to these procedures denotes a
formal quantitative audit of a specific account (i.e. DODAAC) for the purpose of verifying its
records. Account audits include semiannual audits and special audits:
   8.2.1. Semiannual audit. This audit of account is accomplished in conjunction with the
   NWRM inventory. A verifying individual, appointed by the APO’s appointing official, will
   also be designated as the audit officer and will perform this audit in conjunction with each
   NWRM inventory. (T-1)
   8.2.2. Special audits. The Air Force Audit Agency, higher headquarters, or other
   government agency, such as the Government Accountability Office may direct a special
   audit. For special audits, the agency directing the audit determines its scope.
   8.2.3. Audit Trails.
       8.2.3.1. While a specific audit trail for each transaction varies by transaction type, there
       are general requirements that constitute an adequate audit trail. The audit trail begins
       with letters of authorization. These letters, signed by appropriate approving officials,
       IAW governing directives, provide the authorization for individuals to request and or
       receipt for property, report or process accountable transactions to the NWRMAO or
       MASO or his/her representatives, and maintain or process account records on his/her
       behalf and subject to his/her validation. The audit trail continues with paper or
       electronically filed source documents (e.g. receipt, shipping, issue and turn-in documents,
       inventory adjustment documents, etc.) supporting the transactions. These documents are
       controlled through the use of document registers, control logs or electronic management,
       and are numbered sequentially or titled IAW standard formats so that the documents are
       traceable, and it is easy to determine when they are missing. The audit trail includes
       proper preparation of these documents using approved procedures and signatures (when
       required) of approved individuals. Account stock records then tie the supporting
       documents to changes in account balances reflected on individual lines of the stock
       records. The audit trail continues with periodic inventories that demonstrate the accuracy
       of account balances compared to physical identification and counts of property. The
       audit trail also includes certificates of transfer of accountability.
       8.2.3.2. Semiannual or other directed audits provide an independent assessment of
       account records to ensure proper accountability is maintained, an accurate audit trail
       exists and proper accounting procedures are being followed. Audits are performed either
       by an outside agency or by a disinterested individual. The audit consists of reviewing a
       representative sample of accounting and transaction records to determine if approved
       accounting procedures are adequate and are being followed, and to assess the accuracy of
       the APSR and completeness of the audit trail. If inaccuracies or irregularities are
30                                                            AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014


     discovered, the sample is increased to determine the extent of the inaccuracy or
     irregularity. In general, an audit provides assurance that:
         8.2.3.2.1. The APO has been duly appointed and meets qualifications required by
         pertinent directives.
         8.2.3.2.2. Certificates of transfer of accountability indicate an unbroken chain of
         accountability between accountable individuals.
         8.2.3.2.3. Proper periodic inventories are being conducted as required and stock
         records reflect accurate balances as of the latest 100-percent inventory.
         8.2.3.2.4. Personnel properly authorized to maintain the account are posting
         transactions to account records as transactions occur, and that personnel are
         knowledgeable of required procedures.
         8.2.3.2.5. Required reports are submitted IAW directive timelines.
         8.2.3.2.6. Transactions posted to the APSR are adequately supported by source
         documents that are properly prepared and only properly supported transactions are
         posted to account records.
         8.2.3.2.7. All original accountable documents are properly filed/maintained as
         determined by a review of document registers, document control logs and files.
         8.2.3.2.8. Personnel who receive property are authorized to do so IAW appropriate
         guidance/procedures.
         8.2.3.2.9. An adequate audit trail exists indicating approved accounting procedures
         are followed.
         8.2.3.2.10. Air Force, higher headquarters and local NWRM management guidance
         is effective in meeting PIC requirements. Auditors will recommend changes to
         management policies through appropriate channels.
  8.2.4. Appointing the audit officer. The APO’s appointing authority will designate a
  verifying individual as the audit officer in writing IAW paragraphs 2.8.4 or 2.9.3 of this
  Instruction. (T-1)
  8.2.5. Briefing the audit officer. NWRMAO or MASO brief the audit officer, who conducts
  the audit IAW procedures in this document, using the checklist in Attachment 3 as a guide.
  Prior to the start of the audit, the NWRMAO or MASO reviews the checklist with the audit
  officer, provides examples of documents to illustrate items shown in the checklist and
  answers any questions the audit officer may have concerning the requirements of the audit.
  (T-1)
  8.2.6. Performing the audit. The audit officer must:
     8.2.6.1. Review the previous audit report. During the audit, place special emphasis on
     ensuring that all previously noted discrepancies were corrected. (T-1)
     8.2.6.2. Review document registers/transaction histories and inventory all documents
     created since the last audit to ensure all documents are on file. For forced receipts, ensure
     the shipper’s document number is cross-referenced in the Remarks column of the
AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       31


       register. Ensure all documents on file are either original documents (paper or electronic)
       or certified true copies of original documents. (T-1)
       8.2.6.3. Review a 10-percent representative sample of all shipping, receipt, issue and
       turn-in documents since the last audit for all NWRM. Ensure documents were properly
       prepared and only authorized personnel signed for the items on the documents. Ensure
       NWRM S/Ns are posted on all documents. (T-1) If the reviewer deems it necessary, or
       when directed by local authorities or higher headquarters, a 100-percent audit may be
       performed in cases where serious inaccuracies or irregularities exist, or where an
       adequate audit trail does not exist. The audit may result in a requirement for a 100-
       percent inventory to reestablish accountability.
   8.2.7. Audit Documentation:
       8.2.7.1. Upon audit completion, the audit officer will:
          8.2.7.1.1. Prepare a "Certificate of Audit" using the format in Attachment 4. (T-1)
          8.2.7.1.2. Attach a copy of the completed checklist, from Attachment 3, to the
          certificate. (T-1)
          8.2.7.1.3. Distribute the original Certificate of Audit to the appointing authority and
          the APO (NWRMAO or MASO). (T-1)
       8.2.7.2. The APO (NWRMAO or MASO) will forward the Certificate of Audit and the
       attached checklist to the accountable officer appointing authority and the MAJCOM
       NWRM POC, with a courtesy copy to the audit officer. The MAJCOM NWRM POC
       will utilize for audit and inventory validation. (T-1)
   8.2.8. Documents. The following will be maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363:
       8.2.8.1. Pertinent appointment letters and orders, designations and delegations of
       authority and authorization letters.
       8.2.8.2. Certificates of transfer of accountability.
       8.2.8.3. Records of inventory.
8.3. Inventory Adjustments Procedures: All Air Force members and employees can be held
liable for the loss, damage or destruction of government property proximately caused by their
negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of
Survey for Air Force Property. After conducting an inventory, quantities of assets counted will
be reconciled against stock records. Discrepancies will require research and supporting
documentation IAW AFI 23-101 or AFI 21-201 for CAS managed NWRM. (T-1)
   8.3.1. If an inventory discrepancy (gain or loss) is discovered, the NWRMAO or MASO will
   notify the NTCC and initiate an ROS within 24 hours IAW the procedures in AFMAN 23-
   220 and AFI 21-201 for CAS managed NWRM. (T-1)
       8.3.1.1. The NWRMAO or MASO must ensure that required causative research is
       conducted and forwarded to the NTCC for IM approval authorization prior to the
       adjustment of any APSR. Research must be completed within 30 calendar days of the
       inventory close-out date. (T-1)
       8.3.1.2. Prior to performing or authorizing an inventory adjustment transaction, IMs will:
32                                                             AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014


         8.3.1.2.1. Ensure required causative research has been performed and the NWRMAO
         or MASO has received approval from the first Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service
         in the NWRMAO or MASO’s chain of command. This is required regardless of
         NWRM dollar value or classification. (T-1)
         8.3.1.2.2. Provide written notification to units approving or disapproving inventory
         adjustments (T-1). Detailed explanations should be provided for disapproved

         DEMILITARIZATION, EXPENDITURE, AND DISPOSAL OF NWRM

10.1. General.
   10.1.1. All NWRM declared excess to Air Force requirements will be demilitarized,
   destroyed or disposed of IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, DoD
   4160.28-M Volume 1 - 3, Defense Demilitarization, and applicable guidance in AFI 23-101
   and AFI 21-201. DOE-designed items will be demilitarized and disposed of IAW TO 11N-
   100-1. Demilitarization and disposal of NWRM is required within two years of
   excess/condemned determination. Process NWRM for demilitarization in accordance with
   approved AF Demilitarization Plans or as directed by the item manager.
   10.1.2. Disposal of NWRM also applies to NWRM expended or destroyed in test and
   evaluation programs.       Documentation would be the same as below to show
   destruction/expenditure and provided to the IM to be processed off the AF record. The IM
   will provide NWRMAOs direction to remove NWRM from the base-level APSR. (T-1)
10.2. Demilitarization Codes. All NWRM will be assigned demilitarization codes G or P.
Demilitarization Code G (applies to ammunition and explosives) and Demilitarization Code P
(applies to classified articles) must be demilitarized prior to transfer of the resulting scrap to
DLA Disposition Services (DLADS).
10.3. NWRM Demilitarization Instructions. NWRM may be demilitarized, destroyed or
expended by various agencies: other services, Air Force organic maintenance or contractor.
Completion of a Demilitarization Certificate IAW with DoDM 4160.28, Vol 3 is required, by
S/N, for all destroyed or expended NWRM. This requires two signatures (certifier and verifier).
When a built up asset (one that has numerous NSNs) is destroyed/expended, the Demilitarization
Certificate must include all NWRM NSNs and the S/Ns that were destroyed/expended as part of
the action taken on the built up asset.
   10.3.1. For NWRM demilitarized and/or destroyed/expended by AF maintenance personnel,
   different individuals within the maintenance organization must certify and verify the action.
   The completed Demilitarization Certificate will be provided to the IM. (T-1)
   10.3.2. For NWRM demilitarized/destroyed/expended by other services or by contractors,
   the demilitarization will be witnessed and verified by an Air Force, DCMA or NNSA
   representative. The certifier will be responsible for completing the Demilitarization
   Certificate and forwarding it to the IM upon demilitarization/destruction/expenditure
   completion. The other services or contractor representative will sign as the verifier.
10.4. Demilitarization of Demilitarization Coded P and G NWRM.
   10.4.1. All assets must be rendered safe, declassified and demilitarized IAW AFI 23-101 or
   AFI 21-201 for CAS managed explosive NWRM. (T-1)
   10.4.2. Scrap material from the completely demilitarized assets will be transferred to
   DLADS. (T-1)
   10.4.3. Scrap material generated as the result of NWRM demilitarization will be transferred
   only to DLADS, not to a Base Resource Recycling and Recovery Program. When NWRM

Terms
Accountability—The degree of responsibility for property that exists when a record of property
is maintained on a numbered stock record account that is subject to audit.
AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     47


Accountable Documents—all documents involving transactions that increase or decrease the
stock record account balance.
Accountable Property Officer—An individual who, based on his or her training, knowledge,
and experience in property management, accountability and control procedures, is appointed by
proper authority to establish and maintain an organization’s accountable property records,
systems, and/or financial records, in connection with Government property, irrespective of
whether the property is in the individual's possession.
Accountable Property System of Record—The system used to control and manage
accountable property records; a subset of existing organizational processes related to the
lifecycle management of property; the system that is integrated with the core financial system.
Arming—Operations that configure a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system so application
of a single signal will start the action required for obtaining a nuclear detonation.
Authorization—The critical function that prevents unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon
system.
Auditable Documents— All documents involving transactions that change the transaction
history and/or other indicative data on the item record.
Custody—The responsibility for the control of, transfer and movement of, and access to,
weapons and components. Custody also includes the maintenance of accountability for weapons
and components.
Defense Transportation System—The Defense Transportation System is that portion of the
worldwide transportation infrastructure that supports Department of Defense transportation
needs in peace and war. The Defense Transportation System consists of two major elements:
military (organic) and commercial resources. These resources include aircraft, assets, services
and systems organic to, contracted for or controlled by the Department of Defense.
Delivery vehicle— the portion of a weapon system that delivers a nuclear weapon to its target.
This includes cruise and ballistic missile airframes as well as delivery aircraft.
Formerly Restricted Data (FRD)—The term Formerly Restricted Data applies to classified
defense information which (a) has been removed from the Restricted Data category in order to
conform with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and (b) cannot be released to foreign nationals
except under specific international agreements.
In-Transit Visibility (ITV)—The ability to track the identity, status, and location of Department
of Defense units and non-unit cargo (excluding bulk petroleum, oils, and lubricants) and
passengers, medical patients, and personal property from origin to consignee or destination
across the range of military logistics operations.
Inventory Adjustment—The accounting transaction, which corrects a book balance to agree
with the quantity of the item in storage. Such adjustments may result from (1) physical
inventory, (2) a potential discrepancy revealed by a materiel release denial or location
survey/reconciliation, and (3) erroneous capitalization/ decapitalization actions. Excluded are
adjustment transactions caused by (1) reidentification of stock, (2) type of pack changes, (3)
standard price changes, (4) catalog data changes, (5) supply condition and purpose code changes,
and (6) condemnation of materiel resulting from rebuild and surveillance programs. Adjustment
transactions directly attributed to computer malfunctions, program errors, and correction of
 48                                                              AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014


computer system time lags will not be categorized as adjustments due to physical inventory. All
such adjustment transactions identified during research will be assigned the appropriate error
classification code, and supply system managers will monitor the rate of occurrence.
Item—A single hardware article or a single unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies,
components, or constituent parts. (DFARS 252.211-7003).
Item Unique Identification (IUID)—A system of establishing unique item identifiers within
DoD by assigning a machine-readable character string or number to a discrete item, which serves
to distinguish it from other “like” and “unlike” items.
Launch—Propulsion of a reentry vehicle, gravity bomb or nuclear warhead into flight beyond
the immediate area of the launching site.
Life Cycle—The span of time associated with a system, subsystem, or end item that begins with
the conception and initial development of the requirement, continues through development,
acquisition, fielding, and sustainment until the time it is either consumed in use or disposed of as
being excess to all known materiel requirements.
Line Replacement Unit (LRU)—An essential support item removed and replaced at field level
to restore an end item to an operationally ready condition. (Also called Weapon Replacement
Assembly and Module Replacement Unit.)
Nuclear Weapon—A complete assembly (i.e., implosion type, gun type, or thermonuclear type),
in its intended ultimate configuration which, upon completion of the prescribed arming, fusing,
and firing sequence, is capable of producing the intended nuclear reaction and release of energy.
Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (OSD Definition)—Classified or unclassified assemblies
and subassemblies (containing no fissionable or fusionable materiel) identified by the Military
Departments that comprise or could comprise a standardized war reserve nuclear weapon
(including equivalent training devices) as it would exist once separated/removed from its
intended delivery vehicle.
Positive Inventory Control (PIC)—The ability to identify and account for NWRM by S/N and
to be cognizant of the condition and location of these items in near real time. Assets are tightly
controlled and in secure areas.
Pre-arming—Nuclear weapon system operations that configure a nuclear weapon so that
arming, launching, or releasing will start the sequence necessary to produce a nuclear detonation.
Property Custodian—An individual appointed by the APO, who accepts custodial
responsibility for property, typically by signing a hand-receipt. The property custodian is
directly responsible for the physical custody of accountable property under their control.
Receiver—The activity or agency at which the Defense Transportation Service shipment
terminates. The activity is usually the ultimate consignee, but may also be the agent for the
ultimate consignee (e.g., a central receiving point or a temporary storage point for the ultimate
consignee).
Release—In air armament, release is the intentional separation of a free-fall aircraft store from
its suspension equipment for purposes of employment of the store.
AFI20-110 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       49

Shop Replacement Unit (SRU)—A SRU is an item required to repair a Line Replacement Unit
(LRU). SRUs do not include expendable (bit and piece) items.
Stock Record Account—A HQ USAF prescribed numbered record of transactions of property
subject to audit. All stock record accounts are assigned an official AF number by HQ AFMC
and are maintained by an accountable supply officer.
Tampering—Refers to a variety of forms of sabotage and is often used to mean intentional
modifications or attempts to alter by making unauthorized changes.
Targeting—Operations that involve identifying specific target sets, transferring target data to a
guidance computer, or designating the intended flight path to the target.
T-0— Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g. Congress, White House, OSD, JS).
Requirement external to AF; Requests for waivers must be processed through command channels
to publication OPR for consideration. (Source AFI 33-360).
T-1— Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF strongly at risk of mission or
program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waiver
authority is MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director), with the
concurrence of the publication’s Approving Official (Source AFI 33-360).
