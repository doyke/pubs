ment. It applies to responsible members of the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron (366 CES), facility manag-
ers, squadron commanders, and the 366th Comptroller Squadron, Financial Services Officer (366 CPTS/

posed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://

    2.1. When housing inspectors, housing contract quality assurance evaluators, facility managers,
    squadron commanders, or real property accountable officer determines a family housing unit, other
    government real property facility, unaccompanied housing unit, or installed real property has been
    damaged beyond fair wear and tear, they will then submit an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
    Request, to 366 CES/CEOSC (Customer Service) identifying damage and, if possible, the identity and
    status of individual(s) responsible for the damage. (Note: When home addresses and/or home phone
    numbers are annotated on any forms mentioned in this instruction, mark the form "For Official Use
    Only."
    2.2. If the individual responsible for the damages agrees to voluntarily reimburse the government and
    has TDY or PCS orders, follow the instructions in Attachment 2, Voluntary Payment Based on Esti-
    mated Repair Costs Instructions.
    2.3. If the individual responsible for damages agrees to voluntarily reimburse the government and
    does not have TDY or PCS orders, follow the instructions in Attachment 3, Voluntary Payment
    Based on Completed Repair Costs Instructions.
    2.4. If the Individual responsible for damages does not agree to voluntarily reimburse the government
    for damages, follow the instructions in Attachment 4, Nonvoluntary Payment Based on Report of
    Survey Instructions.
    2.5. Reimbursable work orders must receive prompt attention from responsible personnel at each step
    in the procedure. Personnel clearing Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) must receive expeditous service
    to ensure required documents are processed within a 24-hour period. Ensure charges are based on a
    fair and reasonable statement of costs to restore property upon collection.
    2.6. When 366 CES personnel identify a possible facility abuse case, a letter will be sent to the indi-
    vidual’s unit commander, with a copy to their group commander, requesting an investigation, pecuni-
    ary liability determination, and corrective action to prevent recurrence (Attachment 5, Sample
    Facility Damage Memorandum). The letter requests unit commander to provide a written reply to 366
    CES/CC (Commander) of the incident and a complete DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation
    of Property Loss, if required. When individual(s) responsible for the damage cannot be identified by
    the unit commander, unit funds will be transferred to 366 CES/CERF (Financial Management) for
    cost of materials.
       2.6.1. Unit funds will be transferred for each separate work order for material costs of $100 or
       more.
       2.6.2. Work orders, with material costs under $100, will be accumulated until total reaches $100
       or more, at which time the accumulated costs will be transferred to 366 CES/CERF.
       2.6.3. Routine repairs will not be made by 366 CES personnel until the responsible unit com-
       mander investigates the incident and results sent to 366 CES/CC. Temporary emergency repairs
       are authorized to protect personnel and real property.
