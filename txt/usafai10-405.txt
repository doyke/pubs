SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is significantly revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. USAFAI 10-401 has
been renumbered to USAFAI 10-405 due to conflicts with AFI 10-401. Significant changes to
this revision include: Allow at least 15 working days each for 3-ltr and 2-ltr coordination
(paragraph 1.2.1.9.). Resolve any rejected and modified critical (severe impact) comments prior
to submitting a plan through the applicable organization Plans Manager to HQ USAFA/XP
(paragraph 2.3.3.). Mission Elements obtain and maintain all external coordination with non-
USAFA units, including any required Memorandum of Agreement/Memorandum of
Understanding (MOA/MOU), and forward copies to HQ USAFA/XP (paragraph 2.3.10.).
