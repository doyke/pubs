   1.3. Additional Special Pay (ASP). Lump sum annual payment for Medical and Dental Corps offic-
   ers.
       1.3.1. Medical Corps. A physician who is not undergoing internship or initial residency training
       is entitled to additional special pay of $15,000 annually. HQ AFMPC/DPMMUF1 may use ASP
       contracts as authority to extend a physician’s date of separation (DOS) to match the required com-
       mitment, as long as the DOS does not carry a physician past a mandatory release or retirement
       date.
       1.3.2. Dental Corps. A dentist who is not undergoing dental internship or residency training is
       entitled to additional special pay in the annual amounts outlined in Figure 5. Dental officers must
       apply for a DOS extension to match the required commitment.

3 but less than 14                         6,000
14 but less than 18                        8,000
18 or more                                 10,000

   1.4. Incentive Special Pay (ISP). Lump sum annual payment for Medical Corps officers. HQ
   AFMPC/DPMMUF1 may use single-year ISP contracts as authority to extend a physician’s DOS to
   match the required commitment as long as the DOS does not carry a physician past a mandatory
   release or retirement date.
       1.4.1. Eligibility. A Medical Corps officer is entitled to ISP if the individual is serving in pay
       grade 0-6 or below, is not undergoing medical internship or initial residency training, and is fully
       qualified in a medical specialty and practicing in that specialty. The Assistant Secretary of
       Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) updates the specialties authorized to receive ISP and the ISP
       amount for each specialty on an annual basis. HQ AFMPC/DPMM provides this information to
       each facility upon receipt from ASD(HA).
   1.5. Multi-Year Special Pay (MSP). Lump sum annual payment for Medical Corps officers who
   sign a contract for 2, 3, or 4 years.
       1.5.1. Eligibility. A Medical Corps officer is entitled to MSP if the individual is serving in pay
       grade 0-6 or below, has at least 8 years of creditable service or has completed any active duty ser-
       vice commitment incurred for medical education and training, and has completed specialty quali-
       fication (or is scheduled to complete initial residency training before 1 October of the fiscal year
       in which the member wishes to receive MSP). ASD(HA) updates the specialties authorized to
       receive MSP and specifies the 2, 3, and 4 year MSP amounts on an annual basis. HQ AFMPC/
       DPMM provides this information to each facility upon receipt from ASD(HA).
   1.6. Nurse Anesthetist Pay (NAP). Lump sum annual payment for fully qualified certified regis-
   tered nurse anesthetists (CRNA). Amount of NAP is $6,000. HQ AFMPC/DPMMUF1 may use NAP
   contracts as authority to extend a CRNA’s DOS to match the required commitment, as long as the
   DOS does not carry a CRNA past a mandatory release or retirement date.
   HQ AFMPC/DPMMUF1 initiates this pay.
   1.7. Nurse Accession Bonus (NAB). A bonus initiated by Headquarters Air Force Recruiting Ser-
   vice for eligible Nurse Corps officers that agree to enter active duty for a period of 4 years. Amount
   of NAB is $5,000.
       1.7.1. Eligibility. A nurse is not eligible for the NAB if:
           • The individual received financial assistance from DoD to pursue a baccalaureate degree.
           • The individual holds an appointment as a Nurse Corps officer.



                                                4
       Additionally, an individual with prior active duty service as a Nurse Corps officer must have been
       discharged from active duty at least 12 months prior to execution of the written agreement.
   1.8. Optometry and Veterinary Professional Pay. Payable monthly to optometrists and veterinari-
   ans. Veterinarians assigned as environmental health officers are not eligible. HQ AFMPC/
   DPMMUF1 initiates these pays. Amount of pay is $100 monthly.

Section B—Special Pay for Reserve, Active (Involuntarily Retained), and Recalled Officers

2. Eligibility. The Fiscal Year 92/93 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 102-190, Section
634) provides special pay authority to Medical Corps, Dental Corps, and non-physician health care pro-
viders who are:
    • Reservists called to active duty (other than for training) for a period of not less than 30 days or
       more than 1 year.
    • Active duty health care providers involuntarily retained (under the legislative rules of a contin-
       gency operation) for a period of more than 30 days or who voluntarily agree to remain on active
       duty for a period of less than 1 year when officers are involuntarily retained.
    • Recalled retirees (under the legislative rules of a contingency operation) for a period of more than
       30 days.
   2.1. Payment Information. Officers who fulfill the above eligibility criteria are entitled to a pro-rata
   amount of ASP, VSP, BCP, NAP, and optometry/veterinary special pay for all active duty service.
   Earliest entitlement date is 5 December 1991.

Section C—Special Pay Withholding or Termination

3. Approval Authority. The Air Force Surgeon General, as designated by the Secretary of the Air Force,
may withhold or terminate at any time an officer’s entitlement to ASP, ISP, MSP, or NAP. Withholding
or termination is based on unprofessional conduct, medical incompetence, noncompliance with Air Force
standards, or substandard performance. Unprofessional conduct includes the failure to attain or maintain
Air Force standards of military or medical performance. Substandard performance refers to substandard
performance as an officer and/or as health care provider.
   3.1. Withholding or Termination Action. The basis for initiating both actions are the same, as are
   the procedures involved (AFP 36-58 explains in detail both procedures). There are, however, signifi-
   cant differences. For example, once a special pay contract has been terminated, it can not be rein-
   stated, and a new contract must be submitted. Termination action results in the Air Force recouping
   the unearned portion of the special pay, as well as the potential adjustment to the officer’s ADSC.
   Withholding pay, on the other hand, does not end an active multi-year contract. A withholding action
   anticipates the possibilityof an officer’s exoneration or improvement with subsequent return of all
   withheld pays to the individual--the ADSC is not adjusted. Termination action, however, does not




                                                5
anticipate exoneration or improvement and is therefore more definitive. A withholding action can
also be used in connection with contracts before they become active. Consequently, the commander
can recommend disapproval of a new contract or renewal of an existing one. If at a later date the
health care provider improves, the commander may reinstate special pay privileges and the effective
date becomes the date the agreement is signed.

Terms
Creditable Service for Medical Corps Officers—Physicians receive creditable service only for the

                                               7
standard number of years that the appropriate American medical or osteopathic specialty board requires.
However, physicians may receive 6 months’ credit for time spent in a chief resident program. Physicians
who complete a portion of a residency year before entering active duty and then complete the rest of the
training year on active duty receive credit for the training completed before entering active duty.
Physicians receive credit only for prior active duty periods of 1 year or longer.
Creditable Service for Dental Corps Officers—Dentists receive credit only for active duty periods of 1
year or longer.
Medical Service Pay Date (MSPD)—HQ AFMPC and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service use
the MSPD to determine a physician’s or dentist’s eligibility and amounts of special pay. To calculate the
MSPD for a physician or dentist, subtract the officer’s creditable service from the extended active duty
date.
Medical, Osteopathic, or Dental Internship—The first year of graduate medical education, whether a
formal internship or the first year of residency, immediately following medical, osteopathic, or dental
school.
Initial Residency Training—That period of time in residency training before formally completing a first
residency that qualifies an officer as board eligible. To qualify for ASP, Medical Corps officers must
have a formal postgraduate medical training program of 2 or more academic years in their initial
residency training. Board certification based on specialty experience also fulfills ASP initial residency
requirements for physicians. Dental Corps officers may only use programs that qualify them as board
eligible to receive ASP.
Fully Qualified—(definition varies by corps) --A physician who has completed a residency training
program or is board certified or board eligible in a medical specialty and, if involved in independent
patient care, has received credentials in that specialty is considered fully qualified. A dentist who has
successfully completed an American Dental Association accredited dental school and, if involved in
independent patient care, has received credentials is considered fully qualified. A nurse anesthetist who
has passed the certification examination from the Council on Certification of Nurse Anesthetists is fully
qualified.
