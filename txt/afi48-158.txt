The purpose of this instruction provides the requirements for a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP),
assigns responsibilities, and provides guidance for protecting workers from the health hazards
presented by hazardous chemicals used in the laboratory work environment.

This instruction implements the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Standard Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.1450, Occupational Exposure to
Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories, for Air Force laboratories that meet the definition of a
laboratory in this instruction. The OSHA regulation and this instruction prescribe the minimum
requirements for an effective chemical hygiene program for Air Force laboratories. Major
Commands (MAJCOMs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Field Operating Agencies (FOAs)
may not waive any of these requirements, but may supplement this instruction when additional
or more stringent criteria are required. Request for Tier waivers must be submitted through the
chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. Send comments and
suggested improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through
channels, to AFMSA/SG3PB, 7700 Arlington Blvd, Falls Church, VA 22042. Refer to AFI 33-
360, Publications and Forms Management, for instructions on processing supplements,
variances, and Tier waiver authority. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS). The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product,
commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement the Air Force.
Implementation of this AFI shall supersede, for laboratories, the requirements of all other OSHA
 2                                                                AFI48-158 27 MARCH 2014


Health Standards contained in 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances,
except as noted in 29 CFR 1910.1450 (a) (2). Other requirements, such as the Occupational and
Environmental Exposure Limits (OEELs) and the Occupational and Environmental Health
Program are not altered for laboratory operations.

This instruction applies to laboratory operations, as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1450, performed by
United States (US) civilian and military workers and direct hire foreign nationals (as established
by the Status of Forces Agreements) of the Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
Reserve. Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) laboratories within the continental
United States (CONUS) or US territories shall implement 29 CFR 1910.1450. GOCO
laboratories located outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the CONUS or the US territories that
are not covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act shall comply with this instruction in
response to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification
and Material Safety Data and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS),
Clause 252. 233-7001, Choice of Law Overseas. Contracting Officers shall include this clause in
the appropriate section of the contract.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include update of several references to align with updated publications and changes were made
to organizational and individual responsibilities.

                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This instruction only applies to uses of hazardous chemicals that meet the
definition of Laboratory Use of Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.1450 (b)). The definition
typically encompasses educational, histopathology, clinical, and small experimental laboratories.
It specifically excludes routine tests or operations that are part of, or adjunct to, a production
operation. Therefore, this instruction usually does not apply to dental, pharmacy, nondestructive
inspection (NDI), precision measurement equipment laboratories (PMEL), and quality control
labs. This instruction does not apply to laboratory operations that rely solely on prepackaged,
commercially-prepared kits. JBAIDS labs and most Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE)
drinking water test procedures rely on these kits and, therefore, these laboratories would not be
covered by this standard. Refer to the OSHA website for interpretation at:
http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATION
S&p_id=20190.
1.2. Laboratories. In laboratories where this instruction applies, the requirements of AFI 90-
821, Hazard Communication, do not apply.
1.3. Evaluation and Control. The evaluation and control of biological hazards associated with
laboratory operations will be made in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1910.1030, Bloodborne
Pathogens.

Terms
Shall—Indicates a mandatory requirement.
Will—Indicates a mandatory requirement which expresses a declaration of intent, probability or
determination.
Should—Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
May—Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
Action Level—An exposure level that dictates active air monitoring, medical monitoring, and
worker training. The Action Level for airborne exposures is typically one-half the Occupational
& Environmental Exposure Limit for time-weighted average (TWA) exposures, except where 29
CFR 1910 Subpart Z designates a different concentration or where the statistical variability of
sample results indicates that a lower fraction of the OEEL should be used as the Action Level.
Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO)—All CHOs will have a detailed working knowledge of the
operating procedures, chemical hazards, and precautions for the laboratory to which they are
named CHO.
Hazardous Chemical—Any material which is a physical hazard or health hazard as defined in
Federal Standard 313, Material Safety Data, Transportation Data and Disposal Data for
Hazardous Materials Furnished to Government Activities.
Hazards—Chemical laboratory hazards are divided into two categories: health hazards and
physical hazards.
(i) Health hazards—Chemicals can produce health hazards from long-term (chronic) or short-
term (acute) exposures, or both. Exposure to chemicals that present health hazards in a
laboratory can occur through inhalation, ingestion, absorption through the skin, and skin surface
contact. Health effects from these exposures vary from minor irritation and temporary illness to
permanent organ damage and cancer.
(ii) Physical hazards—A chemical can present a physical hazard if it has one of the following
properties: explosive; flammable (gases, aerosols, liquids, or solids); oxidizer (liquid, solid, or
gas); self-reactive; pyrophoric (gas, liquid or solid); self-heating; corrosive to metal; gas under
pressure; when in contact with water emits flammable gas; or combustible dust

Laboratory—A facility where the "laboratory use of hazardous chemicals" occurs. It is a
workplace where relatively small quantities of hazardous chemicals are used on a non-production
basis.
Laboratory scale—means work with substances in which the containers used for reactions,
transfers, and other handling of substances are designed to be easily and safely manipulated by
one person. "Laboratory scale" excludes those workplaces whose function is to produce
commercial quantities of materials
Laboratory use of hazardous chemicals—means handling or use of such chemicals in which
all of the following conditions are met: (i) Chemical manipulations are carried out on a
"laboratory scale;" (ii) Multiple chemical procedures or chemicals are used; (iii) The procedures
involved are not part of a production process, nor in any way simulate a production process; and
(iv) "Protective laboratory practices and equipment" are available and in common use to
minimize the potential for employee exposure to hazardous chemicals.
Occupational and Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL)—The OEEL is the most
appropriate limit adopted from established recognized standards including, but not limited to,
