This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-9, Civil Law for Individuals, and
provides the framework for the disposition of juvenile misconduct cases and the treatment of
juvenile offenders. The purpose of this instruction is to establish responsibilities and procedures
for the administrative disposition of misconduct committed by juveniles at Tinker Air Force
Base (AFB) and to establish the Tinker AFB Juvenile Assistance Council (JAC). The JAC will
hear all cases in which a juvenile is alleged to have engaged in misconduct or cases referred to it
by the 72d Air Base Wing (72 ABW). The JAC will determine the appropriate disposition of the
case by weighing the best interests of the juvenile and Tinker AFB. The action taken will be
designed to attain the primary goal of maintaining good order and discipline at Tinker AFB and,
if possible, to rehabilitate the juvenile offender. This instruction applies to juveniles who engage
in misconduct at Tinker AFB and are dependents of personnel stationed at Tinker AFB (to
include all personnel administratively assigned to 72 ABW) or dependents of active duty or
retired military personnel using Tinker AFB facilities. Applies to Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard unites except where noted otherwise. This instruction also applies to the sponsors
of juveniles who engage in misconduct at Tinker AFB. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm                    See

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This has been substantially revised. Changes include administrative modifications, such as
renumbering of all paragraphs, as well as substantive changes which modify the purpose and
procedures of the JAC. Please review this publication in its entirety.
1. Authority.
     1.1. Title 18 United States Code (USC) Sections 5031-5042 set forth a strong preference that
     juvenile misconduct which amounts to a petty offense or misdemeanor be dealt with outside
     of the federal court system. As such, administrative procedures are authorized.
     1.2. The installation commander is charged with the responsibility for maintaining law and
     order on the base (AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense). To achieve this goal, the installation
     commander may limit or revoke base privileges, as outlined in relevant guidance (e.g., DoDI
     5200.08, Security of DoD Installations…; DoDI 1330.17, Armed Services Commissary
     Operations; AFI 34-211, Army and Air Force Exchange Service Operations; AFI 31-204, Air
     Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision; etc.). The privileges include the following: base
     exchange privileges, commissary privileges, housing privileges, theater privileges, shoppette
     privileges, base driving privileges and the privilege of entering any part (or all) of the base.
     This instruction complies with the foregoing law and instruction by ensuring that an offense
     involving a juvenile is identified, adjudicated and disposed of in a manner that maintains
     good order and discipline while stressing deterrence and rehabilitation of the juvenile.
2. Purpose of the JAC:
     2.1. The JAC is designed to:
        2.1.1. Maintain good order and discipline at Tinker Air Force Base.
        2.1.2. Educate juveniles and their sponsors on the consequences of misconduct and crime
        (i.e., the impact crime has on the juvenile offender, the offender’s family, the victims and
        the community).
        2.1.3. Rehabilitate juveniles through counseling, education, community service,
        restitution and other means of corrective action as recommended by the JAC and ordered
        by the Commander of the 72d Air Base Wing (72 ABW/CC). Therefore, all actions
        should be designed to prevent further misconduct and instill respect for the law in the
        juveniles participating in the JAC.
        2.1.4. Protect the best interests of both the juvenile and the Tinker AFB community.
     2.2. Participation in the JAC Program. Participation by the juvenile in the JAC Program is
     voluntary. However, certain administrative sanctions may be taken against a juvenile
     offender even if the juvenile refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC. (For example,
     the installation commander retains the authority to bar the juvenile from base and to
     terminate on-base housing privileges of the juvenile’s family.) Conversely, certain
     rehabilitative measures, such as referral to counseling, performance of community service or
TINKERAFBI51-100 31 AUGUST 2011                                                                3


   participation in a work program by the juvenile offender, may only be undertaken if the
   juvenile agrees to submit to the JAC’s jurisdiction. Rescission of administrative sanctions
   (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the juvenile’s consent to the
   jurisdiction of the JAC and satisfactory completion by the juvenile offender and/or his or her
   sponsor of such rehabilitative measures ordered by the JAC. If the juvenile refuses to submit
   to the jurisdiction of the JAC, the JAC may refer the case to the Special Assistant United
   States Attorney (SAUSA) for prosecution at Magistrate’s Court as a petty offense under 18
   U.S.C., Section 5032, as may be permitted by law.
3. Composition of the JAC.
   3.1. Composition of the JAC:
       3.1.1. The Deputy Commander, 72d Mission Support Group (72 MSG/CD), shall serve
       as the JAC Chair.

4                                                    TINKERAFBI51-100 31 AUGUST 2011

       memorandum (see Attachment 4) for the 72 ABW/CC’s signature, addressed to the
       juvenile offender, announcing the final disposition of the case. The memorandum shall
       also include information regarding community service, counseling referrals, etc., if
       applicable. Once signed and returned by the 72 ABW/CC, 72 ABW SJA (or designee)
       will ensure the signed memorandum is mailed to the juvenile offender and his or her
       sponsor and a copy forwarded to Report & Analysis (72 SFS/S5R) and Administrative

  4.4. 72 ABW/CC will:
     4.4.1. Review the minutes of the JAC meetings.
     4.4.2. Consider the recommendations of the JAC. The 72 ABW/CC shall take the action
     deemed appropriate for the preservation of good order and discipline at Tinker AFB

        reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the satisfactory completion of such
        programs
5. Conducting JAC meetings.
     5.1. The JAC Chair shall conduct JAC meetings, with input as desired from the various
     members.
     5.2. General guidance.
        5.2.1. The JAC may arrange for the appearance of any witness deemed necessary for the
        resolution of a case. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. The JAC may rely on
        relevant hearsay evidence (to include Security Forces reports), so long as the hearsay
        statement is deemed to be reliable.
        5.2.2. JAC meetings shall be closed to the public, as the information discussed is
        protected from public disclosure by the Privacy Act.
        5.2.3. The JAC meetings are not adversarial proceedings. Neither the juvenile nor his or
        her sponsor has the right to legal counsel during the meeting, to call their own witnesses
        or to cross examine any witnesses called by the JAC. Moreover, nothing in this
        instruction shall be construed to grant any rights to the juvenile or his or her sponsor.
     5.3. Suggested procedure:
        5.3.1. Prior to calling any juveniles, JAC members convene and discuss preliminary
        matters, such as order in which JAC cases shall be heard or any old cases which require
        follow-up.
        5.3.2. When each case is called, the Chair shall explain the purpose and procedures of
        the JAC to each juvenile and/or the juvenile’s parents/sponsor.
        5.3.3. If the juvenile chooses to participate in the JAC, the Chair shall inquire of the
        juvenile as to the factual basis for the case and allow the juvenile an opportunity to voice
        his or her version of the alleged misconduct. This factual inquiry should be thorough
        enough to prove by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., it is more likely than not) that
        the juvenile did in fact commit the misconduct.
        5.3.4. After a factual inquiry has been developed to support a finding of guilt as to the
        allegation, the JAC shall make additional inquiries to determine if circumstances exist
        which might warrant leniency or harsher action against the juvenile.
        5.3.5. Upon the conclusion of this inquiry, the juvenile and his or her parents/sponsor
        will be asked to wait outside while the JAC members discuss the recommendation for an
        appropriate command response to the misconduct. The juvenile and parent/sponsor shall
        then be called back before the JAC to hear the recommended course of action. The Chair
        may also give any verbal counseling/admonishment/reprimand at this time.
        5.3.6. Once the juvenile’s case has been concluded, the Recorder (OC-ALC/JA) shall
        provide any necessary documents (e.g., written instructions detailing actions necessary by
        the juvenile and/or parents/sponsor).
6. Records Management.
TINKERAFBI51-100 31 AUGUST 2011                                                             7

  Privacy Act of 1974 and dispose of such records in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
  Management of Records, and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition–Procedures and

  located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil, units are responsible for the maintenance and disposal
  of electronic or paper records created.
  6.2. No incident system of records will be generated or kept by JAC members. All
  correspondence to the juvenile or his or her sponsor will be hand delivered or mailed via
  United States Postal Service certified mail with return receipt.

Dear (Sponsor’s Name/Rank)

    On (date), your (son/daughter), (juvenile’s full name), shoplifted (name of items) valued at over
(dollar amount) from the (Tinker Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) main store) or
(shoppette). As a result, you and your (son/daughter) met with the Juvenile Assistance Council (JAC) on
(date) to discuss appropriate rehabilitative and compensatory actions.            I have accepted the
recommendations of the JAC and direct the following:

    1. (Juvenile’s first name) AAFES, to include the Base Exchange and Shoppettes, and Commissary
       privileges are suspended for a period of 1 year. If there are no additional infractions and if
       otherwise eligible, (Juvenile’s first name) privileges may be reinstated on (date – one year from
       date of incident).

    2. (Juvenile’s first name) is to perform (number of hours) hours of community service. The
       community service must be completed in accordance with the guidance provided by (JAC Chair’s
       name) during the JAC meeting.

    3. (Juvenile’s first name) will (compose a five-page essay) or (letter of apology to). The (essay or
       letter) must be completed in accordance with the guidance provided by (JAC Chair’s name)
       during the JAC meeting.

    You should send documentation of (Juvenile’s first name) completed actions to (JAC Chair’s name,
72 MSG/CD, at 7460 Arnold St., Suite 227, Tinker AFB, OK, 73145), or you may E-mail him/her at
(JAC Chair’s base email address). Your participation in the JAC is completely voluntary. If you do not
wish to comply with the requirements stated above or do not complete them within the prescribed time
limits, I will consider further action including referral of (Juvenile’s first name) crime to the Special
Assistant United States Attorney for prosecution in U.S. Magistrate Court.

    Shoplifting is a serious crime and I will not tolerate such misconduct on the installation. I sincerely
hope (Juvenile’s first name) understands the impact of his/her actions and as a result will make better
choices in the future. I wish you and your family the very best as you move past this unfortunate incident.

                                                       Regards

                                                       (72 ABW/CC’s name), Colonel, USAF
