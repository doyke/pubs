                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. All evaluations will be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this AFI.
1.2. Recommended Changes and Waivers:
   1.2.1. Submit suggested changes to this AFI via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
   of Publication, to the parent MAJCOM through standardization/evaluation channels. (AF
   Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP]. Refer to that
   publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
   1.2.2. AF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction.
   1.2.3. Except as specified elsewhere in this instruction, and IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
   AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for aircrew requirements in this instruction. Waiver
   requests may be submitted in message or memorandum format and will be sent through the
   stan/eval chain of command.
1.3. Procedures:
   1.3.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 2 for
   conducting flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.3.2. Unless specified, the examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a
   thorough evaluation.
   1.3.3. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
   how it will be conducted. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher headquarters FEs (and unit
   FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission
   materials, and maps (if required).
   1.3.4. Areas required by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, are indicated in Chapter 2 of this AFI.
   When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight, it will be evaluated by an alternate
   method (that is, in a simulator or cockpit procedure trainer [CPT] or by oral examination) to
   complete the evaluation. The alternate method of evaluation will be documented in the
   examiner’s remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification.
   1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include the
   examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must be debriefed on all
   evaluations. Additionally, he or she must attend the debrief if the overall grade is Q-3.
1.4. Grading Instructions:
   1.4.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in grading,
 4                                                               AFI11-2T-6V2 8 AUGUST 2013


     provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
     jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. Compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation
     with the standards provided in this AFI and assign an appropriate grade for the area. Derive
     the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the area grades, based on a
     composite for the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this
     AFI.
     1.4.3. FEs will use the grading criteria in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 to determine individual area
     grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and specific
     situations are not covered.
     1.4.4. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
     identified in this AFI, an overall grade of Q-3 will be assigned.
     1.4.5. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
     1.4.6. Use the following grading criteria on all evaluations to grade individual items:
        1.4.6.1. Q. The examinee’s performance is correct, quickly recognizing and correcting
        errors.
        1.4.6.2. Q-. The examinee’s performance is safe, but with limited proficiency, making
        errors of omission or commission.
        1.4.6.3. U. The examinee’s performance is unsafe, lacking knowledge or ability.
     1.4.7. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 for basic aircraft control apply during all
     phases of flight (except as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches).

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). If available and configured appropriately, a
flight simulator may be used to conduct the requisite EPE for the instrument/qualification
evaluation. If a simulator is not used, the EPE may be given orally.
     1.5.1. The following items will be included on EPEs:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
AFI11-2T-6V2 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                        5


         1.5.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate all boldface procedures and at least one
         emergency procedure per phase of flight.
         1.5.1.3. Unusual attitude recoveries.
         1.5.1.4. At least one approach and use of standby or emergency instruments.
         1.5.1.5. Alternate or divert airfields. Evaluate at least one approach at other than home
         base.
      1.5.2. For EPEs graded “Q” with additional training, the FE will indicate whether the
      additional training must be accomplished before the next flight. Additional training and
      reevaluations will be accomplished in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2.

   1.6.1. Record the aircrew member’s qualification, using AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2.
   1.6.2. All mission evaluations (whether contact, formation, instrument/navigation, or low
   level) will be logged as “MSN” evaluations in the Flight Phase block (Section II) of AF Form
   8. Additional clarification as to the specific type of mission evaluation will be included in the
   Mission Description section of the Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF
   Form 8. (See AFI 11-202, Volume 2, for AF Form 8 requirements.)

                                 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Evaluations Guidelines:
      2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Pilot
      evaluation requirements are shown in Table 2.1 of this AFI. They are divided into the
      following areas: preflight, general, contact, instruments, formation (general), formation
      (lead), formation (wing), navigation, low-level navigation, general knowledge, and
      instruction (if applicable). Use all areas for criteria applicable to the events performed on the
      evaluation.
      2.1.2. Ensure CRM skills are debriefed for all evaluations, using AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
      Criteria Training/Evaluation, or a locally developed equivalent. Forward trends to the unit
      CRM program manager for analysis.
      2.1.3. Areas indicated in Table 2.1 with an “R” will be flown by the examinee for that
      evaluation. If impossible to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate
      the area by an alternate method (for example, simulator, CPT, orally, etc.) in order to
      complete the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately
      evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete
      the evaluation.
      2.1.4. Areas in Table 2.1 indicated with an asterisk (*) are critical items for that evaluation.

NOTES:
1. At least one ELP will be accomplished on Evaluation #2 (Contact Mission).
2. One no-flap straight-in or no-flap overhead pattern is required on Evaluation #1 (Instrument/
Qualification).
3. At least one en route descent or a penetration will be accomplished on Evaluation #1
(Instrument/ Qualification).
4. One approach will be flown by the examinee on Evaluation # 4 (Instrument/Navigation
Mission).
5. At least one precision and one nonprecision approach will be flown on Evaluation #1
(Instrument/ Qualification).

6. Wingwork will be accomplished to 90 degrees of bank and 2 to 3 Gs on Evaluation #3
(Formation Mission).
7. Qualified Instructor Pilots will be evaluated on instructional ability during all periodic
evaluations (Instrument/Qualification/Mission) IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
2.2. Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument
flight rules (IFR) fulfills the objective of the instrument/qualification evaluation. The examinee
will complete the following:
   2.2.1. Instrument examination.
   2.2.2. Closed- and open-book qualification examinations.
   2.2.3. EPE.
   2.2.4. Boldface examination.
   2.2.5. Publications check. Publications that will be checked during the evaluation are
   technical order (TO) 1T-6A-1CL-1, T-6A Pilot’s Pocket Checklist, and the local in-flight
   guide.
2.3. Pilot Mission Evaluation:
      2.3.1. Scenarios that represent unit tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The
      profiles (contact, formation, low level, or instrument) will be designed to evaluate the
      training, flight position, and special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the
      examinee.
      2.3.2. To the maximum extent possible, instructor pilots and flight leads will brief and lead
      the mission. The FE may require the flight lead to fly the wing position to perform events
      from the wing position.
         2.3.3. Minimum ground phase requisites are EPE and boldface examinations. If the
         instrument/ qualification and mission evaluation eligibility periods overlap, a single EPE
         fulfills each requirement if it is accomplished within both eligibility periods (A separate
         boldface examination is still required for each evaluation.)
         2.3.4. Examinees will only be evaluated on those missions routinely performed by the
         pilot. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas and at a performance level for
         which they are qualified.
         2.3.5. T-6 mission areas are contact, formation, instrument/navigation, and low-level.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown according to syllabus
mission profile guidelines (if stated) or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training
objectives. To complete the evaluation, formal course guidelines may be modified, based on
local operating considerations or FE judgment. Syllabus tasks not addressed in this instruction
will be evaluated using criterion reference objectives (CRO) from the appropriate syllabus.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation:
      2.5.1. Instructor evaluations will be conducted according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Flight
      evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee’s instructor knowledge and
      ability.
AFI11-2T-6V2 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     45


   2.5.2. Initial rear cockpit (RCP) landing qualification will include a satisfactory
   demonstration of normal and emergency patterns and landings (overhead or straight-in) and
   an ELP pattern and landing. Periodic RCP landing qualification evaluations will include in-
   flight evaluation of a landing flown from the RCP.
   2.5.3. Instructor pilots will accomplish the RCP landing qualification during either (1) the
   combined instrument/qualification sortie, (2) a mission evaluation sortie, or (3) as defined in
   paragraph 2.5.4.
   2.5.4. The RCP landing qualification may be conducted independently of another evaluation.
   When the RCP landing qualification is evaluated during another sortie as a requisite for flight
   evaluation, record “SPOT” in the Flight Phase block (Section II) on the AF Form 8 and align
   the expiration date with the expiration date of the current evaluation in which the examinee
   would normally complete this requirement. Use the Examiner’s Remarks of the Comments
   block on the AF Form 8 to further describe the evaluation as a “Rear Cockpit Landing
   Qualification” evaluation. (See AFI 11-202, Volume 2, for AF Form 8 requirements.)
2.6. Evaluation Criteria:
   2.6.1. To initially qualify as an instructor, the pilot must successfully complete a dedicated
   initial instructor evaluation in the RCP. Subsequently, crewmembers designated as
   instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations IAW
   AFI 11-202v2. The flight examiner may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating
   the examinee’s instructional ability.
   2.6.2. During recurring T-6 instrument/qualification evaluations, instructor pilot examinees
   will occupy the RCP. During the instrument/qualification evaluation, first pilot examinees
   will occupy the FCP. During T-6 mission evaluations, examinees will occupy the seat
   normally occupied when performing in-flight duties. During recurring combined T-6
   instrument/qualification/mission evaluations, instructor pilot examinees will normally occupy
   the RCP.
