                       18 WING TURKEY SHOOT COMPETITION

A2.1. 18 WG Turkey Shoot Program. In the spirit of professional competition and air combat,
the 18 OG/CC will host periodic wing Turkey Shoots. This competition will emphasize the skills
fighter aviators have honed since August 1914 and is designed to be an annual evaluation. The
culmination of these events will be an awards ceremony to ensure the winners from each
specialty are highlighted amongst their peers.
A2.2. The scheduling of the events will be the responsibility of 18 OSS/OSK in concert with the
respective squadron reps and maintenance officers. For events requiring simulation time, the
OSK rep (OSKC/OSKF) will coordinate with respective simulation schedulers to ensure
adequate time is set-up for execution. For live fly events, 18 OSS/OSK will coordinate with the
JOSC for airspace requirements to maximize scenario completion. If outside resources are
brought in to provide red air support, 18 OSS/OSKD will facilitate their role and support
throughout the competition.
A2.3. This competition will include a series of maintenance competitions. 18 OSS/OSKF will
coordinate with the AMU leads to ensure grading criteria and events are set-up up and will not
interfere with the live fly portion of the event or other daily operations.
A2.4. Supporting documents (e.g., SPINS, ACO, etc.) will be released 7 days prior to the week
of execution to allow for adequate planning. The total number of sorties and events for each
Turkey Shoot will vary depending on squadrons participating, time constraints, squadron
exercise schedules, and real-world taskings.
A2.5. All NIPR information supporting the 18 WG Turkey Shoot can be found at:

                        TRAINING CONFIGURATION POLICIES

A3.1. Training Configuration for 18 WG F-15 Aircraft:
   A3.1.1. AIM-9/AIM-120 Series: A captive adapter plug/repeater cable will be installed in
   the LAU-128 when carrying training missiles; expect training AIM-9X and AIM-9s for all
   missions. AIM-9 missiles that contain an argon coolant tank should have a minimum of 3000
   lbs. of gas. AIM-9-9 and older series AIM-9 CATMS should not be loaded on the same
   aircraft during training missions. The unit will submit a letter of request to 18 OSS/OSK if
   off-station carriage of the captive AIM-9/AIM-120 is desired (i.e., Cope Tiger, Cope North,
   Northern Edge, etc.).
   A3.1.2. M61 Cannon: On all non-live fire training missions, the gun will be both
   mechanically and electronically safe prior to flight.
   A3.1.3. Requests for nonstandard configurations (EA pods, external tanks, 20MM target
   practice [TP]) must be annotated on the squadron soft-shell scheduling input to the 18 OSS.
   A3.1.4. EA pods, captive missile and pylons with captive missiles will not be carted.
   A3.1.5. The basic ALE-45 training configuration is one magazine of chaff and one magazine
   of flares (15 MJU-7 or 6 MJU-10). Squadron ECPs are tasked to set the load according to the
   training plan/objectives and administer a chaff/flare training program that will provide for
   equitable distribution of allocated chaff and flare training munitions to all MR/MS pilots.
   Note: These configurations are subject to modification due to applicable -1/-34 changes or
   operational/safety supplement guidance.

                                  DACT COORDINATION

A5.1. To further enhance combat capability and provide a realistic threat replication with
different type aircraft, 18 OSS/OSK is charged with the responsibility of solicitation and
schedule coordination of Dissimilar Aircraft Training (DACT) assets from throughout the Pacific
region. This specifically includes all USAF, USN, and USMC units in the Republic of Korea and
Japan as well as allied assets (for example, JASDF).
A5.2. Based on squadron exercise schedules and in conjunction with the 18 WG Quarterly
Training Plan, 18 OSS/OSKD will provide input for the upcoming quarter. When the 18 WG
Quarterly Training Plan goes to print, it is an agreement amongst the participants to support and
participate with the events outlined in the plan. The DACT officer will ensure the airspace and
needed support is coordinated to maximize training. Individual squadron involvement is essential
to the smooth coordination of the LFEs.
A5.3. All incoming DACT requests will be routed through 18 OSS/OSKD and coordinated with
the 18 OSS/OSO. After reviewing the exercise schedule, the appropriate F-15 squadrons will be
notified of the upcoming training assets via e-mail, telecon, or the wing schedule meetings. The
equity of the DACT between Kadena squadrons will be monitored by OSKD.
A5.4. Squadrons may be tasked by OSK with sponsoring a visiting unit. 18 OSS/OSKD will
inform the appropriate squadron by giving amplifying information on what has been
accomplished and what is required for the incoming unit.
A5.5. Approval of DACT between the 18 WG and all USAF/USN/USMC and all Allied forces
is provided by 18 WG/CC (as per PACAFCOM). If required, 18 OSS/OSK will coordinate all
required communications for approval with higher headquarters. 18 OSS/OSKD has current
MOUs, LOAs, and regulations concerning DACT with Pacific region units.
A5.6. Required DACT after-action reporting will be forwarded to the appropriate commands by
18 OSS/OSKD. The involved squadrons will provide 18 OSS/OSKD with inputs.
A5.7. A lessons learned/mission critique sheet will be sent out to DACT units (18 OSS/OSKD)
to log/track effectiveness and quality of air superiority provided by the F-15 squadrons based at
Kadena AB. Individual results will be summarized quarterly and distributed appropriately.

criteria. Waivers are rare and should not be pre-planned.
A10.3. WIC Sequence of Events:
   A10.3.1. Unit Weapons and Tactics officers look at prospective candidates throughout the
   year. Communication between Weapons and Tactics officers is imperative. All Weapons and
   Tactics officers should be familiar with all of the candidates.
   A10.3.2. HQ AFPC and ACC/A3TW announce the WIC selection board dates (usually Feb
   and Aug).
   A10.3.3. 18 OSS/OSK notifies the squadrons to submit nomination packages. Suspense for
   completed packages is typically 30 to 45 days prior to HQ PACAF’s suspense date.
   A10.3.4. 18 OSS/OSK will coordinate the nominations through the appropriate 18 OG and
   18 WG leadership.
A10.4. Package Preparation. When preparing a package nominees should work with their
respective weapons officers to ensure their nomination is as strong as possible. The format for
nomination packages is located on the ACC/DOTW web page: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

NIPR at
P:\OSK\EXEMPT Templates\Weapons School.
A10.5. Each MDS should develop and maintain a WIC Spin-up process to send the best
prepared candidate to WIC upon selection. The squadron DOW will utilize the Wing Quarterly
Training Plan as an opportunity to have multi-MDS training opportunities to replicate phases of
WIC centered on WIC objectives and WIC development.

                          18 WG QUARTRELY TRAINING PLAN

A11.1. The 18 WG Quarterly Training Plan is an 18 OG directed training plan coordinated and
managed by 18 OSS/OSK. The initial plan is based on 9-month flying calendar, Composite
Planning Order (CPO), and spin-up inputs from the squadron. The plan incorporates live fly,
simulator, verification events, academic sessions, and Part Task Training opportunities as
directed by 18 WG XP/OGV. 18 OSS/OSX coordinates Distributive Mission Operations (DMO)
for F15C and E-3 training locally and with off-station units.
A11.2. The plan is a process that begins prior to the start of the quarter. A meeting is held 6-8
weeks prior to the start of the quarter to gather inputs from the Weapons Officers and squadron
reps     attached    to    OSK.       This    plan    is   then   uploaded     into   Sharepoint
(https://kadena.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/18%20OSS_OSK%20and%20OSX/default.aspx) for
presentation at a Scheduling meeting with the majority of CC/DO/ADOs present. The 18 OG, or
his designated representative, will approve the plan. 18 OSS/OSK will produce a word document
reflecting the plan and send it out to the squadrons.
A11.3. As events are completed, lessons learned are produced, distributed, and archived for
future planning purposes and application to similar events to improve integration and operations
(\\KAFS001\TRM7$\18OG\18OSS\OSK\EXEMPT Templates\3 – 18 WG Quarterly Training
Plan).
A11.4. The 18 WG Verification program, a subset of the 18 WG Quarterly Training Plan, is
designed to present a real world tactical problem to a group of operators within the context of an
OPLAN. In the process of presenting their solution to the audience, several benefits occur. First,
all in attendance will better understand the Wings role in OPLANs and how the Wings assets
integrate in combat. Second, current plans and procedures are validated. Finally, new ideas for
improved tactical employment should arise.
A11.5. Each squadron within the 18 Operations Group is required to execute a verification
quarterly through OSK. Participation is tracked by OSK. These events are coordinated through
the squadrons and deconflicted from the flying calendar and deployment calendar to the max
extent possible to enable participation.
A11.6. The team presenting will be a mix of experienced operators and recent upgrades. Their
squadrons will not task these players during the week unless their schedules permit.
A11.7. 18 OSS/OSK and 18 OG/IN will provide the scenario on Monday the week of the
verification. The scenario should be generated using real world situations and focus on current
problems or tasking of the 18 WG.
A11.8. The audience will consist of the 18 WG/CC, 18 WG/CV, 18 OG/CC, 18 OG/CDF,
squadron leadership and squadron members.
A11.9. The 18 WG Verification program is designed to be a useful tool to get all the major
weapons systems together and discuss current problems facing the wing. It is not designed as a
test but more as a learning tool where teams are encouraged to try new approaches and present
them with some logical rationale. It should help foster a more cohesive Team Kadena and
educate all involved to the strengths and weaknesses of all the assets in the 18 WG.
