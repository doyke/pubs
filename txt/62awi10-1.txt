Supersedes 62 AWI 10-01, 15 January 1997                                                     Pages: 12

This instruction establishes local SORTS reporting procedures and defines the responsibilities of units/
agencies submitting or making inputs to SORTS reports, as required by Joint Pub 1-03.3, AFI 10-201 and
AFI 10-201 AMCSUP1. Combat and com-bat support units use SORTS to report combat readiness data
directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). SORTS provides a timely and accurate assessment of a unit's
readiness to do its combat mission and establishes a data base of essential readiness management informa-
tion. Inaccurate or late data distorts assessments which impact military decisions, obscures trends, and
undermines the process of prioritizing and allocating resources to correct deficiencies. Used as an internal
management tool by HQ AMC, United States Air Force, and JCS, SORTS reports the status of four
resource areas -- Personnel, Equipment and Supplies On Hand, Equipment Condition, and Training. This
instruction applies to units and agencies listed in paragraphs 2.1. and 2.2. of this instruction.
