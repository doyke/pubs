This pamphlet sets the guidelines for preparation and use of the Noncommissioned Officer
Induction Certificate and Senior Noncommissioned Officer Induction Certificate.

This pamphlet is the primary source for Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) and Senior
Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) induction certificates. Units may produce and award locally
produced certificates, however, they must be presented in addition to the certificates prescribed
by this pamphlet. Recommendations to change, add, or delete these certificates should be sent to
HQ USAF/CCC, 1670 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1670. Process supplements to
this pamphlet as shown in AFI 37-160, volume 1, The Air Force Publications and Forms
Management Programs--Developing and Processing Publications, table 3.2.


1. Introduction. The NCO and SNCO are members of the armed services that have been
recognized as troop leaders and an important link in the chain of command from the earliest
records of warfare. History has recorded NCOs as leaders who have kept their units moving.
Great military leaders, such as Caesar and Napoleon have lauded the vital contributions of the
NCO. AFPAM 36-2241, Vol 1, Promotion Fitness Examination Study Guide, and Vol 2, United
States Air Force Supervisory Examination Study Guide, provide extensive text on the history,
accomplishments, and professionalism of the NCO and SNCO corps. These pamphlets provide

many passages that examine the history and contributions of the NCO and the creation of the
SNCO grades.
2. Ceremony. A ceremony of induction into the NCO and SNCO corps is also steeped in
history. From the earliest days individuals obtaining the ranks equivalent to those of an NCO and
SNCO have been recognized and ceremonially inducted into these elite groups. This pamphlet
implements NCO and SNCO certificates to be used for these ceremonies. Ceremonies of
induction should be conducted unless circumstances are completely prohibitive. The ceremony
should be at the discretion of the group responsible for executing the event and should be held in
conjunction with the promotion release or in monthly increments. Regardless of the timing or the
host, the event should be as formal as practical, stressing the importance of the role of
NCO/SNCO, their role in the successful operation of the United States Air Force, and the core
values that are required of the inductees, and all that they represent. While presentation of these
Air Force certificates is required, they do not preclude the presentation of locally produced and
sponsored certificates.
3. Certificates. Use the Microsoft Word versions of the certificates (Figure 1 and Figure 2)
and add the authenticators signature blocks below the provided signature lines at the bottom of
the pages.
