SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Some
paragraphs and chapters were renumbered. Major changes include: integrates the 927 ARW;
revises Schedule of Events (SOE) timing (paragraph 3.11.1.); removes redundant reference to
Addenda A aircraft configurations; outlines interfly agreements (paragraph 3.15.4.); amends
local engine start timing (paragraph 14.4.2.3.4.); establishes One-Stop procedures (paragraph
6.10.5.); revises divert considerations (paragraph 6.18.); and clarifies Bird Bath Procedures
(Attachment 4).
1.2.Applicability.This instruction applies to all 6 AMW/927 ARW and attached individuals
operating KC-135R/T aircraft.
2.2.1.The 6th Operations Support Squadron, Scheduling (6 OSS/OSOS) and 927th Operations
Support Flight (927 OSF/OSO) are the point of contact (POC) for requesting Off Station
Training Flights (OSTF).
2.4.5. (Added)Diverts From Homestation. Notify the Command Post (6 AMW/CP) as soon as
possible when diverting. Coordinate through 6 AMW/CP to ensure the divert location can
provide the required support. The aircrew will contact 6 AMW/CP as soon as practical after
landing at an alternate airfield and relay crew/aircraft status and intentions. Leave a telephone
number where the crew can be reached.
2.5.1.Aircrews will relay the take off and land times (in Zulu) to the 6 AMW/CP. If takeoff is
not on time (-20/+14 minutes of schedule), include the reason. A single aircraft may relay all
takeoff times for cell departures.
2.8.C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. A listing of key telephone numbers is in Attachment 2.
2.11.Enroute Maintenance Support.When handling maintenance problems at enroute stations
(other than MacDill), the 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center, Logistics Readiness Control, (618
TACC/XOCL, DSN 779-0363) is the command’s single point of contact for fixing broken
aircraft. If a 6 AMW/927 ARW tanker with maintenance problems lands at a base with or
without KC-135 maintenance, notify 618 TACC/XOCL to coordinate repair arrangements. 618
TACC/XOCL will coordinate all actions necessary to fix the aircraft. Aircrews will ensure their
immediate theater commander, if chopped, or 6 AMW/CP, as appropriate, is aware of their
status.
3.11.1.Planned alert time equals 4+30 hours prior to takeoff. 91 ARS/63 ARS Director of
Operations (91 ARS/ DO or 63 ARS/DO) or designated representative will coordinate planned
alert time with 6 AMW/CP, if applicable. Aircrews will self-alert for local training missions,
ensuring they are prepared to fly as depicted on the local flying schedule. Aircraft commanders
are responsible for ensuring all crewmembers are notified of any schedule changes affecting their
mission (i.e., change in show time). The standard show time at base ops is 3+30 hours prior to
takeoff. Crews will arrive at the aircraft NLT 2+00 hours prior to takeoff for formation flights or
missions departing home station (deployers, coronets, aeromedical evacuations, etc.). If the crew
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009                                                       3


determines that more time is needed at the aircraft for training purposes, the crew must
coordinate this request through squadron scheduling by 1430L on the day prior to the sortie.
Crews will show at the aircraft NLT 1+30 hours prior to takeoff for all other sorties.
3.15.4. (Added)Consult the current AMC OPORD for interfly agreements on AMC missions.
In order for aircrew assigned/attached to other units to fly local 6 AMW/927 ARW missions
and/or fill deployment taskings, an interfly agreement is required. Such personnel will be
administratively supported as follows:
3.15.4.1. (Added)91 ARS/63 ARS Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) will
maintain the interfly agreement. SARM will also maintain the training level, last fly date, and
expiration dates of all GO/NO-GO items.
3.15.4.2. (Added)If interfly agreement is for local missions, 6 OSS/OST and 927 OG/OST will
maintain local area training documentation.
3.15.4.3. (Added)91 ARS/DOV and 927 OG/OGV will maintain a copy of the crewmember’s
current AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and Letter of Xs, USAF Certification of
Aircrew Training.
3.15.5. (Added)Attached aircrew. Aircrew assigned to bases other than MacDill who are
attached to the 91 ARS/ 63 ARS will be administratively supported as follows:
3.15.5.1. (Added)91 ARS/63 ARS SARM will maintain the letter of attachment. SARM will
also maintain the training level, last fly date, and expiration dates of all GO/NO-GO items.
3.15.5.2. (Added)6 OSS/OST will maintain documentation of training in local area procedures.
3.15.5.3. (Added)91 ARS/DOV and 927 OG/OGV will maintain FEFs and track certifications
via the Letter of Xs.
4.3.1.If the approval authority for a waiver is above the OG/CC level, coordinate at the OG level
before submitting, if possible. The OG which owns the mission will be the primary waiver
authority. When waiver approval/disapproval is received, inform respective OG/CC of the result
and forward a copy of the original request and result to respective OG/OGV. If the respective
OG/CC approves a waiver verbally due to time constraints, ensure it is followed up in written
format and submitted to respective OG/OGV. AFI 11-202V2_ AMCSUP_ 6AMWSUP, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program, describes the format to be used for waiver requests.
5.12.3.2.6 AMW/927 ARW aircrew should use Very High Frequency (VHF) as the primary
radio when talking to MacDill Tower in the local traffic pattern to enhance situational awareness
of local Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic.
5.15.4.4. (Added)Operations from MacDill Air Force Base (AFB). Due to ATC restrictions;
1,600 feet above the runway, instead of 2,000 feet as directed by the Dash 1, will be used for flap
clean-up height during MAX mode takeoffs or in the event of an engine failure on takeoff. The
maximum flap clean-up height for ACCL mode takeoffs will be 1,600 feet. Aircrew are
permitted to pressurize the aircraft after leveling off at 1,600 feet.
5.16.1.The taxi lines on the North Ramp have been measured to ensure a minimum 10-foot
clearance from any obstruction.
5.18.3.4.Additional local guidance can be found in MACDILLAFBI 11-250, Airfield Operations,
and MacDill In-Flight Guide (IFG).

5.20.1.4. (Added)A Bird Watch ALERT does not impose any restrictions on flying operations,
yet crews need to be prepared for a greater chance of implementing Bird Watch Conditions
(BWC) Moderate or Severe. See also ANNEX F to 6 AMW PLAN 91-2, Bird Aircraft Strike
Hazard (BASH) Plan.
5.20.1.5. (Added)It is the aircrew’s responsibility to notify tower if significant bird activity is
observed and warrants a change in the BWC.
5.20.2.Bash Phase II window at MacDill is 1 November to 28 February. The BASH window
will be annotated on the flying schedule during Phase II. During this window, a Bird Watch
ALERT will be issued for the hours of 0900-1500 for the increased possibility of soaring birds
(i.e., turkey vultures) over the airfield flying in the thermals. Migratory periods from September
– October and March – April may also present a rise in the local bird populace, especially one
hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset at MacDill AFB, FL. If conditions warrant, 6
OSS/OSA will issue a Bird Watch ALERT and advise aircrew via Notice to Airmen (NOTAM),
Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS), and tower.
5.20.4.1. (Added)Prior to transitioning at non-Department of Defense (DoD) airfields,
planners/crews will obtain any available bird activity information prior to and during operation at
the airfield (i.e., http://www.usahas.com). Crews experiencing high bird activity at these
locations will advise both the squadron and wing safety office of the hazards noted to include
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), size and number of wildlife, altitude, and
location on airfield.
5.20.5.The aircraft will be inspected by -135 qualified maintenance personnel. Crews will not
change aircraft configuration until it has been determined that it is safe to do so. Bypass the
birdbath if a bird strike is suspected.
5.20.5.1. (Added)Aircrew Bird Strike Reporting. Aircrews will use AF Form 853, Air Force
Wildlife Strike Report, and AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence
Worksheet, to report a bird strike and turn in a copy to maintenance debrief and their squadron
safety office. The wing safety office must also be notified as soon as possible. This is required
to ensure that evidence is preserved in order to identify the bird species involved. The only
identification features that should be preserved are feathers, feet, or beaks. During non-duty
hours, the on-call flight safety officer (FSO), 6th Maintenance Group/Quality Assurance (6
MXG/QA), and Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) personnel will make arrangements
for the preservation of evidence until wing safety assumes responsibility for it. If aircraft
damage is known or suspected, immediately notify 6 MXG/QA.
5.21.Functional Check Flights (FCF), Acceptance Check Flights (ACF) and Operational
Check Flights (OCF).FCFs and OCFs do not require any specific mission profile. The purpose
of the flight is to determine airworthiness or the proper function of aircraft systems prior to the
aircraft’s release for use by regular crews.
5.21.1.2.OG/OGV will be responsible for maintaining applicable Technical Orders (T.O.), and
checklists for each crew position to conduct FCFs. OG/OGV will also maintain a continuity
folder for FCF duties with additional information and guidance.
5.21.1.5.FCF or high speed taxi checks (HSTC) crews will be comprised of OG/OGV flight
examiners, supplemented as necessary by squadron stan/eval flight examiners. All individuals
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009                                                      5


conducting FCF sorties or HSTCs must be designated in a letter by the OG/CC as FCF qualified.
A copy of this letter will be forwarded to MXG/QA.
5.21.2. (Added)Operational Check Flights (OCFs). An FCF certified crew is preferred, if
available. The minimum OCF requirement is a fully qualified crew with one Instructor Pilot. If
the OCF is for the boom system, an Instructor Boom Operator is also required. OG/OGV will
provide applicable T.O.s. to the crew. OCFs are not to be confused with Inflight Operational
Checks, which may be conducted by any crew on any sortie profile.
6.1.2.Nomex flight suit (green or desert brown, as applicable), cotton or fire retardant
undergarments, and flight boots will be worn on all sorties. The FWU-3P and FWU-8P flyer’s
boots, Belleville lightweight boot model 700, 770, 790, and Belleville Sage Green Flyer’s Boot
model 690 are the only boots AMC aircrew are authorized to wear during flight operations in
accordance with AFI 11-301V1, Chapter 6 (paragraph 6.2.5.), Aircrew Life Support (ALS)
Program, and AFI 36-2903_AMCSUP, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
The Nomex or leather flight jacket will be carried on all non-local sorties. Attached/interfly
personnel will wear the same uniform that 6 AMW/927 ARW crewmembers would wear flying
the same mission.
6.2.9.3. (Added)Aircrew members (pilots) are no longer required to carry helmets and oxygen
masks on routine training missions. They will be carried on deployment/contingency missions
and whenever Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) gear, parachutes (if
directed), PLTZ or night vision goggles are required. Boom operators will carry a helmet/mask
on all missions.
6.2.9.4. (Added)Boom operators will position their helmet/mask at the crew station they will
occupy for the sortie. Boom operators performing air refueling duties may have the MA-1
portable oxygen bottle or aircraft oxygen system, with helmet and mask or quick-don assembly
attached as their readily available oxygen.
6.2.9.5. (Added)Qualified KC-135 crew members dedicated to supervising passengers are
required to have either a preflighted quick don oxygen mask or helmet/mask connected to the
MA-1 portable oxygen bottle during flight. This provides respiratory protection and
communications with the crew in the event of an emergency.
6.4.Aircrew Publications Requirements.Crewmembers will maintain electronic publications
(EPubs) in accordance with OG/OGV Functional Publications Library.
6.10.5. (Added)One-Stop, Local Mission Kit, and Temporary Duty (TDY) Kits. The pilot in
command (PIC) will ensure an adequate review of the mission products is performed. Missions
planned by dispatch do not alleviate the responsibility of the PIC for proper mission study, the
accuracy of the mission materials, nor ensuring all required items are accomplished. The PIC or
designated representative is responsible for inventorying and signing out the mission kit for each
sortie. Mission kits (local or TDY kit, as applicable) will be onboard all sorties. The PIC will
also ensure route navigation kit (flip kits) are inventoried and returned after each mission.
6.10.5.1. (Added)Local Missions. Local mission kits (Inflight Manual, laptop, power cord,
power strip, and mouse) will be inventoried prior to/after each mission. Any missing items will
be identified to dispatch.
 6                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009


6.10.5.2. (Added)TDY Missions. TDY kits (Global Positioning System (GPS)) unit, laptop,
power cord, power strip, and mouse) will be checked out from the squadron the day prior to
departing TDY. The kits will be inventoried prior to/after each trip and will be returned the next
duty day once the trip is complete.
6.12.2.Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring all briefing requirements of the flight
manual, as well as those in Chapters 6 and 16 are met.
6.18.Alternate Planning.Weather, runway, and airfield restrictions should be the primary
concerns when selecting an alternate. The aircraft commander should land at the nearest suitable
airfield, to include civilian airfields.
6.18.1. (Added)A list of alternate/divert airfields is provided at Attachment 3. Tampa
International should not be used as a primary divert alternate for planning purposes due to
nacelle clearance issues.
6.21.12. (Added)Lightning Procedures on the Ramp.               In accordance with Air Force
occupational safety standards, no one will be standing on the flight ramp when lightning has
been reported within 5 statute miles (SM) of the field. Safe areas for lightning protection include
buildings, heavy aircraft, and vehicles. The following two terms will be used over ATIS and 6
AMW/CP frequencies to advise personnel of impending lightning hazards:
6.21.12.1. (Added)Lightning Watch (DELTA): Conditions are favorable for lightning activity
within 5 SM of the airfield within 30 minutes. The watch shall not expire earlier than 30 minutes
from issue. All ground operations are not affected by a lightning watch.
6.21.12.2. (Added)Lightning Warning (ECHO): Lightning has been observed or reported
within 5 SM of the field. The warning will remain in effect until the threat has passed beyond
the 5 SM ring, moving away from the field. All personnel shall take appropriate shelter (vehicle,
aircraft, or structure). Outbound aircrews may continue preflight activities to the extent that is
possible without a ground crew. Crews will not start engines or taxi out of the parking ramp
during a lightning warning. They may taxi as soon as the ground marshaller has returned to his
marshalling post. Inbound aircrews may land and taxi to the ramp, but will stop short of parking
and await a follow-me or marshaller. Aircraft will not taxi into a parking spot without
marshalling assistance.
6.26.3.LPUs will be placed at each primary crewmember’s position and readily available for
passengers for all overwater operations, including transition at MacDill AFB.
6.31.1.Check receiver status through 6 AMW/CP prior to engine start and again prior to takeoff,
if necessary. Do not delay engine start to check receiver status if it will affect mission timing,
however, obtain receiver status as soon as time permits.
6.60. (Added)Birdbath Procedures.See Attachment 4.
8.6.3.1.Aircraft commanders will turn-in the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log,
fuel and/or Multi-Service receipts to the 6 OG/927 OG Resource Advisor (RA) upon TDY
return. If returning after normal duty hours, aircraft commanders will turn-in AF Form
664/DD1898, Energy Sale Slip, with post mission paperwork. Mission review personnel will
forward the items to the 6 OG/927 OG RA immediately upon concluding mission review.

8.6.3.5.Aircraft commanders will ensure in-flight fuel issue data is accurately entered in Air
Mobility Command Air Refueling Tracker (AMCART) and a printed copy is turned in with post
mission paper work.
8.6.3.5.1.1.If unable to obtain receiver information in-flight, the aircraft commander or
designated representative will contact the receiver unit and obtain the necessary data during post
mission duties.
9.2.5.This includes emergency gear/flap extension. Aircraft commanders see AFI 11-401,
Aviation Management, for further governance of incentive/Distinguished Visitor
(DV)/familiarization/orientation flights.
9.3.1.Maximum traffic pattern/transition time is 3 hours. If the aircraft commander determines
that aircrew fatigue may compromise safety, transition training will be terminated.
9.4.3. (Added)Full Stop Taxi Back/Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures. ERCCs
should be scheduled the week prior to flight to maximize training opportunities with limited tails.
GDSS2 will reflect a line in the schedule for both halves of the ERCC. Bus times will be
scheduled as normal. Changes made to the schedule (fuel loads, timing, crews, etc.) must be in
to Scheduling (6 OSS/OSOS) by 1430L the day prior to flight.
9.4.3.1. (Added)The first crew will call Command Post 30 minutes prior to landing with
maintenance status, fuel, and estimated land time. Land using 50 degrees of flaps for full stops
to the maximum extent possible based on gross weight and weather conditions. Use entire
runway length for stopping the aircraft to minimize required brake cooling time. After landing,
the crew will taxi to parking for the crew change. Taxiway Juliet or other locations may be used
to ERCC if necessary provided clearance with ground and is pre-coordinated with the
Maintenance Group (MXG) and OG and no taxi conflicts exist. The departing crew will inform
the oncoming crew of the earliest allowable takeoff time that will satisfy brake cooling time
(BCT) or flight manual charted ground cooling requirements. The departing crew will also brief
the oncoming crew of any maintenance discrepancies, complete AFTO Form 781, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, (leave forms with the aircraft), and proceed to
maintenance debrief to discuss any discrepancies. Leave the water jug, FLIP, and mission kit
with the jet. The outgoing crew will take the data cards and secrets with them. If the oncoming
crew requires secrets, they will check out their own bag.
9.4.3.2. (Added)Do not shut down engines. The departing crew will deplane through the crew
entry chute and take the oncoming crew’s bus to maintenance debrief and base ops as required.
Crew chiefs and fire bottles are not required if only aircrew and –135 maintenance personnel are
involved.
9.4.3.3. (Added)Orientation Flights. The above procedure will be modified for orientation
flights in that an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) will be started, all engines will be shut down, and
air stairs will be used to deplane passengers. Two crew chiefs and a fire bottle are required.
This may be done in conjunction with an ERCC or to facilitate transition training for the original
crew. Orientation flights carrying local civilian leadership will taxi back to the north ramp, shut
down all engines, and deplane passengers via air stairs. Keep an APU running if the same
aircraft is to be used again for transition training.
9.4.4. (Added)Off-Station Transition. Table 9.1. lists recommended off-station transition bases
with runway information.

9.4.5. (Added)Supplemental Evaluations. All instructors are invited to participate in the
Supplemental Evaluation Program. The purpose of a supplemental evaluation is to provide non-
retribution feedback to squadron and group leadership on either ground or flight activities with
the aim of refocusing or validating current training. Instructors may also be directed via a
Standardization/Evaluation Board (SEB) to perform a supplemental evaluation on an event about
which        the     group     commander        desires      feedback.            AFI        11-
202V2_AMCSUP1_MACDILLAFBSUP, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program,
provides Supplemental Evaluation forms.
9.4.6. (Added)Crews scheduled to transition off-station will thoroughly review airfield
information and familiarize themselves with the off-station airfield/terminal area environment
during mission planning. This includes all available information on bird activity. If off-station
transition is pre-planned, wing scheduling will coordinate with the appropriate airfield to ensure
permission is granted to conduct training.
9.4.6.1. (Added)If pre-planned off-station transition training is desired at a location other than
one of the recommended airfields, aircraft commanders will coordinate with wing scheduling
and get approval from the 91 ARS/63 ARS/DO. This is not intended to restrict crew training at
other locations should external factors such as weather, bird conditions, NAVAID outages, etc.
force crews to adapt their sortie profile during execution. Every effort shall be made to advise
the 91 ARS/63 ARS/DO of crew intentions as soon as possible.
9.10.1.1.Do not taxi with reported Runway Visual Range (RVR) below 1,600 feet or Runway
Condition Reading (RCR) below 6 unless approved by OG/CC or appropriate execution
authority.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009                                                       9


9.10.7.2.1. (Added)Do not practice 30 flap, full stop landings.
13.2.1.2.2. (Added)Heat Stress/Hydration. Based on recommendations from the flight surgeon,
an external air conditioner should be used to cool assigned aircraft during preflight checks, cargo
loading operations, and cockpit maintenance lasting longer than 30 minutes. Requirement is
based on Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index above 84 degrees Fahrenheit as measured
by bioenvironmental engineering and reported to Base Operations during the summer months.
WBGT index above 84 is expected between the hours of 1000 and 1600 daily during the period
of 1 June through 30 September. In addition, carry one quart of water per person per hour of
planned ground operations during conditions 1, 2, or 3. Carry at least one quart per person per 4
hours of planned flight time regardless of heat stress condition.
13.2.1.2.3. (Added)Beverage/water containers will be stored at One-Stop in Base Operations.
Crews should utilize no smaller than 5 gallon containers to ensure enough water is available for
any contingency/passengers. Containers will be returned empty to the One-Stop after each flight
and placed on the wire shelves (lid off) to drain/dry.
13.2.1.4.2.1. (Added)MacDill KC-135R/T aircraft will be configured as depicted in AFI 11-
2KC-135V3 Addenda A or per locally generated/approved configurations posted on the 6
MXG/QA                            webpage                    (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/browse.do?programId=1471711&channelPageId=-1537728&portletId=-
2104306). Any special configuration or deviations from Addenda A must be coordinated with
wing scheduling, OGV Chief Evaluator Boom Operator, MXG/QA, Aircraft Maintenance
Squadron (AMXS) Dash-21 and Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), if applicable, a minimum of
48 hours prior to scheduled takeoff.
13.2.1.4.2.2. (Added)The training configuration will be the standard for all local flights. All
other configurations will be reflected on an AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load Planning Worksheet or
Computer-generated Worksheet.
13.2.1.4.2.3. (Added)Any change to the scheduled aircraft configuration should be coordinated
by the 91 ARS/ 63 ARS Operations Superintendent or designated representative as early as
possible with 6 OSS Scheduling and MACC to minimize mission impact.
13.2.1.4.2.4. (Added)A minimum of four copies of the load planning worksheet will be
distributed as follows: One copy each for MXG/QA, aircraft weight and balance book, AMXS
Dash-21, and the OGV Chief Evaluator Boom Operator.
13.2.1.4.2.5. (Added)AMXS Dash-21 personnel will install aircraft load configuration using AF
Form 4100 or Computer Generated Worksheet.
13.2.1.4.2.6. (Added)91 ARS/63 ARS Operations Superintendent or designated representative
will work closely with 6 AMXS Dash-21, maintenance flightline supervisor, and wing
scheduling to ensure the airplane is properly configured.
13.2.1.4.2.7. (Added)The mission boom operator assigned to the mission will work closely with
the 91 ARS/        63 ARS Operations Superintendent to ensure his/her airplane is properly
configured prior to entering crew rest. If the airplane is unavailable prior to entering crew rest,
the 91 ARS/63 ARS Operations Superintendent or designated representative will ensure the
airplane is properly configured and secured prior to its departure. The 91 ARS/63 ARS
Operations Superintendent or designated representative will contact 6 AMXS Dash-21 personnel
 10                                  AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009


to coordinate times and actions required. Updated weight and balance data will be provided to
the primary boom operator for mission planning purposes.
13.2.1.4.2.8. (Added)Mobility/Deployments: The 6 OG (supplemented by 927 OG, when
necessary) will designate a liaison, preferably an instructor boom operator, to work closely with
the 6 LRS load planning office, air terminal operations center, and deployment control center
(DCC) (when operational) on all loading operations concerning the KC-135R. In addition, the 6
OG/927 OG representatives will remain in close contact with the AMXS production
superintendent (Tanker Super), MXG/QA, and AMXS Dash-21 personnel to ensure loading
operations run smoothly.
14.4.Fuel Conservation.Under no circumstances will the practice of fuel conservation adversely
affect operational requirements or safety of flight.
14.4.2.3.4. (Added)Aircrews will make every effort to take-off on time versus taking off early
for convenience. Aircrews will use the following engine start timing at homestation based on
active runway: Runway 04, crews will start 25 minutes prior to take-off; Runway 22, crews will
start 20 minutes prior to take-off.
14.4.2.3.5. (Added)For delays of 30 minutes or more, shut down unnecessary engines.
Coordinate through CP for crew chiefs and fire bottles if engines will be restarted. For delays of
60 minutes or more, taxi back to parking and shut down all engines. Coordinate with command
post prior to taxiing back to parking.
14.4.2.10.1.Due to Tampa Air Traffic Control (ATC) airspace considerations, flight operations in
MacDill AFB’s pattern should be conducted with a 20 flap configuration.
15.1.1. (Added)Air Refueling (Tyndall AFB, 325th Fighter Wing (325 FW)). Boom Operators
recommended by the 91 ARS/63 ARS Operations Superintendent and approved by the squadron
commander may conduct air-refueling operations with the 325 FW. The Letter of Xs will be
used to identify boom operators who are cleared to conduct air refueling with 325 FW
unqualified receivers. Note: Boom Operators pursuing MCT status may refuel 325 FW
instructor pilots while under the direct supervision of an instructor boom operator.
16.1.1.Mission Planning (Dispatch) will ensure crews receive a complete mission package for
short-notice taskings, deployments, coronets, Operation NOBLE EAGLE missions, Operation
ENDURING FREEDOM missions, Banner missions, Channel missions, hurricane evacuations,
capstones, business efforts, Red Flag support, aeromedical evacuation missions, or any other
tasking deemed appropriate by the 6 OG/CC.
17.4.3.1.4. (Added)M050 Tactics Sorties. Tactics sorties may be accomplished under instructor
supervision or by crewmembers certified in Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures
(AFTTP) 3-3.KC-135 maneuvers in accordance with AFI 11-2KC-135V1, KC-135 Aircrew
Training. Terminal area maneuvers may be accomplished at Homestead ARB, Robins AFB,
deployed locations where tactical procedures are in place, or other areas designated by the 91
ARS/63 ARS/CC. The primary area used for air work is W-168, but other suitable areas may
also be used with prior coordination through 6 OSS and 91 ARS/63 ARS/DO.
17.4.3.1.4.1. (Added)When scheduled for an M050 tactics sortie, the aircraft commander will
coordinate with Intelligence (6 OG/OGI) for an intelligence briefing during day-prior mission
planning. Pick up a Tactics sortie binder from Plans and Tactics (6 OSS/OSK) prior to flight.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP 27 JULY 2009                                                      11


Aircraft commanders will thoroughly incorporate the planned tactics profile into the crew
briefing.
17.4.3.1.4.2. (Added)Do not fly VFR/tactical arrival and departure (TAD) maneuvers when the
BASH condition is moderate or severe, unless operational mission requirements dictate or when
directed by the executing agency.
17.4.3.1.4.3. (Added)Do not practice simulated emergency procedures in the airplane while
performing any VFR/TAD maneuver.
17.4.3.1.4.4. (Added)When available, aircraft commanders should have a crewmember
positioned in the instructor seat to help clear visually for other traffic. After an initial
introduction to flying in the boom pod, scanning for threats, and making threat calls, boom
operators will fly in the cockpit as safety observers. Boom operators will use threat calls in
accordance with AFTTP 3-1, Employment and Tactics. To the maximum extent possible, boom
operators and navigators (if on board) will constantly crosscheck maneuvering airspeeds,
configuration changes (to prevent over-speeding flaps and ensuring the gear is lowered as
appropriate), and altitude clearances. Situation permitting, they may also be assigned fuel panel
management, checklist initiation, radio communications, and the approach and landing log
duties. This will facilitate a more efficient distribution of the aircrew workload and will enhance
VFR clearing techniques.
17.4.4. (Added)Crewmembers are highly encouraged to submit Tactics Improvement Proposals
(TIP) through 6 OSS/OSK.
18.6.1.Formation Briefing. Formation leaders will conduct formation briefings using any
suitable briefing guide that meets the criteria stated in AFI 11-2KC-135V3, chapters 6 and 18.
Refer to MACDILLAFBI 11-250 for additional guidance on cell departures. AFTTP 3-3.KC-
135 and the MacDill In-flight Guide also provide suitable guides for use.
18.6.5.1. (Added)When cell aircraft have significantly different gross weights (>10K), consider
basing takeoff data on matched climb gradients and placing the lighter aircraft in the lead
position.
18.6.6.1.Formation Join-Up. During day visual meteorological conditions (VMC), visual cutoff
to expedite join-up is pre-approved by letter of agreement with Tampa Approach Control.
18.10.Formation Break-Up and Recovery.Formations returning to MacDill AFB should break
up the cell before entering Tampa Approach Control’s airspace.

     altitude, fly at best range Mach no., and land at alternate.
     Note: Heading shown is initial true course to divert base.
     Note: Computations are based on 25,000 # of fuel. KC-135R fuel computations are
     based on a 145,000 pound airplane. Time and fuel required are based on winds of
     270/50. All climbs are based on max climb thrust.
     Note: Fuel requirements depicted are fuel required enroute, not totalizer readings
     required to begin divert. Crews must plan so as to land with required fuel reserve
     after using depicted amount of fuel.

                                   BIRDBATH PROCEDURES

A4.1. Birdbath Procedures. Aircraft will taxi through the birdbath using the following
checklist. The clear water rinse (birdbath) is required after two events (take-off, landing) below
3000’ over salt water, per day. Missions that do not originate from a location that is within 1.25
miles of salt water do not require a birdbath if one approach to a full stop is flown (Reference:
T.O. 1-1-691. Aircraft Weapons Systems – Cleaning and Corrosion Control, 3.2.3.). MacDill
ground control can confirm the status of the birdbath. Completion of the ―After Landing‖
checklist should be delayed in order to accommodate transiting the birdbath. Crews will follow
the checklist in this attachment, Birdbath Procedures. These checklists are also located in the In-
Flight Guide.
A4.2. To enter the birdbath, taxi southbound on taxiway Echo onto Birdbath taxiway until
aircraft is just short of the first set of 3 spray bars, abeam the yellow line located on the left side
of the taxiway. Ensure the items in the Birdbath Procedures checklist have been accomplished.
A magnetic sensor will trigger the automatic rinse to begin. Once water is flowing, the rinse will
last 3 minutes. Taxi the airplane so that the pilot is abeam the last set of spray bars at one
minute, abeam the first yellow line painted across the taxiway at two minutes, and abeam the
second yellow line at three minutes. Wait at the last yellow line until the rinse cycle is complete.
After completing the rinse, finish the ―After Landing‖ checklist and taxi to parking. Crews will
expedite shutting down two engines after the birdbath, using the proper checklist. If entering the
birdbath after another aircraft has passed through, allow 10 minutes for the birdbath to recharge.
A4.3. When aircraft will transit the birdbath enroute to parking, use these procedures after
clearing the runway. Finish this checklist before entering the birdbath. After completing
birdbath, complete AFTER LANDING checklist.
