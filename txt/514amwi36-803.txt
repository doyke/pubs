           schedule. Credit hours cannot be earned under a CWS program. Two CWS options
           are authorized. Under both options, the non-work day must be approved by the
           supervisor and is not necessarily Monday or Friday. Any other CWS options must be
           approved by the Wing Commander/Senior.

               and either one 8 hour day or two 4 hour days for a total of 80 hours in a bi-weekly
               pay period.
           3.4.1.2. Flexible Work Schedule (FWS) – Two FWS options are authorized, any
           other FWS options must be approved at the Group commander level or higher.

               hours a day, 40 hours a week, and 80 hours a bi-weekly pay period. Tour of duty
               limits, as requested by employee and determined by the supervisor, normally
               should not exceed 11 hours. The hours that define tour of duty limits include core
               hours, flexible hours (before and/or after core hours), and a standard meal period
               of .50, .75 or 1.0 hour. Employees request fixed arrival and departure times,
               which are subject to supervisor approval and results in a fixed scheduled.
               3.4.1.2.2. Gliding Schedule: The official 514 AMW gliding schedule tour of
               duty hours are 0630-1730 with mandatory core hours from 0830-1500 and up to a

               1500-1730. Under this option employees may vary daily arrival/departure times
               with supervisor coordination. They must complete their basic work requirement
514AMWI36-803 5 APRIL 2013                                                                  5


           of 8 hours from that arrival time, excluding the lunch period. The core hours
           always remain 0830-1500 regardless of the meal period approved. These are the
           only gliding schedules approved (see Attachment 3).
               3.4.1.2.2.1. Changes to gliding schedule options described above require
               approval by the Wing Commander/Senior ART in writing.
     3.4.2. Rules Governing Alternative Work Schedule:
        3.4.2.1. A basic premise of the AWS program is that there will be no negative impact
        on work productivity, diminished level of services, or increased costs of operation.
        3.4.2.2. Management is authorized, but not directed, to approve alternative work
        schedules within their areas. Management will not approve alternative work schedule
        changes for the sole purpose of avoiding charges to military leave.
        3.4.2.3. Work centers will be manned during customer service hours as established or
        published by the work center supervisor.
        3.4.2.4. Employees will be scheduled to work eighty (80) hours for a work period.
        3.4.2.5. Employees desiring to use annual leave, LWOP, sick leave, credit hours,
        military leave, or compensatory time off for an entire work shift will be charged the
        amount of time equal to the alternative work shift that was scheduled for that day,
        e.g., if alternative work shift schedule was ten hours and employee requested sick
        leave, the employee is charged for ten hours of sick leave.
        3.4.2.6. Credit hours may be earned only by FWS employees and IAW AFRCI 36-
        803. An employee’s right to earn or use earned credit hours is subject to supervisor
        approval. Remarks identifying specific duties performed while earning credit hours
        are required in the AFRC Form 270 remarks section. Both the employee and the
        supervisor must closely monitor credit hour balances. If not closely monitored and a
        work requirement exists, it may be necessary for management to approve
        compensatory time in lieu of credit hours to avoid loss. ARTs will not gain net credit
        time and perform duty in a military status on the same calendar day. Employees will
        not normally be allowed to earn credit or compensatory time prior to 0630.
        Exceptions are for mission requirements. For example, early aircraft generation,
        launch or recovery duties; personnel deployment processing; or other hands-on
        mission duties. Normal administrative or managerial duties should not be
        accomplished prior to 0630.
        3.4.2.7. Employee integrity and a relationship of trust between the employee and
        management are the keystones of a successful AWS program. If a documented
        pattern of duty absence or credit hour/leave abuse on the part of an employee is
        established, management may remove the employee from the program and return
        them to their pre-AWS work schedule.
     3.4.3. Procedures For Implementing Alternative Work Schedule:
        3.4.3.1. Employees desiring to participate in the AWS program must submit a written
        request to management outlining their choice of plan, tour of duty hours, and core
        hours. (Refer to attachment 1 for a sample format). In accordance with the Labor
 6                                                               514AMWI36-803 5 APRIL 2013


            Management Agreement, bargaining unit employees must submit their requests to the
            union for review prior to submitting to management.
            3.4.3.2. Alternative work schedules must be requested and approved in writing no
            later than termination of the work shift Wednesday, prior to the start of the affected
            bi-weekly work period. After an alternative work schedule has been approved, it
            remains in effect until a new schedule is requested and approved. Normally, changes
            to an approved alternative work schedule cannot be made for the current bi-weekly
            work period. requirements or emergency situations may require exceptions to these
            procedures.
            3.4.3.3. An approved copy of the alternative work schedule will be filed in the
            employee’s Time and Attendance folder and the original will be returned to the
            employee.
     3.5. Lunch Periods:
        3.5.1. Lunch periods and lunch documentation will be IAW AFRCI 36-803 and AFRC
        Form 270 Time and Attendance worksheet. For all 514 AMW personnel, work shifts of
        six (6) hours or more will include a scheduled lunch period. Lunch periods must be a
        minimum of 30 minutes in length and scheduled during the mid time of work shift. It is
        inappropriate to schedule and take a lunch period at the beginning or end of the civilian
        workday. During instances when members are in civilian status and lunches are
        consumed in flight, appropriate justification will be documented on the AFRC Form 270
        remarks section (i.e., “Fly NLT”). Members will submit copies of the AFTO Form 781
        for local missions or AFRC Form 4 for TDY missions with timecard to document
        occurrences of in flight lunch periods.
4. ART Status During Upgrade Training.
     4.1. ART personnel assigned to 514 AMW will not attend upgrade training (e.g., position
     upgrades to instructor, flight examiner or flight lead) in a military status. These upgrades are
     not a part of flying transition training school tour; therefore, not considered as part of a
     progression tour.
     4.2. ART personnel will not perform military duty after/between civilian workdays while
     TDY for upgrade training.
5. Time and Attendance Training.
     5.1. Purpose: The goal of time and attendance training is to help guarantee all 514 AMW
     personnel take a proactive role to ensure accurate accounting and the prevention of
     inappropriate leave/dual compensation.
     5.2. Training Responsibility: Group commanders will establish Time and Attendance
     training programs that ensure every employee, timekeeper, and supervisor level member
     receives appropriate training consistent with the member’s level of responsibility.
     5.3. Training Resource: The wing budget office (514 AMW/FM) will develop and
     maintain Power Point Time & Attendance training slides and maintain their accessibility on
     the wing’s S-drive, in a folder entitled Time & Attendance Tools.
514AMWI36-803 5 APRIL 2013                                                                     7


   5.4. Time and Attendance Training: All employees will receive an initial training and
   refresher training as directed by group commanders. Supervisors will ensure this training is
   completed in accordance with the group commander’s program.
   5.5. Validation of training: Employee folders will be reviewed annually to screen for
   100% employee time and attendance training certification/documentation.
   5.6. Internal Auditors. Group commanders will designate internal audit teams for
   conducting periodic random audits using AFRC developed Time and Attendance auditing
   checklist. (see attachment 2).
6. Internal Controls. The purpose of internal audits is to ensure compliance with established
procedures, as well as identify inappropriate compensation and time and attendance accounting
errors. Internal audit procedures are established as follows:
   6.1. Group commanders will ensure time and attendance audits are completed on all ART
   personnel annually with 25% of assigned personnel reviewed each quarter. Review selected
   ART time and attendance records to cover all pay periods that start within each quarter.
   Appointed auditors will use AFRCI 36-803 AFRC developed Time and Attendance auditing
   checklist. The audit checklist and other auditing tools can be found in a shared folder on the
   S drive.
   6.2. Group commanders will forward quarterly audit results to 514 AMW/FM no later than
   30 days after completion of quarterly audit. As a minimum, audit reports will include total
   number of records reviewed and total number of errors found for dual compensation,
   inappropriate leave/duty, and AF Form 428 discrepancies. 514 AMW/FM will determine
   group audit and completion status and compile results for forwarding to 514 AMW/CC
   quarterly.
