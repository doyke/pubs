This instruction covers the entire spectrum of actions required to protect resources and personnel
to the maximum extent possible from severe weather and outlines the reporting and crossfeed of
information necessary to support these actions. It applies to all Air Force organizations including
the Air National Guard and US Air Force Reserve units. Any organization may supplement this
instruction. Major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units send one copy
of their supplement to HQ AF/XOO, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. Each year Air Force and Army installations, equipment, and personnel are
threatened by severe weather. When severe weather occurs, it can affect readiness and the ability
to accomplish Air Force and Army missions. Severe weather is defined as any weather
phenomena requiring a special severe weather notice from an Air Force Weather unit. The severe
weather notice is designed to give the designated agency advance notification (with sufficient
time to implement protective actions) of expected weather conditions that pose a hazard to
personnel, resources, and property. When notified of the potential for severe weather, the agency
will normally take subsequent preventative actions. Table 3.1 contains standard watch and
warning criteria.
1.2. General Information. Successful preparation and response to severe weather events
require an integrated approach among operations, logistics, and support units on a base. The key
aspects to ensuring units optimally protect people and equipment lie in ensuring all base
elements fully understand their role in either the prediction, notification, preparation, or response
to severe weather. Bases must identify how they will respond to severe weather that affects the
installation and geographically separated operating locations and ensure these plans are
exercised. Key actions to consider in protecting people and equipment are: identifying mission
limiting/damaging weather criteria; forecasting specific severe weather events by issuing
watches and warnings; disseminating the watches and warnings in a timely manner; and taking
required protective actions based on the watches and warnings (See Attachment 2 ). Finally, by
documenting and crossfeeding lessons learned, severe weather resource protection is enhanced.

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Headquarters Air Force:
     2.1.1. AF/XOO:
        2.1.1.1. Will serve as 24 hour point-of-contact for receipt of information (e.g., via fax,
        message, phone, or e-mail) concerning severe weather occurrences at Air Force and
        Army installations supported by Air Force weather units.
        2.1.1.2. Will collect severe weather operational reports and crossfeed to XOW for
        analysis and action as necessary.
     2.1.2. AF/XOW:

        perspective to monitor technical ability, equipment status, and adequacy of training.
        2.1.2.2. Will crossfeed severe weather forecasting lessons learned.
        2.1.2.3. Will assist in determining cross-MAJCOM/FOA/DRU severe weather
        notification responsibilities as necessary for geographically separated installations
        requiring such support.
     2.1.3. AF/ILC:
        2.1.3.1. Will assist MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs in developing and maintaining reliable
        primary and back-up severe weather information (weather watches and warnings)
        dissemination capabilities.
     2.1.4. AF/SE (AFSC) :
        2.1.4.1. Will assist MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs with procedures and checklists via the Air
        Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards and other guidance documents
        for safeguarding personnel and equipment during severe weather.
2.2. Major Commands/Direct Reporting Units (DRUs)/Field Operating Agencies (FOAs):
     2.2.1. Will review all installation severe weather reports from a functional weather
     perspective to monitor technical ability, equipment status, and adequacy of training and
     forward after-action reports and applicable lessons-learned received from their units to HQ
     USAF/XOO.
     2.2.2. Will designate OWSs to provide severe weather notification to installations requiring
     such support.
     2.2.3. Will review base-wide preparedness activities during MAJCOM/DRU/FOA-selected
     wing/ base inspections to ensure compliance with this instruction and will make
     recommendations to their installation commanders on areas for improvement to enhance the
     effectiveness of resource and personnel protection during severe weather events.
AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012                                                          7


   2.2.4. Will assist weather units in meeting requirements that exceed the unit’s capabilities
   (e.g., arranging back-up support, exploiting technology, and enhancing severe weather
   forecasting techniques).
   2.2.5. Will ensure subordinate units report severe weather events in accordance with this
   instruction and AFMAN 10-206.
   2.2.6. Will assist OWSs and CWTs supporting the Army with developing procedures to
   provide severe weather notification to Army units.
2.3. The Installation Commander:
   2.3.1. Will chair meetings as required, but not less than annually, to review installation
   severe weather preparedness, capabilities, requirements, and procedures. Meetings will be
   attended by representatives of base agencies responsible for developing protective action
   plans, CWT, guard and reserve components, tenant organizations, local off-base units, and
   others organizations with severe weather notification requirements. Other attendees will
   include installation agencies responsible for disseminating the information (e.g., base
   communication squadron and Command Post). Meetings will address at a minimum the
   following issues:
      2.3.1.1. Severe weather observing and forecasting capabilities and corresponding user
      requirements to identify the weather phenomena for which notification is required to
      include threshold values and desired lead-times.
      2.3.1.2. Primary and back-up dissemination procedures.
      2.3.1.3. Protective action procedures and resources.
      2.3.1.4. Severe weather awareness training and exercise procedures.
   2.3.2. Will ensure installation personnel are educated on the local severe weather threat and
   applicable protective measures, as well as on the purpose, applicability, and operating
   procedures of the watch-warning system (IAW AFI 10-2501). The training will ensure
   personnel authorized to issue “back to work” orders following a stop work order are properly
   equipped to assess weather hazards and appropriate precautions. Educational information can
   be included in newcomer orientation briefings, base newspaper articles, commander’s call
   briefings, the base web site, and other forums deemed appropriate by the installation
   commander.
   2.3.3. Will ensure base agencies develop and document pre-severe weather protective
   measures and post-severe weather response plans. Requirements and support will be
   documented and recertified annually for each phenomenon in weather support documents,
   wing instructions, host-tenant support agreements, or similar documents (e.g., base annexes).
   These plans/agreements will include a base warning notification pyramid structure diagram.
   The notification pyramid structure will include all on and off-base agencies (e.g., swimming
   pools, golf courses, child care centers) requiring support.
   2.3.4. Will ensure CWT leadership is available to assist in the severe weather management
   process by prioritizing the assignment of additional and temporary duties not related to
   weather (i.e., security forces augmentees, squadron safety manager, etc.).

        2.3.4.1. Will ensure sufficient CWT personnel are available to provide “eyes forward”
        support to the OWS during severe weather episodes. The CWT will provide back-up
        weather watch and warning support to their installation on behalf of the OWS (IAW
        AFMAN 15-129). Providing “eyes forward” support and base resource protection has a
        higher priority of duty than assignment to base details and additional duties out of the
        weather facility. AFMAN 15-135 and AFMAN 15-129, further discuss the utilization of
        weather personnel.
     2.3.5. Will ensure the appropriate alternate weather observing site is available with

                         WEATHER WATCHES AND WARNINGS

3.1. Criteria. Table 3.1 outlines the standard criteria which normally require weather watches
and warnings. This list is not all inclusive and customers have the responsibility to make their
individual requirements known at the local severe weather preparedness meeting or following the
procedures outlined in AFMAN 15-129. Customer requirements must be identified in the WSD
(or equivalent documentation). In addition, the CWT documents the requirements with the
supporting OWS via a MOA (or equivalent document).

Table 3.1. Standard Watch and Warning Criteria.

 NOTE: Lighting watches and warnings are mandatory IAW AFOSH Standard 91-100
3.2. Minimum Desired Lead-time. Agencies require advance notice prior to the onset of a
particular weather phenomenon. This is the minimum time required to take action to protect
resources, property, and personnel. CWTs will coordinate and establish the actual values and
timing for watches and warnings according to supported agency requirements. AFMAN 15-129
AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012                                                           19


contains further information on standard watches and warnings, lead-times, and severe weather
processes and procedures.
3.3. Weather Watch . This is special notice provided by an OWS or CWT to supported
agencies alerting them to the potential for weather conditions of such intensity to pose a hazard
to life or property. The weather watch can be thought of as a "heads up", at which time agencies
need to consider implementing required protective actions should a subsequent weather warning
be issued.
   3.3.1. Upon issuance of a weather watch, all key personnel and agencies in high risk
   activities and operations should be notified of the potential of severe weather. Activities
   include, but are not limited to, agencies having aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, explosives, or
   petroleum; those performing open-air work, recreational activities, and underground utility
   work.
   3.3.2. Upon receipt of a weather watch, operations may continue. However, personnel in
   high risk areas should be prepared to implement corresponding required protective actions
   without delay if and when a subsequent weather warning is issued.
3.4. Weather Warning. A special notice by an OWS or CWT to supported agencies giving
them advance notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) of expected weather
conditions of such intensity to pose a hazard to personnel, resources, and property.
   3.4.1. Upon issuance of a weather warning, all key personnel and agencies in high risk
   activities and operations should be notified of predicted mission impacting or operationally
   significant weather conditions. Activities include, but are not limited to, those agencies
   having aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, explosives, or petroleum; open-air work, those
   performing recreational activities, and underground utility work.
   3.4.2. Upon receipt of a weather warning, required protective actions corresponding to the
   weather event will be immediately implemented to safeguard personnel and equipment.

A5.2. (354FW) This WCT chart is worst case approximations based on mathematical models
and data derived from limited human studies. The exact effect of cold exposure on an individual
will vary depending on the actual activity level, length of exposure, moderating effects of
clothing or partial shelter from the wind and overall physical state.
A5.3. (354FW) Freezing cold injury can occur anytime temperatures (air or surface) fall below
freezing (32°F). However, the likelihood and severity of injury will increase with prolonged
exposure to lower temperatures and greater air velocity, whether it is due to vehicle speed or
actual wind.
A5.4. (354FW) WCT is an indication of the combined effects of wind and colder air
temperature. Individual level of activity, protective clothing, partial shelter from the wind, and
overall fitness may alter the actual impact of cold exposure. Even when temperatures are above
freezing, prolonged exposure to cold and wind may result in hypothermia or non-freezing cold
injury (chilblains or trench foot).

      USE OF NEW GENERATION HEATERS (NGH) IN WARMING SHELTERS

A8.1. (354FW) During +20º F temperatures and colder outdoor workers will take warm breaks
in buildings, vehicles or shelters heated to about 70º F (a variance of no more than 10 degrees
from this temperature is authorized).
A8.2. (354FW) If a permanent, heated structure is not available nearby, supervisors must
establish warming shelters. Contact 354 MXS AGE for information on using NGH heaters to
warm the shelters. Heaters should only be used for facilities during emergency conditions.
NGH are authorized for flightline support only and emergency use. When using supplemental
heaters, personnel will adhere to the following:
   A8.2.1. (354FW) Take proper precautions to ensure personnel are not overexposed to diesel
   exhaust. Personnel should exit the shelter any time they feel light-headed, dizzy, and/or
   nauseous. If symptoms persist or warrant medical attention, dial 911 immediately for prompt
   medical care.
   A8.2.2. (354FW) NGH heaters must be placed downwind from the shelter, the heater intake
   facing into wind, and a minimum of two heating ducts (in series) used to avoid excessive
       temperatures.
   A8.2.3. (354FW) Users should not adjust NGH heater thermostats. Contact 354 MXS AGE
   to exchange NGH heaters if they are not providing adequate heat.

                 WINTER STORMS AND EXTREME COLD SAFETY

A9.1. (354FW) Heavy snowfall and extreme cold can immobilize an entire region. Even areas
that normally experience mild winters can be hit with a major snowstorm or extreme cold.
Winter storms can result in flooding, storm surge, closed highways, blocked roads, downed
power lines and hypothermia. This information will help you survive and operate at home or
work during winter storms and extreme cold.
A9.2. (354FW) Before Winter Storms and Extreme Cold
   A9.2.1. (354FW) Add the following supplies to your disaster supplies kit: rock salt to melt
   ice on walkways, sand to improve traction, snow shovels and other snow removal equipment.
   A9.2.2. (354FW) Prepare your home and family
      A9.2.2.1. (354FW) Prepare for possible isolation in your home by having sufficient
      heating fuel; regular fuel sources may be cut off. For example, store a good supply of
      dry, seasoned wood for your fireplace or wood-burning stove.
      A9.2.2.2. (354FW) Winterize your home to extend the life of your fuel supply by
      insulating walls and attics, caulking and weather-stripping doors and windows, and
      installing storm windows or covering windows with plastic.
      A9.2.2.3. (354FW) Winterize your house, barn, shed or any other structure that may
      provide shelter for your family, neighbors, livestock or equipment. Clear rain gutters;
      repair roof leaks and cut away tree branches that could fall on a house or other structure
      during a storm.
      A9.2.2.4. (354FW) Insulate pipes with insulation or newspapers and plastic and allow
      faucets to drip a little during cold weather to avoid freezing.
      A9.2.2.5. (354FW) Keep fire extinguishers on hand, and make sure everyone in your
      house knows how to use them. House fires pose an additional risk, as more people turn
      to alternate heating sources without taking the necessary safety precautions.
      A9.2.2.6. (354FW) Learn how to shut off water valves (in case a pipe bursts).
      A9.2.2.7. (354FW) Know ahead of time what you should do to help elderly or disabled
      friends, neighbors or employees.
      A9.2.2.8. (354FW) Hire a contractor to check the structural ability of the roof to sustain
      unusually heavy weight from the accumulation of snow - or water, if drains on flat roofs
      do not work.
   A9.2.3. (354FW) Prepare your car by checking or having a mechanic check the following
   items on your car.
      A9.2.3.1. (354FW) Antifreeze levels - ensure they are sufficient to avoid freezing.
      A9.2.3.2. (354FW) Battery and ignition system - should be in top condition and battery
      terminals should be clean.
      A9.2.3.3. (354FW) Brakes - check for wear and fluid levels.
 32                                            AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012


      A9.2.3.4. (354FW) Exhaust system - check for leaks and crimped pipes and repair or
      replace as necessary. Carbon monoxide is deadly and usually gives no warning.
      A9.2.3.5. (354FW) Fuel and air filters - replace and keep water out of the system by
      using additives and maintaining a full tank of gas.
      A9.2.3.6. (354FW) Heater and defroster - ensure they work properly.
      A9.2.3.7. (354FW) Lights and flashing hazard lights - check for serviceability.
      A9.2.3.8. (354FW) Oil - check for level and weight. Heavier oils congeal more at low
      temperatures and do not lubricate as well.
      A9.2.3.9. (354FW) Thermostat - ensure it works properly.
      A9.2.3.10. (354FW) Windshield wiper equipment - repair any problems and maintain
      proper washer fluid level.
      A9.2.3.11. (354FW) Install good winter tires. Make sure the tires have adequate tread.
      All-weather radials are usually adequate for most winter conditions. However, some
      jurisdictions require that to drive on their roads, vehicles must be equipped with chains or
      snow tires with studs.
      A9.2.3.12. (354FW) Maintain at least a half tank of gas during the winter season.
      A9.2.3.13. (354FW) Place a winter emergency kit in each car that includes:

Table A9.1. Winter Emergency Kit
        - shovel                               - windshield scraper and small broom
        - flashlight                           - battery powered radio
        - extra batteries                      - water
        - snack food                           - matches
        - extra hats, socks and mittens        - first aid kit with pocket knife
        - necessary medications                - blanket(s)
        - tow chain or rope                    - road salt and sand
        - booster cables                       - emergency flares
        - fluorescent distress flag

   A9.2.4. (354FW) Dress for the Weather
      A9.2.4.1. (354FW) Wear several layers of loose fitting, lightweight, warm clothing
      rather than one layer of heavy clothing. The outer garments should be tightly woven and
      water repellent.
      A9.2.4.2. (354FW) Wear mittens, which are warmer than gloves.
      A9.2.4.3. (354FW) Wear a hat.
      A9.2.4.4. (354FW) Cover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs.
A9.3. (354FW) During a Winter Storm
AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012                                                          33


  A9.3.1. (354FW) Listen to your radio, television, or NOAA Weather Radio for weather
  reports and emergency information in addition to monitoring base severe weather
  information.
  A9.3.2. (354FW) Eat regularly and drink ample fluids, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.
  A9.3.3. (354FW) Conserve fuel, if necessary, by keeping your residence cooler than
  normal. Temporarily close off heat to some rooms.
  A9.3.4. (354FW) If the pipes freeze, remove any insulation or layers of newspapers and
  wrap pipes in rags. Completely open all faucets and pour hot water over the pipes, starting
  where they were most exposed to the cold (or where the cold was most likely to penetrate).
  A9.3.5. (354FW) Maintain ventilation when using kerosene heaters to avoid build-up of
  toxic fumes. Refuel kerosene heaters outside and keep them at least three feet from
  flammable objects.
  A9.3.6. (354FW) If you are outdoors
     A9.3.6.1. (354FW) Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow. Overexertion can bring
     on a heart attack a major cause of death in the winter. If you must shovel snow, stretch
     before going outside.
     A9.3.6.2. (354FW) Cover your mouth. Protect your lungs from extremely cold air by
     covering your mouth when outdoors. Try not to speak unless absolutely necessary.
     A9.3.6.3. (354FW) Keep dry. Change wet clothing frequently to prevent a loss of body
     heat. Wet clothing loses all of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly.
     A9.3.6.4. (354FW) Watch for signs of frostbite. These include loss of feeling and white
     or pale appearance in extremities such as fingers, toes, ear lobes, and the tip of the nose.
     If symptoms are detected, get medical help immediately.
     A9.3.6.5. (354FW) Watch for signs of hypothermia. These include uncontrollable
     shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness, and
     apparent      exhaustion.
  A9.3.7. (354FW) If you are driving
     A9.3.7.1. (354FW) Drive only if it is absolutely necessary. If you must drive, consider
     the following:
     A9.3.7.2. (354FW) Travel in the day, don’t travel alone, and keep others informed of
     your schedule.
     A9.3.7.3. (354FW) Stay on main roads; avoid back road shortcuts.
  A9.3.8. (354FW) If a blizzard traps you in the car:
     A9.3.8.1. (354FW) Pull off the highway. Turn on hazard lights and hang a distress flag
     from the radio antenna or window.
     A9.3.8.2. (354FW) Remain in your vehicle where rescuers are most likely to find you.
     Do not set out on foot unless you can see a building close by where you know you can
     take shelter. Be careful; distances are distorted by blowing snow. A building may seem
     close, but be too far to walk to in deep snow.
 34                                            AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012


      A9.3.8.3. (354FW) Run the engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour to keep
      warm. When the engine is running, open a downwind window slightly for ventilation
      and periodically clear snow from the exhaust pipe. This will protect you from possible
      carbon monoxide poisoning.
      A9.3.8.4. (354FW) Exercise to maintain body heat, but avoid overexertion. In extreme
      cold, use road maps, seat covers, and floor mats for insulation. Huddle with passengers
      and use your coat for a blanket.
      A9.3.8.5. (354FW) Take turns sleeping. One person should be awake at all times to
      look for rescue crews.
      A9.3.8.6. (354FW) Drink fluids to avoid dehydration.
      A9.3.8.7. (354FW) Be careful not to waste battery power. Balance electrical energy
      needs - the use of lights, heat, and radio - with supply.
      A9.3.8.8. (354FW) Turn on the inside light at night so work crews or rescuers can see
      you.
      A9.3.8.9. (354FW) If stranded in a remote area, stomp large block letters in an open
      area spelling out HELP or SOS and line with rocks or tree limbs to attract the attention of
      rescue personnel who may be surveying the area by airplane.
      A9.3.8.10. (354FW) Leave the car and proceed on foot - if necessary - once the blizzard
      passes.
A9.4. (354FW) The human body cannot adapt to cold except through proper clothing, shelter,
and behavior changes.
   A9.4.1. (354FW) Cold weather can lower body temperature, resulting in impaired
   performance and cold injuries. Cold weather is often accompanied by wind, rain, snow, and
   ice, which can worsen the effects of cold. Inactivity for long periods increases the risk of
   cold injury. This is a particular concern for Defensive Fighting Positions (DFPs) or small
   vehicle crew compartments where movement is restricted. Minimize the risk of cold injuries
   in DFPs by placing pads, tree boughs, etc., inside these positions.
      A9.4.1.1. (354FW) For any given air temperature, the potential for body-heat loss, skin
      cooling, and decreased body temperature is increased by wind and moisture. Any source
      of nicotine, such as smoking or chewing tobacco, can increase susceptibility to cold
      injury. An early warning sign of inadequate clothing and shelter is shivering, which
      increases heat production. Over the counter drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and
      acetaminophen, can interfere with shivering.
      A9.4.1.2. (354FW) Vigorous physical activity will also increase heat production, but
      adds to the risk of cold injury if clothes become wet with sweat. When body heat loss
      exceeds the body’s ability to produce and retain heat, body temperature decreases. When
      body temperature falls below 95º F, hypothermia, a life threatening condition, follows.
      To reduce heat loss, the body decreases blood flow to the arms, legs, and skin. Although
      this protects the internal organs, the decreased blood flow increases susceptibility of
      hands, feet, ears, etc., to nonfreezing (trench foot) and freezing (frostbite) cold injuries.
AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012                                                           35


   A9.4.2. (354FW) Clean, dry, loose layers of clothing, including insulated headgear (watch
   caps/hoods), multiple gloves, and double socks, help prevent heat loss. The outer layer
   should provide wind and water protection. Adjust layers to minimize sweating. If clothing,
   including socks, becomes wet, change them immediately. Size boots to accommodate extra
   socks without restricting blood circulation. Cover exposed skin to help prevent frostbite,
   beginning at “moderate” cold stress levels.
   A9.4.3. (354FW) Metal objects and liquid fuels left in the cold can pose a serious hazard.
   Fuels and solvents remain liquid at very low temperatures. Skin contact with fuel or metal at
   below freezing temperatures can result in nearly instantaneous freezing injury.
   A9.4.4. (354FW) Maintain adequate food consumption to make up for increased energy
   requirements      in cold weather. Eat normal meals with frequent nutritious snacks
   between meals. Maintain adequate hydration with fluid intake of 0.5 to 1 liter per hour. The
   low absolute humidity associated with adverse cold will cause dehydration with normal
   breathing. Avoid caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol. Keep hands, feet, and skin dry.
A9.5. (354FW) Cold stress leads to reduced performance and lack of concentration. People are
not always the best judge of their own condition. Supervisors must be aware of the risks of cold
weather operations and enforce the buddy system to help prevent cold injuries. Individual
tolerance to cold exposure varies greatly for a variety of reasons, including genetic and racial
differences. Low body fat decreases tolerance, while higher body fat is protective. Use the
recommended warming cycles in Attachment 7 as well as the response of individuals to trigger
actions to prevent cold injuries.
A9.6. (354FW) Symptoms of Cold Injuries
   A9.6.1. (354FW) Chilblain: A nonfreezing cold injury, which, although painful, causes
   little or no permanent impairment. It appears as tender, red, swollen skin that is hot to the
   touch and may itch. This can worsen to an aching, prickly (“pins and needles”) sensation and
   then numbness. It may develop in only a few hours in skin exposed to cold.
   A9.6.2. (354FW) Immersion or Trench Foot: Develops when feet are exposed to moisture
   and cold for prolonged periods (12 hours or longer). The combination of cold and moisture
   softens skin, causing tissue loss and, often, infection. Untreated, trench foot can eventually
   require amputation. Often, the first sign of trench foot is itching, numbness or tingling pain.
   Later the feet may appear swollen, and the skin faintly red, blue, or black. Commonly,
   trench foot shows a distinct “waterline” coinciding with the water level in the boot.
   A9.6.3. (354FW) Frost Nip: Involves freezing of water on the skin surface. The skin will
   become reddened and possibly swollen. Although painful, there is usually no further damage
   after re-warming. Repeated frost nip can dry the skin, causing it to crack and be sensitive.
   Frost nip should be taken seriously since it may be the first sign of impending frostbite.
   A9.6.4. (354FW) Frostbite: Involves freezing of deeper layers of tissue. Ice crystal
   formation and lack of blood flow cause tissue damage. Skin freezes at about 28º F. The skin
   becomes numb and turns a gray or waxy white color, is cold to the touch, and may feel stiff.
   A9.6.5. (354FW) Hypothermia: An immediately life-threatening condition in which body
   temperature falls below 95º F. Generally, body temperature will not fall until after many
   hours of exposure to cold air or shorter exposure to cold water. Body temperature can fall
 36                                           AFI10-229_354FWSUP_I 20 JANUARY 2012


   even when air temperatures are above freezing if conditions are windy, clothing is wet,
   and/or the person is inactive. The first signs of developing hypothermia include confusion,
   bizarre behavior, and withdrawal from group interaction. Victims of hypothermia may be
   unconscious, with nearly undetectable breathing and pulse.
A9.7. (354FW) First Aid for Cold Injuries
   A9.7.1. (354FW) Chilblain and Trench Foot: Prevent further cold exposure. Remove wet
   or constrictive clothing. Gently wash, dry, and elevate the injured part. Cover the injured
   area with layers of loose warm clothing and allow to re-warm. Pain and blisters may
   develop. Do not pop blisters, do not apply lotions or creams, do not massage, do not expose
   to extreme heat, and do not allow victim to walk on injury. Seek medical attention.
   A9.7.2. (354FW) Frostbite: Prevent further cold exposure and remove wet or constrictive
   clothing. Gradually re-warm the injury by direct skin-to-skin contact between injured area
   and non-injured skin of victim or a buddy. Evacuate for medical treatment. Victims with
   foot injuries should not walk, but should be evacuated by litter. Do not thaw frostbite
   injuries if there is a possibility of refreezing during evacuation.
   A9.7.3. (354FW) Hypothermia: Prevent further cold exposure and remove wet clothing.
   Initiate Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) if required. Transport for medical treatment
   as soon as possible. Re-warm by covering with blankets, sleeping bags or body-to-body
   contact if necessary. Get the victim off the ground. Handle gently during treatment and
   evacuation because rough handling of hypothermic victims can cause dangerous irregular
   heartbeats or seizures. Apparently lifeless victims are never pronounced dead, even by
   physicians, until they are “warm and dead”.

                                     LIGHTNING SAFETY

A10.1. (354FW) In the United States, there are an estimated 25 million lightning flashes each
year. During the past 30 years, lightning killed an average of 62 people per year. This ties the
average of 62 deaths per year caused by tornadoes. Yet because lightning usually claims only
one or two victims at a time and does not cause mass destruction of property, it is underrated as a
risk. While documented lightning injuries in the United States average about 300 per year,
undocumented injuries likely much higher.
A10.2. (354FW) Watch for developing thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are most likely to
develop on spring or summer days but can occur year round. As the sun heats the air, pockets of
warmer air start to rise and cumulus clouds form. Continued heating can cause these clouds to
grow vertically into towering cumulus clouds, often the first sign of a developing thunderstorm.
A10.3. (354FW) Lightning can strike as far as 10 miles from an area where it is raining. That's
about the distance you can hear thunder. If you can hear thunder, you are within striking
distance. Seek safe shelter immediately.
A10.4. (354FW) Most lightning deaths and injuries occur in the summer. Where organized
outdoor sports activities take place. Coaches, camp counselors and other adults must stop
activities at the first roar of thunder to ensure everyone time to get in a large building or enclosed
vehicle. Leaders of outdoors events should have a written plan that all staff are aware of and
enforce.
A10.5. (354FW) If outdoors, avoid water, high ground, open spaces, and metal objects
including electric wires, fences, machinery, motors, power tools, etc. Unsafe places include
underneath canopies, small picnic or rain shelters, or near trees. Where possible, find shelter in a
substantial building or in a fully enclosed metal vehicle such as a car, truck or a van with the
windows completely shut. If lightning is striking nearby when you are outside, you should
crouch down, put feet together, place hands over ears to minimize hearing damage from thunder,
and avoid proximity (minimum of 15 ft) to other people.
A10.6. (354FW) If inside a building, stay off corded phones, computers and other electrical
equipment that put you in direct contact with electricity. Stay away from pools, indoor or
outdoor, tubs, showers and other plumbing. Buy surge suppressors for key equipment. Install
ground fault protectors on circuits near water or outdoors. When inside, wait 30 minutes after
the last strike, before going out again.
A10.7. (354FW) If a person is struck by lightning, call 911 and get medical care immediately.
Cardiac arrest and irregularities, burns, and nerve damage are common in cases where people are
struck by lightning. However, with proper treatment, including CPR if necessary, most victims
survive a lightning strike. You are in no danger helping a lightning victim. The charge will not
affect you.
A10.8. (354FW) Lightning is dangerous. With common sense, you can greatly increase your
safety and the safety of those you are with. At the first clap of thunder, go in a large building or
fully enclosed vehicle and wait 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder to back outside.

                                    HIGH WIND SAFETY

A11.1. (354FW) Extreme winds brought on by tornados, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and winter
storms can cause serious damage to your buildings and property, putting you and your family at
risk. Don't wait until it's too late. Wind-proofing your building is a smart way to prevent
damage.
A11.2. (354FW) During high winds, wind speeds fluctuate and winds may change directions.
This puts enormous pressure on all parts of a building. Keeping your building well sealed on the
outside will prevent wind from getting into your building and causing damage. In addition,
debris carried by high winds can penetrate your building, causing damage and possible injury.
A11.3. (354FW) The roof is one of the most vulnerable parts of your building. The connection
between the roof and walls must be strong enough to resist the "uplift" effect of strong winds.
Make sure the roof sheathing is properly installed.
A11.4. (354FW) Windows should be protected to reduce the risk of damage or injury caused by
flying debris and pressure changes.
A11.5. (354FW) Check to be sure entry doors are secured with at least three hinges and a
deadbolt security lock.
A11.6. (354FW) Trim the trees around your building that could pose a threat by falling or
hitting your building. Put away any furniture, grills, tools, and anything else that could become a
flying missile.
A11.7. (354FW) Roll-up doors (the larger, the more prone to damage) are also vulnerable to
damage from high winds. Ensure they are installed correctly and securely.
A11.8. (354FW) Tornados in Alaska are not a significant threat. Compared with other States,
Alaska ranks number 50 for frequency of tornadoes. There has been 1 recorded tornado in
Alaska since 1950.

                                    LARGE HAIL SAFETY

A12.1. (354FW) "Large Hail" is greater than or equal to three-quarter inch in diameter. Large
hail can cause serious or even fatal injuries.
A12.2. (354FW) If you are in an automobile, stop driving. If you can see a safe place close by
(like inside a garage, under a highway overpass, or under a service station awning), drive there as
soon as you can. Make sure you pull completely off the highway. Do not leave the vehicle until
it stops hailing. Your car will furnish reasonable protection.
A12.3. (354FW) Stay away from car windows. Cover your eyes with something (like a piece
of clothing). If possible, get onto the floor face down, or lie down on the seat with your back to
the windows. Put very small children under you, and cover their eyes.
A12.4. (354FW) Stay inside until the hail stops if you are in a building. Stay away from the
windows, especially those being struck by hail. Account for all family members, building
occupants, pets, etc. Do not go outside for any reason. Avoid using phones and electrical
appliances during a severe storm to avoid the danger of electrocution from lightning.
A12.5. (354FW) If you are caught outdoors, seek shelter immediately. If you can't find
something to protect your entire body, at least find something to protect your head. Stay out of
culverts and lowland areas that might fill suddenly with water. Trees are a last resort. It is
common during severe storms for trees to lose branches. Also, large isolated trees attract
lightning.

      CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL WARFARE DEFENSE (CBWD) COLD WEATHER
                            OPERATIONS

A13.1. (354FW) As a CBRNE Low Threat Area, Eielson AFB is not under immediate
chemical or biological threat posed by nation states or non-state actors. The following guidelines,
however, are to be used in training and exercising scenarios in which personnel may be required
to utilize Personal Protective Equipment.
A13.2. (354FW) Commanders should not consider cold conditions a deterrent to Chemical
Warfare agent use. Agent physical properties are affected by temperature, but the effectiveness
is not always degraded at very low temperatures. The major threat from the employment of
chemical warfare weapons in cold regions is the delayed action. The “Danger” is created when
nerve and blister agents are carried into heated shelters on clothing, footgear, or other
equipment. The warmth of the shelter will reactivate these agents creating a chemical vapor
and/or a liquid hazard in the enclosed area.
A13.3. (354FW) Cold weather clothing (parka, field jacket, mittens, etc.) is to be worn OVER
the ground crew ensemble (GCE) if the individual needs protection from the cold. This is an
appropriate practice during exercises and war. Items worn over the GCE will become
contaminated upon contact with CW/BW agents and must be properly discarded during
decontamination procedures.
A13.4. (354FW) Do not wear cotton glove inserts below 32° F. For temperatures between 32°
F and - 10° F, personnel should wear polypropylene gloves with wool inserts under the rubber
gloves. Personnel may also wear winter or leather gloves over the rubber gloves. When
temperatures fall below -10° F, personnel should wear polypropylene gloves, wool inserts, and
winter gloves (minus the rubber gloves).
A13.5. (354FW) In extremely cold temperatures, the M50 and MCU-2AP protective masks
become very rigid and are difficult to don. When donned at these temperatures, the protective
mask causes instantaneous frostbite on the individual’s face. Due to this potential, 354 FW
personnel will not wear protective masks outdoors, during exercises, when wind chill
temperatures (WCT) are 0º F or below. If moving from indoors to outdoors, remove mask and
dry face prior to going outside. Personnel will wear the mask when indoors.
A13.6. (354FW) When temperatures are above 0° F WCT, personnel will observe the
appropriate MOPP level, including wear of the gas mask. Below 32º F, personnel should be
aware the gas mask may still be very cold and be somewhat rigid. Also, the mask eye lenses
may fog and freeze when the mask is donned. In addition, breath condensation may freeze the
valves and the voicemitter assembly. To minimize this, during MOPP conditions 0-2, the mask
must be carried under outer garments to remain relatively warm from the individual’s body
heat. Refer to AFMAN 32-4005, paragraph A7.3., for specific instructions for cold-weather use
of the mask.

              COLD WEATHER FACILITY INSPECTION PROCEDURES

A14.1. (354FW) With the arrival of extended cold weather, it is essential to inspect unoccupied
facilities to ensure there is adequate heat to prevent property loss from frozen water lines or
leaking steam lines.
A14.2. (354FW) Visit unoccupied facilities daily when temperatures are +20º F to -39º F. If
temperatures are -40º F or colder, conduct building checks a minimum of every 8 hours. Inspect
each unoccupied facility to ensure:
   A14.2.1. (354FW) Windows and exterior doors are completely closed and secure, with no
      excessive build-up of frost or ice on the inside. If signs of excessive frost build-up are
      present, look for sources of moisture like open water lines or steam leaks.
   A14.2.2. (354FW) Administrative and living space temperatures are minimum 60º F.
   A14.2.3. (354FW) Warehouse/hangar space temperatures are minimum 50º F.
   A14.2.4. (354FW) Temperature and humidity are under control. Temperatures greater than
   80º F,     high humidity, or musty odors may indicate a problem with the heating system,
   pumps, etc.
   A14.2.5. (354FW) Furnaces, blowers, pumps, etc. are not making unusual or loud noises.
   A14.2.6. (354FW) Interior doors are left open to maximize air movement within the
   facility.
   A14.2.7. (354FW) Check floors for standing water from frozen pipes. If there are no
   obvious signs of burst pipes, open faucets to ensure water flow.
   A14.2.8. (354FW) Inspect for steam leaks. Look around pipe fittings and valves for fluids.
A14.3. (354FW) Facilities that do not have water and/or steam heat are exempt from the
temperature-driven checks.
A14.4. (354FW) If there are any problems, contact the 354 CES Service Call desk.
