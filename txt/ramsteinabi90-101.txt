This instruction implements DoD Continuous Process Improvement/Lean Six Sigma Guidebook
and the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Playbook. It establishes the
structure and responsibilities to govern the Air Force’s Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)
methodology, AFSO21 for the 86th Airlift Wing (86 AW). It defines the structure to initiate and
institutionalize CPI to ensure consistency in training application of improvement efforts; provide
the requisite supporting structure to supervisors, process owners, and the workforce; provide
required leadership governance over process improvement; and direct studies that enhance
organizational effectiveness and efficiency, realize cost avoidance and give time back to Airmen.
This instruction applies to all 86 AW personnel. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.             Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route AF Form 847 from the
field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

1. AFSO21 is our standard concept and approach to immediate and long-term improvement. In
addition, it helps Air Force leaders make sound resource allocation decisions to achieve these
goals. The objective of this program is to maximize value and reduce and/or eliminate waste in
all 86 AW processes to fully integrate continuous improvement in wing missions.

     1.1. The general philosophy of the wing’s AFSO21 program is that this is a group led, wing
     monitored program. Squadrons and groups will look for areas in which improvements can
     best be made or in which changes to programs/processes will have the greatest impact. The
     86 AW AFSO21 Office (86 AW/CCO) will then advise/assist the group or squadron Process
     Managers in their application of AFSO21 tools and concepts.
2. Organization. The 86 AW AFSO21 Office (CCO) will work for the Director of Staff, but
will report to the 86 AW/CV in order to initiate and institutionalize continuous process
improvement for the entire wing structure. The CCO is responsible for ensuring consistency in
application of improvement efforts, training of group process managers, provide supporting
structure to groups, process owners, supervisors and the workforce while providing the required
leadership governance over process improvements. The structure below is the prescribed setup

  2.9. Conclusion. Our goal in the 86 AW is to create and sustain an environment of
  continuous process improvement across the wing, from the top of the organization down to
  each individual squadron, flight, and work center. The organization culture must strive to
  eliminate duplication of effort, value-added commitment of resources and an ability to
  challenge available multi skill/dimensional/cultural work teams to help push/strive for higher
  levels of productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
