Section A—Overview

1. Concept of Operations. The CAIB is a Commander's tool which allows the Commander to
assess the health of the community and to enact positive programs and services to foster
resiliency. This forum is built on a holistic Comprehensive Airman Fitness (CAF) framework
using mental, physical, social and spiritual pillars to focus the community action programs thus
developing a resilient AF culture.
       1.1. The focus of CAIBs is to identify and resolve issues that impact the readiness and
       resilience of AF members and their families, promote the AF as a positive way of life,
       and enhance members' ability to function as productive members of the AF community.
       The emphasis will be on positive actions and programs that strengthen force readiness
       through a sense of community and assist AF members and civilians, their families, and
       communities to thrive and successfully manage the demands of military life.
 4                                                             AFI90-501 15 OCTOBER 2013


       1.2. Effective functioning of the CAIB requires grassroots input on the issues affecting
       individuals, families, installations, and communities. CAIBs promote collaboration
       among helping agencies, reduce duplication of efforts, identify gaps in service, develop
       and implement local solutions, and elevate issues to higher headquarters. When
       resolution is not within local CAIB scope or capabilities or requires changes in higher
       headquarters, AF or DoD policy and/or Legislative action, the issue will be forwarded to
       the next CAIB level using the template in Attachment 4. The CAIB Chair approves all
       submissions forwarded to Higher Headquarters. HAF/MAJCOM CAIBs work and track
       issues forwarded from lower level CAIBs and keep them informed of progress. If
       resolution/implementation is not feasible, an appropriately staffed reply will be provided
       to originating CAIB.
       1.3. To streamline and expedite the flow of information, CAIB Chairs may authorize
       CAIB Executive Directors and IDS Chairs to communicate directly with Higher
       Headquarters counterparts. This authority does not eliminate the responsibility to ensure
       senior leadership is fully informed on CAIB/IDS issues and proposed actions.
       1.4. CAIB Membership, Roles, and Responsibilities. The CAIB approach to
       community problem solving takes a broad perspective to integrate and synergize efforts
       to address community concerns. See Attachment 2 for a synopsis of CAIB
       responsibilities, meeting frequency, and membership. CAIB Chair responsibilities cannot
       be delegated.
       1.5. Inspections.
       1.5.1. CAIB activities will be inspected as determined by AF/MAJCOM Inspector
       General (IG). MAJCOMs establish inspection programs consistent with Mission
       Directive responsibilities and in accordance with AF inspection guidelines outlined in
       AFI 90-201, Air Force Inspection System. MAJCOMs utilize HAF and MAJCOM
       Functional Area Manager (FAM) checklists for conducting inspections. Inspection of a
       unit CAIB and IDS must be performed by a MAJCOM CAIB or IDS member. (T-2).
          1.5.2. HAF checklists standardize assessment criteria and facilitate AF, MAJCOM,
          and Numbered Air Force (NAF) inspection, evaluation, and unit self-assessment
          programs. The OPR for AFI 90-501 is responsible for ensuring a CAIB/IDS checklist
          is available on the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) which can be found
          at: https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod2/mic/mict/mymictview.aspx
All checklists will be reviewed annually by the HAF/MAJCOM functional staffs; HAF checklist
review/update conducted NLT 31 January with MAJCOM supplement review/update NLT 31
March.
       1.5.3. Self-assessment provides commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit
       health and complements external assessments. MAJCOMs will ensure self-assessment
       programs are established for subordinate organizations. Direct reporting units and field
       operating agencies will develop and implement self-assessment programs that align with
       HAF intent and function in similar fashion as wing programs described in AFI 90-201,
       The Air Force Inspection System. Annually, installations will use the CAIB/IDS
       checklist loaded on the MICT site to conduct self-assessments. (T-2).
AFI90-501 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      5


  1.6. IDS. The IDS functions as the action arm of the CAIB and develops a comprehensive,
  coordinated plan for integrating and implementing community outreach and prevention
  programs (e.g., financial, relationship, family maltreatment, sexual assault, equal
  opportunity, suicide prevention, substance abuse, health promotion, tobacco cessation, etc.),
  with the goal of enhancing resilience in military communities. The IDS improves the
  delivery of human service programs by establishing a seamless system of services through
  collaborative partnerships and coordinated activities. See Attachment 2 for a synopsis of
  IDS responsibilities, meeting frequency, and membership. (T-2).
         1.6.1. Each member develops, collects, analyzes for trends and implications, and
         regularly presents metrics reflecting the status of the part of the community they
         represent. Additionally, the IDS reviews the AF Community Assessment Survey
         results and other quality of life surveys and resilience-related data to determine
         implications and develop necessary actions for the appropriate level/forum.
         1.6.2. The IDS uses a variety of approaches (focus groups, surveys, town meetings,
         interviews, Caring for People forums, member agency trend analyses or other
         collected data, etc.) to identify individual, family, and community concerns, and to
         develop and implement cross-organizational solutions to problems that cannot be
         resolved by individual IDS organizations.
             1.6.2.1. The IDS promotes collaboration among helping agencies, identifies gaps
             in service, and reduces duplication of effort.
             1.6.2.2. The IDS elevates to higher levels of leadership if resolution is not within
             the scope of that level of command.
         1.6.3. CAIBs require evidence-based decision support to facilitate program oversight
         and to identify and mitigate negative trends. For example, monitoring key indicators
         (such as alcohol and drug abuse and counseling workload, to include deployment/re-
         deployment counseling with chaplain services) helps identify potential emerging
         issues that could contribute to suicides among total force members.
         1.6.4. IDS teams routinely collect and evaluate indicators for risk behaviors, such as
         those related to substance abuse, family maltreatment, completed and attempted
         suicides, sexual assaults, fitness test-pass/fail rates, and tobacco use.
         1.6.5. IDS teams also track helping agency counseling workload and topics of client
         concerns, such as those related to Financial Management, Military OneSource,
         Military Family Life Consultant, School Liaison, Exceptional Family Member
         Program, Family Practice, Mental Health, Spiritual/Chaplain, and Equal Employment
         Opportunity/Climate Assessments. A tool the IDS has mandated its teams use to help
         their analysis of these issues is a structured approach to problem solving and standard
         template. The approach is a six step methodology for defining the problem and
         achieving the goal. The first three steps, define the problem through a problem
         statement, a goal, and supporting assumptions. The next three steps achieve the goal
         by establishing SMART objectives, tasks to achieve the objectives, and measures to
         indicate when the tasks are complete.
         1.6.6. HAF IDS officials establish a standardized list of key indicator metrics to
         monitor, evaluate, and report measurable information on risk behaviors and helping-
 6                                                              AFI90-501 15 OCTOBER 2013


           agency counseling workload data. It is the responsibility of all IDS teams to note any
           negative trends in the data they are tracking, assess Institutional risk and to bring to
           the CAIB solutions for addressing those concerns.

Section B—Funding

2. Funding for CAIB/IDS Activities. The CAIB and IDS are cross-functional forums and as
such do not have assigned budgets. Funding for cross-functional initiatives will be provided by
the participating agencies, and supplemented when needed by CAIB Chair resources. (Tier 2).

Section C—Training

3. Training. Training of CAIB and IDS facilitates success of each forum’s specific missions
and collaborative efforts.
       3.1. The CAIB Executive Director and IDS Chair facilitate and document initial training
       for newly assigned CAIB and IDS members. At a minimum, training will include a
       thorough orientation briefing covering the role and purpose of the CAIB/IDS, member
       responsibilities, and information flow. The AF IDS makes available computer based
       core training for new CAIB and IDS members, which augments local face-to-face
       orientation sessions with CAIB Executive Directors and IDS Chairs.
       3.2. CAIB/IDS overview will be included in all newly assigned commander’s courses.

Section D—AF Community Assessment (CA)

4. CA. The AF IDS ensures execution of a biennial community assessment, and disseminates
results to all MAJCOMs and installations. The CA is designed to help CAIBs identify
community strengths/needs, assess the effectiveness of community services and identify service
gaps. Specifically, the CA must assess and trend key indicators of community health and well-
being and effectiveness of programs offered by the organizations represented on the IDS.
Wherever possible, the assessment is conducted with a random representative sample of
community members.

Section E—Caring for People (CfP) forums and Community Action Plans

5. CfP forums and Community Action Plans: Biennially, each installation will conduct a CfP
forum, consistent with guidance provided by the AF CAIB, to identify and address significant
community issues requiring resolution. CfP forums will consist of representatives from the
installation CAIB/IDS team and a cross section of select AF community members to include
Airmen, family members, and AF civilians. Installation functional experts will brief participants
on identified community issues and provide results of various available surveys to include results
from the most recent AF Community Assessment Survey. CAIBs will also consider results from
additional community needs and command consultation assessment tools, such as Unit and
Human Relations Climate Assessments, Airmen and Family Readiness Center Support and
Resilience Inventory, Air Force Culture Assessment Safety Tool, and the NORTHSTAR
Initiative research tool. For issues within the scope of the installation to resolve, the CfP forum
will incorporate their efforts into their Community Action Plan (CAP) using the format outlined
at Attachment 3. The CAIB/IDS will elevate issues requiring higher headquarters resolution to
AFI90-501 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                         7


the MAJCOM CAIB, using the template at Attachment 4. The MAJCOM CAIB/IDS will
determine whether to address the issue at the MAJCOM level or elevate it to the AF CfP forum
which will also be held biannually. All CAPs must be approved within six months of the official
release of the AF Community Assessment Survey results. The IDS will report CAP progress at
all respective CAIB meetings. (T-2).

Section F—Best Practices

6. Best Practices. The CAIB directs new initiatives in response to emerging trends from data,
research, lessons learned, and best practices. Working through their respective IDS, the CAIB
ensures new initiatives are integrated into community programs.
       6.1. The CAIB evaluates the effectiveness of IDS programs through reported metrics to
       understand current climate, values, and beliefs and make informed decisions that lead to
       future initiatives.
       6.2. Sharing best practices is an optimal way to achieve a stated goal/objective.
       Additionally, it provides alternate methods to manage resources, align initiatives to
       strategic goals, improve tracking/reporting, and reduce time/money spent on unsuccessful
       processes. Formalizing best practices emphasizes communication and continuous
       improvement.
           6.2.1. Each CAIB/IDS will look for opportunities to up-channel to higher
           headquarters potential best practices using the template in Attachment 5, or other
           procedure established by HAF CAIB/IDS. MAJCOM and HAF CAIB/IDSs will
           consider sharing with other CAIB/IDSs within their sphere of influence all potential
           best practices submitted to them for consideration.
           6.2.2. Identification, recommendation, and sharing of potential best practices will be
           documented in CAIB/IDS meeting minutes.
           6.2.3. Submit lessons learned observations of issues and best practices via the Joint
           Lessons Learned Information System database; unclassified inputs via NIPRNet at
           https://www.jllis.mil and classified inputs via SIPRNet.

Section G—Administrative Support

7. Administrative Support. Leadership at all levels will ensure adequate administrative and
logistical support for CAIB and IDS functions and initiatives. If a CSC is on staff they will be
designated as office of record for all CAIB and IDS documentation; if not, CAIB Chairs will
designate another appropriate office. (T-2).

Section H—CSC

8. CSC. Developed to operationalize CAF domains to help Airmen and their families
withstand, recover and/or grow in the face of stressors and changing demands, CSC positions
were created to serve as the focal point for installation resilience programs. Reporting directly to
the Wing or Vice Wing Commander, CSCs. (T-2).
       8.1. Provide commanders with a multi-discipline capability that coordinates and
       integrates efforts of individual prevention and response programs.
 8                                                               AFI90-501 15 OCTOBER 2013


        8.2. Serve as a lead for installation Leadership Pathways, and ensure resilience education
        and awareness is provided at the installation through use of master resilience trainers.
        8.3. Serve as the Wingman program lead, providing guidance on Wingman Day
        activities.
        8.4. Serve as the CfP Coordinator.
        8.5. Serve permanently as both CAIB Executive Director and IDS Chair, at the
        discretion of the appointing authority. This applies to fulltime CSC positions at all levels
        of the AF (installations, MAJCOMs, and HAF).

Section I—Communication Process

9. Communication Process.
        9.1. The goal of the CAIB/IDS is to work collectively to enhance and improve delivery
        of programs that support overall quality of life shared by all personnel in military
        communities.
        9.2. Any recommendations that cannot be approved or disapproved at any level of
        review because of lack of sufficient authority or resources shall be referred to the next
        level of review.
     9.3. Installation level IDS recommendations shall be communicated formally in writing and
     summarized as part of the minutes. If recommendations cannot be approved or disapproved
     at wing level, the IDS Chair will forward to the CAIB. CAIB Director or CSC shall respond
