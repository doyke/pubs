       UNIT INTELLIGENCE STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. This chapter applies to organizations below MAJCOM level.                         Each
unit/organization with an Air Force intelligence mission is required to establish an Intelligence
Stan/Eval function for the purposes of this instruction. The SIO is responsible to assign
personnel to the Intelligence Stan/Eval function full-time, as an additional duty or a mixture of
both. The scope, diversity of duties and number of personnel assigned to the unit will dictate the
number of evaluators required. The Intelligence Stan/Eval function should be located at the
highest echelon possible (e.g., for the flying wing, the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will be at
the OSS/OSF IN level).
3.2. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval. The conduct of the Intelligence Stan/Eval program is directed
by and resides under the supervision/responsibility of the unit SIO.
   3.2.1. Unit SIO Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the SIO that relate to the
   Intelligence Stan/Eval program:
       3.2.1.1. Establish a unit Intelligence Stan/Eval function to perform the duties directed by
       this instruction.
       3.2.1.2. Direct evaluations to maintain a quality force.
       3.2.1.3. Direct supplementary evaluations.
       3.2.1.4. Chair and determine the composition of the Intelligence Stan/Eval Board (SEB).
       The SEB is a forum convened at the SIO level to review and resolve intelligence
       standardization issues for the unit as well as subordinate and attached units as applicable.
       3.2.1.5. Designate evaluators in writing.
       3.2.1.6. Attend as many evaluations as practical.
       3.2.1.7. (Added)-(HQ AFGSC) Ensure written instructions are maintained identifying
       all procedures and responsibilities for peacetime and contingency operations to
       standardize performance and provide continuity. Procedures will be coordinated with
       squadron intelligence, plans, weapons and tactics, Aircrew Life Support (ALS), Survival,
       Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), and Security Forces (SF) as appropriate.
       Procedures will be approved at the wing/group level when necessary. Written instructions
       will be reviewed annually and updated whenever necessary due to procedural changes.
       As a minimum, the SIO will ensure current written instructions are available for the
       following activities when applicable to unit operations:

     inspection, will be used to conduct self- inspections.
         3.2.1.8.1. (Added)-(HQ AFGSC) Self-assessments will be conducted on an annual
         basis. Assessments will detail deficiencies and recommend corrective actions. The
         SIO will track corrective actions until resolution. Results of the self- inspection will be
         forwarded to AFGSC/A2Q NLT 7 calendar days after the self- inspection. Does not
         apply to AFRC units.
  3.2.2. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval Organization.
     3.2.2.1. The SIO will define the Intelligence Stan/Eval functional organization IAW with
     MAJCOM guidance. The number of personnel involved with the unit’s/organization’s
     Intelligence Stan/Eval function should be proportionate to the unit’s/organization’s scope
     and number of assigned personnel.
     3.2.2.2. The Chief of Stan/Eval will be a qualified and current Intelligence Evaluator
     IAW the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.

                                         EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Intelligence Stan/Eval Program utilizes qualification evaluations to ensure
certification of intelligence personnel and standardization of intelligence opera tions. Intelligence
qualification evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Form 4350.
Certification of core tasks of specialty training standard (STS) may be accomplished
concurrently with intelligence evaluations.
5.2. Intelligence Qualification Evaluations. Intelligence qualification evaluations consist of
two structured phases, knowledge and task. Each phase requires the completion of requisite
events. The knowledge phase includes a series of written (and/or oral, if applicable)
examinations. The task phase includes a hands-on evaluation of intelligence performance.
   5.2.1. Intelligence Qualification Evaluation Types. There are four types of intelligence
   qualification evaluations that may be further described by the following designators.
   Qualification evaluations (QUAL) are administered at the culmination of IQT to ensure basic
   qualification in the duty position of the intelligence professional. Mission Qualification
   (MSN) evaluations ensure the individual’s ability to support full mission planning and
   employment in accomplishing the unit’s operational mission. Provisions are made to ensure
   intelligence personnel are certified and maintain specialized qualifications (e.g., external
   intelligence trainer (EIT), intelligence evaluator (IE)) and provide the flexibility to evaluate
   and certify specific intelligence performance (through SPOT evaluations). Intelligence
   personnel will complete the following types of intelligence qualification evaluations as
   appropriate:
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All intelligence personnel will complete a QUAL
       evaluation in their primary assigned mission, to include requisites, as specified in the
       applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
       5.2.1.2. MSN Evaluations. All intelligence personnel maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
       status will complete an initial MSN evaluation (INIT MSN) upon the completion of
       Mission Qualification Training. Periodic MSN evaluations in their primary assigned
       mission, to include requisites in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, are then administered
       to ensure proficiency is maintained. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and
       difficulty of tasks required in the performance of support to contingency and training
       operations.
       5.2.1.3. Specialized Qualification Evaluations. All intelligence personnel maintaining
       specialized qualifications in a particular MDS, weapons system or intelligence function
       or activity, must complete initial and periodic evaluations of their specialized
       qualifications IAW their respective AFI 14-2(MDS), Volumes 1-3.
       5.2.1.4. SPOT Evaluations (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended
       to satisfy the requirements of a periodic (i.e., MSN) or specialized qualification
       evaluation. SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless
       specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation begun as a SPOT evaluation may
       become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all requirements are
       completed during the SPOT evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all
14                                            AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


     knowledge phase requirements for the evaluation within the periods described in
     paragraph 5.2.6. Do not add on events to complete the requirements for a periodic
     evaluation unless the SIO concurs with the member’s desire to realign the evaluation
     expiration date and approves the additional time requirements. All evaluations not listed
     in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.4. will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When
     the evaluator administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in support to the MDS or
     position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited toward a periodic evaluation.
  5.2.2. Combined Intelligence Evaluations.        To promote efficient use of resources,
  accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
  designation of each evaluation in the Task Phase of the AF Form 4350 - e.g., EIT/MSN.
  5.2.3. Intelligence Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, if applicable, to
  further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.4.:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a position or specialized
     qualification (e.g., INIT MSN, INIT EIT).
     5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to requalify on an item due to
     loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items as specified in applicable AFI
     14-2(MDS)v1), a recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.4.7. for
     rechecks) or loss of qualification due to supervisor or SIO-directed downgrade.
         5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. The AF Form 4350 description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
         5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
         will be as directed by the SIO and will include, as a minimum, those items for which
         the individual is non-current for over 6 months. The AF Form 4350 Event/Check
         description will be documented with RQ SPOT (exception: when loss of
         qualification is due to loss of currency for specialized qualification as defined in AFI
         14-2(MDS)v1, the AF Form 4350 Event/Check description will be documented with
         RQ specialized qualification evaluation designator (e.g. RQ EIT)).
         5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass an evaluation, the recheck
         evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.12. The AF For m 4350
         Event/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
         applicable.
         5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to an SIO-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 7.4.8.), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the SIO. The AF Form
         4350 Event/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
         applicable.
         5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
         qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for an event. The
     beginning of normal preparation for an event will be determined by the evaluator and
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                          15


      may be defined further by the unit. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for
      the event because it is to be an evaluation.
          5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides SIOs and supervisors a
          sampling of daily performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
          5.2.3.3.2. If an examinee elects, a no-notice evaluation may update a MSN
          evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed
          within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.6. If all requirements were not
          completed on the first event, subsequent events are authorized to complete required
          events. If the examinee elects not to update a MSN evaluation expiration date, the
          evaluation will be documented as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
      5.2.3.4. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., N/N SPOT).
      The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations will be
      explained under Task Description in the Evaluator’s Remarks (see paragraph 7.4.5.8.).
   5.2.4. Knowledge Phase Requisites. The knowledge phase for periodic intelligence
   qualification evaluations includes a series of requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this
   instruction for additional guidelines on examinations.
      5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. As specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
      5.2.4.2. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
   5.2.5. Task Phase Requisites. The profile used to fulfill the task phase requisite must
   incorporate all appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, and allow
   accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
   tasking, daily training events, be realistic and incorporate current operational support
   requirements.
   5.2.6. Timing of Intelligence Qualification Evaluations.
      5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 19th
      month following the month in which the task phase was successfully completed (e.g. an
      individual’s INIT MSN occurs in January 2007, the individual enters continuation
      training in February 2007, the eligibility window for the individual’s periodic MSN
      begins in March 2007, and certification expires in September 2008). (See Table 5.1.)

         5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (6- month
         period prior to expiration date).
         5.2.6.3. SIO-Extended Evaluations. SIOs may extend the expiration date of periodic
         evaluations up to 3 months for the reasons listed below. Document such extensions with
         a Memo for Record placed in the individual’s on- line intelligence training and evaluation
         record.
             5.2.6.3.1. Individual assigned PCS/PCA.
             5.2.6.3.2. Individual departing for extended TDY.
             5.2.6.3.3. Individual removal from active intel status (e.g. separation or retirement
             from the Service).
             5.2.6.3.4. Individual participating in real world operations (to include operations
             other than war, etc.) who are not able to complete the required event evaluation(s)
             before or during deployment.
         5.2.6.4. Transfers. Upon PCS or TDY, individuals meeting the requirements specified in
         the gaining MAJCOM intelligence directives (if applicable) may retain current
         qualifications. However, prior to performing duties unsupervised at a new unit, they
         must meet the following requirements:
             5.2.6.4.1. Satisfactorily complete training requirements directed by the gaining
             MAJCOM and the unit.
             5.2.6.4.2. Satisfactorily complete the Intelligence Stan/Eval written examination for
             the duty position.
      5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
      of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. Requisites from a completed
      evaluation may not be used for subsequent evaluations.
      5.2.8. Evaluation Criteria Source. The lead MAJCOM will establish and maintain
      standardized QUAL, MSN and specialized qualification evaluation criteria in the appropriate
      AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for coordinating the establishment of
      areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those required and
      critical for evaluation completion. A critical area is a designated area that is absolutely
      necessary for the success of the mission where failure to follow the strict requirements of
      instructions/regulations, safe operations or conduct could compromise the mission. Grade all
      critical areas as either qualified (Q) or unqualified (U). Critical areas will be identified in the
      individual AFI 14-2(MDS)v2s as applicable.
      5.2.9. Grading system. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
      performance. The first tier is comprised of the individual areas/subareas (e.g. debriefing,
      mission planning, etc.) where a grade of Q, Q- or U is assigned based on established criteria,
      cumulative grades for each task (e.g. preparation, delivery, adherence to unit standards, etc.)
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                        17


  in an area/subarea on a gradesheet and evaluator judgment. The second tier consists of the
  overall qualification level itself (Q-1, Q-2 or Q-3) which is determined from the compilation
  of these individual scores/grades from all the individual areas/subareas.
     5.2.9.1. Written, Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Grade written, computer
     based or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See paragraph
     6.4.6. for minimum passing grade specifics.
     5.2.9.2. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, will establish areas and subareas to
     be evaluated and the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas will
     have a two- level (Q/U) or three- level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade
     will be the lowest of any subarea grade awarded.
         5.2.9.2.1. Qualified (Q). Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee
         demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed
         intelligence duties within the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned
         mission.
         5.2.9.2.2. Qualified with discrepancies (Q-). Q- indicates the examinee is qualified
         to perform the assigned area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as
         determined by the evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed
         the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize safety/security.
         5.2.9.2.3. Unqualified (U). Assign a U area grade for any performance outside
         allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that
         adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised safety. An examinee
         receiving an area grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the
         judgment of the evaluator, additional training will not constructively improve the
         examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the evaluator must
         thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.9.3. Qualification Levels. Overall evaluation performance is graded by qualification
     levels as follows:
         5.2.9.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1).      The member demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.9.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
             area(s)/subarea(s).
             5.2.9.3.1.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies preclude
             awarding an overall Qualification Level 1.
             5.2.9.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
             debrief of that evaluation.
         5.2.9.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The member demonstrated the ability to
         perform duties, but:
             5.2.9.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
             was assigned.
18                                             AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


             5.2.9.3.2.2. A non-critical area(s)/subarea(s) grade of U was awarded.
             5.2.9.3.2.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
             performance in one or several areas/subareas.
         5.2.9.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The member demonstrated an unacceptable
         level of safety, performance or knowledge.
             5.2.9.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
             for the evaluation.
             5.2.9.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator,
             there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
  5.2.10. Grading Policies.
     5.2.10.1. Requisite Examination. The evaluator will consider performance on requisite
     examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the grading criteria in the applicable AFI
     14-2(MDS)v2, to grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation.
     5.2.10.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.10.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded is based on performance during
         both the knowledge and task phases. This grade will be awarded only after all
         evaluation requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
         5.2.10.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the member must satisfy
         the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2 and demonstrate proficiency
         in all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 14-
         2(MDS)v2 may dictate the highest grade for an event based on area and subarea
         performance, evaluator judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding
         the overall qualification level.
  5.2.11. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy.
  Remedial action includes debriefing the discrepancies and/or assignment of additional
  training and/or imposing of restrictions.
     5.2.11.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the evaluator provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated wit h
     “Debriefed” in paragraph B of the Evaluator’s Remarks section of the AF Form 4350
     Comments.
     5.2.11.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by an evaluator to remedy
     deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.11.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, instruction, use of a computer
         based training program or an event. Once additional training is complete, the
         examinee must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                          19


         5.2.11.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Evaluator’s Remarks in the AF Form 4350 Comments.
         Description of additional training will include how satisfactory knowledge or
         proficiency will be demonstrated to an evaluator, supervisor or instructor.
         5.2.11.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 4350 (see paragraphs 7.4.5.6.
         and 7.4.5.7.).
             5.2.11.2.3.1. For Active Duty intelligence personnel, additional training due dates
             will be no later than the end of the first full month following the month in which
             the evaluation was conducted. For example, if an evaluation is accomplished on
             15 February, all additional training must be completed by 31 March.
             5.2.11.2.3.2. For AFRC and ANG intelligence personnel, to include IMAs,
             additional training due dates will be no later than the end of the second full month
             or two unit training assemblies (UTAs) following the month in which the
             evaluation was conducted. For example, if an evaluation is accomplished on 15
             February, all additional training must be completed by 30 April (assuming the
             individual attended two UTAs during that time to complete the requirements).
     5.2.11.3. Restrictions.
         5.2.11.3.1. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment
         of the evaluator and/or supervisor, the examinee will not perform applicable duties
         while unsupervised until successful completion of assigned additiona l training and/or
         a recheck.
         5.2.11.3.2. Restrictions should address the specific task or event that requires
         supervision until successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not punitive, but
         designed to enhance performance and proficiency.
         5.2.11.3.3. Specific restrictions will be documented.
  5.2.12. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Recheck. If an individual fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be
     completed within 30 days (60 days for ARC or two UTAs). SIOs may approve waivers
     to the time limits up to an additional 30 days (30 days or one UTA for ARC) on a case-
     by-case basis. Document such action with a Memo for Record.
     5.2.12.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade members receiving a Q-3 on a QUAL or MSN
     evaluation to non- mission ready (N-MR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic
     mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic qualified (N-BQ) status, as applicable. For
     specialized qualification evaluations, status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be
     downgraded if the discrepancies were only in specialized qualification areas. Note:
     Status downgrade does not affect AFSC skill levels.
     5.2.12.3. Restrictions. Restrict individuals failing to complete an evaluation within the
     required period or receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation, as listed above, until a successful
     evaluation is completed:
         5.2.12.3.1. QUAL Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status.
20                                           AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


         5.2.12.3.2. MSN Evaluation. The examinee may perform basic qualification tasks
         unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised status for mission
         tasks.
         5.2.12.3.3. Specialized Qualification Evaluation.        Examinees receiving an
         unsatisfactory grade in any specialized area(s) will not perform specialized duties
         until a successful recheck is complete.
  5.2.13. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the member to be placed
  on supervised status, the type of supervisor will be determined by the SIO (or equivalent) or
  as specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                          21

                      INTELLIGENCE EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The Intelligence Examination Program measures an individual’s knowledge of
normal procedures, threats and other information essential for effective intelligence operations
through the administration of written, computer based or electronic examinations. Poor testing
performance on examinations indicates areas requiring increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. The Intelligence Examination Program includes requisite examinations for periodic
evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open
book and closed book tests as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation.          Lead MAJCOM will describe the MDS/weapons
   system/function/activity-specific intelligence examination program in written guidance.
   Units will describe the unit specific examination process in written guidance.
   6.3.2. Retention of Examination Records.      Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until AF Form 4350 is completed.
   6.3.3. Examination Question Review. Intelligence Stan/Eval will review all MQFs (HHQ
   and local) and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. Identify corrections/changes to HHQ MQF to the responsible MAJCOM.
6.4. Required Tests. Individuals will complete examinations as requisites for periodic MSN
evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.) and any other examination required by the appropriate AFI 14-
2(MDS)v2. Requisites may be completed anytime during the eligibility period for credit.
   6.4.1. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval functions will develop and control written examinations
   for each duty position. However, when different duty positions are responsible for identical
   information, a single examination will suffice.
   6.4.2. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval will maintain two tests on file for each duty position and
   ensure that no more than 50% of the questions are duplicated between tests.
   6.4.3. Units using computer- generated examinations do not need to maintain the
   examinations referenced above provided the following restrictions are observed:
       6.4.3.1. Individual examinations are randomly generated from the standardized MQF.
       6.4.3.2. Re-examinations are constructed so that duplication of questions is kept to a
       minimum.
   6.4.4. Change 50 percent of the questions on the requisite examinatio ns every calendar year.
   6.4.5. Test Security. Intelligence Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
   tests, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
   6.4.6. Grading Policy. Minimum Passing Grade.            The minimum passing grade for
   examinations is 85 percent-corrected to 100 percent.
   6.4.7. Types of Tests.
22                                          AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


     6.4.7.1. Open Book Tests. Open book test questions will come from publications made
     available to the individual during testing. Each unit may develop an open book secure
     question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the open book test
     questions. Do not distribute the SQB to personnel and safeguard it in the same manner as
     any other required Intelligence Stan/Eval examination.
     6.4.7.2. Closed Book Tests. Closed book questions will come from MQFs. These
     questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for mission
     accomplishment.
  6.4.8. Failure to Pass. An evaluation will not be complete until all failed items have been
  successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.8.1. Reexamination Policy. An individual failing a required test must be afforded an
     adequate study period prior to reexamination. The individual will be reevaluated using
     an alternate exam.
     6.4.8.2. Reexamination Period. Individuals who fail a required test must complete a
     successful reexamination within 30 days (AFRC/ANG: 60 days or two unit training
     assemblies (UTAs)) following the date of the failure. Waiver authority to extend the time
     allowed to successfully complete the examination is the SIO. Document such waivers
     with a Memo for Record placed in the training record of the individual.
     6.4.8.3. Supervised Status Requirement. Place ind ividuals who fail a requisite open
     book or closed book examination in supervised status until successful retesting is
     completed. For individuals who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
     resulting from failure of either an open book or closed book examination applies only to
     the MDS, weapons system, function or activity for which the examination was
     administered.
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              23


                                            Chapter 7

                             EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the Intelligence Evaluation Program requires accurate
documentation. Evaluation results are recorded on the AF Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence
Qualification, which then serves to record and certify that an individual is qualified for his or her
duty position. An individual’s chronological history of evaluations is recorded on an AF Form
4349, Record of Intelligence Evaluation. Both of these AF Forms are maintained in the
individual’s qualification evaluation record within the on- line documentation system. Evaluation
records will be kept throughout an individual’s service and go with the individual to each
assignment.
7.2. On-line Documentation System. The on- line documentation system contains the source
documents that constitute the history of intelligence qualifications for each intelligence
specialist. The AF Form 4350 is the source document used to record and certify the individual’s
qualification for his/her intelligence duty position. A complete history of the AF Forms 4350 in
a member’s record is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 4349.
   7.2.1. All intelligence personnel supporting the operational mission of the unit/organization
   must have a qualification training and evaluation record, which includes all AF Forms 4350,
   AF Forms 4349, and additional MAJCOM specified items. The qualification training and
   evaluation record is separate and distinct from an individual’s training records.
   7.2.2. Evaluation Materials Contained in the On-Line Documentation System. The on- line
   documentation consists of both qualification training and evaluation materials. The forms
   that make up the individual’s permanent qualification evaluation records are included in the
   following sections:
       7.2.2.1. AF Form 4349 Section. This section contains AF Forms 4349, MAJCOM
       required items and those items authorized by the unit in written guidance (e.g., logs of
       initial and annual reviews). AF Forms 4349 should be on top of this section, in
       chronological order with the most recent on top.
       7.2.2.2. AF Form 4350 Section. This section contains AF Forms 4350 for all evaluations
       listed on the AF Forms 4349 Section. File AF Forms 4350 in chronological order with
       the most recent on top.
       7.2.2.3. Memos for Record (MFR) Section. MFRs documenting waivers, extensio ns and
       major discrepancies relating to qualification are filed in chronological order and are
       linked with AF Forms 4349.
   7.2.3. Gradesheets. While gradesheets are used during qualification, recurring, and
   specialized qualification evaluations, they do not become part of the individual’s permanent
   evaluation record. Gradesheets are discarded or turned over to the individual after the AF
   Form 4350 has been accomplished.
7.3. Review of Qualification Training and Evaluation Records.
   7.3.1. Initial Review. The unit will review the records for all newly assigned intelligence
   personnel to identify previous training and qualifications. The reviewing organization is
 24                                            AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


   responsible for establishing the currency and qualification of the intelligence specialist as
   determined from the latest applicable documentation. Following determination of the
   currency and qualification of the intelligence specialist, the unit maintaining the record is
   responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the record.
   7.3.2. Annual Review. As a minimum, the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will review each
   individual’s record annually (manually or via a report generated by the on- line
   documentation system) for expiration dates of required evaluations.
   7.3.3. Corrections.
       7.3.3.1. AF Forms 4350. As source documents, AF Forms 4350 may be corrected by use
       of an electronic correction form in the on- line documentation system provided the
       intelligence evaluator who signed the AF Form 4350 verifies the change.
       7.3.3.2. AF Forms 4349. AF Forms 4349, not being source documents, may be altered
       without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected member and the contents of
       AF Form 4350 Section.
   7.3.4. Transfer of Qualification Training and Evaluation Record. When custody of the
   record is transferred to a new unit or base, the losing unit will ensure the record is properly
   archived in the on- line documentation system for the gaining unit’s retrieval. The
   qualification training and evaluation records for personnel in inactive status or not serving
   with an Air Force intelligence operational mission will be stored on the on- line
   documentation system in a dormant status. Individuals should retain an electronic back-up
   copy of their records during their inactive status.
   7.3.5. Disposition of Qualification Training and Evaluation Record.
       7.3.5.1. Dispose of the record according to Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
       (AFRDS), and this instruction.
       7.3.5.2. Outdated material and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews
       will be returned to the member for disposal.
7.4. AF Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence Qualification.
   7.4.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 4350 to record and to certify intelligence qualification as
   demonstrated in required evaluations.
   7.4.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 4350.
   7.4.3. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (knowledge or task phase) of the
   evaluation requisites or additional training. Use this date on the AF Form 4349.
   7.4.4. Section I - Examinee Information.
       7.4.4.1. Name, Grade and last 4 digits Social Security Account Number (SSAN).
       7.4.4.2. Organization and Location.
          7.4.4.2.1. Use the unit designation and location where the examinee is assigned or
          attached.
          7.4.4.2.2. When attending an IFTU course in which an evaluation is administered,
          the organization and location will reflect the IFTU organization/location.
AFI14-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                          25

         expires Sep 07, enter MSN: Apr-Sep 07). For personnel with specialized training
         evaluation requirements list all eligibility periods as applicable (e.g., if the MSN
         evaluation expires Sep 07 and the EIT evaluation expires Dec 07, enter MSN: Apr-
         Sep 04/EIT: Jul-Dec 07).
         7.4.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for initial periodic evaluations, periodic
         evaluations accomplished outside the examinee’s normal eligibility period and SPOT

                RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A3.1. General. The Intelligence Stan/Eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient
processing of recommended changes to Air Force publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below. Submit recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on
operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or
processes. Do not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality
errors unless they cause misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct
communication with the AF publication OPR.
A3.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A3.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A6.1.. ANG units will utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight
   responsibility. Units will submit AF Form 847s electronically to the maximum extent
   possible.
   A3.2.2. At each level the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will document receipt of original
   AF Forms 847, ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level
   for review, forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while
   informing the preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with
   comments. The advent of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels
   below (including the originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level
   and the originator advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A3.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A3.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A3.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. MAJCOMs may address how to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a
   command level below the AF publication OPR in their supplement to this instruction.
   A3.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   Intelligence Stan/Eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847.
   There is no requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form
   847.
