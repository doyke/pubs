                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating C-9, C-20, C-37, C-32,
   C-40 and VC-25 aircraft. It is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy,
   restates information found in Flight Crew Manuals (FCM), flight information publications
   (FLIP), and other Air Force directives. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another
   basic/source document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the
   source document, waiver authority is In Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4 of this AFI.
   For matters where this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority
   outlined in the basic/source document. Note: FCM is a generic term and will be used to
   refer to applicable aircraft specific Technical Orders (TO) and manufacturer provided
   publications.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting C-9, C-20, C-37,
   C-32, C-40 and VC-25 operations shall ensure this AFI is available to appropriate personnel.
   Transportation and base operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current
   copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to individuals, aircrews, units and agencies operating C-9,
C-20, C-37, C-32, C-40 and VC-25 aircraft performing Special Airlift Missions (SAM),
Command Support Missions (CSM), Distinguished Visitor Guard (DVG) Missions,
Distinguished Visitor (DV) Missions including Presidential Airlift Missions tasked through the
White House Military Office (WHMO), and DV Missions tasked through the Office of Assistant
Vice Chief of Staff (HQ USAF/CVAM), Theater Air Mobility Divisions (AMD) and the Joint
Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC). These operational missions will be referred to
collectively as VIP Missions in this Instruction. Additionally, this AFI applies to training, i.e.
non-operational missions.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested
with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action taken.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                13


   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to their Chief, MAJCOM Stan/Eval who in turn shall notify
   Chief, AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) as appropriate for follow-on action.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed or provided for in this Instruction, waiver
   authority for the contents of this Instruction shall be the MAJCOM/A3 with mission
   execution authority and the Presidential Airlift Group Commander (PAG/CC) shall be the
   waiver authority for Presidential Airlift Missions. Waiver authority for contingency missions
   will be listed in the Operations Order (OPORD)/Air Tasking Order (ATO). Long term
   waivers coordinated by the lead command (AMC) will be maintained on the AMC/A3V
   website. EXCEPTION: AMC/CC hereby grants waiver authority for operational missions
   to the Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) Commander with mission execution
   authority for AMC-assigned forces. In the temporary absence or unavailability of the C-NAF
   Commander, waiver authority for operational missions may be delegated to the C-NAF vice-
   commander; however, no further delegation or re-delegation is permitted. For AMC, in the
   event the 18 AF/CC (AMC's C-NAF) is absent or unavailable, waiver authority for
   operational missions may be delegated to 18AF/CV; however, no further delegation or re-
   delegation is permitted. HQ AMC/A3 retains waiver authority for training missions for
   AMC-assigned forces.
      1.4.2.1. Due to the unique nature of VIP Missions, waiver authority for specific areas of
      this Instruction is delegated to the unit wing, group (or equivalent), or squadron
      commander. If a waiver is approved, the waiver authority will inform the next higher
      level in the chain of command and the MAJCOM Stan/Eval with mission execution
      authority in a timely manner.
      1.4.2.2. Areas in which waiver authority is delegated at or below wing level are
      specifically annotated in this Instruction.
      1.4.2.3. Nothing in this Instruction shall be interpreted to prohibit a commander from
      withholding waiver authority, to include waiver authority delegated by this Instruction.
   1.4.3. Waiver reporting. Waiver requests for missions in execution will be coordinated with
   the MAJCOM/A3 having mission execution authority. PICs must report all waiver requests
   to unit operations group stan/eval (OG/OGV or equivalent) through applicable C2 centers.
   Informational copies of waiver requests and approvals will be sent to the AFRC Command
   Center (AFRC/A3OC) or the Air National Guard Command Center (NGB/A3XC) for aircraft
   operated by each respective Air Reserve Component.
1.5. Supplemental Procedures. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or
operational theater may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures, and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Stipulate unique MAJCOM
procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic document) and publish MAJCOM/A3-
approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement.
   1.5.1. Combined Command Operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces
   from multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this AFI. Do not assume or expect aircrews to
   perform MAJCOM/Theater unique procedures without owning MAJCOM/A3 approval and
   advance training. For additional guidance, refer to paragraph 3.15 of this AFI.

                                          Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. AMC, USAFE, PACAF, AFRC and the ANG command VIP airlift forces
through their respective C2 staffs, Theater AMDs, AFRC/A3OC, NGB/A3XE and unit C2 staffs.
A unit C2 staff [Wing Command Post (CP), Current Operations or Squadron Operations Centers
(SOCs)] serves as the 24-hour liaison between PICs and the mission tasking authority.
2.2. Mission Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over
Mobility Air Force (MAF) resources hold mission execution authority for directed missions.
Commanders with mission execution authority formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve
missions through a local command post or C2 staff. OG/CCs serve as mission execution
authority for local training missions and may approve transition training on positioning/de-
positioning legs in coordination with the appropriate office (CVAM, AMD, MAJCOM/A3,
NGB/A3, WHMO, etc).           The PIC will execute missions operating outside normal
communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. AMC. All active duty operational units, including the Presidential Airlift Group
   (PAG) (part of the 89th Airlift Wing (89 AW)), are aligned under 18 AF. CVAM is
   responsible for tasking and scheduling CONUS-based VIP Aircraft other than Presidential
   Aircraft. All requirements involving movement of VIP Aircraft are coordinated with HQ
   USAF/CVAM, through unit C2 staff. Unit C2 staff serve as the single point-of-contact
   (POC) within the wing for mission assignments from HQ USAF/CVAM. Unit Current
   Operations or SOC provide support to the wing commander to ensure missions are planned
   and executed as scheduled. During the mission planning phase, unit C2 staff serve as liaison
   between the PIC and CVAM. During the execution phase, mission changes are passed from
   the on-board contact to the PIC, who will assess impact to the crew (crew rest, crew duty
   day, weather, airfield suitability, etc.). PIC will forward the request to unit C2, then to
   CVAM for approval. PIC must ensure the on-board contact is aware that final approval is
   from CVAM.
   2.2.2. USAFE/PACAF.        Tasking and execution approval will be IAW command/local
   supplements.
   2.2.3. ANG/AFRC. Mission validation from HQ USAF/CVAM will be received through
   NGB/A3XC and AFRC/A3OO for all ANG and AFRC aircraft covered by this instruction.
   2.2.4. PAG/Presidential Support. WHMO is responsible for tasking Presidential Aircraft.
   PAG/CC serves as mission execution authority for all missions conducted on Presidential
   Aircraft. Non-operational PAG flights that are ―atypical‖ in any respect, including those that
   have any unique aspects or that may attract public or media interest, concern, or criticism,
   must be reported at least ten days in advance, if feasible, through the AMC chain of
   command and approved by AMC/CC or AMC/CV following coordination with AMC/A3,
   PA and JA. Details concerning routine non-operational PAG flights (flights that are not
   ―atypical‖ in any respect) will be reported to 89 AW/CC prior to the mission.
   2.2.5. Off-Station Trainer (OST). The wing commander (WG/CC) is mission approval
   authority for unit OSTs (may be delegated to the OG/CC or equivalent). PAG/CC is
   approval authority for OSTs conducted on Presidential aircraft. Commanders will carefully
 16                                                        AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   review proposed OST itineraries to weigh costs/benefits and minimize impact and maximize
   benefit to the unit‘s aircrew training program. Additionally, the OG/CC can authorize space
   available seating commensurate with training/mission requirements on non-Presidential
   Aircraft.     Forward approved OST itineraries to the appropriate office (AMD,
   MAJCOM/A3T, NGB/A3XE, AF/CVAM, or WHMO) before mission departure. PAG/CC
   will forward itineraries to both the 89AW/CC and DepDirWHMO. EXCEPTION:
   Approval authority for AFRC OSTs to other than approved local training bases is
   AFRC/A3O.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on
a flight authorization form IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements.
This includes AC upgrade candidates on an Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). An
unqualified or non-mission ready (NMR) pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall limit
   mission events to those authorized in the mission tasking without first receiving approval of
   the unit OG/CC and mission execution authority.
   2.3.3. Final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to a higher authority.
   2.3.4. Final authority for requesting or accepting crew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports daily to C2 agents. PICs will inform
   C2 agents of factors that may impact mission accomplishment. When transiting a stop
   without a C2 agent, the PIC shall enter mission information into the C2 system by the most
   expeditious means available. PICs will establish a POC with the appropriate C2 agent prior
   to entering crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support
   requirements on the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members, mission support personnel, and
   passengers.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)
   and passengers.
   2.3.8. Responsible for the safe, comfortable, and reliable accomplishment of the mission. It
   is imperative that the aircrew notify the PIC of all issues that may affect the mission.
   Aircrews are empowered to make decisions for safety at any time, then notify the PIC of
   actions taken.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The PIC has final responsibility for safe conduct of the
mission and possesses full authority for all mission operational decisions. Conduct all flights
with the priorities of SAFETY first, passenger COMFORT second, and schedule
RELIABILITY third.
   2.4.1. Mission Confirmation. Prior to the first leg of each mission, the PIC will review the
   mission itinerary, landing locations, and other applicable mission requirements with the on-
   board contact. Any itinerary discrepancies must be resolved before departure with the C2
   agency and mission execution authority through the appropriate C2 channels.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 17


   2.4.2. Reroutes and Diverts. PICs may reroute or divert their missions if required due to
   emergency situations, adverse weather or other unforeseen circumstances. Attempt to
   coordinate mission diversions in advance with the C2 agency, tasking agency, and dispatch
   function (if applicable). Before directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 agency
   should ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecast weather, Notice to Airmen
   (NOTAM), Airfield Suitability and Restriction Report (ASRR) information and airfield
   security/Phoenix Raven requirements. If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agency for other suitable alternates. The C2
   agency will coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival. The
   PIC is the final authority on the suitability of an alternate airfield.
   2.4.3. Mission Changes. Reroutes or other itinerary changes requested by the DV while en
   route must be approved by the C2 agency and the mission tasking authority. If the itinerary
   changes by 1 hour or more, an itinerary change message must be coordinated by the
   aircrew/C2 to all affected agencies. Itinerary changes of less than 1 hour that affect
   diplomatic clearance windows must also be coordinated with affected agencies.
   2.4.4. Divert Coordination. In the event of an airborne diversion, the PIC will coordinate all
   required clearances, aircraft servicing requirements and aircraft security arrangements.
   Contract Dispatch/Flight Management, Unit CP, SOC, AMD will assist the PIC when
   requested. The PIC will also provide DV and party with all necessary assistance, including
   obtaining transportation and lodging.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. The PIC or Communications Systems Operator (CSO) will
report standard Command MAF movement information (departure, arrival, or diversion) to
appropriate C2 agencies. Onboard communication/data equipment and Communications
Security (COMSEC)/OPORD requirements may dictate messaging methods. The PIC will
establish a POC with the local C2 agency, U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or Fixed Base
Operator (FBO) before entering crew rest.
   2.5.1. Unusual Circumstances. PICs will immediately notify the C2 agency and tasking
   agency of any unusual occurrences. This includes maintenance problems, aircraft
   malfunctions, security and operational concerns. PICs should not wait until arrival to send
   message if in flight communications are available. However, non-secure communications
   media should not be used to transmit sensitive information.
   2.5.2. Crew Location. Notify the C2 agency of aircrew location and telephone number
   during each crew rest and any time the crew will leave the immediate vicinity of the aircraft.
   2.5.3. Commercial Dispatch Services (CDS)/Integrated Flight Management (IFM)
   Controlled Missions. The Dispatcher/Flight Managers (FM) are a C2 conduit authorized for
   VIP missions. Contract Dispatchers/Flight Managers provide the PIC with flight plans, flight
   following, flight support and act as a C2 link to the C2 agency and Air Traffic Control
   (ATC). Communication is accomplished via digital data-link, radio, and landline
   connectivity between MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority and the aircraft. For
   critical C2 communications, voice communications via Satellite Communications
   (SATCOM), Defense Switched Network (DSN), High Frequency (HF) communications, etc.
   are the primary method. The C2 agency will determine COMSEC requirements for CLOSE
   HOLD missions.
 18                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   2.5.4. HF Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the military worldwide C2
   network. During transoceanic flights, pilots will set one HF radio to the ATC frequency and
   use Selective Calling (SELCAL) if available. The second HF radio should be operated in
   Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) mode, if available, to support voice contacts between
   the PIC and MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority. Frequencies for GLOBAL HF
   stations are listed in the Flight Information Handbook (FIH). NOTE: Run the ALE system
   in the silent mode during flights where pilots use the HF radio system for communication
   with ATC.
   2.5.5. L-Band SATCOM. L-Band SATCOM provides a worldwide communications
   capability (secondary to HF). PICs may use L-band SATCOM for routine unclassified
   communication. Due to large volume of traffic, MAJCOM C2 with mission execution
   authority will only forward L-Band messages when the PIC specifically requests this service.
   In this case, the L-Band message to MAJCOM C2 must include, ―Relay, no C2 agent (or
   negative HF contact) at (include station name)‖ in the message remarks. Limit SATCOM
   communications to operational traffic. Turn the transceiver and laptop on during preflight
   and leave it configured to transmit and receive messages until aircraft power down at
   destination.
       2.5.5.1. L-Band SATCOM Messages and Advisories. The PIC, or designee, will
       transmit an on-station message at the beginning of each crew duty day. The PIC will
       transmit an arrival advisory to the arrival C2 agency. The PIC will transmit (free-text
       messages) mission delay, in-flight refuel, and on/off-load reports. NOTE: For missions
       operating through sensitive or classified locations disable the Global Positioning System
       (GPS) position-reporting feature of the system.
       2.5.5.2. Computer management. OG/CC shall develop procedures for management of
       flight crew mission computers at home station. Aircrews will not leave laptop computers
       in an unsecured location.
   2.5.6. AERO-H/I. The AERO-H/I satellite voice system should be used as an alternate
   means of communication for aircraft with ALE/L-Band SATCOM messaging capability
   between the aircraft, C2 agencies, and certain ATC units. AERO-H/I voice is a backup for
   the controller to pilot datalink system (CPDLC) and C2 communications (datalink and
   VHF/HF voice). Certain C2 agencies and ATC units may be selected in the AERO-H/I
   directory.
       2.5.6.1. AERO-H/I voice may not be used for routine communications with ATC or for
       personal use. Also, due to its high cost, other communications options should be
       considered before using the satellite voice. It should be used for ATC communication
       only as a backup to CPDLC or as otherwise instructed. AERO-H/I voice may be required
       as a backup to CPDLC on certain routes.
   2.5.7. DV Messages. On aircraft without CSOs, airborne unclassified messages originated
   by DV passengers may be transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
2.6. Mission Commander Responsibilities. For complex missions and multi-sortie events,
OG/CC‘s (or equivalent) may direct designation of a mission commander to act as overall
authority for mission execution. When so designated, the mission commander exercises
command authority over all mission personnel. Mission commanders will inform the appropriate
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                19


mission execution authority through the appropriate C2 staffs of any factors that may affect
mission accomplishment.
   2.6.1. Mission Planning. Unit C2 staff serve as the single POC within the wing for mission
   assignments from tasking agency. Unit Mission Operations, Current Operations and unit
   SOC ensure missions are planned and coordinated with the tasking, dispatch and flight
   management agencies, as applicable. During the mission planning phase, these agencies are
   the link between the PIC, C2 agency and MAJCOM with mission execution authority.
       2.6.1.1. For all multi-ship operations, (e.g., funeral runs and summits), OG/CC will
       ensure, through the unit C2, that an appropriate level of ground/flight supervision is
       provided for the entire mission. Emphasis should be placed on who is the overall mission
       commander for the operation.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Units should publish a listing of telephone numbers to
assist crews in coordinating mission requirements through appropriate C2 agencies.
2.9. Close Watch Missions. All VIP Missions are Close Watch missions and receive special
C2 attention. PICs will promptly notify the appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other
events that affect on-time departure and provide the local C2 (CP, flight management, dispatch,
etc.) the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned Estimated Time of Departure (ETD), and
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) as soon as safety allows. Local C2 agent will notify the C2
agency and mission executionauthority when delays are anticipated or occur.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the DoD to cooperate with civilian law
enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian
Law Enforcement Agencies, incorporates the appropriate directive and provides uniform policies
and procedures to be followed concerning support provided to federal, state, and local civilian
law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air
Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement organizations.
Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement
authorities through C2 channels.
2.11. Area of Responsibility (AOR) Missions.

 NOTES:
 (1) Not required for local training missions. CSO(s) and FA(s) not required on OSTs and
 depot inputs/outputs. OG/CC may waive FCC(s) for stopover flights if equivalent
 maintenance support exists at stopover locations. FA(s) will be on board when passengers are
 carried. EXCEPTION: With SQ/CC approval, FCCs/MEPs (to include civilian maintenance
 personnel) familiar with egress procedures may be carried without FA(s) on board.
 (2) Minimum 1 MK and 1 FK or 1 IK and 2 UKs. Unit commanders will weigh the students‘
 prior experience and proficiency when scheduling 1 IK with 2 UKs. OG/CC may waive CSO
 requirements to 1 MK.
 (3) No CSOs are required for the C-40C.(4) Normal basic crew is 5 (minimum of 3 MTs and
 2 FTs). One FA may be unqualified as long as an instructor FA is providing training.
 OG/CC may waive FA requirements to 3 (minimum of 1 MT and 2 FTs) for a basic crew if
 there are no meal requirements.
 (5) Normal basic crew is 3 (minimum of 1 MT and 2 FTs). One FA may be unqualified as
 long as an instructor FA is providing training. OG/CC may waive FA requirements to 2
 (minimum of 1 MT and 1 FT) for a basic crew if there are no meal requirements.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 21

(7) SQ/CC may increase the number of FAs depending on mission requirements.
(8) One must be first flight engineer qualified or higher.
(9) Both must be first flight engineer qualified or higher.
(10) For locals, SQ/DO may authorize a fully qualified pilot to occupy the flight engineer
station during any phase of operation. In this case, a qualified FE (FF minimum) will perform
preflight duties and need not fly on the local.
(11) CSOs are on an as-needed basis for 932 AW C-9 missions as determined by 932 AW
and CVAM.
(12) For C-32 and C-40B/C, the minimum required is 1 Lead FCC and 1 Assistant FCC.
EXCEPTION: The PAG/CC will determine crew complement on Presidential Airlift
Missions.


  3.2.1. Augmented crews are required when a mission cannot be completed within a basic
  FDP. Augmentees must be current and qualified in the aircraft. EXCEPTION:
  Crewmembers in mission qualification training under the supervision of an instructor may
  count for augmentation purposes. For pilots, this is limited to FP Phase II training, provided
  the FP is current and qualified. In all other cases, NMR pilots requiring instructor
  supervision may augment provided that of the other two pilots, one is a fully qualified,
  Mission Ready (MR) IP and the other is a fully qualified, MR MP. For an unqualified CSO
  or FA to act as an augmenting crewmember, OG/CC or equivalent waiver is required. In all
  cases, the crew must be augmented from the start of the duty period. Reference paragraph
  1.4.2 for the waiver authority for additional crewmembers to join the mission en route for
  augmentation. If augmentees are added to the crew, the crew‘s FDP will be computed based
  on the FDP of the most limited person. NOTE: C-9, C-20 and C-37 aircraft are not
  authorized an augmented FDP.
  3.2.2. For all passenger missions, do not schedule crew complements that exceed the
  maximum seating capacity specified for a particular aircraft configuration. If not specified,
  do not schedule crewmembers that will displace scheduled passengers. Exceptions to this
  policy are granted by unit C2 in coordination with mission tasking authority concurrence.
  (Note: C-20/C-37 passenger loads are limited to 12 passengers unless otherwise approved by
  mission tasking authority). ANG and AFRC – coordinate passenger manifests with
  NGB/A3XC, AFRC/A3OO, CVAM or JOSAC, as appropriate. USAFE/PACAF –
  coordinate passenger manifests with AMD.
      3.2.2.1. FA/CSO Crew Complements on Organic AMC DV (KC-10/C-17/KC-135)
      missions. For planning, the normal FA/CSO crew complement for basic FDP organic
      AMC missions will include 3 FAs and, if required, 2 CSOs. The crew complement for
      augmented FDP organic AMC missions will consist of 3 FAs and, if required, 2 CSOs.
      At least one FA will be MT qualified on an aircraft and, if required, at least one CSO will
      be MK qualified. All others will be at least FT or FK qualified. OG/CC, through unit
      C2, will determine the actual FA/CSO crew complement (increased or decreased) based
      upon passenger loads, configuration, and mission requirements. OG/CC will maintain
 22                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       waiver authority over CSO/FA crew complements on all organic AMC missions.
       FAs/CSOs will follow Crew Duty time (CDT)/FDP and scheduling restrictions IAW this
       instruction.
   3.2.3. The PAG/CC will determine crew complement on Presidential Airlift Missions.
3.3. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crewmembers or those occupying a primary position
during flight, must be qualified (current and valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Evaluation)
or in training for qualification in that crew position. EXCEPTION: The Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the
Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, Combatant Commanders, and MAJCOM Commanders,
Wing/CC/CV and OG/CC are the only senior officers (O-6 and above) authorized to perform
pilot duties on VIP Aircraft. They must be rated Air Force pilots and comply with AFI 11-401.
   3.3.1. Unit senior officers completing Senior Officer Qualification course (restricted AF
   Form 8) or orientation training for a Senior Officer Familiarization flight may occupy a
   primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI 11-401 for
   procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying.
   3.3.2. Crew members who complete the Senior Officer Qualification Course will log
   ―FP/FN‖ for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/ Mission
   Flight Data Document.
   3.3.3. Crew members who complete a Senior Officer Familiarization flight will log
   ―OP/ON‖ for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/ Mission
   Flight Data Document.
3.4. Pilots. An IP must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during takeoffs, landings and emergency procedures).
   3.4.1. Missions with Passengers. To occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers, pilots must have
   a current AF Form 8 for the Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific aircraft. For takeoff,
   approach and landing one of the following conditions must be met:
       3.4.1.1. Two qualified and current pilots (1 AC or higher, 1 FP or higher) must be at the
       controls.
       3.4.1.2. A qualified pilot non-current no more than 60 days for flying currency
       requirements and an IP providing direct supervision (must be at the controls). AC‘s
       regaining currency will be designated PIC.
       3.4.1.3. A qualified NMR pilot accomplishing phase II qualification training and an IP
       providing direct supervision.
       3.4.1.4. A qualified AC upgrade candidate on an initial or requalification OME and a
       qualified pilot (FP or higher) under supervision of a qualified EP must be at the controls
       (AC upgrade candidates will be designated in command).
       3.4.1.5. A basic qualified (valid AF Form 8 in MDS-specific aircraft) senior officer who
       has completed a Senior Officer Qualification course may occupy either pilot seat under
       direct IP supervision.
   3.4.2. Qualification Training. Initial qualification, requalification, or upgrade training (AC
   upgrade training allowed) for pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  23


   onboard. Mission qualification training, OMEs, and line training/development missions may
   be conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if the individual in training is
   qualified to the applicable level.
   3.4.3. Local Training and Evaluation Missions. Non-current or unqualified pilots may
   perform crew duties under the supervision of a qualified instructor or examiner. If
   passengers are carried, paragraph 3.4.1. of this AFI applies.
   3.4.4. When unit authorized maintenance specialists and/or civilian contractors are flying in
   the aircraft for the purpose of conducting in-flight maintenance inspections, including touch-
   and-go landings, the restrictions in paragraph 3.4.1 of this AFI (concerning pilots with
   passengers) are waived for these specialists/contractors only.                 However, the
   maintenance/contractor personnel should be deplaned after completion of the in-flight
   inspection.
3.5. Navigators. PAG/CC determines navigator crew complement.
3.6. Flight Engineers, Communications System Operators, Flight Attendants. Any non-
current or unqualified crewmembers may be assigned in addition to the minimum complement of
qualified and current primary crewmembers. They may perform duties in their designated crew
position only under the supervision of a current instructor/examiner qualified in the respective
crew position (direct supervision for passenger/DV service, emergency procedures). Non-
current or unqualified crewmembers may fill a primary crew position under the supervision of a
flight examiner (direct supervision for passenger/DV service, emergency procedures) during
flight evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
The PIC may direct the instructor or examiner to assume the primary crew position during
critical phases of flight or adverse conditions.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP
   when the autopilot pitch servo fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot
   fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to
   preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include
   diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and
   comply with limitations. NOTE: Failure of the autopilot pitch servo does not require a FDP
   reduction on the leg the failure is experienced.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative). All tactical maneuvers will be
       accomplished within the first 14 hours of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP,
       the OG/CC may extend to an augmented FDP provided the composition is adequate for
       an augmented crew.
           3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
           weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
           augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
           long as:
24                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


            3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
            the first takeoff of the day.
            3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
            rest en route.
        3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek OG/CC approval to extend the FDP as
        much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled mission. If mission requirements justify the
        risk and the PIC is unable to contact the waiver authority, the PIC may extend
        maximum FDP up to 2 hours. Only use this provision to recover from
        unscheduled/unplanned en route delays/changes. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to
        exercise this option. A PIC with a basic crew may seek OG/CC approval to extend
        the tactical duty day by as much as 2 hours to a maximum of 16 hours.
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative). All tactical maneuvers will be
     accomplished within the first 18 hours of the FDP. FDP will not be based on crew
     complement, but rather on mission requirements. Only the pilot portion of the crew is
     affected by the FDP reduction when the autopilot is inoperative.
        3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CCs augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the mission
        profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en route.
        3.7.1.2.2. A PIC with an augmented crew may seek OG/CC approval to extend the
        FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled mission. If mission requirements
        justify the risk and the PIC is unable to contact the waiver authority, the PIC may
        extend maximum FDP up to 2 hours. Only use this provision to recover from
        unscheduled/unplanned en route delays/changes. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to
        exercise this option.
     3.7.1.3. Not Used.
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training FDP.
        3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, Functional Check Flight (FCF) and
        Acceptance Check Flight (ACFs) missions is 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot is
        inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
        3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
        events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local
            training missions provided their time from start duty does not exceed 16 hours
            and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
        3.7.1.5.3. Crews may position/de-position to home station or a deployed staging base
        following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative).
     3.7.1.6. Technician Status. CDT and FDP include both military and civilian work and
     begin when an individual reports for their first duty period (military or civilian). (This
     does not preclude a civilian from starting a pay period prior to the report for their first
     duty period, only from showing to perform office duties prior to CDT and FDP.)
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               25


   3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
   combined ground/flight duties. For planning purposes, 45 minutes will be used as the time to
   complete post-FDP duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission
   duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for
   other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. Maximum
   CDT is 16+45 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented aircrew. If the
   option in para 3.7.1.1.2. is exercised, increase the maximum basic CDT by up to 2 hours.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority may authorize a C2
   agent to alert an aircrew member early. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member
   reports for those duties.
      3.7.3.1. For Self-alerts, CDT/FDP begins at established showtime. The PIC shall
      coordinate early individual/crew mission report times with C2 agents. If an early report
      time is utilized, begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning
   or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crewmembers
   may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve
   crewmembers to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      flying in deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for deadhead flight).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a
      maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
      3.7.4.3. Crewmembers must have standard pre-departure crew rest prior to deadheading
      IAW paragraph 3.10.1 and/or 3.10.2.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties. Maximum crew duty time is 12
   hours.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions (See AFI 11-202V3). IAW AFI 11-202V3, SQ/CCs shall not
schedule an aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert [LFA] time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or
   while impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
26                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


  3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval from the flight surgeon (on a
  voluntary basis following ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest
  periods. This section provides guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications)
  that help aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew
  rest periods. Fliers on augmented aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
  3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
  fatigue management tool.
  3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
  with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CCs (may delegate in writing, the
  responsibility to, but no lower than, the squadron commander), and with each individual
  aircrew member. During extended deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go
  pills from a deployed USAF flight surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with
  the home unit medical team prior to dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
  3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
  medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
  for mission planner, OG/CC, crew, and FS use on the AMC/A3V website.
  3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS, who has received training on the AMC/SG-approved
  (lead command) counter-fatigue program, is the POC for no-go prescriptions. Upon request,
  the FS will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest
  caused by duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures in DoD 5210.42/AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel
  Reliability Program (PRP), if prescribed no-go Pills.
  3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
  the following categories (characterized by the potential for sleep disruptions and therefore
  candidates for no-go medications):
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and
     darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater than 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming no-go pills [consider Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF)]. EXCEPTION:
  SQ/CCs may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm
  prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect [6 hours for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours
  for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline
  where they would be under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties
  (use mission report or LFA time to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
  3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   27


       3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
       surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
       3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12-hours after consuming
       a no-go pill. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult
       with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have a short duration effect. In no
       case will crew members consume no-go pills on a timeline where they would be under
       the effect of the medication while they operate equipment.
       3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12-hours of consuming
       alcohol.
       3.9.9.4. Aircrew members will inform the FS of any other medications (including
       nutritional supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can
       evaluate potential interactions.
       3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril and Ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and
       no more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
       3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28
       days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority
to waive any portion of the crew rest period or ground time as needed to meet mission tasking
IAW AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplements. NOTE: The Presidential PIC is the waiver
authority for Presidential Airlift Missions.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. As a minimum, crewmembers will enter
   crew rest 12 hours prior to alert time or, when self-alerting, 12 hours prior to reporting time.
   For missions that will keep aircrew members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders
   will enter primary and deadhead aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours
   before the LFA time. Aircrew members deadheading to join a mission via commercial travel
   are entitled to 24 hours of pre-departure crew rest prior to reporting at the commercial
   airport. Aircrew members (including those that will be travelling via commercial means
   prior to joining a mission) may perform limited non-flying duties during the first 12 hours of
   pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-
   departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-
   departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC, and ANG aircrews will comply with the
   provisions in AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement regarding home station pre-
   departure crew rest.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12-
   hour non-duty period before the FDP begins. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12
   hours before scheduled report time (for exceptions, reference para 3.10.3. of this AFI). This
   provides aircrews at least 8 hours to sleep plus 4 hours to travel, relax, and dine.
       3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3 with mission
       execution authority, C2 agents shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When
       necessary to interrupt aircrew members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a
       subsequent minimum 12 hour crew rest period after they complete official duties.
28                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, aircraft
     preparation, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. A minimum 15 hour ground time between block-
  in to block-out should normally be planned. OG/CC is waiver authority for missions in
  planning phase to no less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out. For missions in
  execution, the PIC may waive to no less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out to
  accommodate special CVAM/AMD/DV requests. Do not plan consecutive 12 hour-to-12
  hour crew rests.
     3.10.3.1. Before reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time and
     other factors peculiar to the mission. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority
     to reduce crew rest to less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out. It is not to be used
     for DV scheduling convenience.
     3.10.3.2. Ground time reduction will ensure aircrew is afforded 8 hours of uninterrupted
     sleep and adequate time for transportation and meals.
     3.10.3.3. PIC will notify the tasking agency and C2 of all modifications to ground time.
     NOTE: The Presidential PIC is the waiver authority for Presidential Airlift Missions.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides aircrews a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. For AFRC and ANG units,
  application of PMCR will be determined by the OG/CC.
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and parent MAJCOM/A3 may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. FCC/RAVEN Work and Rest Plan. For off-station missions, FCCs and RAVENs are
  responsible to the PIC only. Aircrew crew rest rules do not apply. The PIC will determine
  how long FCCs and RAVENs can safely perform duties. FCCs and RAVENs must have the
  opportunity to rest 8 hours in each 24-hour period. For FCC work-rest plan guidance, see
  AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and associated MAJCOM
  supplements.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   29


       3.10.6.1. Unless specified in AFI 21-101 or applicable MAJCOM supplements, FCCs
       will only perform in flight duties/maintenance when in the opinion of the PIC an
       emergency condition exists requiring FCC‘s assistance.
       3.10.6.2. Upon arrival at en route locations the PIC will determine how long the FCC can
       safely perform aircraft maintenance duties on assigned aircraft.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish parent MAJCOM/A3-approved crew rest
   waivers in the Exercise or Contingency OPORD, Operations Plan (OPLAN), or Concept of
   Operations (CONOPS).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. C2 agents for MAJCOM with mission execution
       authority will forward information on the departing aircrew‘s orders to a POC for the
       next crew rest location‘s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure Temporary Duty
       (TDY)/Flight orders clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime
       Knight reservations in advance.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. Self-alerting procedures are normally used for all VIP Missions.
The PIC sets the crew reporting time and location. Home-station departure show time will
normally be 2+00 prior to scheduled takeoff time. PICs may change the home station reporting
time as necessary if approved by unit Current Operations or SOC. Normally, off-station crew
reporting time is 2 hours prior to scheduled departure time. The PIC may establish reporting
times as required for mission accomplishment (e.g. scheduled mission departure time changes,
increased travel time from hotel to plane, customs, etc).
   3.11.1. The latest allowable alert time for an aircrew given a legal for alert time (e.g. as a
   maintenance back-up) is 6 hours after the expected alert time. The PIC may extend that
   window to 8 hours when flying as the primary crew or 12 hours when dead-heading. The
   controlling C2 agency will not ask the PIC to accept more than the 6 hour window.
3.12. Stage Management. VIP missions may require stage crews. When a stage crew is
needed due to flight duty period limitations, maintenance difficulties, etc., ensure unit validates
the requirement and assists in determining transportation requirements, in place times, mission
specific details, etc.
3.13. Standby/Alert Force Duty. C2 agents for MAJCOM with mission execution authority
shall task units for Standby Force Duty not later than 18 hours prior to LFA time. This allows
crew members 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When
aircrews are unable to complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an
additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours
prior notification, the SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow
 30                                                        AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5 of this AFI to prepare the aircraft for launch.
The SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. After 48 hours, C2
must launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. Reference
paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority to extend this period for contingencies. Standby/Alert
Force Duty shall not be used as a tool to eliminate pre-departure crew rest.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as
   an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. Once SQ/CC forms an ALFA
   Standby Force, that aircrew will accomplish follow-on pre-flights required by the FCM.
   Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin
   CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing
   pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours (normally 1 hour to show
   and 2 hours to perform preflight duties). Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew
   rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   LFA 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE status up to
   72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them into 12
   hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby Force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby/Alert Duty. OG/CC‘s and unit C2 with mission execution authority
   determine Standby/alert crew status and initiate scheduling procedures if needed.
       3.13.4.1. VIP Standby/alert crews should perform standby/alert duty at home. At their
       discretion, standby/alert crewmembers are permitted to perform up to 4 hours of on-base
       duties each 24-hour standby/alert period; they are not limited to staying at home for their
       entire duty period. Although not limited to staying at home, standby/alert aircrew must
       be capable of proceeding directly to the unit immediately upon notification (response
       times will be published in unit supplements/OIs). Alert crewmembers quartered off base
       may be required to perform alert duty on base if travel time between quarters and the alert
       aircraft jeopardizes alert reaction time. Assigning quarters on base must be coordinated
       through the squadron operations officer.
       3.13.4.2. The primary method of contact will always be the telephone. Ensure alerting
       organization has an operable and reachable contact phone number. Pagers/beepers will
       only be used as a backup method of contact.
       3.13.4.3. Commanders will not require crewmembers to perform any duties other than
       standby/alert duty during standby/alert.
       3.13.4.4. Crew Rest. Crewmembers are given 12 hours of pre-standby/alert crew rest
       prior to assuming Alpha or Bravo alert. Crews are legal for mission reporting after pre-
       standby/alert crew rest. Preflight duties, if required, interrupt crew rest. In no case will a
       crewmember be placed on Alpha or Bravo standby/alert duty within 12 hours of the
       previous flight duty period.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 31


       3.13.4.5. Schedule standby/alert crews to have the most flexible crew complement for
       the maximum applicable CDT/FDP. For example: the C-32/C-40 aircraft should
       schedule an augmented crew for standby/alert. Notify unit C2 and the tasking authority if
       any part of a crew complement cannot be manned at the applicable manning level.
       3.13.4.6. Response Time. Tasking authority (through unit C2), will determine the
       aircraft alert requirements unless previously specified. Normal alert response time for
       VIP Aircraft is 2 hours. C-32A and C-40B/C response time is 3 hours. Tasked units will
       ensure an alert crew is available for that MDS and a backup aircraft if required.
       3.13.4.7. Standby/alert crewmembers will not fly local missions while on alert. OG/CC
       or equivalent (with tasking authority/C2 concurrence) may waive this requirement. VIP
       or contingency missions may be flown following the local if crew rest and CDT/FDP
       limitations per this AFI are followed.
       3.13.4.8. Crewmembers will not be scheduled for more than 3 consecutive standby/alert
       duty periods.
       3.13.4.9. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority to waive all or any part of
       alert crew rest period. Post standby/alert crew rest waiver procedures are the same as
       PMCR. On completion of standby/alert duty, aircrew members may be dispatched on a
       mission.
   3.13.5. Pre-Departure Standby/alert duty. Standby/alert duty and pre-departure crew rest
   may be concurrent if notification is provided at least 12 hours prior to mission reporting.
       3.13.5.1. If started, post-standby/alert crew rest must be completed before the start of
       pre-departure crew rest.
       3.13.5.2. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the post-mission
       crew rest time on standby/alert time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post-Standby/Alert Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission
   following Alpha or Bravo standby/alert duty will receive post-mission standby/alert crew rest
   as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby/alert duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby/alert time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby/alert duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation, AFI
11-401, Aviation Management, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit
current and qualified aircrew members from one unit to perform primary aircrew duties on
another unit‘s aircraft. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to wing commanders for active
duty/AFRC interfly with ANG. Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by the
lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS. Conduct interfly operations as
follows:
   3.15.1. OG/CC‘s or equivalent may authorize interfly of aircrews and/or aircraft. Normally
   interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances but may
 32                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   be used to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls, or in Combined Command
   Operations (ref. paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI). Long-term interfly arrangements may be found
   in command-to-command Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) or Letters of Agreement
   (LOAs). Associate Reserve units and active duty HQ Staff/MAJCOM Staff evaluation or
   inspection teams have existing interfly arrangements. Interservice agreements on like aircraft
   must be approved by parent MAJCOM A3s and other service equivalents.
   3.15.2. Interfly is authorized under the following conditions:
       3.15.2.1. Aircraft ownership is not transferred.
       3.15.2.2. Aircrew shall be current and qualified in the MDS (aircraft and model), as well
       as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
       3.15.2.3. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
       command for the MDS. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific
       items. The aircraft owning unit will direct appropriate operations instructions and
       restrictions, as appropriate, for the aircrew members who interfly.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized
MEP status on any mobility aircraft to accomplish training, evaluation, or pre-/de-position in
support of mobility operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or
authorized to accompany the normal crew complement are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Travel in this status while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on VIP Aircraft unless authorized by the tasking authority through the
       PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (mission cut).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by the
       tasking authority through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CC may authorize MEP status for unit assigned mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the PIC will coordinate with home
   station C2 before seating MEPs in the passenger compartment. Seats not previously assigned
   may only be used for MEPs with tasking agency approval.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  33


   3.16.5. The PIC or designated representative will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers.
   3.16.6. Additional procedures and policies regarding MEPs are contained in AFI 11-401 and
   AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized.
3.17. Mobility Mission Observer Program (MMO) Program. MAJCOM supplements or
additional directives may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to
fly for mobility mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft
for launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable). Lack of available spare
parts, skilled technicians, and manpower limitations have a negative and direct impact on
mission accomplishment. However, redundant systems may allow safe operation with less than
all equipment operational for certain missions under specific circumstances. VIP Aircraft MELs
are provided in separate publications The PIC, using the following policies, determines an
aircraft's overall status. Make a detailed explanation of the discrepancy in the AFTO 781A,
Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, include the following maintenance identifiers to
effectively communicate aircraft status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe
   aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated ME by the PIC. A PIC accepting
   an aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not commit that
   PIC (or a different PIC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). An item, system or subsystem component, which is not
   currently essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion, will be designated as
   MC. MC discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity to the extent that
   maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability permit. If circumstances change,
   an MC item may be upgraded to ME status. In the PIC's judgment, if mission safety would
   be compromised by the lack of any component, re-designate the component as ME. Do not
   delay a mission to correct an MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission
   or any subsequent mission are designated as OIs. These items receive low priority and are
   normally worked at home station.
   4.1.4. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications, altitude, speed, and
   heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions. For instruments with both
   analog and digital displays, either the analog or digital presentation is acceptable.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. It would be impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunction and contingent
circumstances. As such, commercial derivatives have extensive MELs that provide guidance to
make safe dispatch decisions with VIP Aircraft. The C-9 MEL will be addressed in the 932 AW
supplement to this AFI.
   4.2.1. Description. The aircraft MEL lists the minimum equipment and systems to launch
   the aircraft under routine operations. The list does not necessarily include all equipment or
   systems essential to airworthiness (e.g. rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires, etc.). The
   MEL shall not conflict with the FCM or USAF/MAJCOM directives. Those items that state
   a minimum requirement and have no listed exceptions are grounding items.
   4.2.2. Waiver Authority. PICs must refer to their aircraft MEL or Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) approved Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for inoperative
   systems before dispatch. Deviations must be approved by the unit OG/CC (or equivalent)
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                35


  prior to departure. Coordinate with unit stan/eval, system program directors, aircraft
  manufacturers and maintenance personnel. Safety-of-flight is paramount. MAJCOM
  Stan/Eval shall be informed of all granted MEL deviations within 24 hours of departure.
  4.2.3. The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure aircraft are not
  dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an
  undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of additional failures during continued
  operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. This chapter is
  not intended to allow for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with
  systems/subsystems inoperative.
     4.2.3.1. System components required to complete emergency procedures and associated
     warning systems will be operational. All emergency equipment will be installed unless
     specifically exempted by mission requirements/directives (e.g., depot inputs with
     minimum survival kits). One time flight authorizations to repair facilities may be
     authorized for primary crewmembers only. For all one time flight authorizations, notify
     MAJCOM Stan/Eval of OG/CC actions.         NOTE: Do not accept an aircraft from
     factories, modification centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and
     operative.
  4.2.4. Off Station Waiver Policy.          PICs will consider route segment (navigation
  requirements, terrain, weather, etc.) when determining required equipment to safely navigate
  and operate the aircraft. If, after exploring all options, the PIC determines a safe launch is
  possible with an MEL item inoperable the PIC shall request an OG/CC waiver. Use C2
  channels to notify the appropriate tasking agency of intentions. Plan a minimum 1-hour
  response from unit stan/eval (OGV or equivalent) to respond to the waiver request.
  4.2.5. Off-Station Maintenance Difficulties. PICs with maintenance difficulties away from
  home station will coordinate all requirements for supply and maintenance assistance with
  local support agencies and unit maintenance support agencies. Do not accept aircraft parts or
  maintenance without thorough coordination with home station C2 and maintenance agencies.
  Keep unit C2 centers informed of current aircraft status through CP channels. If an aircraft
  arrives at any station with a maintenance status that would prevent or delay departure, the
  PIC will take whatever action is necessary to have aircraft restored to MR status as soon as
  possible after landing, regardless of scheduled ground time. Aircraft must be MR as soon as
  possible to support DV schedule changes or diversion to a higher priority mission. The PIC
  will monitor maintenance and report when the aircraft is restored to MR status.
     4.2.5.1. If parts are required, advise unit C2 that supply assistance is required. The PIC
     may be provided a contact that can arrange for parts locally. If parts will be shipped, C2
     (CP, AMD, etc.) will provide the aircrew with shipping details. Normally, parts are
     shipped to the PIC in care of the U.S. Embassy or other mission supply activity. The PIC
     or embassy will make arrangements to have someone pickup the shipment as soon as
     possible after it arrives. When the parts shipment has been received, notify unit C2 to
     preclude unnecessary tracing actions.
     4.2.5.2. If maintenance assistance is required beyond the scope of local capabilities,
     advise unit C2 of anticipated requirements. If necessary, maintenance specialists will be
     dispatched from home unit.
 36                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       4.2.5.3. Parts are furnished by the Contractor Operated Maintenance Base Supply
       (COMBS) facilities. All repairable parts must be returned to the COMBS facilities. The
       PIC will ensure the defective parts are returned to home unit upon the aircraft from which
       they were removed or by the most advantageous means available. The PIC will relay the
       method of shipment and name/phone number of the local contact, if applicable, to unit
       C2. Ensure the flight engineer or crew chief attaches AFTO 350, Repairable Item
       Processing Tag to each defective part upon removal. Coordination for supply support
       will be arranged through the contractors support facilities at other stations. For the C-9C,
       standard USAF supply procedures will be used for the UHF/VHF/HF communications
       radios, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), low pressure oxygen cylinders, life rafts/vests
       and the first aid kits.
   4.2.6. Maintenance Delay. If a maintenance condition exists that will prevent or delay a VIP
   departure, the PIC will advise C2 centers immediately. Depending on DV desires and the
   urgency of their schedule, the PIC, the on-board contact, and unit C2 will coordinate a new
   departure time. PIC, in coordination with unit C2 and/or MAJCOM C2 with mission
   execution authority, shall arrange substitute transportation if available and acceptable to the
   DV.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waiver to operate with degraded equipment exceeding this chapter and
the aircraft MEL/MMEL will be coordinated through unit C2 centers in coordination with unit
stan/eval and waiver approval through unit OG/CC or equivalent. Notify MAJCOM Stan/Eval
with mission execution authority at the earliest opportunity (within 24 hours of departure).
4.4. Technical Assistance Service. The PIC may request (at anytime in the decision process)
technical support from their home unit stan/eval, MAJCOM/A3 staff, and maintenance
representatives to include commercial derivative engineering support.
   4.4.1. PICs electing to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems (with
   appropriate waiver) must coordinate mission requirements (i.e. revised departure times, fuel
   requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with C2 centers prior to flight.
   4.4.2. When it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by this
   AFI and immediate action is required, the PIC may elect to deviate according to paragraph
   1.4 of this AFI. Report deviations (without a pre-approved waiver), through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority within 48 hours. Units must be prepared to
   collect background information and submit a followup written report upon request.
4.5. Not Used.
4.6. One-Time Flights. If an aircraft has a safety-of-flight condition beyond the immediate or
final repair capability of an en route facility, temporary repairs may be made to allow a one-time
flight to a pre-selected facility capable of final repair.
   4.6.1. PIC's Recommendation. PICs will send their recommendations to C2 centers.
   4.6.2. Approval Authority. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority is approval
   authority for one-time, safety-of-flight conditions with passengers on board. EXCEPTION:
   OG/CC is approval authority for one-time, safety-of-flight conditions without passengers on
   board. Notify parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval of actions at the earliest opportunity.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                       37

                                OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. MDS specific checklists are designed as clean up checklists, and items may be
accomplished prior to the checklist being read. A checklist is not complete until all items have
been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and
deviations specified in the FCM, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or
limitations may be added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is the crewmember‘s
responsibility and may be evaluated.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts to
   supplement FCMs. If the FCM is a TO, approval will be IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight
   Manuals Program (FMP). If the FCM is a commercially provided manual, approvals will
   parallel procedures outlined in AFI 11-215. For AMC and AMC gained units, AMC/A3V is
   the checklist insert approval authority. These inserts may be placed in an in-flight guide or at
   the end of the checklist. All proposed checklist inserts must have a POC. If any crew
   member has recommendations or changes they should contact the POC. Submit changes to
   the FCM to MAJCOM Stan/Eval and provide copies to HQ AMC Stan/Eval for final
   approval. Local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting FCM guidance and procedures may
   be locally approved by OG/OGV or equivalent.
   5.1.2. Flight Operations Manuals (FOM) and Quick Reaction Checklists (QRC) are
   authorized. AF Form 847 will be processed through MAJCOM Stan/Eval to HQ AMC
   Stan/Eval (Lead Command) for revision approval.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods (approximately 15 minutes) to meet physiological needs.
Crewmembers will notify the pilot prior to departing assigned primary duty stations.
   5.2.1. With both pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying
   a primary duty station during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and
   alert). Only one pilot, or the flight engineer, may be absent from their duty station at a time,
   except as required when entering or exiting the flight deck.
   5.2.2. When additional aircrew personnel are on board, the observer‘s seat should be
   occupied, preferably by a qualified pilot if available, to assist the crew in avoiding other
   aircraft during ground operations, and critical phases of flight.
   5.2.3. Unqualified pilots in qualification training and qualified senior officers may occupy a
   pilot seat during flight provided another qualified pilot is in the other seat. During critical
   phases of flight, they must be under direct IP supervision (at a set of controls).
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to
meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access
to the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer position regardless of its availability. For the C-20/C-37 at
cruise, the flight engineer/observer seat may be occupied by a passenger on a non-interference
basis with approval by the PIC.
 38                                                        AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. AC Takeoff and Landing Policy. Conditions permitting, a qualified and current pilot
   certified as an AC, IP, or EP will accomplish all takeoffs, approaches, and landings from the
   left seat under the following conditions: EXCEPTION: The PAG/CC will determine
   takeoff and landing policy for designated Presidential Aircraft.
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.1.2. When making an actual Category (CAT) II or III Instrument Approach Landing
       System (ILS) approach.
       5.4.1.3. When operating to or from airfields requiring airfield related waivers.
       EXEPTION: On Operational Mission Evaluations (OMEs), EPs may allow pilots being
       evaluated to remain in the seat if the waiver is for weight bearing capacity to the ASRR.
   5.4.2. Missions in Command. Only missions where the individual is certified as an AC and
   designated as PIC on the flight orders will be credited as missions in command.
   5.4.3. Takeoff and Landing Policy. FPs can accomplish takeoffs and landings on any
   mission at the discretion of the PIC using the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1 of this AFI.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. Unless the FCM directs otherwise, the pilot in
the left seat will command gear and flap operations and the pilot in the right seat will activate the
systems. The right seat pilot will acknowledge the command prior to system activation. If the
pilot flying (PF) the aircraft is in the right seat, that pilot should command gear and flap
operations to include a go-around. The pilot monitoring (PM) in the left seat will acknowledge
the command prior to gear/flap system activation by the right seat pilot. MDS Cockpit/Crew
Resource Management (CRM) differences should be thoroughly briefed for right seat procedures
to include programming flight management systems.
5.6. Outside Observer. When available, use a crewmember to assist in outside clearing during
all taxi operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). If
the aircraft will penetrate a known or suspected Weapons Engagement Zone (WEZ), the PIC will
review, brief, and assign specific observer duties according to applicable AFTTP lookout
doctrine.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as
   directed by the PIC and the FCM. The use of an Infant Car Seat (ICS) aboard aircraft is not
   mandatory. Crewmembers will assist passengers in securing the ICS in the seat. The PIC will
   be the final authority in determining if the ICS is adequately secured.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers occupying primary crew positions will have seat belts fastened at all
   times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened
   during taxi, takeoff, and landing, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Crewmembers
   performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt requirements unless
   they occupy a crew station; however, a seat with an operable seat belt will be available.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 39


5.8. Aircraft Lighting. Set aircraft lighting IAW this AFI, AFI 11-202V3, FCM, AFTTPs, and
applicable AOR guidance.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.5.1.
   5.9.1. Portable non-transmitting devices are authorized IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.5.1
   and include audio and video recorders, playback devices, computers, peripherals, electronic
   entertainment devices, radio receivers, and personal digital assistants (PDA). Navigation aid
   Portable Electronic Devices (PED) are covered in 5.23 of this Instruction.
   5.9.2. Unauthorized equipment (e.g., Walkman-type radios/tape players, CD players, etc.)
   will not be connected to the aircraft intercom, Public Address (PA) or radio systems.
   5.9.3. Portable Satellite (SAT) Phones. The use of portable SAT phones (IRIDIUM,
   FLIGHTCELL etc.) in flight is authorized on C-32, C-37 and C-40 aircraft in Visual
   Meteorlogical Conditions (VMC) above 10,000 feet. Until Lead Command approved, they
   are not authorized for use in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or to be connected
   to aircraft power or antennas. Suction cup antenna use is authorized.
       5.9.3.1. SAT phones will not be used below 10,000 feet or in IMC. CSOs and FAs will
       notify the PIC if SAT phones are in use to assist in compliance.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use, to include smokeless (spit/loose)
products, is prohibited on Air Force aircraft per AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force. If an
exception to policy is required, it must be coordinated through HQ AFMOA/SGZP to HQ
USAF/CC for approval.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director
and autopilot mode selections and mode transitions, and/or when circumstances require deviating
from normal procedures. The PM will make all advisory calls except those designated for other
crewmembers. NOTE: Automated aircraft advisory calls satisfy this requirement. Tables 5.1
through 5.5 depict suggested calls for nonprecision approaches, precision approaches, climbout
and descent, and supplement FCM guidance on mandatory calls.

 NOTES:
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  41


 1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
 environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing,
 a go around will be made.
 2. With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the
 runway environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be
 visible. The pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights.
 For a CAT I/II ILS, the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone
 elevation using the approach lights as the sole reference unless the red terminating
 bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
 3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around.
 Respond intention to ―Land‖ if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
 throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing. The ―Land‖
 call will not be made solely off of the approach lights unless the requirements in Note
 2 are satisfied.
 4. Calls will be based off of the radio altimeter.
 5. Tolerances to call ―Land‖ are IAW FCM guidance or as follows if not specified:
 a. Airspeed is plus or minus 5 knots of the computed final approach
 b. Localizer or glideslope deviations do not exceed ½ dot deviation on the course
 deviation indicator (CDI) or glideslope indicator.
 c. Aircraft track will remain within the lateral confines of the runway extended.
 d. If any of these are exceeded, or if the aircraft is not stabilized IAW the FCM, a
 ―Go Around‖ will be called.
 6. All other instrument approach callouts are located in the appropriate FCM, or
 approved MAJCOM supplement/local supplement.


   5.11.1. Deviations.
       5.11.1.1. The PF will brief any planned deviations from procedures. The PM will
       announce any deviations from planned or prescribed procedures for the approach or
       departure being flown. They will also announce course and heading deviations, airspeed
       deviations of 5 knots or more below desired, and altitude deviations of 100 feet or more
       from desired.
       5.11.1.2. Any crewmember will announce an altitude variation of 200 feet or more, an
       airspeed deviation of 10 knots or more below desired, or any potential terrain, obstruction
       or traffic clearance problem.
5.12. Communications Policy. Recorded aircraft crew communications are considered factual
and therefore the Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to aircrews regarding their
recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree
of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
42                                                    AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


  5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
  mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, flight below 10,000 feet
  Mean Sea Level (MSL) (except cruise), and penetration of a known or suspected WEZ.
  5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone/Datalink. Do not discuss classified information over interphone
  or clear VHF/HF datalink [Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System
  (ACARS)/Airborne Flight Information System (AFIS)] channels. Primary crewmembers
  will monitor interphone. Crewmembers will advise the PIC prior to checking off interphone.
  5.12.3. Command Radios:
     5.12.3.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls. Normally, use only one
     command radio, plus guard. Monitoring two controlling agencies' transmissions
     simultaneously is not recommended. EXCEPTION: ILS/PRM approaches.
     5.12.3.2. In terminal areas the primary crewmembers at assigned stations will monitor
     the primary command radio unless directed otherwise.
     5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the command radios will inform the crew when the primary
     radio is changed. Also, announce the radio (if different from the primary) on which to
     monitor guard.
     5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and will acknowledge all ATC clearances. The other
     pilot, navigator, or flight engineer will monitor the read-back. This includes all
     transmissions pertaining to ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach
     procedures. Disregard this procedure when ATC instructions require immediate
     execution or when such action interferes with completion of more important duties or
     physiological needs.
     5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard frequencies to the maximum
     extent possible.
     5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
     unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK and SECURE VOICE training.
     5.12.3.7. When the aircraft is in other than a normal configuration (for example, an
     engine inoperative, hydraulic or electrical malfunction, communications difficulty, etc.),
     the pilot should request simultaneous transmission of the controller's instructions on a
     single frequency approach if in a terminal area under radar control.
  5.12.4. CRM Assertive Statement ―Time Out":
     5.12.4.1. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers.
     The use of "Time Out" will:
         5.12.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational
         awareness.
         5.12.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
         5.12.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers that someone sees the aircraft or crew departing
         from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
         uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   43


       5.12.4.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
       the following actions:
          5.12.4.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
          5.12.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
          5.12.4.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
          inputs relative to the stated concerns.
          5.12.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
          current course of action or direct a new course of action. NOTE: The PIC is the final
          decision authority.
5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) on aircraft will be coordinated
through unit OG/CC (or equivalent) for approval with C2 agencies (CVAM, AMD, etc). Other
pets or animals are normally prohibited. Waiver authority is OUSD(AT&L). Units are
responsible for developing guidance regarding handling of pets during flight.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. Dispensing of alcoholic beverages on VIP Aircraft is IAW AFI 34-
219, Alcoholic Beverage Program.       MAJCOMs will publish approvals in applicable
supplements.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements use Table 5. 6. and Table 5.7

Table 5.6. Minimum Runway Length.
 MDS Aircraft Type                                Minimum Runway Length

 NOTE: PAG/CC determines minimums for Presidential Airlift Missions.


   5.15.1. Waiver requirements. If operationally necessary, the unit OG/CC may approve use
   of runways shorter than specified. Approval requires careful evaluation of aircraft and crew
   capabilities. Request waivers through C2 centers, unit stan/eval for OG/CC approval. If
   operations are approved, a qualified and current AC, IP or EP will make the landing and
   takeoff from the left seat. Inform MAJCOM/Stan Eval of all OG/CC waivers granted.
   5.15.2. Runway length for takeoff.
       5.15.2.1. Do not attempt takeoff if runway available is less than critical field length (Use
       the greater of accelerate-and-stop or accelerate-and-go distance for the C-20/C-37).
   5.15.3. Runway Length for Landing.
       5.15.3.1. Minimum required runway for landing will be based on landing distance
       computed from 50 feet over threshold.
 44                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


      5.15.3.2. Compute landing distance with no-reverse thrust. EXCEPTION: C-37B
      landing distance on wet or contaminated runways will be computed using maximum
      reverse thrust.
      5.15.3.3. C-20/C-37. Minimum runway may be reduced to landing ground roll plus
      1000‘ when approved by OG/CC. Reported weather must be equal to or greater than
      circling minimums. Pilots should plan to touchdown approximately 500 feet from the
      approach end of the runway and a normal visual glidepath will be used (i.e. 2.5 to 3
      degrees).
   5.15.4. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Width Requirements.

Table 5.7. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Width Requirements.

VC-25                 See Note 6               See Note 6                  See Note 6

NOTES:
(1) 90 degree turns onto a 40 foot taxiway will be from a minimum surface width of 75 feet.
(2) C-20: For 90 degree turns to/from a surface less than 35 feet, but no less than 25 feet, the
other surface will be a minimum width of 45 feet. Offset to the larger surface to keep on
pavement.
(3) C-37: For 90 degree turns to/from a surface less than 35 feet, but no less than 25 feet,
the other surface will be a minimum width of 55 feet. Offset to the larger surface to keep on
pavement.
(4) For both C-20/C-37: Minimum taxiway width for 90 degree turns (with fillets) is from a
35 foot to 35 foot taxiway. Even when fillets are available, these turns may not be possible
in the given taxiway surface. Deplane a crewmember if in doubt to marshal the turn.
(5) C-32 aircraft require fillets when turning from one 49 foot (15 meter) wide taxiway to
another.
(6) PAG/CC determines minimums for Presidential Airlift Missions.


   5.15.5. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized
   for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.
   Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   45


   5.15.6. Takeoff or Landing Over Raised Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables).
      5.15.6.1. When conditions permit [aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds,
      Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD), etc.] and the PIC has considered the potential for
      damaging the aircraft, make takeoffs and landings beyond raised cable barriers. Use the
      entire length of runway if necessary. Be aware that operations over arresting gear barriers
      at speeds in excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft.
      5.15.6.2. Do not land on a raised arresting cable. Damage may occur to the cable or
      aircraft.
      5.15.6.3. If the aircraft lands before a raised arresting cable and rolls over it, the flight
      crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected (this does not include rolling
      over a cable at normal taxi speeds).
      5.15.6.4. Do not takeoff or land over a raised arresting cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, Automated Terminal Information Service
      (ATIS), ATC, etc.
   5.15.7. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.15.7.1. Consult with MAJCOM Airfield Suitability Branch (HQ AMC/A3AS for
      MAJCOMs without an airfield suitability branch) for suitability guidance. Once a
      mission is in execution, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield suitability based
      upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
      5.15.7.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the Global Decision
      Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/ASRR before all off-station operations for which AMC
      is the mission execution authority. 18AF/CC is the waiver authority for the restrictions in
      GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
      specifically delegated in this Instruction or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant
      Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. Parent MAJCOM/A3 is the
      waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance.
      Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
   5.15.8. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered unusable for takeoff and landing
   when winds (including gusts) are greater than established in Table 5.8.

Table 5.8. Wind Restrictions.
 MDS Aircraft                   Maximum Wind         Maximum         Maximum Crosswind

      5.15.8.1. The maximum crosswind component during manual (autopilot off) CAT II and
      CAT III ILS approaches is 10 knots.
46                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.15.8.2. The maximum crosswind component for VC-25 (autopilot on) CAT II and
     CAT III approaches is 15 knots.
     5.15.8.3. The maximum crosswind component for (autoland) CAT II and CAT III
     approaches is 25 knots (C-32) and 20 knots (C-40).
     5.15.8.4. The maximum crosswind component for C-37A/B (autopilot on) CAT II
     approaches is 20 knots.
     5.15.8.5. Reference chapter 9 for CAT II training restrictions.
  5.15.9. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) or Runway Surface Condition (RSC). Comply
  with FCM guidance.
     5.15.9.1. Determine RCR versus maximum allowable crosswind component from the
     FCM. Braking Action/Mu values from the FCM define runway condition and aircraft
     capability. RCR equivalents to Braking Action/Mu values are found in the FCM.
     5.15.9.2. Operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff data will be
     based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. To ensure
     proper takeoff performance in the event of an engine failure, the runway should be
     cleared to allow for your maximum Vmcg offset (e.g., C-32 is 25 feet plus main gear
     offset). If your required Vmcg offset either side of centerline is not cleared to the
     reported RSC, then the RSC of the unclear portion, up to your required offset, will be
     used for takeoff data computations.
     5.15.9.3. RCR Reporting. RCR information is obtained only within 20 feet of the
     runway centerline. Only the average RCR is reported. Many portions of the runway
     (laterally and longitudinally) may have a significantly lower RCR than the value
     reported.
     5.15.9.4. Wet vs. RCR. For operations on wet, un-grooved runways, use the RCR
     designated as "wet" in the FCM for all takeoff and landing data. Use RCR 12 if the "wet"
     RCR is not designated in the FCM. For wet operations on grooved runways, use the
     RCR corresponding to ―Dry‖ in the FCM.
     5.15.9.5. No Reported RCR or RSC. When RCR or RSC reporting is not available,
     flight crews are to consider a runway surface as wet when there is sufficient water on the
     surface to cause reflective glare or when rain is falling.
     5.15.9.6. Localized Hazards. RCR or RSC reports do not call attention to localized RSC
     hazards, i.e. standing water pools, snow, and sand drifts. Such hazards probably will not
     be reported unless accompanied by reduced RCR. Pilots should be alert to the possibility
     of this condition existing and, if deemed safe, attempt to avoid these hazards.
     5.15.9.7. RCR Corrections. Do not use runways with reported RCR lower than the
     lowest RCR correction contained in the FCM.
     5.15.9.8. If the runway is wet and the reported RCR is higher than the FCM wet RCR,
     the actual reported RCR may be used for mission accomplishment.
     5.15.9.9. C-9 operations into/out of runways less than 5,500 feet available when the RCR
     is less than 12 require an OG/CC waiver.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                47


      5.15.9.10. C-37B operations on wet or contaminated runways require a correction to
      effective runway length to ensure a screen height of 35 feet is met on takeoff with engine
      failure. The PIC will ensure applicable performance data is referenced when operating
      on wet or contaminated runways.

5.16. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: Aircraft at home station
   may delete wing walker restriction IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on
   the Ground, if paragraphs 1.22.2 or 1.22.3 (as applicable) are complied with.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, de-plane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshalling. Use AFI 11-218 signals. The PIC should use marshallers, wing
   walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember positioned at a door or window to act as
   an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
   marshallers should have an illuminated wand in each hand. Observers should be in a position
   to observe wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate to the
   pilot.
   5.16.3. When taxi certified flight engineers taxi the aircraft, another taxi certified
   crewmember will be in the other pilot‘s seat (Comply with AFI 11-218).
   5.16.4. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.16.4.1. Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be familiar with taxi
      routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.16.4.2. Confirm that taxi routes have been swept. If a taxi route has not been swept,
      consider taxiing via an alternate route.
      5.16.4.3. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
      5.16.4.4. Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns.
      5.16.4.5. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations that would position a wing engine over
      an unprepared or un-swept surface. If it becomes absolutely necessary to position a wing
      engine over an unprepared or un-swept surface, the engine should be left in idle (to the
      maximum extent possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface. Consider
      increasing power on remaining engines.
 48                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       5.16.4.6. If it becomes absolutely necessary to accomplish a 180-degree turn on a narrow
       runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at a
       designated turn around pad.
5.17. Human Remains (HR). MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority must authorize
transport of HRs on VIP Aircraft.
5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures. Fuel jettison is limited to the minimum necessary for safe and
effective flight operations. Except in the case of an emergency, prior to jettisoning fuel, crews
will notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude, and location.
Inform the appropriate ATC or flight service facility when the operation is complete.
5.19. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3, FCM, and applicable AFTTPs.
5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, units must implement the following procedures:
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch Condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local Instrument Flight
       Rules (IFR)/Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver
       authority to operate at non-DoD airfields. EXCEPTION: PAG/CC is waiver authority
       for Presidential Airlift Missions.
   5.20.2. Make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings, and low-levels from one hour
   before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the BASH phase II period. Significant bird
   hazards will be published in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along with
   the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PIC‘s have the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition. Coordinate through appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.20.4. The PIC should consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the
   mission to help minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model
   (BAM) on HQ AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized
   CONUS bird migration patterns, European BIRDTAMS, Portable Flight Planning System
   (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)
   website is another source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed
   through the AMC aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife
   Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the
   aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Aircrews involved in a wildlife strike
   will fill out an AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, and forward to the appropriate
   safety office.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    49


       5.20.5.1. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected
       damage may result in a complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance
       personnel on the ground can make reliable damage assessments.
       5.20.5.2. Aircrews should not change the aircraft configuration until it has been
       determined that it is safe to do so. However, crewmember judgment should always
       prevail in any situation in making a decision concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft.
5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCF), Acceptance Check Flights (ACF) and Operational
Check Flights (OCF). FCFs and ACFs will be performed according to TO 1-1-300,
Acceptance/Functional Check Flt and Maint Opr Checks, and the applicable AFI 21-101. FCF
flights/programs are not applicable to leased aircraft (except where specifically annotated in
lease agreement).
   5.21.1. Terms and Abbreviations:
       5.21.1.1. FCF. FCFs are performed after accomplishing inspections or maintenance to
       assure the aircraft is airworthy and capable of mission accomplishment. FCF
       certification required.
       5.21.1.2. ACF. ACFs specify guidelines for accepting new production aircraft and to
       determine compliance with contractual requirements. ACF certification required.
       5.21.1.3. OCF. OCFs will be performed to verify functionality for could not duplicate
       (CND) and non-safety of flight items. Aircraft will be at least Partial Mission-Capable
       (PMC) to perform an OCF. PIC will be at least an instructor pilot.
   5.21.2. FCF Restrictions:
       5.21.2.1. Conditions requiring an FCF typically include (but are not limited to) major
       retrofit modifications, removal or replacement of moveable flight control surfaces, major
       repairs that would affect the flying characteristics of the aircraft, adjustment, removal, or
       replacement of major components of the flight control system for which airworthiness
       cannot be verified by maintenance operational checks, or removal or replacement of an
       engine. Final determination for conditions requiring an FCF are contained in
       manufacturer‘s guidance or maintenance TOs.
       5.21.2.2. OG/CC‘s are responsible for the wing FCF program. The OG/CC may waive a
       complete FCF and authorize an FCF to check only systems disturbed by maintenance,
       inspection or modification.
       5.21.2.3. Minimum Crew Complement: Pilot: At least one FCF/ACF certified
       instructor, second pilot must be current and qualified; Flight Engineer: one FCF/ACF
       certified instructor; CSO and FA: as required.
       5.21.2.4. Check flights should be conducted within the designated check flight airspace
       of the airfield from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be
       conducted under specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area
       restrictions.
       5.21.2.5. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority to approve a combined FCF
       and ferry flight with degraded systems.
 50                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       5.21.2.6. FCFs and ACFs will be accomplished by the best qualified instructor/evaluator
       aircrews. The OG/CC will provide written designation of FCF/ACF qualified aircrew.
       5.21.2.7. FCFs will normally be conducted in daylight and VMC. However, the OG/CC
       may authorize a flight under a combination of VMC and IMC. The flight will begin in
       VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are operating properly, it may proceed by IFR to
       penetrate cloud cover to VFR on top to continue the altitude phase of the flight.
       5.21.2.8. FCF aborts. If a malfunction occurs during an FCF and is not related to the
       condition generating the FCF, and the original condition operationally checks good, the
       aircraft may be released for flight.
       5.21.2.9. OG/CC (or equivalent) and deployed mission commander may authorize
       temporary waivers to these FCF procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally
       necessary. Permanent waiver requests require MAJCOM Stan/Eval approval.
5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. IAW AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
all aerial events must be sanctioned and individually approved by the appropriate military
authority, and dated with the FAA. AFI 11-209 clearly identifies events sanctioned for support,
and specifies the approval authority for each type. AFI 11-209 also stipulates that units
participating in aerial events will ensure activities are coordinated with the FAA through the
regional USAF representative.
5.23. Hand Held GPS and Portable Electronic Devices for Navigation. All VIP Aircraft
have integrated GPS. As a backup, aircrews are authorized to carry an approved handheld GPS
unit for additional situational awareness. Use of a handheld GPS unit as an IFR navigation aid is
prohibited. An Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) is a portable tablet computer. It contains a database
of approach charts/plates for use in flight. Some EFBs are integrated into the Flight
Management Computer (FMC)/Flight Management System (FMS) or have a hand-held GPS and
suction cup antenna. Use of these devices for instrument procedures (below 10,000 feet) must be
approved by HQ AFFSA/A3OF and MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority. All non-
transmitting     portable     electronic   devices    require    Electromagnetic    Interference
(EMI)/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing for use in flight below 10,000 feet.
AMC/A3V maintains a list of approved carry-on electrical devices. Contact AMC/A3VS for
specifics.
   5.23.1. Before using the device in-flight, aircrew members must receive training and aircraft
   must be capable of supporting the hand-held GPS equipment. The portable GPS will not be
   used to update Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)/Inertial Reference Systems (IRS)
   equipment unless the portable GPS position can be confirmed by another aircraft source [i.e.
   radar, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio-
   Range (VOR), another INS/IRS, or navigator].
5.24. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). TCAS is designed to enhance
crew awareness of nearby traffic and issue advisories for timely visual acquisition or appropriate
vertical flight path maneuvers to avoid potential collisions. It is intended as a backup to visual
collision avoidance, application of right-of-way rules and ATC separation. The PIC will file an
AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) if required to deviate due to an resolution
advisory (RA).
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  51


   5.24.1. Aircrew must comply with all RA‘s. This ensures aircraft separation computed by
   TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may result in a midair collision. Advise ATC as
   soon as practical when a deviation becomes necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory.
   5.24.2. Aircrew should visually clear the airspace and obtain clearance prior to maneuvering
   the aircraft in response to a TCAS traffic advisory (TA).
5.25. Radar/Radio Altimeter.
   5.25.1. Any crewmember detecting the illumination of the radar/radio altimeter Low
   Altitude Warning Light will immediately notify the PF. Terrain clearance and aircraft
   position must be verified.
   5.25.2. Before departure the radar/radio altimeter should be set to the emergency return
   minimums altitude or the first planned approach for local training unless FCM specifies
   different. Normally, use the height above touchdown/height above aerodrome (HAT/HAA)
   for IMC, or 600 feet for VMC departures.
   5.25.3. Set the radar/radio altimeter to the HAT/HAA during instrument approaches.
5.26. Not Used.
5.27. Reduced Power Takeoffs. Accomplish IAW applicable FCM.
5.28. Aircraft Recovery From Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi. Using the
appropriate equipment, ground crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. EXCEPTION: In
highly unusual situations, it may be necessary for VIP aircrews to recover the aircraft.
Accomplish recovery only if the PIC has coordinated with unit safety, stan/eval and appropriate
MAJCOM maintenance authorities through the unit C2 centers to confirm there is no aircraft
damage and the surface will support the aircraft.
5.29. Engines Running Onload/Offload (ERO) Procedures. Accomplish IAW applicable
FCM and AFTTPs.
5.30. Use of Automation. In order to perform the same demanding worldwide strategic and
theater missions currently flown with larger crews, automation is employed. All TOs,
procedures, checklists, training, and supporting documents are designed to support the human
operator.
   5.30.1. It is the responsibility of the crew to fully understand the operations and limitations
   of the automation on the aircraft. In flight, the PF will determine the most desirable level of
   automation for a given situation. The PM provides basis for duties to aid PF, he must
   manage PF workload, set priorities and employ the available resources, including
   automation, to help PF maintain overall situational awareness.
   5.30.2. Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight conditions. The first
   priority is to fly the aircraft. The FMC/FMS/Automatic Flight Director System (AFDS) and
   Mission Computer are intended to aid in workload management, not complicate it. As the
   flight situation changes, do not feel locked into a level of automation.
   5.30.3. Avoid the following common pitfalls associated with over-reliance, misuse, or
   misunderstanding of automation.
 52                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       5.30.3.1. Fixating on the automation. One pilot should always remain heads up.
       Establish clear roles for computer related tasks. Announce ―pilot heads down‖ when the
       task requires focusing significant attention on the mission computer in flight.
       5.30.3.2. Misprioritizing programming tasks. Extensive reprogramming during critical
       phases of flight or during periods of high workload should be avoided.
       5.30.3.3. Mode awareness. The PF should monitor flight mode annunciations and make
       AFDS panel changes during coupled operations. Programming the FMC/FMS should be
       verified by PF prior to coupling route to the autopilot. During uncoupled flight, the PF
       should direct the PM to make changes to the AFDS panel to match the flight director.
       Confirm all mode changes by observing the correct flight mode annunciations.
       5.30.3.4. Altitude Window. The most critically missed area of responsibility is the
       altitude window on the AFDS panel. Typically, (autopilot on or off), the PM sets the
       cleared altitude in the window and confirms the altitude with the PF. It is vital that the
       PM obtain verbal confirmation from PF after setting an assigned altitude on the AFDS
       panel.
       5.30.3.5. Over-reliance on automation. Practice flight operations at all levels of
       automation to be proficient. If the automation is not performing as expected, take over
       manually. Reference backup navigational aids (NAVAIDs) (if available) that define the
       procedure when using the FMC/FMS.
5.31. Aircraft Defensive System (DS). Operate DS IAW applicable FCMs, technical
instructions, AFTTPs, and command guidance.
5.32. Mobility Aircrew Fall Protection. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto
the upper fuselage or wing surfaces unless there is an operational necessity. When operational
conditions dictate that aircrew members must climb onto upper fuselage or wing surfaces, they
will do so only when conditions are dry and while wearing a maintenance safety harness and
properly engaged lanyard. PICs will ensure no other personnel (excluding qualified
ops/maintenance personnel) have access to, or are allowed to, climb onto the fuselage or wings.
EXCEPTION: Aircraft that do not have the ability to anchor the maintenance safety harness
and lanyard are exempt from the harness requirement until a suitable alternate is available.

   authorized the wear of earrings.
   6.1.5. Uniforms for aircraft security RAVENs. RAVENs and RAVEN augmentees will
   wear the same type clothing, military or civilian, as the rest of the aircrew. For stateside and
   overseas missions scheduled to Remain Overnight (RON) at civilian airports or overseas
   missions transiting US military bases where civilian clothing is required for travel, civilian
   clothing will be worn while performing sentry duties. The RAVEN Non-Commissioned
   Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will coordinate duty uniform requirements with the PIC prior to
   mission departure.
   6.1.6. Personnel will have the appropriate items of clothing in their possession when flying
   in Arctic and Antarctic regions and Desert regions IAW OPORD (if applicable).

   transit locations where passports are required. PICs are responsible for ensuring passports
   (with applicable visas) are carried by crewmembers when required.
 54                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   6.2.2. Shot Record. Crewmembers must maintain worldwide shot requirements and carry
   their shot records on all OCONUS missions.
   6.2.3. Driver's License. A valid state driver's license is required on each TDY where use of
   US government general purpose vehicles may be required. Crewmembers will contact the
   local airfield manager before driving on the flight line.
   6.2.4. Identification Tags. Crewmembers will carry two identification tags (aka dog tags) on
   all flights.
   6.2.5. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, or
   earrings in the aircraft or on the flight line. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may wear elastic
   hair fasteners and/or pins, clips, earrings or barrettes (IAW AFI 36-2903) provided they do
   not interfere with the wearing of headsets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. They will be
   accounted for before and after flight.
   6.2.6. Flight Gloves. All crewmembers should have Nomex gloves in their possession.
   6.2.7. Flashlight. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight for night flights.
   6.2.8. Headgear. Do not wear headgear that interferes with donning the oxygen mask or
   smoke goggles while performing crew duties.
   6.2.9. Hearing Protection. Each crew member will have appropriate hearing protection
   available for the conditions encountered on the flight line.
   6.2.10. Reflective Belts. Crew members will have reflective belts in their possession. These
   are to be used on the flight line between dusk to dawn (or as directed by local supplement).
   6.2.11. Protective and Survival Gear. If required IAW applicable AOR guidance, the PIC
   will ensure appropriate crew members are equipped with protective gear (e.g. body armor,
   laser eye protection, etc.) and survival equipment (e.g. survival kit, escape and evasion kit,
   etc.).
6.3. Pre-mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Mission Planning and Airfield Review. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all
   mission planning, foreign clearance and en route support requirements are coordinated.
   Planning activities may be accomplished by contracted dispatch, flight management agencies
   or mission operations personnel. The PIC is ultimately responsible for validating all
   planning material prior to execution. The suggested mission planning review areas for
   aircrew and IFM/CDS/AMD include, but are not limited to:
      6.3.1.1. Airspace/Airfield Review. Aircrews will use MAJCOM approved Unclassified
      But Sensitive Protocol Router (NIPR) and Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR)
      network websites. The AMC Aircrew Portal and theater-specific websites provide vital
      links to planning. Include FLIP, Flight Information Region (fir)/Upper Flight
      Information Region (uir)/Air Defense Identification Zone (adiz), aOR, and Jeppesen
      procedures as well as study of runways, taxiways, and ramp areas. Refer to paragraph
      5.15 of this AFI for minimum runway and taxiway requirements. Check weight bearing
      capacities. Contact AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability), and/or Airfield Manager directly
      if airport capabilities are questionable. Check adequacy of parking space and if adverse
      weather is possible arrange for hangar space if available. Verify the availability of
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               55


     aircraft stairs if required prior to mission departure. Check for DoD contract
     fueling/service/AGE availability prior to making any arrangements with airport facilities.
     If cold weather operations are expected, check snow removal and de-icing capabilities.
     6.3.1.2. Airspace classifications, AMC Giant Report, ASRR, Airport Qualification &
     Familiarization Manual, and airport qualification videos (if available).
     6.3.1.3. Theater Instrument Procedures. Required instruments and/or procedures for
     Non-DoD Approaches, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) course reversal
     approaches, circling, holding, Non Directional Beacon (NDB) approaches, Host
     Nation/Jeppesen Approaches, and transition altitudes/altimeter setting procedures,
     terminal GPS coverage [Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) check if
     applicable]. Notify appropriate MAJCOM Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)
     office as soon as possible to request reviews of non-DoD procedures (unless using the
     host government-sanctioned FLIP product for airfields located in a Special Accredited
     Host Nation).
     6.3.1.4. Oceanic/Organized Track Systems.      Consult North Atlantic Minimum
     Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Airspace Operations Manual, FAA
     Oceanic NOTAMS, and FLIP AP series, to verify MNPS airspace, Communications,
     Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and North Atlantic and
     Pacific Region Track Systems requirements.
     6.3.1.5. Communication and Emergency Procedures. FLIP AP series, FIH, C2, over-
     water position reporting, CPDLC procedures, lost communications procedures,
     emergency procedures, and weather information sources.

     Personnel Customs, Immigration, Agriculture, Insect and Pest Control, Diplomatic
     Clearance Log.
     6.3.1.7. Flight planning. DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, Jeppesen
     Approach Plates and Charts, theater weather conditions, fuel reserves and alternate
     requirements, Extended Range Operations (EROPS) fuel requirements, MEL/MMEL
     dispatch restrictions, Equal Time Points (ETP)/critical wind factors, and NOTAMs
     [RAIM - GPS, Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), enroute and international
     NOTAMs].
     6.3.1.8. Special Military Operations. Obtain Altitude Reservations (ALTRV), AOR
     procedures, SPINS, ATO‘s and review ―Due Regard‖ procedures if applicable to the
     mission.
     6.3.1.9. Other Regulatory Requirements. General navigation procedures, Life Support
     equipment, hazardous cargo, crew rest/crew duty time, aircraft records/AFTO 781, ARMS
     Aircrew/Mission Data Document, procedures, Mission Essential Personnel, passenger
     handling, etc.
     6.3.1.10. Location Information. C2 reporting procedures, maintenance problems, aircraft
     security, embassy/consulate contacts, social customs, billeting, transportation, and cash

56                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


  6.3.2. Pre-Mission Planning.    Pre-mission planning responsibilities include, but are not
  limited to the following:
     6.3.2.1. Review tasking and itinerary. When mission confirms, contact the DV mission
     contact. Inform the on-board contact officer that excessive carry on baggage cannot be
     stowed in the passenger compartment. Confirm on-board communication requirements.
     6.3.2.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, ATO, Jeppesen products and DoD FLIP.
     6.3.2.3. Foreign Clearance. Review the FCG and classified FCG. Ensure the planned
     itinerary can be flown in compliance with the provisions of the FCG. If not, obtain an
     exception to the FCG through the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or State Department
     channels or coordinate an itinerary change. Start visa processing as soon as possible.
     6.3.2.4. Flight Itinerary. Confirm itinerary times and prepare a flight itinerary. Itinerary
     leg times are block-to-block times (door closed to door open) and include time for taxi-
     out, takeoff, climb, descent, approach, landing, and taxi-in. After completion of planned
     computer flight plan (CFP), current operations/CDS/IFM will notify C2 if CFP + taxi
     block times are in excess of scheduled block times. Reference local supplement for unit
     standards and guidance for programmed (AVISOURCE, GDSS, etc) vs. CFP block
     times. Notify C2 and re-compute departure times to meet ―hard‖ block times if
     requested. In all cases, ensure forecast winds, payload and drag factors are accurately
     assessed.
     6.3.2.5. Messages. Advance notice and/or diplomatic clearance messages are required
     for all missions to destinations OCONUS, including flights to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto
     Rico. Exact requirements and addressees for each country are found in the FCG and
     classified FCG. See local supplement for additional unit guidance on message formats
     and procedures.
     6.3.2.6. Protection of DV foreign travel itineraries is required by DoD and USAF policy
     guidance. For unclassified missions operating outside the United States, US possessions,
     or Canada, do not include the name of the DV in unclassified messages or email. Make
     every effort to keep DV itinerary and trip itinerary separate to enhance OPSEC. See local
     supplement for security measures to transmit itinerary, hotel reservations and DV
     messages.
     6.3.2.7. En Route Support. PICs are ultimately responsible to ensure en route support at
     all destinations. If applicable, ensure CDS/IFM/AMD/CAOC arrange en route support.
     For most OCONUS missions, arrange support by tasking the local Defense/Air Attaché
     by e-mail or AUTOMATED MESSAGE HANDLING SYSTEM (AMHS) message. For
     all CONUS missions (and as necessary for foreign missions), PICs will confirm
     destination support through CDS/IFM/AMD (as applicable). When a mission or portion
     of a mission is canceled or changed, the PIC is responsible for advising affected support
     agencies or attaches. 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) is available for VIP
     support (USAFE/PACAF support provided by AMD and CENTAF support provided by
     CAOC).
     6.3.2.8. Coordinate for worldwide FLIP, TAAD procedures and sufficient COMSEC
     materials for the duration of the mission.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  57


     6.3.2.9. Review anti-hijacking procedures (AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Piracy
     (Hijacking) (FOUO), and chapter 7 of this AFI).
     6.3.2.10. Obtain terminal terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations, if available.
     6.3.2.11. If applicable, release available seats to passenger terminal (See paragraph
     6.51.1 of this AFI).
     6.3.2.12. Comply with the AMC Phoenix Raven Locations list for enroute aircraft
     security.
  6.3.3. Parking, Servicing, and Aircrew Requirements. The following should be considered
  when planning missions into certain locations:
     6.3.3.1. Guard and Reserve Facilities. On missions to CONUS civil airports with a
     military facility (ANG/AFRC) capable of providing support, use the military facility;
     however, there are exceptions. If the mission will arrive or depart outside the normal
     operating hours of the military facility (nights, weekends, or holidays) use a civilian
     facility (terminal, FBO ramp, etc.) provided you can arrange the necessary support. If the
     using agency requests use of a civilian facility in preference to an available military
     facility, use the civilian facility. If your DV party has a requirement to use the military
     facility, make arrangements to use the military facility. In general, avoid requiring
     ANG/AFRC units to work overtime in support of VIP Missions unless the using agency
     has a specific need to use the military facility or suitable support cannot be obtained from
     civilian sources.
     6.3.3.2. Contract Servicing Agents. When you plan to use civilian facilities for parking
     or servicing, refer to the worldwide merchant directory for the Multi Service Card via
     https://www.airseacard.com. Use the government fuel contractor unless you cannot
     obtain the required services. If your mission requires parking away from the contracted
     fueling ramp, try to arrange trucking of fuel/servicing at the parking spot; don't plan to
     taxi to the contracted fuel ramp solely for refueling. Use approved government credit
     card if you must purchase fuel from other than the designated government contract
     vendor.
     6.3.3.3. Border Clearance. Missions entering or departing the United States will
     normally use a regular or special foreign clearance base, a civil international airport of
     entry (AOE), or a landing rights aerodrome as specified in the FCG. Military inspectors
     at special foreign clearance bases are only authorized to clear aircraft participating in the
     special projects listed for each base in the FCG. When aircraft not participating in the
     approved special projects require clearance, the special foreign clearance base
     commander must obtain advance approval from US border clearance officials in order to
     clear the aircraft. Aircraft must not transit a special foreign clearance base for clearance
     unless advance approval is confirmed. If the mission requires, arrangements can be made
     to use any suitable CONUS airfield, but the PIC must coordinate border clearance
     inspections with all appropriate government agencies in advance. Refer to the FCG,
     classified FCG, and applicable AFIs.
     6.3.3.4. Security Support. Standard message formats include security support. If
     RAVENs are assigned to the mission, the senior RAVEN NCO can assist in arranging
     support. However, security support arrangements are the PIC‘s responsibility. If
58                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


     additional aircraft security support and/or threat suppression is required, the PIC should
     contact the applicable tasking agency for assistance.
     6.3.3.5. Aircrew Billeting. Crew integrity is a mission requirement. PICs must know
     where their crewmembers are at all times. Itinerary changes are common and often
     require immediate action by crewmembers. To provide crew control, all crewmembers
     should be billeted at the same facility at en route stops. The PIC must have a "class A" or
     equivalent phone in the room. The mission contact officer/escort and the CP controller
     must know the location of the crew and how to contact them. Crew integrity does not
     require the whole crew to be billeted together in a BOQ. "Billeted at the same facility"
     means billeted on the same base or at the same hotel complex; however, if the whole
     crew is not together, the EAC must have a room phone. When government quarters are
     available, but not suitable, use an AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect - Use of
     Government Facilities, to justify the non-use.
     6.3.3.6. Cabin Service. Determine if meal/beverage service is desired. Arrange for the
     1st FA to call the contact officer directly to coordinate menus and other cabin service
     requirements.
         6.3.3.6.1. The PIC normally should not discuss meal requirements with the contact
         officer. If the mission flight attendant is not available, the PIC should ask the FA
         scheduler to make contact and pass on the requirements to the 1st FA.
         6.3.3.6.2. Confirm payment arrangements for meals and beverage service. If charges
         will be billed, obtain the complete billing address. If a mission cancels (at the request
         of the using agency) after the FA has purchased supplies, the FA will advise the
         contact officer to the costs of all non-returnable items.
     6.3.3.7. Advance Per Diem. Normally, advance per diem will not be paid to
     crewmembers, they are expected to use their government provided credit cards. When
     the mission requires an advance that is too large to reasonably collect from an automatic
     teller, the squadron administration section will assist in arranging advance per diem
     payments. On missions where substantial cash payments are anticipated for aircrew
     transportation and other incidental official crew expenses, the PIC will designate a
     transportation officer to receive an additional advance and be responsible for these
     payments. Refer to the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) for information about per
     diem rates and procedures to follow when applying for special per diem allowances.
  6.3.4. Other planning factors:
     6.3.4.1. The SOC serves as POC between current operations, mission execution
     authority, and crewmembers. Contact unit SOC for coordination with current operations
     or mission execution authority during mission planning and itinerary changes.
     6.3.4.2. All VIP Missions are considered "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" and
     crewmembers will not discuss the mission or any DV information with anyone without a
     need to know. Unclassified missions may be designated "CLOSE HOLD". In this case,
     certain mission details are restricted from normal release to military/non-military
     agencies/contracted dispatch. Clarify the applicable restrictions with unit C2 centers and
     mission execution authority prior to any mission planning or coordination activities.

     6.3.4.3. Confirm the aircraft tail number with the contact officer. Obtain the contact
     officer‘s home/cell telephone number and provide him/her with the PIC‘s home/cell
     telephone number. Notify unit C2 if the contact‘s name or phone number is different
     from the one listed with the SOC/CP printout.
     6.3.4.4. Prearrange your pre-departure weather briefing (DV weather package, ―social‖,
     etc.) IAW local supplement. Provide all details needed to prepare your weather briefing.
     Do not request (DV weather package, ―social‖, etc.) for "CLOSE HOLD" missions.
     6.3.4.5. VIP aircrews will prearrange special communications support as follows:
         6.3.4.5.1. High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS, formerly
         known as Mystic Star)/Andrews Very Important Person (VIP) HF support is required
         for all missions transporting the Secretary of Defense. HFGCS support is also
         available on a priority basis for aircraft transporting the Vice President, cabinet
         members, service secretaries, and service chiefs of staff. When HFGCS/Andrews
         VIP support is required, the CSO will ensure appropriate agencies are notified. Last
         minute requests at crew show time are not acceptable. For alert missions, the PIC
         will request the unit CP or AMD controller to arrange coverage.
         6.3.4.5.2. FM radio support is provided by the White House Communications
         Agency (WHCA) IAW established priorities.
         6.3.4.5.3. Current procedures for use of the HFGCS network and the WHCA FM
         networks are described in the 89 OG/CC Special Communications Support
         Procedures Package available in each mission kit and at the SOC.
         6.3.4.5.4. Denial of service from Andrews Airways. When denied service from
         Andrews Airways due to higher priority traffic and the aircraft is working another
         airways station, inform 89 AW CP which station you are working.
         6.3.4.5.5. Denial of service from WHCA. When denied service from WHCA on
         White House missions with a Secure Communications Required profile, notify SOC
         and advise them to contact current operations and CVAM immediately.
         6.3.4.5.6. Prior to transiting an AOR with special communication requirements, the
         PIC should contact the unit Intelligence or Tactics office for AOR communication
         plan and, as applicable, ATO integration.
         6.3.4.5.7. CSOs will need to coordinate with Commercial Satellite Service Providers
         via the Government Network Operations Center (GNOC) IAW paragraph 14.3 of this
         AFI for accessibility to the Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN).
         6.3.4.5.8. Crews will notify contact officer of aircraft capabilities and the costs
         associated with the respective systems.
     6.3.4.6. Arrange for spare parts as required. PICs on extended overseas missions to areas
     where support facilities are limited may request certain spares be issued for a particular
     trip. Coordinate requirements with C2 agencies and maintenance control personnel.
  6.3.5. Not Used.
  6.3.6. Itinerary Coordination. Use the following procedures when confirming and planning
  itinerary details:
 60                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       6.3.6.1. Preposition for DV pickups. Plan to preposition for DV pickups two hours prior
       to the scheduled departure time (or as directed by local supplement/directives). PICs may
       request to preposition the night prior to an early morning pickup depending on aircraft
       and crew availability. Early preposition may also be requested to allow adequate crew
       rest prior to an extended crew duty day. Coordinate request for early preposition with
       unit C2.
       6.3.6.2. Configurations. Aircraft configuration requirements originate with the mission
       execution authority through unit C2. If the using agency requests a change in the
       configuration shown on the mission printout, the contact officer must coordinate with
       CVAM/AMD. PICs cannot accept aircraft configuration changes directly from the using
       agency. Advise the contact officer to coordinate with the mission execution authority and
       notify unit C2 of the pending request.
       6.3.6.3. Manifest Information. The PIC will coordinate with the contact when
       manifested passengers are not present at departure time. PICs shall designate a
       crewmember to review manifests for accuracy prior to mission departure. PIC‘s will not
       depart without primary DV onboard unless authorized by C2.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. As a minimum, PICs will carry current copies of
AFI 11-202V3 and this AFI on all flights. Additionally, the PIC will ensure the aircraft has a
complete set of current FCMs. All must be readily available in the cockpit during all phases of
flight. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority approval is required to use electronic
publications in lieu of paper manuals. All other crew positions must carry the appropriate
abbreviated checklists. Additional individual aircrew publications requirements will be specified
in local supplements.
6.5. Airfield Review. All crewmembers will review Airport Qualification and Familiarization
Manuals, audiovisual slide tape programs and review any certification airfields available prior to
departure. In addition, aircrews will review appropriate websites, (e.g. AMC Aircrew Portal,
CENTAF AOR CAOC) for all restrictions and certification policies for a particular airfield.
Contact MAJCOM Airfield Suitability and Analysis Branch for all questions pertaining to
airfield weight bearing and suitability prior to all off-station operations. Airfield suitability
waivers must be coordinated through unit Stan/Eval to MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution
authority for approval. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive the airfield certification
requirement (special aircrew certification).
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing and Tactics Support. Before leaving home station on
missions traveling OCONUS (except Alaska and Hawaii), crews will receive an intelligence
briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in
the area in which they will be flying. Crews must also receive an intelligence brief prior to
entering specific AOR. As a complement to the intelligence briefing, the PIC should review and
coordinate necessary tactics with the theater and/or unit Tactics office. In theater, aircrews
should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location, or en route
stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible
intelligence value to the local intelligence officers as soon as possible to ensure timely
dissemination of mission reports (MISREP). In addition, the PIC should provide the Tactics
office with feedback on tactical considerations.

      method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
      methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
      requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
      VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
      high terrain are avoided.
      6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
      ensuring all the following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
          departure route.
          6.16.1.2.2. OEI climb capability shall ensure departure or emergency return route
          provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply with any of the above
          conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that are more favorable
          exist.
      6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of

     IAW paragraph 6.16.1. of this AFI An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields
     without an instrument approach.
     6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning in AFMAN 11-217V1.
        6.16.2.2.1. Runway End Crossing Height or Screen Height is the aircraft‗s required
        AGL altitude at the Departure End of the Runway (DER). The OCS slope begins at
        the DER at the runway end crossing height. Determining and complying with the
        proper runway end crossing height is crucial to preventing unsafe operations below
        the OCS. Runway end crossing heights vary depending on location of the airport,
        who designed the procedure, terrain, obstacles, etc. The parenthetical notation at the
        top of DoD approach plates cannot reliably be used to determine what rules were used
        to produce a departure procedure and screen heights are not consistently published in
        the ODP section of the approach plates. USAF pilots will only consider the type of
        airfield when determining runway end crossing height: USAF/USN non-joint-use
        and all others (Civil/Joint Use/ICAO/NATO/etc.). Consult the IFR Supplement or
        other appropriate FLIP for this information. Joint use airfields will be annotated as
        ―MIL/CIV‖. If an airport is listed as an AFB or NAS and does not include
        ―MIL/CIV‖ in the listing, then it is non-joint-use.
            6.16.2.2.1.1. USAF/USN non-joint-use bases: The OCS at USAF and USN bases
            normally begins at zero feet AGL at the DER, but the OCS may be raised as much
            as 35 feet in order to clear obstacles. If the TERPS specialist raises the OCS, it
            will be published in the ODP. At non-joint-use USAF or USN bases, assume a
            zero foot runway end crossing height unless a higher altitude is published.
            6.16.2.2.1.2. Other         than        USAF/USN          non-joint-use         bases
            (Civil/ICAO/NATO/etc.): If civil aircraft certification standards mandate, or
            obstacles penetrate the OCS, TERPS may raise the runway end crossing height up
            to 35 feet to maintain a normal 200‗/NM climb gradient. There is no reliable
            way, from looking at the DoD/NACO FLIP, to know if TERPS raised the OCS or
            not. Therefore, for any departure at other than non-joint-use USAF or USN bases,
            if the screen height is not published in the ODP or other reliable source, pilots will
            plan to cross the DER at or above 35 feet.
               6.16.2.2.1.2.1. There is no provision for a runway end crossing height greater
               than 35 feet. If a runway end crossing height of 35 feet does not eliminate all
               penetrations of the 40:1 OCS, then a higher than standard (i.e. >200 ft/NM)
               climb gradient will be published on the departure.
               6.16.2.2.1.2.2. If in doubt, or the 35 foot restriction limits mission capability,
               contact the appropriate TERPS authority for the airfield. If further help is
               required, contact the USAF Instrument Procedures Center at DSN 339-8300
               or commercial (405) 739-8300.
            6.16.2.2.1.3. Special Departure Procedure (SDP): Published on SDP.
 68                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
       all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
       NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
       gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
       6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
       obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
           6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedures (SDP). HQ AMC/A3V (lead command)
           authorizes the use of Jeppesen or CDS provided SDP‘s for VIP Aircraft. SDP‘s
           utilize worldwide obstacle database criteria to calculate OEI emergency gross
           weights, flap settings, and provide escape routing. SDP‘s and associated OEI
           obstacle routings (Takeoff Procedures) provide optimum dispatch takeoff weights at
           specified departure locations. Each must be specifically designed for your MDS.
           SDP‘s must be current. If obstacle NOTAM affects SDP routing, do not use the SDP.
           Aircrew must use the FCM and/or computer based performance tools for OEI
           departure planning. Verify aircraft OEI climb gradient will clear all obstacles along
           the planned flight path. NOTE: Use of SDP‘s as alternate departure routing (no
           emergency) is not authorized.
           6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
           is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
           ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
           available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
           gradients for the selected departure, with OEI. Minimum climb gradients may be
           published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off Minimums section of FLIP
           or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment, crews may subtract 48‘/nm
           from published climb gradients before computing OEI takeoff data. Minimum climb
           gradients do not take into account low, close in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘
           AGL and below) which should normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR
           departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews must also ensure the aircraft can clear these
           close in obstacles. NOTE: If the requirements of paragraph 6.16.2.4 of this AFI
           cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
   6.16.3. Tactical Departure Procedures. If transiting an AOR and airfield with TAAD
   procedures, the PIC should review these procedures and apply tactics IAW applicable
   AFTTPs.
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Departures with weather below landing minimums are
authorized IAW AFI 11-202V3, chapter 8. When weather is below approach and landing
minimums (ceiling and visibility), a departure alternate is required (see paragraph 6.19. of this
AFI).

Table 6.1. Takeoff Weather Minimums.

 Operational    RVR          When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 600,
 (Note 2)       (Runway      the crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the
                Visual       runway has a minimum of 2 functioning RVR readouts (minimum
                Range)       RVR 600 on all functioning readouts) and runway centerline
                600          lighting is operational. When 3 transmissometers are installed, all
                             are controlling.

                meters)
 All Others     RVR          For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR
 (Note 1)       1600         must read 1600 minimum on all.
                (490
                meters)

 NOTES:
     1. In the absence of RVR readouts, reported visibility will be no lower than 1/2SM (800
     meters).
     2. If the runway has only one functional RVR readout or no centerline lighting, the
     minimum RVR is 1600.


6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing minimums
   for an available approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use CAT II/III ILS minimums to
   determine if a departure alternate is required.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA) or Minimum
   Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI
   performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the
   following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. Existing weather at an alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to
       or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour
       after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400/730m), or;
       6.19.2.2. The existing weather at an alternate within 1 hour flying (C-9, C-20, C-32, C-
       37 and C-40) or 2 hours flying time (VC-25) must be at least 500-1 above the lowest
       compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a precision
 70                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after
       ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for an
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling or visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the 48 conterminous states. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do
   not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews will use 1+15 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate and 45 minutes holding fuel). A remote or island destination is defined as
   any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil
   or military) within 2 hours flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island
   destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach [excluding Approach Surveillance
       Radar (ASR)], for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a precision approach is available, the
       ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision approach minimums
       (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
       NOTE: See chapter 17 of this AFI for fuel planning considerations for destination
       requirements.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Turbulence. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
       6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or
       what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their
       route of flight. Turbulence category charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency
       technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques.
       6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
       fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                71


     WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
     and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
     6.21.1.3. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain
     wave turbulence.
  6.21.2. Icing. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
  operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
  NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
  Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
  equivalent to severe icing.
     6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
     conditions of freezing drizzle except when the aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
     with approved commercial Type II/IV de-icing fluids IAW applicable FCM procedures.
     For additional information regarding USAF de-ice/anti-ice requirements and procedures,
     consult TO 42C-1-2.
     6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
     ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
     icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
         6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in the FCM or
         approved by the aircraft manufacturer. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all
         restrictions in the FCM with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times.
         6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
         icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved
         anti-icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-
         2, Anti-Icing, Deicing and Defrosting of Parked Acft, and AFFSA holdover tables
         located at the AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first
         applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine
         when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure. In addition to a visual inspection, a tactile
         inspection may be required within 5 minutes of departure per the aircraft FCM. The
         PIC will conduct a tactile inspection as necessary IAW the FCM.
     6.21.2.3. C-20/C-37: Based on actual testing and review of the runoff characteristics in
     the undiluted (neat) form, Gulfstream has determined that Type IV de-icing fluid is
     aerodynamically acceptable for the wing. Consult the Gulfstream AOM/AFM and/or
     Gulfstream FSR for the most current list of approved Type IV fluids.
  6.21.3. Thunderstorms. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or
  cumulonimbus clouds. If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds
  by at least 2,000 feet, avoid them by at least:
     6.21.3.1. 20NM at or above flight level FL230.
     6.21.3.2. 10NM below FL230. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NM or more
     from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
     thunderstorm development and hazard.
 72                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
   used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
   never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
   based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
   instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
       6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
       6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
       6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
   6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
   advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
   thunderstorms.
   6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
       6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NM separation from heavy rain showers.
       6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
       feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
       or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs. The
       thunderstorms must not be producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning,
       strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must
       not be forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include
       the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
   6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
   or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH,
   and other altitudes inside the FAF.
   6.21.8. In-flight Weather Advisories. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)
   and other National Weather Service in-flight weather advisories are issued for large areas.
   Contact appropriate military weather facility or flight service station to determine mission
   applicability and impact.
   6.21.9. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.21.10. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most favorable for lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.10.1.
       6.21.10.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorms.
6.22. Standby/Alert Mission Pre-departure Procedures. Standby/Alert missions include any
mission where the scheduled departure time is less than 12 hours after original notification.
Procedures for standby/alert missions will vary depending on the type mission, type of aircraft
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    73


and time available between notification and departure. Procedures also vary depending on time
of day (i.e., duty hours or non-duty hours). The following general procedures apply in most
cases:
   6.22.1. Normally the standby/alert PIC is notified of an standby/alert mission by current
   operations, SOC, or aircrew scheduler (USAFE/PACAF: AMD notifies unit). When
   notified, the following will be covered:
       6.22.1.1. The mission number, departure spot, expected departure time, DV name and
       position, and number of passengers. If the mission is supporting another VIP Aircraft,
       you may be instructed to log mission symbol S-7, and if you are not given a mission
       number, use the mission call sign plus the static two or three digit suffix number, i.e.
       SAM 70, in place of the mission call sign plus the four digit mission number suffix.
       6.22.1.2. The itinerary details which are available. You may be asked to confirm times,
       airports, preferred FBOs, etc.
       6.22.1.3. Fuel load requirements.
       6.22.1.4. Threat assessment, tactics and airfield security information as applicable.
       6.22.1.5. Items you want briefed to your crewmembers during notification. You should
       specify aircrew uniform or civilian clothes.
   6.22.2. FAs normally require cash for purchases. Reference local supplement.
   6.22.3. For immediate launches overseas during duty hours, the SOC or aircrew scheduler
   will arrange for passports, shot records and navigation kits (as applicable) to be delivered to
   the aircraft. In addition, the SOC or aircrew scheduler will arrange an intelligence briefing
   and/or intelligence package pick-up. After duty hours, the PIC will designate who will pick
   up passports, shot records, navigation kits, intelligence package (as applicable) and confirm
   who will handle pre-launch paperwork. Normally, the duty scheduler (during duty hours),
   SOC or the CP/AMD (after duty hours) will order a weather briefing, intelligence briefing,
   and computer flight plans, if required. Current North Atlantic Track (NAT) messages are
   always available at the CP. For missions departing immediately, the duty scheduler (during
   duty hours) or the CP/AMD (after duty hours) will file a flight plan for the first mission leg.
   The crew must arrange desired dispatch/mission operations service for subsequent legs. The
   duty scheduler will assist in obtaining CFPs when requested. During duty hours, the SOC
   will coordinate with mission operations to prepare and dispatch diplomatic clearance and
   advance notice messages. After duty hours, the CP/AMD controller will arrange to handle
   messages. If you have adequate crew rest and notice prior to departure, you may accomplish
   pre-launch flight planning yourself.
   6.22.4. The SOC and aircrew schedulers will notify the rest of the crewmembers. They will
   be briefed on the mission/aircraft numbers, departure time, where the aircraft is/will be
   spotted, required fuel load, general itinerary and number of days away, and any items the PIC
   has designated for briefing.
   6.22.5. Reporting.
       6.22.5.1. PICs normally report to base operations/squadron/CP to pick up the dispatch
       flight plan, weather briefing and intelligence package, file a flight plan (if required), and
       then report to the aircraft. For immediate launches, one of the other pilots will normally
 74                                                        AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       report directly to the aircraft. For all other launches, one of the other pilots will normally
       pick up passports/shot records, crew orders, navigation kits, and intelligence packages (as
       applicable), then report to the aircraft for pre-launch preparation.
       6.22.5.2. FEs/FCCs report directly to the aircraft to monitor fueling and reconfiguration,
       and accomplish preflight inspections. Keep the CP advised of any aircraft problems.
       6.22.5.3. CSOs pick up applicable crypto kits and report to the aircraft for preflight.
       They act as the crew monitor and notify the CP and PICs if crewmembers do not report
       within a reasonable time.
       6.22.5.4. FAs report to their duty section to pick up supplies. During duty hours, the
       duty scheduler will arrange for another FA to assist with commissary goods and aircraft
       preparation. Do not delay reporting for shopping. Aircraft preparation is the most
       important priority. Obtain cash advances from unit resource advisor (duty hours) or from
       the CP (non-duty hours). Order fleet service and report to the aircraft.
   6.22.6. Immediate Launch Clearances. Pilots should ask clearance delivery for a full route
   clearance if the CP, IFM/CDS, SOC or aircrew scheduler files the flight plan.
6.23. Crew Station Times. Crewmembers will normally be at their duty stations with all
checklists accomplished up to the point of engine start not later than 30 minutes prior to
departure. Crewmembers will be prepared to depart as expeditiously as is safely possible if the
DV arrives early.
6.24. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as
part of predeparture/preflight activities.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.25. AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   6.25.1. Review AFTO 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
   systems. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If
   one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure
   that the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card is aboard the aircraft.
   6.25.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. After
   the maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling
   agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. Approval
   authority for one-time flights is contained in paragraph 4.6.
   6.25.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support, refer to
   paragraphs 12.3. and/or 16.4. of this AFI.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                75


6.26. En Route Aircraft Preflights. FEs, FCCs and CSOs will accomplish aircraft preflights
following crew rest. If the ground time will exceed 72 hours or if the aircraft has been left
unattended, aircrews should accomplish an aircraft inspection/walk-around of the aircraft within
24 hours of scheduled departure, when practical. Anytime en route maintenance has been
performed, the affected systems will be pre-flighted and should be operationally checked as soon
as possible if practical. Thru-flight inspections will be completed anytime a preflight is not
required. FAs only need to accomplish a thru-flight inspection at en route stops. Pilots will
ensure flight controls are checked IAW the FCM.
6.27. Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Requirements. The minimum quantity of oxygen
aboard an aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the
ETP to recovery, should oxygen be required.
   6.27.1. C-37 Oxygen Waiver Policy. A waiver to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, Table 6.1,
   permitting C-37A/B aircraft to operate above FL410 without one pilot donning an oxygen
   mask is granted, under the following provisions:
       6.27.1.1. Operations up to FL450 will be treated the same as those currently allowed in
       AFI11-202 Volume 3, Table 6.1, up to FL410. Crews will limit exposure to higher
       altitudes by planning all missions at or below FL410. Any missions planned at altitudes
       above FL410 (requesting waiver) require MAJCOM A3 approval. Coordinate through
       unit OG/CC and OGV for processing the request.
       6.27.1.2. Should fuel reserves, adverse weather or turbulence necessitate a climb above
       FL410, C-37A/B crews may operate up to FL450 with oxygen immediately available to
       both pilots under the following restrictions:
           6.27.1.2.1. Both pilots will occupy their duty positions.
           6.27.1.2.2. The Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) must be functional.
           6.27.1.2.3. The autopilot must be engaged and functional in each axis.
           6.27.1.2.4. The auto-throttles must be engaged and functional.
           6.27.1.2.5. Internal baggage door must remain closed.
           6.27.1.2.6. Flights over terrain greater than 13,000 feet MSL require one pilot to be
           continually on oxygen if the aircraft is above FL410.
       6.27.1.3. If all the above criteria cannot be met, one pilot will don an oxygen mask IAW
       AFI 11-202 Vol 3, Table 6.1. Additionally, if the cabin pressure low warning message
       illuminates at or above FL400, activating the EDM, the crew will take the following
       actions:
           6.27.1.3.1. Crew Oxygen Masks - Don (All)
           6.27.1.3.2. Speed Brakes - Extend (P or FE)
           6.27.1.3.3. Emergency Descent Procedures - Initiate (PF)
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough to
permit inventory prior to engine start.
 76                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


6.29. Crash Position Indicator (CPI) and Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT). CPIs
and ELTs must be operative for all flights except those remaining in the local area. If a CPI or
ELT deploys or activates inadvertently, notify ATC immediately. In the case of a deployed CPI,
if the aircraft is scheduled to fly a local or is en route with no replacement airfoil available and
the airplane is permitted to continue the mission, a locally manufactured airfoil should be
installed over the missing CPI.
6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, High-Visibility Aircraft Parts
Shipments, and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. These shipments are normally not carried on VIP passenger aircraft. PICs may
   accept or decline shipments at their discretion based on mission requirements or crew or
   aircraft capabilities. Receipts will be obtained for classified cargo, high-visibility aircraft
   parts shipments, signature services, and registered mail at the on-load and off-load station
   using the cargo manifest.
       6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
           6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated without the consent of the
           PIC.
           6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to stop at locations where DCS
           couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as couriers. This does
           not relieve the PIC of the responsibility for life and death urgent shipments.
   6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers to protect the material.
       6.30.2.1. During unscheduled stops, crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies listed in descending order of priority:
           6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier
           6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces
           6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State diplomatic courier
           6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity
           6.30.2.1.5. US military guards
           6.30.2.1.6. US DoD civilian guards
   6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or if
   material is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest
   Defense Courier Station and notify the local US military commander or US government
   activity.
   6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  77


   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record, for unit moves. The
   PIC, or designated representative, will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be
   made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. A delay is charged any time the DV and passengers are ready to
move at the scheduled departure time and the aircraft is not ready for departure or cannot depart
due to maintenance or operational reasons.
   6.31.1. The simplest definition of a VIP delay is a failure to block out when the DV is ready
   at the scheduled time due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV. To
   promote the credibility of our reliability rate the following will be considered delays:
       6.31.1.1. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out "on-time" but could not
       takeoff due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV.
       6.31.1.2. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out "early" but could not takeoff
       due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV. The DV party should
       expect departure any time after stations time (30 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff time),
       or any time the crew has agreed (explicitly, or by loading the party, closing the door and
       implying readiness for departure) to depart early. If the party arrives prior to stations
       time and the crew is not ready a delay will not be charged. When the crew indicates they
       are ready (i.e. boarding party, closing door, removing stairs, starting engines, etc.),
       further delay would constitute a VIP delay.
       6.31.1.3. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out and took off "on-time" but air
       aborted or diverted to an airport other than the next scheduled stop due to maintenance or
       operational reasons, thus delaying the DV.
   6.31.2. Right side engine may be started prior to final on-load of all passengers, baggage,
   and gear in order to expedite overall engine start process. The PIC will ensure the right side
   of the aircraft is safe, clear and all right side aircraft baggage doors are closed/secure. The
   left side engine will not be started until all passengers, baggage and gear are on board, left-
   side aircraft baggage doors are closed/secured and the area around the aircraft is safe and
   clear.
6.32. Cabin Security Procedures for Takeoff and Landing. The following procedures should
be followed prior to all takeoffs and landings:
   6.32.1. The FA should assure all carry-on luggage, equipment and supplies are secured as
   soon as possible after boarding passengers. Ensure all passenger carry-on baggage is stowed
   to prevent a hazard during unforeseen events on takeoff or landing (i.e. aborted takeoff,
   emergency landing, low-level wind shear, turbulence, etc.). EXCEPTION: The primary DV
   may use a portable laptop computer on the fixed table (stowable table for C-20/C-37) during
   taxi, takeoff, and landing. No other use of carry-on equipment or raised tables is permissible
   during take-off and/or landing as they pose an unacceptably high risk of blocking emergency
   exit routes.        After considering extenuating circumstances (i.e. potential wind
   shear/turbulence, combat departure/arrival, aircraft malfunctions, etc.), the PIC may direct
 78                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   that all carry-on baggage be stowed to include the DV compartment. Notify the PIC when
   excessive carry-on baggage (topside) precludes safe stowage.
   6.32.2. The 1st FA will coordinate with the PIC the anticipated taxi time prior to
   commencing any cabin service prior to takeoff.
   6.32.3. The 1st FA should notify the cockpit crew that the cabin is secure prior to being
   seated for takeoff or landing. The cockpit crew should confirm the cabin security report prior
   to takeoff and landing. At the PICs discretion, if conditions warrant (i.e., immediate takeoff
   clearance), the pilots may alert the passengers and crew using the PA system.

Section 6E—En route

6.33. Flight Progress.
   6.33.1. Prior to coast out fix, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate Oceanic
   Plotting Chart (OPC). Annotate the chart with the mission number, PIC's name, preparer‘s
   name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused.
   6.33.2. Anytime waypoint data is inserted into the FMC/FMS, it will be verified by two
   primary crewmembers. Check both the coordinate information and the distances between
   waypoints against the flight plan.
   6.33.3. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor FMC/FMS performance.
   Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability which degrades
   centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight
   progress:
       6.33.3.1. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the CAT I Route or
       overwater EROPS segment. Perform a gross navigation error check/altimetry check
       using available NAVAIDs and annotate the position, altitude and time on the chart.
       6.33.3.2. When approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates for the next waypoint.
       Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the
       aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
       tolerances.
       6.33.3.3. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart. For CPDLC operations, maintain a log of ATC clearances and retain with the
       OPC.
       6.33.3.4. Monitor FMC/FMS loaded EROPS ETP alternates for weather/NOTAMs.
       Contact dispatch or weather for updates if necessary.
   6.33.4. Post Mission Papers. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if
   reused) and applicable computer flight plans to the squadron stan/eval function. Squadron
   stan/eval will retain the charts, CFPs, CPDLC clearance logs, and associated materials for a
   minimum of 3 months.
   6.33.5. Operations in International/National Territorial Airspace (See FLIP, FCG, AP, and
   MDS series instruction for further guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel
   entering another nation to conduct US government business therein must have the approval
   of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   79


  international air operations are obtained through the DAO. Refer to FLIP GP for discussion
  of international strait passage, archipelagic sea lane passage, procedures to follow if
  intercepted, and other international foreign sovereignty issues.
     6.33.5.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and national
     territorial airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states'
     territorial seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by
     the coastal state. National Territorial airspace, also referred to as territorial or sovereign
     airspace, includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland waters, and
     land territory and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such areas only
     with the consent of the sovereign country.
     6.33.5.2. IAW international law, the US recognizes territorial sea claims and the
     corresponding airspace up to 12 nautical miles measured from baselines drawn consistent
     with international law (normally the low-water mark). Diplomatic constraints and/or a
     lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions operating in international
     airspace. Because of this, it is imperative sufficient information be provided far enough
     in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by the countries
     concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond 12 nautical
     miles; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
     differ from the standard.
     6.33.5.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is defined as an area of airspace
     within which flight information and related services are provided. An FIR does not
     reflect international borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an
     established FIR without approval of the adjacent controlling coastal state/country,
     provided the PIC avoids flight in sovereign airspace.
     6.33.5.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
     into national territorial airspace for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained,
     should not amend entry point(s).
     6.33.5.5. Safe Passage violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or
     improper entry or departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace
     (12 NM seaward from sovereign landmass) for which a clearance has not been duly
     requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
     6.33.5.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
     penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
     country. Aircraft diplomatic clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
     6.33.5.7. In the event air traffic control agencies challenge the validity of a flight routing
     or attempt to negate existing clearances, pilots must evaluate the circumstances. The
     normal response will be to attempt to advise the air traffic control agency that the aircraft
     will continue to planned destination as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase
     is "in international airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
     continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance which routes
     their mission over sovereign airspace which was not approved through diplomatic
     channels prior to mission departure, as being valid authorization. If faced with this
 80                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       situation, aircrews must contact the appropriate MAJCOM C2, as soon as possible, to
       obtain the correct approvals.
       6.33.5.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
       transited prior to performing the critical portion of the mission.
       6.33.5.9. Aircrews normally are not tasked to and should not fly "due regard" routings
       unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority
       and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
       obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all
       other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard"
       option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon
       as practical.
   6.33.6. SPINS. Prior to transiting AOR airspace, review specific theater guidance, including
   SPINS. At a minimum, review the AOR communication plan, special airspace, and airfield
   ingress and egress procedures. Ensure FMC/FMS waypoints for tactical reporting points,
   approaches, and departures are loaded. If appropriate, review combat entry and exit
   checklists with crew members and designate a time/point to initiate or complete the
   checklists.
6.34. Navigational Aid Capability. Refer to chapter 11 of this AFI.
6.35. Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS)
and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP
planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-Flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 center. Also
   attempt to contact the nearest CP when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
6.36. Communications.
   6.36.1. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters.
   Perform an HF radio ground check prior to takeoff when the use of HF radio may be required
   for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF
   range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station and an alternate
   means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, return to the nearest
   suitable support base. ALE equipped aircraft should preflight in the ALE mode.
   6.36.2. General. Provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   Frequencies for GLOBAL HF stations are listed in the FIH.
   6.36.3. AF Form 72, Air Report (AIREP). When directed by departing weather facility, take
   and record an AIREP at each position report over a CAT I Route. Identify inaccurate CFP
   winds by special report if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30 degrees
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 81


   error in wind direction or 25 knots in wind speed. Turn in completed AF Form 72 to the
   destination USAF weather facility.
   6.36.4. SELCAL code assignments: Reference local supplement for unit tail numbers.
   6.36.5. ATO and SPINS. Prior to transiting an AOR with SPINS and ATO requirements,
   load assigned IFF modes/codes. Additionally, contact and monitor appropriate C2 agencies
   at designated times and points along route of flight.
6.37. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.37.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklists and associated actions, crews should furnish the controlling
   agency and appropriate C2 center a description of the difficulty, assistance required,
   intentions, and any other pertinent information.
   6.37.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
      6.37.2.1. Local Area. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over
      appropriate frequencies.
      6.37.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
      center using GLOBAL HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable,
      aircrews are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone
      patch connectivity (ref paragraph 6.37.2.4. of this AFI).
      6.37.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits.
          6.37.2.3.1. Narrative description of the situation to include actions taken by the crew
          and the intentions of the PIC.
          6.37.2.3.2. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
          6.37.2.3.3. Position.
          6.37.2.3.4. Altitude and flight conditions.
          6.37.2.3.5. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
          6.37.2.3.6. Qualification of PIC.
          6.37.2.3.7. Planned landing base.
          6.37.2.3.8. ETA at landing base.
      6.37.2.4. ARINC phone patch. If unable to contact a station with phone patch capability,
      the USAF has a contract with ARINC to provide this capability. ARINC has VHF
      coverage over the CONUS and Caribbean regions and HF coverage over most of the
      Atlantic and Pacific regions. Contact procedures can be found in the IFM Aircrew
      Flimsy available on the TACC web site. It is recommended that this flimsy be placed in
      each mission kit. Additionally, ARINC is the oceanic position reporting service provider,
      and the position reporting frequencies found on enroute charts can be used to obtain
      phone patch frequencies from the radio operator.
 82                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


6.38. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.39. Weather Forecasts.
   6.39.1. PIC is responsible for obtaining destination weather prior to descent. The primary
   sources are TACC Global Mobility Weather Operations, Operational Weather Squadrons
   (OWS), USAF weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV), MAJCOM
   approved CDS or FAA Flight Service Stations (FSS). Refer to the FIH for an OWS listing
   and their applicable AORs. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route
   aircraft.
6.40. Not Used.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts [Operational
Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint
Operations Graphic (JOG)] should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness of
obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations,
descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to
landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach.
       6.41.1.1. During night VMC conditions, if an approved instrument approach is not
       available, a visual approach may be flown as long as crews review appropriate VFR
       terrain charts and the intended runway has outlined runway lighting and is clearly
       discernible IAW AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 5.9.5. However, VIP crews should back up
       the visual approach with visual glide slope indicator (VASI, PAPI etc.). Use of
       FMC/FMS solution [Lateral Navigation (LNAV)/VNAV] and/or Enhanced Vision
       System (EVS) is authorized in lieu of visual glide slope lighting.
       6.41.1.2. On training and evaluation flights at familiar fields, pilots may perform VFR
       traffic patterns without (VASI, PAPI etc.). See local supplement for listing of familiar
       fields and local restrictions.
       6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
   6.41.2. Tactical Considerations. Prior to descending through a known or suspected WEZ,
   the PIC should review applicable AFTTP options with the crew. In addition, the PIC must
   comply with published AOR SPINS and airfield tactical arrival procedures.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures. DoD/National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA), NACO or MAJCOM approved FLIP procedure can be flown by USAF aircrews without
requiring a TERPS review. Any non-DoD (Jeppesen, Host Nation) approach requires a TERPS
review that can be requested through the appropriate MAJCOM TERPS office. EXCEPTION:
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 83


Aircrew using the host government-sanctioned FLIP product for airfields located in a Special
Accredited Host Nation do not require TERPS reviews.
   6.42.1. Weather. Prior to starting an instrument approach or beginning an en route descent,
   pilots will confirm that existing weather is reported to be at or above required minimums for
   the lowest compatible approach. Pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of
   an instrument approach by ½ SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach
   plate, when the runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. NOTE: This applies
   only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the
   ALS.
   6.42.2. Precision Approach Minima. The ILS or Precision Approach Radar (PAR) decision
   height will provide a height above touchdown of 200 ft or higher. For CAT II ILS
   approaches, use the lowest published radar altitude. For PAR approaches, visibility will be
   no lower than RVR 2400 (730 meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR
   readout available.
   6.42.3. Circling approach minimums will be as published for the applicable aircraft
   category. If not published by category, limit circling minimums to an MDA based on a HAA
   and visibility as indicated below or as published, whichever is higher.
       6.42.3.1. Category C: 500 feet HAA, 1 1/2-half mile visibility.
       6.42.3.2. Categories D and E: 600 feet HAA and 2-mile visibility.
   6.42.4. NDB approaches. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC after
   compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS and the ASRR (note: some airfields will
   continue to be restricted IAW ASRR criteria for mountainous terrain, landing illusions, etc.).
   Back up each approach with available NAVAIDs/area navigation (RNAV)/GPS to include
   loading the NDB coordinates in the FMC/FMS (if equipped).
   6.42.5. RNAV, GPS and RNAV(GPS) Instrument Departures, Arrival and Approaches. All
   VIP C-9, C-20, C-32, C-37, C-40 and VC-25 aircrews are authorized to fly pure GPS,
   RNAV, and RNAV(GPS) instrument departures, arrivals, day or night, IMC or VMC.
   Comply with procedures and temperature corrections IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FIH. Aircraft
   must have RNP as published on the IAP. The PM shall monitor lateral cross track, vertical
   velocity trends, IAW FCM guidance and report alerts [required navigation performance
   (RNP), RAIM or loss of GPS signal] to the PF. PF shall execute missed approach if
   excessive deviations occur.
       6.42.5.1. Equipment. Aircraft must have operable RNAV (INS/IRS) and/or GPS-
       updated FMC/FMS equipment to ensure sufficient RAIM, or appropriate level of actual
       navigation performance (ANP) is available IAW FCM procedures prior to initiating the
       approach. IAP notes such as ―DME/DME RNP 0.3 N/A‖ or ―GPS Required‖ state that
       GPS signal and aircraft equipment must be operational to start the approach. For aircraft
       where the MEL/MMEL does not allow the approach, or if the required approach
       RAIM/ANP is not available, the approach shall not be flown.
       6.42.5.2. RNAV Instrument Approaches. All VIP Aircraft and certified aircrews are
       approved to perform RNAV approaches IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FCM guidance.
84                                                   AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


         6.42.5.2.1. LNAV approaches. LNAV approaches are non-precision approaches and
         may be flown IMC to a barometric LNAV MDA(H). They may be also be flown
         using VNAV procedures to a derived decision altitude (DDA) = LNAV MDA(H)
         +50ft. The PM shall monitor lateral track error IAW FCM guidance and provide
         trends to the PF.
         6.42.5.2.2. VNAV approaches. VNAV procedures differ from LNAV procedures as
         they are similar to ILS procedures following vertical path guidance. VNAV
         approaches may be flown IMC to a VNAV DA(H). IAW FCM guidance, C-20H, C-
         32, C-37, and C-40 aircraft are authorized descent to published barometric VNAV
         DA (corrected for temp) in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) compliant
         airspace only. Use of remote altimeter settings to VNAV DA(H) minimums is
         prohibited. The PM shall monitor lateral/vertical track error IAW FCM guidance and
         provide trends for PF.
         6.42.5.2.3. RNAV (RNP) approaches. Aircrews are not authorized to fly RNAV
         (RNP) approaches until aircraft equipment is certified, aircrews are trained, and
         AMC/A3 has issued operational approval. This does not affect the capability to fly
         RNAV, RNAV (GPS), GPS, or ―OR GPS‖ approaches.
     6.42.5.3. Overlay approaches. The GPS Approach Overlay Program is an authorization
     for pilots to use GPS avionics under IFR for flying designated nonprecision instrument
     approach procedures, except LOC, LDA, and simplified directional facility (SDF)
     procedures. These procedures are now identified by the name of the procedure and ―or
     GPS‖ (e.g., VOR/DME or GPS RWY 15). Other previous types of overlays have either
     been converted to this format or replaced with stand-alone procedures. Only approaches
     contained in the current onboard navigation database are authorized.
     6.42.5.4. WGS-84 compliance. Individual country compliance with the WGS-84 means
     that the country‘s NAVAID and obstacle database conforms to the same US grid standard
     that today‘s updated avionics use to determine position. US NAS/Canadian Domestic
     Airspace is WGS-84 compliant. WGS-84 compliance is one of several items which are
     monitored to determine if a country‘s published RNAV(GPS) and overlay terminal
     procedures are authorized for use by USAF aircrews.               PICs shall check
     www.jeppesen.com to determine compliance if a country‘s WGS-84 status is in doubt.
     On the Jeppesen home page, type ―WGS-84 Status Report‖ in the search field to access
     the compliance list. Except as noted below, only those procedures that are WGS-84
     compliant may be flown using FMC/FMS guidance.
  6.42.6. Not Used.
  6.42.7. C-37 A/B Approach to straight-in landing operations below DA, DH, or MDA using
  enhanced vision system (EVS). C-37A/B EVS is approved for use in day, night, or IMC
  IAW the applicable FAA-approved Gulfstream Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Aircraft
  Operating Manual (AOM), and Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). Refer to the AFM,
  AOM, and QRH for operational procedures and limitations. For straight-in instrument
  approach procedures other than Category II or Category III, operating below the authorized
  MDA or continuing an approach below the authorized DH is not authorized unless:
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   85


     6.42.7.1. A current and qualified EVS pilot, IAW AFI 11-2SAM-CSM-DVGV1,
     occupies the left seat;
     6.42.7.2. The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on
     the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers,
     and the descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the
     runway of intended landing;
     6.42.7.3. The pilot determines that the enhanced flight visibility observed by use of a
     certified enhanced flight vision system is not less than the visibility prescribed in the
     standard instrument approach procedure being used;
     6.42.7.4. The following visual references for the intended runway are distinctly visible
     and identifiable to the pilot using the enhanced flight vision system:
         6.42.7.4.1. The approach light system (if installed); or
         6.42.7.4.2. The following visual references in both paragraphs 6.42.7.4.2.1 and
         6.42.7.4.2.2 of this section:
            6.42.7.4.2.1. The runway threshold, identified by at least one of the following:
                6.42.7.4.2.1.1. The beginning of the runway landing surface;
                6.42.7.4.2.1.2. The threshold lights; or
                6.42.7.4.2.1.3. The runway end identifier lights.
            6.42.7.4.2.2. The touchdown zone, identified by at least one of the following:
                6.42.7.4.2.2.1. The runway touchdown zone landing surface;
                6.42.7.4.2.2.2. The touchdown zone lights;
                6.42.7.4.2.2.3. The touchdown zone markings; or
                6.42.7.4.2.2.4. The runway lights.
     6.42.7.5. At 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation of the runway of intended
     landing and below that altitude, the flight visibility must be sufficient for the following to
     be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot without reliance on the enhanced flight
     vision system to continue to a landing:
         6.42.7.5.1. The lights or markings of the threshold; or
         6.42.7.5.2. The lights or markings of the touchdown zone.
  6.42.8. Missed Approach. Prior to starting any instrument approach, ensure proper
  sequencing of waypoints to the missed approach waypoint if lateral path is followed.
  Additionally, pilots will confirm their aircraft can accomplish the missed approach (to
  include holding) and meet or exceed all climb gradients specified in the missed approach
  procedure. If unable to meet required climb gradients, pilots must coordinate alternate
  missed approach procedures with ATC that will ensure terrain clearance, prior to
  commencing the approach. Do not initiate the approach if OEI performance will not permit
  safe obstacle clearance on the missed approach.
     6.42.8.1. Not used.
86                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


     6.42.8.2. Not used.
     6.42.8.3. Weather below minimums: Pilots will not execute an approach if advised prior
     to starting the en route descent or penetration that the airfield is below landing
     minimums.
         6.42.8.3.1. If a pilot starts the published approach, (an en route descent to an
         approach may be considered a published approach), and subsequently determines the
         weather is below minimums, the pilot must not deviate from the last ATC clearance
         until obtaining a new or amended clearance. The pilot may elect to:
         6.42.8.3.2. Request clearance to a holding fix or alternate, as applicable.
         6.42.8.3.3. Continue the approach as published to the missed approach point and
         land, if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway
         environment is in sight.
         6.42.8.3.4. Established on a Segment of the Approach. If established on a segment
         of the approach or being radar vectored to final approach and the weather is reported
         or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing
         the approach to the MAP/DA/DH. If deciding to abandon the approach, level off (or
         descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure). Comply
         with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received.
         6.42.8.3.5. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the aircraft is in a
         position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight.
         6.42.8.3.6. If the approach is continued, PICs will ensure sufficient fuel is available
         to complete the approach and missed approach and proceed to a suitable alternate
         with normal fuel reserves.
         6.42.8.3.7. CAT II/III approaches will not be continued if weather is reported below
         CAT II/III minimums.
         6.42.8.3.8. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is
         below designated minimums and for initiating proper clearance requests.
  6.42.9. CAT II/III Procedures. Special aircraft and aircrew training required. Refer to AFI
  11-217V1, Chapter 19 and appropriate FCM for CAT II/III ILS information.
     6.42.9.1. CAT II minimum RVR of 1200 ft (350 meters).
     6.42.9.2. CAT II minimums based on a HAT no lower than 100 ft.
     6.42.9.3. CAT II approaches without radio altimeter (RA) setting for DH are authorized.
     In this case IAP statement ―RA NA‖ denotes irregular terrain changes that affect RA.
     Utilize barometric DH and inner marker if approved on the IAP. If inner marker is
     inoperative, CAT II approaches are not authorized.
     6.42.9.4. CAT I ILS procedures will be used when unable to use alternate FCM guidance
     for local barometric DA(H) procedures.
     6.42.9.5. CAT IIIA minimum RVR of 700 ft (200 meters).
     6.42.9.6. CAT IIIB minimum RVR of 150 ft (50 meters).
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   87


       6.42.9.7. Use Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS) lighting (if
       available) at destination and taxi route.
   6.42.10. Computed Microwave Landing System (MLS) Approaches. Aircrews will not fly
   computed MLS approaches unless authorized by the FCM.
6.43. Tactical Arrivals. If ingressing a WEZ and/or an airfield with known or suspected
threats, review applicable AFTTPs and published airfield tactical arrival procedures with the
crew.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. Notify the airfield selected for an emergency diversion as soon
as possible to allow maximum time to prepare the required assistance or services. ARTCC and
C2 centers will assist the PIC as necessary in notifying the appropriate agencies.
   6.44.1. Over-Flying Scheduled Refueling Stops. Before offering to over fly scheduled
   refueling stops, the PIC must consider all consequences that may arise. As a minimum,
   coordination with the contact, final arrival airport, over flight windows and greeting parties
   must be considered. Optimally the option of over-flying refueling stops should be
   coordinated with the contact and C2 through appropriate channels prior to departing home
   station.
6.45. Maintenance Debrief. Complete the AFTO 781, ARMS Flight and Mission Data Report,
after each flight. After landing, crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of
the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required.
Crewmembers are also responsible for documenting cosmetic faults on the aircraft to ensure
maintenance is aware of the flaw. See local maintenance debrief policies in local supplement of
this AFI.
6.46. Customs and Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations:
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of all aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When staff support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the
       PIC. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to other designated crewmembers,
       but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the
       following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
          when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crew members and passengers have current record of immunization.
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the US through an airport where border clearance
          can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (FCG and paragraph 6.47. of this AFI).
88                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry:
     6.46.2.1. En route, the FA or designated crewmember will distribute personal customs
     declarations to all passengers and crew members. The FA or designated crewmember
     will also brief passengers and crew members on customs regulations, and prepare and
     compile necessary border clearance forms for the FA‘s signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency or airfield contact at the base of intended
     landing of any change in ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as
     possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft
     (which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceed to another location
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the off-load station and saves intermediate
     off-loading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling
     C2 center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers or crew members unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and
     property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
     designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all
     landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers,
     and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of US aircraft by foreign officials:
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, chapter
     6, section G. In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from
     searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign
     officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of and adhere to any specific FCG provisions
     for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures:
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters or the
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   89


          appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the
          foreign request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions.
          6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
          notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
          indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
          time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
          so.
          6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
          way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
          being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
          appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
          physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
          and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
          authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
       6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
       Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to AFJI
   48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, FCG, or as directed by higher
   headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form (CF) 7507, or on forms provided by the
   country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on-board. The only
   exception is when the FCG mandates it.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Use the following guidelines:
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
          use, spray prior to boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
          minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
       6.47.1.2. Spraying Times. Spray the aircraft for the following times unless longer
       periods are specified for the country being transited:

   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, base operations, or airport manager of the
   situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation or to deplane the minimum number of crewmembers required for
   block-in duties. Do not on-load or off-load cargo or passengers until the inspection is
   satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Object Response. If a dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify the Current Operations or SOC and the controlling agency as soon as
   practical; includes routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify unit safety and maintenance at the next station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). If involved in a
mishap or incident, after landing and terminating the emergency, open the CVR and FDR power
circuit breakers.
   6.49.1. FDR and CVR systems, if installed, should be operative prior to departure and
   operated continuously from the start of the takeoff roll until the aircraft has completed
   landing roll at destination. If en route failure occurs, continue the mission to a station where
   adequate repairs can be made. If involved in a mishap or incident, open the CVR and FDR
   power circuit breaker after landing and after terminating the emergency. CVR recordings are
   considered factual and the transcript is not a privileged document. The actual aircrew voices
   on the tape should be considered protected under the Privacy Act. See AFI 91-204, Safety
   Investigations and Reports.
6.50. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or designated
representative will:
   6.50.1. Prior to departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or remainder
   of the mission are aboard the aircraft. Review applicable leased aircraft procedures.
   6.50.2. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO 46, Pre-positioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and life support and survival equipment have been certified as installed
   by aircrew life support and that configuration documents match mission requirements.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 91


   Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-water missions
   carrying children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.       Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO 781 entry for equipment found missing. Additionally, ensure
       equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the AFTO
       781.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF 4076 and AFTO 46 in the next vacant column, by indicating the
       quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above
       the check number of that column.
       6.50.4.3. Leave AF 4076 and AFTO 46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route
       crew change.
       6.50.4.4. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.5. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.6. When possible, advise MAJCOM Stan/Eval (or airport management) before
       mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF 4076 and AFTO 46, annotate the total quantity in the next vacant
   column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the on-board contact
officer.
   6.51.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
   PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
   passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). PICs are encouraged to release
   maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
       6.51.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency (typically a
       government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the aircraft. Space
       available passengers on revenue missions must be approved in advance by
       USAF/CVAM/AMD/JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using agency contact officer
       through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper funding and reimbursement.
       Consult CVAM/AMD/JOSAC to determine mission revenue status if in doubt.
       Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
       6.51.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally not
       be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express permission of
       HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the aircraft, which may
       include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary to move aircrew
       members or support personnel on White House support mission aircraft, the WHMO will
       be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and CVAM. On de-positioning
 92                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       legs space available passengers will usually be permitted if the aircraft is no longer
       required to maintain an upgraded security status.
       6.51.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
       being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable route,
       depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer releases seats,
       aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability for the passengers
       is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will ensure passengers
       understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to boarding.
       6.51.1.4. Anti-hijacking Inspections. Board space available passengers only after anti-
       hijacking inspections are completed. If a space available seat release is anticipated at an
       en route station, the local passenger service facility will be advised of the inspection
       requirement. Procedures for anti-hijacking inspections by the aircrew at stations without
       a military passenger service facility are specified in chapter 13. The PIC has final
       authority for accepting space available passengers.
   6.51.2. Passenger Boarding. On all missions operating without security guards, the first FA
   will ensure that all passengers are listed on the passenger manifest prior to boarding the
   aircraft. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer will be responsible for greeting and checking
   passengers on the C-20/C-37. Passengers will be greeted and checked at the bottom of the
   steps. The PIC or the mission escort officer must clear any passengers not listed on the
   manifest prior to entering the aircraft. This task will be completed at the beginning of each
   mission and any time passengers have to re-board the aircraft.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting strange airfields or airfields where conditions
may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight or ground
incident, the PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the
controlling C2 center and parent MAJCOM safety office for further instructions.
6.54. No Show Passenger Baggage. Unclaimed passenger baggage and untagged baggage will
be subject to search and seizure. Under no circumstances will it be allowed on the aircraft.
Tagged but no-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be
downloaded prior to departure. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage except IAW
AMCI 24-101.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP GP section 6 for more
information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.56. Operations at Airports Above 10,000’ MSL. Use approved FCM procedures and the
following aircrew procedures for operations at airports above 10,000‘ MSL:
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    93


   6.56.1. Raise cabin altitude to 10,000 feet during the descent. Configure aircraft
   pressurization, air conditioning, and oxygen/warning systems as required and complete the
   remaining depressurization on final approach.
   6.56.2. A specific timed period of oxygen use prior to landing is not required. Aircrew
   members use oxygen during descent, approach, landing, takeoff, and ground operations when
   engines are running/checklist operations in progress.
   6.56.3. PIC briefing and passenger briefings must include cautions on high altitude
   operations and hypoxia. All passengers are susceptible to hypoxia during depressurized
   flight above 10,000 feet cabin altitude. Take your time during ground operations at high
   altitude. Monitor and back up other crewmembers servicing or loading the aircraft. Keep
   portable oxygen bottles readily available in the event of over-exertion or hypoxia.
   Administer oxygen to any passenger displaying hypoxia symptoms.
   6.56.4. Emergency Egress Restrictions.         CAUTION:        Do not, repeat, do not land
   pressurized.
6.57. Classified Equipment and Material.
   6.57.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure aircraft security
   requirements are met according to chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of
   the USAF, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information
   Security Program Management, provides specific guidance concerning the security of
   various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   6.57.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box or classified safe may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET.
   Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.57.3. IFF/Selective Identification Feature (SIF). Ground check IFF/SIF prior to takeoff
   (ground test assets permitting). IFF self-test or radar interrogation will satisfy this
   requirement. This check is not required on stopover flights if the IFF is operational upon
   landing unless required by theater directives.
   6.57.4. Mode 4. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for
   mission accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4
   (ground test assets permitting) prior to deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD
   or contingency/exercise tasking.
      6.57.4.1. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 prior to takeoff. Do not delay takeoff or
      cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area
      where safe passage procedures are implemented.
      6.57.4.2. Conduct an inflight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS
      for overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through
      NORAD on UHF frequency 364.2.
      6.57.4.3. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations.
      Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
94                                                  AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


     maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
     aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable
     airspace control order or ATO.
     6.57.4.4. Ground and inflight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are a mandatory
     maintenance debrief items.        Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful
     interrogation of the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO 781A).
     6.57.4.5. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate
     the Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Prior to departing
     for any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local
     COMSEC managers for guidance.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                95


                                          Chapter 7

                                  AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. Your mission places you and your aircraft in an environment highly vulnerable to
security threats. The importance of the DVs transported and the high frequency of missions into
civil airports throughout the world magnify this vulnerability. Positive security measures are
required at all times. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and
resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking) of VIP Aircraft. AFI 13-207, AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Installation Security Program (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM security publications contain
additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or
identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The OG/CC or above may direct the use of security personnel above and beyond
the requirements of AFI 31-101. The waiver approval authority for VIP RAVEN team
composition, security and RAVEN team support requirements is the WG/CC exercising
authority over VIP Aircraft.
   7.2.1. Protection Level (PL)-1. Presidential WHMO, Office of the Secretary of Defense
   (OSD) designated aircraft are required continuous security protection at home station, en
   route operating locations and contract maintenance facilities. Units will define RAVEN
   requirements for PL-1 missions in local supp to this AFI.
   7.2.2. PL-2/PL-3. When not designated as PL-1 aircraft, C-32 aircraft will be designated
   PL-2 resources. All other VIP Aircraft will be designated PL-3 resources. See AFI 31-104
   for PL-2/PL-3 security requirements. Units will define RAVEN requirements for PL-2/PL-3
   missions in local supp to this AFI.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101 requirements for VIP Aircraft:
   7.3.1. PIC Authority. The PIC will ensure that adequate aircraft security measures are
   provided at all times.
   7.3.2. Advance Security Support Arrangements. The PIC will ensure security support has
   been coordinated at en route stations in advance. If security requirements cannot be met
   prior to departure, the airfield may be deemed unsuitable for RON by the unit. Units may
   use ORM teams and Mission Assessment Groups (MAG) to integrate MAJCOM and AOR
   Intel/Threat Working Group (TWG) recommendations to determine suitability. OG/CC or
   equivalent is arbiter for security. Home station CP and unit C2 will assist the PIC for alert
   missions or en route diversions.
   7.3.3. Briefings. When required, PICs will obtain threat assessment and security capability
   evaluation briefings before departing home station. Unit C2 will provide the PIC with
   pertinent updates en route.
   7.3.4. Baggage Security. Baggage not certified safe for loading by a responsible government
   agency will be inspected prior to loading at the PIC‘s discretion. Verify baggage
   identification against passenger manifest. Aircrew members will secure their own baggage.
   The PIC is responsible for explaining baggage security requirements to the mission contact.
 96                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


      7.3.4.1. On PL-1 and PL-2 aircraft, all passenger baggage will be inspected prior to
      loading. A RAVEN will verify baggage identification against the passenger manifest.
   7.3.5. Fuel Security.
      7.3.5.1. Fuel for PL-1 Presidential Aircraft must pass a laboratory analysis and be
      secured until used. The USAF advance agent will obtain and secure this fuel.
      7.3.5.2. Fuel for other aircraft do not require secured fuel. Use fuel obtained from large
      capacity, high use sources not pre-designated for VIP Aircraft.
   7.3.6. Flight Line Photography. There are no restrictions on exterior photography of VIP
   Aircraft. Interior photography is also allowed with the exception of the VC-25 and enroute
   aircraft. Interior photos of the VC-25 must be coordinated with WHMO through the
   PAG/CC. Interior photos of enroute VIP Aircraft are at the discretion of the PIC and the
   principle DV. Care must be taken to remove all classified materials from sight prior to
   authorizing any photography. Specific airfields may have restrictions regarding the
   photography of aircraft.
7.4. Not Used.
7.5. En Route Security.
   7.5.1. Aircraft Access Control. Positive control of access to VIP Aircraft is mandatory.
      7.5.1.1. RAVENs control access, after coordination with the PIC, to Presidential,
      Presidential Support, and certain other VIP Missions and will accompany these aircraft
      during the missions. When directed by the OG/CC, ASNCOs control access to VIP
      Aircraft. They will positively identify all individuals granted unescorted entry to the
      aircraft.
      7.5.1.2. When RAVENs do not accompany aircraft, the aircrew is responsible for
      controlling access. At USAF installations, a passenger service representative normally
      assists in boarding passengers. The passenger service representative should be at the
      aircraft prior to passenger arrival and remain at the aircraft until loading is complete.
      Monitor all servicing and support personnel. Do not allow unidentified personnel
      onboard or around the aircraft. Escort unofficial visitors on board the aircraft and keep
      them under surveillance until they depart.
   7.5.2. Use of Aircraft Sealing Devices. Except for Presidential, Presidential Support, and
   SDSAM aircraft protected by a RAVEN, VIP Aircraft should be sealed (at the discretion of
   the PIC) during all RONs and during any ground time when aircrew is absent from the
   aircraft. Seal doors and hatches according to local wing directives. Aircraft with an onboard
   ground security system meet the intent of this paragraph.
   7.5.3. Refer to chapter 15 of this AFI for specific RAVEN procedures.
   7.5.4. RAVEN policy. Typical teams will consist of a minimum of two USAF security force
   members depending on MDS and MAJCOM security requirements. The team travels as
   MEPs and are responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, PICs are responsible for their
   welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). PICs will ensure security team members receive a
   mission briefing and aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                     97


   7.6.1. Suspected Unauthorized Entry. If the PIC suspects the aircraft has been tampered
   with or subjected to unauthorized entry, take the following actions:
      7.6.1.1. Notify the local security authorities and request a thorough inspection of the
      aircraft for sabotage, explosive devices, and pilferage.
      7.6.1.2. Notify CP and C2 centers. Advise them of any requirements for assistance, and
      give them your estimate of a revised departure time.
      7.6.1.3. If there are indications that sabotage is a definite possibility or if security
      inspections may delay the DV party, notify the mission contact officer. Establish suitable
      departure time and if necessary, coordinate suitable alternate transportation through
      current operations or SOC.
      7.6.1.4. Monitor the security check of the aircraft. When cleared by security authorities,
      conduct a thorough preflight inspection. Look for broken wiring, damaged components,
      foreign devices, etc.
      7.6.1.5. If both the security authorities and the PIC are assured aircraft is safe to fly,
      notify the OG/CC. Depart only with the OG/CC approval. EXCEPTION: Presidential
      missions may depart with PAG/CC approval. Safety and aircraft security take priority
      over minimizing DV inconvenience.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect all accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel
   wells, and cargo compartments for personnel or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. General Hijacking Guidance. A hijacking could create a serious international incident
   and jeopardize the safety of passengers and crew. High level DVs traveling aboard VIP
   Aircraft increase potential severity of any hijacking incident. Expect the National Military
   Command Center (NMCC) to become involved in resolving hijack crises. Military C2 is
   central POC if a hijacking threatens your VIP Aircraft or passengers at any location. The
   PIC is the coordinating authority for anti-hijacking procedures. The PIC has first-hand
   knowledge of the situation and must take every opportunity to keep command authorities
   apprised of the situation. Use military C2 channels to contact NMCC, who in turn will relay
   instructions to the PIC.
   7.7.2. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.3. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.4. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that the DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, the
   DoD will provide the FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with all pertinent information.
 98                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law
   enforcement activity.
   7.7.5. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.6. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.7. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation. Resistance may vary from dissuasion to
   direct confrontation, including the use of weapons. RAVENs are authorized to use weapons
   to subdue a hijacker.
   7.7.8. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.9. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.10. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.7.11. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the PIC of the aircraft and the authority exercising OPCON of the anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When VIP Aircraft are operating
away from home station, the PIC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207, as
supplemented, are complied with.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following:
       7.8.1.1. The host station passenger processing or manifesting facility should conduct
       anti-hijacking inspections.
       7.8.1.2. Do not board passengers until the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results.
       7.8.1.3. In the absence of qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC will ensure
       the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, Personal Security Details and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                     99


   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, ask the individual to:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons IAW standard safety procedures.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discussion through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. To counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, delay movement of the aircraft to provide
   time for ground personnel and the aircrew to establish communication and execute
   coordinated resistance actions.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijackers in conversation to calm him or her and to evaluate what course
   of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
   7.10.6. Never give up control of the aircraft to a hijacker.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up
with situation reports as circumstances permit. Detailed guidance is contained in AFI 13-207.
   7.11.1. Crews will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-
   clear transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set the transponder,
   or if not under radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500.
   7.11.2. Aircrews will not use the covert signals depicted in AFI 13-207 Table 2, Covert
   Signals, to communicate the presence of a hijacking situation. Code words, covert
   notification actions, and further transponder changes will not be used.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. These procedures are designed to deter
possible hostile action against the hijacked aircraft that has been forced to penetrate airspace of a
nation unfriendly to the United States.
 100                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   7.12.1. If instructions from the unfriendly nation are received either by radio contact or by
   air intercept before boundary crossing, comply with instructions received.
   7.12.2. If no contact with unfriendly nation is made before approaching a boundary:
       7.12.2.1. Maintain TAS not more than 400 knots.
       7.12.2.2. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 and 25,000 feet if possible.
       7.12.2.3. Fly a direct course toward destination announced by the hijacker, if no course is
       specified.
       7.12.2.4. Transmit the international distress signal, MAYDAY, on any of the
       international distress frequencies (121.5 MHz, 243.0 MHz, or 2182 KHz) in an effort to
       establish communications.
       7.12.2.5. Set Mode 3 code 7700 on transponder.
       7.12.2.6. If radio contact cannot be established, follow procedures set forth in FLIP.
   7.12.3. Consider the presence of classified documents and equipment aboard the aircraft.
   When a landing in an unfriendly nation is imminent, attempt to dispose of or destroy the
   equipment or material.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. Aircrews will be armed on all overseas missions unless
RAVENs are a part of the crew (not required for a CONUS depot input for OCONUS units).
Units will establish which crewmembers will be armed in their supplement to this AFI. All
crewmembers should know who is armed. Arm aircrews on CONUS missions only when
directed by the current operations or SOC IAW OPORD or OPLAN. Unit commanders will
ensure that crewmembers are trained in weapon issue, loading, safety, firing, transfer, and receipt
procedures. Comply with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. If an
armed crewmember must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized
crewmember using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.1. Standby/Alert Launches. Do not delay the mission to pick-up weapons. If it appears
   there will be an unacceptable wait to get weapons, proceed to the aircraft and notify the CP.
   7.13.2. Crew Rest. When crew must RON, secure weapons in the aircraft gun box with
   approved lock. Do not use local armories.
   7.13.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2 center, armories and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. When
   OCONUS, wearing weapons outside the aircraft is discouraged. Keep armed crewmembers
   inside the aircraft.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage In-flight. Crewmembers will be armed before preflight, onload, or
   offload duties and until completion of all offload duties. When no passengers are onboard,
   weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check.
   Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before placing
   them in a gun box.
   7.13.5. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   101


   7.13.6. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another
   crewmember; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to the possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual; Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's
Personal Protection Guide: A Self-Help Handbook to Combating Terrorism; AFI 10-245,
Antiterrorism; and applicable AFTTPs for Force Protection measures. The following
considerations may help crewmembers avoid becoming victims of terrorism when operating
OCONUS:
   7.14.1. Personal Conduct. Crews must realize their conduct can make them a target for
   individuals dissatisfied with US foreign involvement in their national affairs. Local foreign
   nationals may or may not condone a military presence - crew conduct will be watched and
   judged. Therefore, utilize the following:
       7.14.1.1. Maintain good military bearing both on and off duty.
       7.14.1.2. Avoid dressing in clothes that highlight the fact you are an American, i.e.
       cowboy hats, wide belt buckles, shirts with pro-American slogans, etc.
       7.14.1.3. Do not wear clothing displaying profanity.
       7.14.1.4. Know where ―off limits‖ areas are and avoid them.
       7.14.1.5. When possible, travel in groups of two or more.
       7.14.1.6. Avoid demonstrations for any cause.
       7.14.1.7. Avoid discussion of politics.
       7.14.1.8. Avoid using ranks or titles in public places.
   7.14.2. Ground transportation security. When traveling to and from billeting, messing
   facilities, etc. consider the following to minimize drawing attention to yourself as a potential
   target:
       7.14.2.1. If possible, consider not using a car that announces government ownership.
       7.14.2.2. Park in well-lighted areas.
       7.14.2.3. Always lock your car. If possible, do not leave it on the street overnight.
       7.14.2.4. Avoid isolated roads and dark alleys.
   7.14.3. Personal Identification. Consider the following actions to avoid advertising the fact
   you are an American:
       7.14.3.1. Avoid military style luggage such as B-4 bags and duffel bags with military
       logos, etc. Luggage tags should be nondescript and not reflect the type of mission (e.g.
       no souvenir luggage tags from previous VIP Missions). All bags, including hand-carried
       bags, will have luggage tags.
       7.14.3.2. Consider placing your official passport and related documents such as military
       ID, flight orders, dog tags in your hand-carried luggage and not in your wallet or purse.
 102                                                         AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       7.14.3.3. Wear     conservative   styled   civilian    clothing   when   using commercial
       transportation.
   7.14.4. Hotel Security. When billeted in commercial hotels, crews need to be aware of the
   following:
       7.14.4.1. If possible, obtain rooms between the second and sixth floors.
       7.14.4.2. Always lock interior locks when occupying rooms.
       7.14.4.3. Always assume your room is monitored and avoid viewing or discussing
       classified material.
       7.14.4.4. Sanitized crew lists with names only should be used to record room numbers.
       7.14.4.5. At no time should the crew orders be given to hotel registration clerks.
       7.14.4.6. Orders, itineraries, or other mission related materials should not be left in clear
       view in hotel rooms.
       7.14.4.7. Avoid home station addresses on hotel registrations and baggage tags.
7.15. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. The PIC is responsible for protection of
classified materials aboard their aircraft. The CSO, if available, is responsible for supporting the
PIC with these duties. See requirements in AFI 31-401. As a minimum, ensure the IFF
equipment is set to zero before leaving the aircraft.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. Applicable reports and forms are contained in this chapter.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program.
   8.2.1. The Air Force hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to
   alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective
   action.
   8.2.2. Special Procedures for Hazard Reports Concerning Weather. Complete the front of an
   AF Form 457 and address it to the parent wing flying safety office. If a computer flight plan
   deficiency is involved, attach one copy of the AF Form 72, Air Report (AIREP) or AF Form
   4053, INS Flight Plan and Log, and the CFP to the report. Send the report so that the parent
   wing flying safety office receives it within 5 days.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF Form 651 is a tool to
report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of
AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, list
   HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. ARTCC,
   FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety allows. Include the
   following information in the radio call (as appropriate):
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,
       incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed
   AF Form 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to the wing safety office. If
   landing airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the
   Air Force base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC‘s home base safety
   office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient
   information to prepare AF Form 651.
8.4. AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet (AMC
and AMC Gained Only). The AMC Form 97 is a tool to notify appropriate authorities of any
mishap involving crewmembers or aircraft. PICs shall complete all appropriate areas of the form
in as much detail as possible.      When notified, AMC C2 agents will inform their
supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities IAW AFI 91-204, and
 104                                                        AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010

flight related documents, (e.g. flight plans, weather briefings, NOTAMs, Weight and Balance
form, etc.) for collection by appropriate safety officials.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
       8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
       flight due to medical or physiological reasons). NOTE: Crewmembers and passengers
       involved in a physiological episode will see a flight surgeon to be evaluated and to ensure
       the incident is reported in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) as soon as
       practical.
       8.4.1.2. A human factor related situation, [e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation)]. Anonymous reports are acceptable.
       8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
       suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
       failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
       penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
       substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
       report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon
       landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training and/or FCF unless the
       engine fails to restart.
       8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that
       results in an unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading.
       Enter the flag words, ―Reportable Flight Control Malfunction‖ in the AFTO 781A.
       8.4.1.5. A landing gear malfunction aggravated by failed emergency system or
       procedures.
       8.4.1.6. An in-flight loss of all pitot-static or gyro-stabilized attitude/directional
       instrument indications.
       8.4.1.7. Any spillage/leakage of radioactive, toxic, corrosive, or flammable material from
       aircraft stores or cargo.
       8.4.1.8. Conditions that required pilot to depart takeoff or landing surface.
       8.4.1.9. All in-flight fires regardless of damage.
       8.4.1.10. All bird/wildlife strikes regardless of damage.
       8.4.1.11. Incidents that, in the PIC‘s judgment, are in the interest of flight safety.
   8.4.2. Always provide your home station safety officer a copy of relevant information.
   Make every effort to preserve all mission and flight related documents, such as flight plans,
   weather briefings, NOTAMs, Weight and Balance form, etc., for collection by appropriate

   days of the event/notification. AFRC OG/CCs shall send original investigation report
   through channels to HQ AFRC/IGI within 35 days of the event/notification. HQ AFRC/IGI
   will send the investigation report to HQ AFRC within 45 days of event/notification.
   8.5.5. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
   for navigation errors over 24 NMs.
       8.5.5.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the PIC (or agency that receives
       initial notification) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using
       report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3.
       8.5.5.2. Include the following information in the report:
       8.5.5.3. The name and location of agency/unit submitting report.
106                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


      8.5.5.4. Affected mission identification number.

  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, uncoordinated aircraft interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine
  failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew member, hostile attacks on aircraft
  communications networks, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents
  to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what, when,
  where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
      8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
      Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
      of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter EMI will report
      the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A6O// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system
             function, name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system
             description. The operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile,
             pulse doppler, search, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so
             forth).
             8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets,
             reduced intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
             8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if
             known, otherwise state as unknown).
             8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
             8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their
             location or distance and bearing from your location.

AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                107


              of security clearance expert requires).
              8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
              8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
              and Duty hours).
          8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
          intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC‘s
          judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
          8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
          adversaries‘ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
          accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
          interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
          would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
          in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
       8.5.6.2. On aircraft that dial into the GNOC, CSOs must report hostile attacks on aircraft
       networks to the GNOC, where protective measures will be implemented and reported.
       Hostile attacks may include penetration attempts, denial of service, viruses, or malicious
       code. This is not an all-inclusive list.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision (reference DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel
and Services at Commercial Locations). Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) AIR card for
the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The AIR card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants
can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card. MSC can be contacted 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week regarding acceptance or refueling issues. Their toll free number is 1-866-
308-3811.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:         DoD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
108                                                   AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


      8.6.3.1. The DD Form 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for
      purchases at other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and
      place the DD Form 1898 inside the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log. The
      PIC or designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor
      insists on a unique invoice along with the DD Form 1898, annotate the vendor‘s invoice
      with ―DUPLICATE DD Form 1898 ACCOMPLISHED.‖
      8.6.3.2. The AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
      AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form
      and insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF Form 664, with
      supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC
      or designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
      8.6.3.3. The SF 44 may be used to purchase fuel, ground services and/or other authorized
      products when no MSC card contract is in place.

   authorization is not intended to replace the use of the FTD.
   9.4.5. VC-25. The minimum weather for simulated engine-out approaches/landings and no-
   flap approaches is published circling minimums (use 600/2 if circling minimums are not
   published) during daylight, and 1000/2 or circling minimums, whichever is higher, at night.
   9.4.6. Do not perform no-flap or no-slat approaches at night or in IMC.
9.5. Fuel Planning.
   9.5.1. Planning Factors for Local Flights. When planning fuel requirements for local flights,
   consider planned flight training times, planned ground times between locals, and planned
   minimum landing fuel requirements, IAW chapter 17 of this AFI. Local training flights may
   be scheduled for more or less flying time with the proper coordination.
       9.5.1.1. IPs and EPs will initiate an approach to a full stop landing when fuel on board is
       equal to or less than the amount specified in chapter 17 as the minimum fuel for landing.
       Request priority handling from air traffic control if necessary.
9.6. Operating Limitations.
   9.6.1. Policy: Unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section, do not practice
   emergency procedures that degrade aircraft performance or flight control capabilities (in-
   flight).

                                           Chapter 10

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment. If crews are not trained or equipped to operate in the CBRN environment, this
chapter is for information only.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   and radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 117


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
     10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
     attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
     at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
     controlling OPORD.
     10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
     reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
     aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
     the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
     landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
     engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors, don
     Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the base. If
     time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of
     one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
     10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
     contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
     and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
     aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
     includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
     shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
     (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
     canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
     gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
     They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
     The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
     Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
     Control Area (ACCA). (Note: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask).
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to
118                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
      to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
      and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
      zone. All pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds
      itself in need of immediate protection. Crewmembers should avail themselves of
      facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
      above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   119


      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
 120                                                       AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
   boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated
   environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                121


   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
   full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To
   estimate how much time it takes to perform a task or operation, (1) take the Task Time
   Multiplier (Figure 10.1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2)
   multiply it by the time it normally takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy
   work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour
   task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is
   found in AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Figure 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.
 Work Rate                       Temperature
                     20-49 F       50-84 F    85-100 F
                    -6 to 9 C     10 to 28 C 29 to 38 C

 Heavy                 1.7            2.1        5.0
   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.

   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
       may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
       with agent residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Figure 10.2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
       10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
       case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
       phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                           Chapter 11

                               NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. Mission Planning.
   11.1.1. The PIC or designated representative shall verify that proposed routes and flight
   altitudes/levels provide proper terrain clearance and meet FLIP, FCG and AOR requirements.
   11.1.2. A pilot/navigator shall crosscheck the CFP route of flight against the route of flight
   entered on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, DD Form 1801 or ICAO flight plan.
   11.1.3. If a CFP is out of date or not available and routing or meteorological information is
   desired, the PIC should obtain direct assistance from the CDS or IFM. CFPs and CFP tracks
   to assist in manual flight planning are available with a current account through the AMC
   Aircrew Portal.
   11.1.4. Flight Plan. Cross-check the CFP planned route against the route of flight entered on
   the DD Form 175 or DD Form 1801 and the approved diplomatic clearance.
   11.1.5. Navigator Station (if applicable). The navigator who prepares or accepts the flight
   plan will remain on duty at the navigator's station during departure and will brief the
   relieving navigator. The navigator ensures all required fuel computations are accurate and
   complete, and, in addition, will ensure ramp fuel load is compatible with mission
   requirements.
11.2. Flight Charts. Complete oceanic plotting IAW para 6.33.3. of this AFI.
11.3. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in
FLIP, and are considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, Reduced Vertical Separation
Minimum (RVSM), Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV), and RNP.
   11.3.1. North Atlantic MNPS airspace system procedures are as follows:
       11.3.1.1. MNPS standards are mandatory.
       11.3.1.2. Aircraft that lose one INS/IRS prior to airspace entry will comply with North
       Atlantic MNPS Airspace Operations Manual (as applicable) and appropriate FLIP series.
       Although the North Atlantic MNPS Airspace Operations Manual is not regulatory for
       airspace other than North Atlantic MNPS operations, it provides solid general guidance
       for operations in other oceanic regions.
       11.3.1.3. Aircraft that lose all INS/IRS capability prior to designated airspace entry may
       continue if the crew re-files outside MNPS airspace and NAVAIDs (or navigator) are
       available to maintain proper navigation tolerances.
   11.3.2. RVSM Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special
   qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for
   operations in these areas. Refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements:
       11.3.2.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
124                                                    AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


      11.3.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
      the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
      11.3.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record
      readings of both altimeters.
      11.3.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
      11.3.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
      other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
      11.3.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
      RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
      11.3.2.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
      equipment.
  11.3.3. BRNAV Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is considered special
  qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for
  operations in these areas. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. Aircraft with
  integrated GPS have no BRNAV restrictions. Without GPS, aircraft must auto update every
  two hours (as required) to maintain actual centerline within +/- 5 NM of ATC cleared route.
      11.3.3.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is one INS/IRS capable of
      updates or an FAA approved GPS with RAIM or equivalent system. Flights entering
      BRNAV airspace after long overwater flight must be especially aware of BRNAV
      tolerances and update accordingly.
      11.3.3.2. Aircraft unable to maintain BRNAV tolerances must advise ATC immediately
      and take appropriate coordinated action.
      11.3.3.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of BRNAV required
      equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV tolerances.
  11.3.4. RNP Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification
  airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in
  these areas. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the world to increase air traffic
  capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes. VIP Aircraft are approved
  for RNP, but limited to operational time restrictions based on navigation equipment. These
  limitations will be annotated in local supplement and updated by unit stan/eval when
  appropriate.
      11.3.4.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual
      position 95% of the time. Aircraft not possessing integrated GPS with RAIM, or
      equivalent system, are limited in how long they may operate in RNP-10 airspace. The
      following are RNP-10 requirements:
         11.3.4.1.1. Flight Planning. Verify aircraft is approved for RNP operation, assess
         mission impact and ensure appropriate code is annotated on the flight plan IAW FLIP
         GP.
         11.3.4.1.2. Preflight Procedures. Review maintenance logs to ascertain status of
         RNP-10 equipment and particular attention should be paid to navigation antennas and
         the condition of the fuselage skin in the vicinity of these antennas.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 125


          11.3.4.1.3. Enroute. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP-10
          must be operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be
          accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from
          ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation
          equipment below navigation performance requirements and coordinate appropriate
          actions.
          11.3.4.1.4. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RNP required
          equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   11.3.5. CPDLC Operations. Refer to applicable FLIP, FAA and MDS guidance for CPDLC
   operations. Specific operations and procedures must be approved by MAJCOM/A3 with
   mission execution authority. Verify equipment and ensure appropriate code is annotated on
   the flight plan IAW FLIP GP.
11.4. Navigator Procedures. Use local supplement to describe duties (if applicable).
11.5. High Latitudes/Grid Navigation/Polar Routes. Operations when flying north of 70
degrees latitude require provisions for conversion of heading systems from magnetic to true, or
operations with Grid procedures. Provisions for INS/IRS failure must be considered. Refer to
the FCM for specific procedures.
   11.5.1. Use of Polar Routes is authorized. Ensure aircraft MEL, performance capability and
   navigation capability exists for the entire route. Utilize all IFM/CDS functions and review
   polar route navigation procedures in FLIP (Arctic Control Area, NavCanada, Alaska
   Supplements, etc.). Follow MDS specific guidance for alternate planning and EROPS, if
   applicable. Ensure alternates qualify and are suitable for use. Comply with all cold
   weather/polar operations manual restrictions (fuel temperature, cold weather operations,
   etc.).
   11.5.2. Navigators. Backup grid procedures should be used when flying north of 70 degrees
   north latitude (except Alaska) and south of 60 degrees south latitude or where the
   convergence of meridians or magnetic variation changes preclude using true and magnetic
   direction references.
       11.5.2.1. INS/IRS Operation. Set compasses to computed grid heading in order to have a
       current grid heading available should INS/IRS fail.
       11.5.2.2. If INS/IRS fail, aircraft will be directed by grid heading until exiting the grid
       area.
   11.5.3. En route requirements with INS/IRS inoperative:
       11.5.3.1. Navigators. Comply with FLIP (Arctic Control Area or other applicable
       procedures). Check aircraft's grid heading each 30 minutes during the first hour after grid
       entry. Thereafter, heading checks are required every hour. When entering grid
       operation, apply convergence to the true heading. Establish the aircraft on computed true
       heading references. When exiting grid, apply variation to obtain magnetic headings to
       the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion data used.
       This will ensure the validity of initial entry headings and provide precise target headings
       for exit.
 126                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       11.5.3.2. Determine the precession information for gyros after each heading check. Do
       not reset the gyros unnecessarily. When precession is one degree or less do not reset the
       gyros since the error may be in the observation.
       11.5.3.3. If a grid heading can't be determined at the regular time interval by celestial,
       use the previous precession information to determine heading changes.
11.6. EROPS Procedures (C-32 and C-40). An EROPS area of operation shall be considered
to be any geographical area where, at any point on the planned route, the aircraft will be more
than 60 minutes from an adequate airport at the single-engine drift-down speed and altitude in
still air. An EROPS area of operation may also be considered to apply to over-land areas having
suitable alternates within 60 minutes (at the single-engine drift-down speed and altitude in still
air), but are considered not usable for political, military, security or performance considerations.
   11.6.1. Mission Planning. The EROPS area of operation shall be considered and factored
   into route planning considerations. Use of appropriate extended range flight planning tools is
   authorized. Adequate airfields shall be identified, reviewed for suitability, and contained in
   FMC/FMS database.
       11.6.1.1. Suitability Planning. Verify weather, airfield, aircraft systems, instrument
       approach, passenger handling, maintenance support, fire and rescue support, operations
       hours and NOTAMs determine suitability.
       11.6.1.2. Units will publish specific EROPS guidance in local supplement to enhance
       operational safety. As a minimum, the PIC must have a qualified alternate planned for
       CAT 1 fuel, and a contingency plan for weather, suitability and MEL/MMEL [e.g. loss of
       Auxiliary Power Unit, fire detection, generator, etc]. The PIC has the ultimate
       responsibility for safety.
           11.6.1.2.1. C-32 and C-40. These aircraft are considered 180 minute EROPS
           compliant. To maintain that standard, the unit OG/CC (or equivalent) will evaluate
           the MEL situation with unit stan/eval and direct as to how the route should be
           planned and how the aircraft should be operated. OG/CC (or equivalent) will approve
           any EROPS waiver, or approve a new route conforming to reduced EROPS limits
           (120, 90, 60 minutes). Unit OGV will pass waiver approval to CP, AMD, CDS or
           IFM to the crew for go/no-go.
11.7. CDS/IFM. All VIP Aircraft are authorized to utilize MAJCOM approved CDS/IFM (this
includes AFMC contracted services as part of aircraft procurement/sustainment if coordinated
with the lead command). PIC is overall responsible for monitoring accuracy and completeness
of flight planning.
   11.7.1. Certified Dispatchers are authorized to mission plan, obtain/transmit weather
   information, obtain/transmit diplomatic clearance messages, compute flight plans,
   electronically file and flight follow VIP Aircraft. PIC must verify dispatch release via
   signature, verbal communication or datalink. At locations with MAF C2, PIC should
   confirm actions with CP or AMD. Secure Launch and Close Hold missions may require
   modification of planning factors. OG/CC or equivalent shall inform PIC if mission is not to
   be dispatched.
   11.7.2. Messages. CDS Dispatchers are not authorized to send official AMHS messages.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              127


     11.7.2.1. Close Hold. Units may further restrict CDS activities to accommodate
     sensitive missions. In such cases, the unit will perform flight planning and dispatch
     services.
  11.7.3. Dip Clearances. Dispatchers may obtain diplomatic clearances. PIC‘s are
  responsible for overall border clearance, approval authority for flight plans and country
  clearance. Verify flight plan annotates appropriate diplomatic clearances for border
  clearance and safe passage.
  11.7.4. Datalink. Use of HF and VHF datalink is approved for enroute dispatch and C2
  capability. Dispatchers shall notify PIC of updated alternates and weather prior to obtaining
  clearances (departure, oceanic, approach). In any case, PICs, Navigators or FEs should
  update enroute alternate weather prior to oceanic entry point via any means (HF or datalink).
  MDS specific EROPS may dictate further oceanic restrictions. OG/CCs (or equivalent) are
  waiver authority for dispatch relief for EROPS. In these cases, dispatchers should contact
  crew by any/all means for all planning problems or changes. If not able to contact the crew,
  CDS/IFM must notify ARTCC, unit C2, CP or AMD to pass information to the aircraft.
     11.7.4.1. CPDLC. MAJCOM authorized users may use flight following and oceanic
     clearance release procedures via ATC datalink. Ensure appropriate ATS log-on
     procedures are followed (Pacific Operations Manual, CNS/ATM Asia, etc). Initiate HF
     communication (typically 15-45 minutes prior to entry) and establish log on
     communication. Ensure log on is accepted and advise ATC via HF voice if
     communication is not established. Minimize the use of free text messages. Maintain log
     of ATC datalink communications and retain with post mission paperwork at unit
     stan/eval IAW unit procedures.

12.1. General. This chapter outlines additional procedures not in the FCM for FEs.
12.2. Responsibilities. The first FE is responsible for the condition of the aircraft, keeps the
PIC informed at all times of changes in aircraft status. FEs will supervise or perform aircraft
servicing and maintenance at en route stations as required to maintain aircraft in a mission-
capable condition. VC-25 FEs supervise the crew chief on missions and lend assistance when
required. At the end of each flight, the FE will police the flight deck if there is no CSO onboard.
12.3. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols in the AFTO 781A. IAW TO00-20-1, when
authorized by the home station maintenance group commander and contracted logistics support
(CLS) agreement, FEs are authorized to clear red X write-ups.
12.4. Refueling and Defueling.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling and Defueling. Qualified FEs are authorized to refuel or de-fuel
   their aircraft. Comply with the appropriate dash-2 aircraft TOs, FCMs/Ground Servicing
   Guides and TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding.
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous refueling or de-fueling while
   maintenance operations are being performed is authorized according to TO 00-25-172.
   NOTE: During concurrent servicing for C-9 operations, three way interphone contact will be
   established between a pilot or other qualified crewmember in the cockpit, fuel servicing
   crewmember located at the Single Point Refueling (SPR) panel [who may act as Concurrent
   Servicing Supervisor (CSS)], and safety observer located forward of the nose area (e.g. Pilot,
   FA, CSO). If interphone communication cannot be established/maintained, an alternate
   means of communication must be found before refueling may commence/continue.
       12.4.2.1. Aircrew members are authorized to enplane or deplane during fuel servicing to
       perform mission essential duties.
       12.4.2.2. Aircrew personnel are authorized to conduct "power off" portions of
       inspections during servicing when essential to meet operational turn-around requirements
       (Reference TO 00-25-172, paragraph 3.7.).
       12.4.2.3. Passengers may remain on board the aircraft during refueling, provided they are
       briefed on the hazards of the operation and given the option to deplane prior to refueling.
       Stairs and exit(s) will be positioned (if required) with doors open. Passengers will not
       enplane or deplane during fueling operations unless absolutely necessary and escorted by
       an aircrew member. A standby fire truck is required if servicing with JP-4 or Jet B fuels
       (Reference TO 00-25-172, paragraph 6.10c.).
12.5. Concurrent Servicing Operations. Concurrent servicing is authorized according to TO
00-25-172. All FEs are qualified to perform CSS duties. The FE is the final authority for
coordinating all en route servicing operations.
12.6. Certifications. Flight Engineers are authorized certification in aircraft taxi and engine run
procedures.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  129


   12.6.1. Taxi Certification. FEs may taxi VIP Aircraft with unit OG/CC approval. FEs will
   receive instruction from a qualified instructor pilot or examiner pilot IAW the FCM, AFI 11-
   218, MAJCOM Supplement, and local directives at the discretion of the unit commander. A
   qualified EP will certify the FE on an AF Form 8 as a ground phase item, or it may be in
   conjunction with an annual FE evaluation annotated on the AF Form 8.
       12.6.1.1. Limitations. FEs are only authorized to taxi the aircraft with another taxi
       qualified crew member in the other seat. FEs are only authorized to taxi across runways
       at home station with a qualified pilot in the other seat (not applicable to PAG operations).
          12.6.1.1.1. The conditions for taxi must be no worse than wet RCR and at least 1200
          RVR (1/4 mile visibility).
   12.6.2. Engine Run Certification. FEs are authorized instruction from a qualified
   instructor/examiner pilot or certified FE on engine run procedures IAW the FCM, AFI 11-
   218, MAJCOM Supplement, and local directives at the discretion of the unit commander.
   Training will be documented on the appropriate Aircrew Qualification Training Record.
   Initial and recurring engine-run certification will be documented on an AF Form 8 as a
   ground phase item. Not applicable to taxi qualified FEs.
12.7. Pushback Operations. The FE (or FCC as applicable) will normally be on headset for all
pushback operations away from home station. All pushback/towing operations performed
enroute by C-20/C-37 aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-218, unit OG/OGV approved checklist
inserts and the FCM.
12.8. Local TOLD Card. The FE will complete the entire TOLD card, including the landing
portion, prior to departure. FEs will confirm accuracy of (C-20/C-37) FMS computed
performance data and complete manual TOLD card when required by the FCM or directed by
the PIC.
12.9. Multiple Full-Stop Landings. For all practice, full-stop landings, the FE will complete a
new TOLD card using actual gross weight, field, and weather conditions. FEs will confirm
accuracy of (C-20/C-37) FMS computed performance data and complete manual TOLD card
when required by the FCM or directed by the PIC.
12.10. Monitoring Primary Radios. The FE will monitor the primary radio for flight
clearances, altitudes, heading changes, and radio frequencies. The FE is not required to copy
departure clearances.
   12.10.1. For local sorties without a CSO onboard, the FE will monitor the local C2
   frequency and report take-off times, block times and aircraft status as applicable.
   12.10.2. For local sorties on the alert aircraft without a CSO onboard, the FE will monitor
   the local C2 frequency and report when transiting from each location as applicable.
12.11. Use of Second Flight Engineers. For VC-25 operations, a qualified second FE may
perform exterior pre-flight duties without supervision. When supervised by an instructor or
flight examiner FE, a second FE may occupy the FE position during takeoff and landing. The
second FE does not need direct supervision by a flight examiner or instructor during climb,
cruise, and descent at altitudes above 10,000 feet.
   12.11.1. An FF may fly C-20/C-37 local training sorties provided they are current and
   qualified (valid AF Form 8), and they have received a local area orientation briefing from an
130                                                    AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


  instructor or evaluator FE. An FF may preflight a back-up aircraft provided a MF will fly the
  mission. An FF will not fly as a member of a basic crew except on local training missions.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  131


                                          Chapter 13

                       FLIGHT ATTENDENT (FA) PROCEDURES

13.1. General. This chapter outlines procedures for FA not in the FCM or elsewhere in this
volume.
13.2. Responsibilities. The FA is the direct contact between the USAF and the passenger. The
FA primary duties are to instruct passengers in the use of emergency equipment, ensure cabin
discipline and conduct emergency egress when necessary. Additionally, FAs act as the PIC‘s
cabin representative, provide cabin service and maintain cabin cleanliness throughout the
mission. On multi-FA crews, the first FA acts as FA supervisor and delegates specific duties and
responsibilities to each FA. At home station, one or two FAs may be required to assist with post
mission aircraft cleanup. Upon completion of missions, maintenance personnel should allow
FAs one hour (C-9, C-20, C-37, C-40) or two hours (C-32) of uninterrupted time to clean
aircraft.
13.3. FA Standards.
   13.3.1. When making contact with party, FAs must wear appropriate uniform as prescribed
   in local supplement. Ensure accuracy of requirements and security of funds.
   13.3.2. Any FA approaching VIP Aircraft on the DV spot/row should be in the appropriate
   uniform. This does not apply to cleaning crews, who should not approach the aircraft until
   all passengers and their baggage have departed the area.
   13.3.3. Any problems encountered with passengers during the mission (i.e. mistreating the
   aircraft, disorderly behavior, etc.) will be forwarded to the PIC for appropriate action.
13.4. Pre-mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Contact the PIC or navigator for draft itinerary times and any information already
   received concerning cabin service requirements. Provide en route mission ice requirements
   at this time.
   13.4.2. Call or visit the mission contact officer to determine cabin service (food, beverage,
   catering etc.) requirements. Coordinate with CSO any estimated costs for communication
   services. It is vital that the contact understands all the associated cost for in-flight service
   may include communication services. See local supplement for billing procedures. For
   cabin food services, get the name of the onboard contact and obtain funds, if available (if not
   received from the mission contact, obtain funds from the In-flight Funds Custodian).
   Complete all portions of AF Form 4084, Mission Planning Worksheet. Procure needed
   supplies (food, beverages, special requirements, etc.) and retain all receipts.
   13.4.3. The first FA on C-9, C-32, C-40 and VC-25 aircraft will conduct a FA briefing to
   assign FA positions and duties. For unplanned emergencies, all FAs will act in the position
   they are assigned. In planned emergencies, the FA with the highest qualification will assume
   command of the emergency and all FAs. It is critical that coordination between PIC and first
   FA occur during pre-flight briefings to assure that clear directions for action be defined for
   aircrew duties for planned and unplanned emergencies. This includes, but is not limited to:
   egress, cabin smoke, fire, and emergency passenger handling duties.
 132                                                    AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


13.5. Preflight Duties.
   13.5.1. Perform applicable preflight or en route checklists. On multi-FA aircraft, this
   preflight may be accomplished by one FA or divided into zones, as necessary. Check that
   applicable passenger information cards are properly distributed.
   13.5.2. Upload food and fleet items and stow as necessary. If aircraft availability and
   maintenance scheduling allows, consideration should be given to loading non-perishable
   items the day prior to departure.
   13.5.3. Prepare meals as required. Focus of preflight duties will be directed toward
   passenger service to ensure completion prior to station time and not inhibited by crew meal
   service.
   13.5.4. Coordinate receipt of passenger manifests.
   13.5.5. Coordinate passenger baggage loading and security. If loading space-available
   passengers at a non-US military facility, perform the following anti-hijacking inspections as
   directed by the PIC:

   they are records, ensure the dispositions are consistent with the Air Force Records
   Disposition Schedule.
14.6. En Route Security of Classified Material.
   14.6.1. When RAVENs are carried; any level of classified material may be left onboard the
   aircraft in locked safes/security containers.
 136                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   14.6.2. When RAVENs are not carried, after each flight and before departing aircraft,
   zeroize all COMSEC equipment. All superseded keying material will be destroyed. For all
   missions, place all classified keying material in a National Security Agency (NSA) approved
   sealable bag (computer disks will be placed in an anti-static bag before they are placed in the
   bag). After ensuring that the number on the strip matches the number on the bag, seal the
   bag and remove the strip for safekeeping. The sealable bag will be placed in the aircraft safe,
   which will be locked. Material will remain sealed and locked until the crew shows for the
   next flight.
   14.6.3. The aircraft will be sealed (locked) and/or the alarm system activated (assuming no
   ASNCOs accompanied the aircraft) for all missions carrying classified material.
   14.6.4. Upon arrival at aircraft and before each flight, the aircraft, security container,
   security bag and contents must be checked for signs of tampering or penetration. Match the
   serial number on the security bag with the serial number on the strip. Check security bag for
   any cuts, rips, discoloration or other abnormalities. Inventory or destroy (as necessary) all
   COMSEC materials. If any violation of the aircraft safe or its contents has taken place, or if
   the inventory shows discrepancies, you will assume a compromise has taken place. If this
   occurs, immediately contact CP and COMSEC account custodian by secure means if
   possible. Advise them of the situation and the mission impact. If a secure means is
   unavailable, identify to the COMSEC account custodian the affected line items from SF 153,
   COMSEC Material Report in question. They will advise the controlling agency. The
   COMSEC account custodian will advise you as to the disposition of the material and what
   actions to take with it.
   14.6.5. US military guards not assigned to the VIP Aircraft may be treated as security guard
   status after their credentials have been verified. Foreign military/civilian guards fall into
   several categories. Current Operations and SOC will provide guidance on each situation.
   The aircraft will always be sealed (locked) and/or alarmed any time guards not assigned to
   the VIP Aircraft are used to guard the aircraft.
   14.6.6. Securing Passenger Classified Material. Prior to leaving an aircraft, the CSO and FA
   will conduct a walk through of passenger compartments. During a mission, if classified
   documents are visible, secure the documents in the aircraft safe/security container and leave
   the passenger a note. If the documents exceed the safe‘s capacity, safeguard the documents,
   then attempt to contact the party and find adequate storage. When returning to home station
   at the end of a mission if classified documents are left on the aircraft by a passenger, work
   with the home station CP to have the classified documents returned to the passenger (do not
   release classified to uncleared personnel).
   14.6.7. Simultaneous securing of weapons, cash and COMSEC is authorized in the aircraft
   safe if no other option is available.
14.7. Post Flight Procedures.
   14.7.1. Accomplish postflight inspections including the FCM and COMSEC checklists.
   14.7.2. Secure all classified materials and equipment. Put all classified waste in a burn bag
   marked with the highest classification, handling instructions, and mission number.
14.8. Post Mission Procedures.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   137


   14.8.1. Attend aircrew debrief as required.
   14.8.2. Turn-in crypto kits.

   agencies.
   14.8.4. Forward all communications problem logs, communications reports, and customer
   comment cards to the GNOC, MAJCOM/A6 and AMC/A6NG.
14.9. Destruction of Classified Material.
   14.9.1. COMSEC Material Destruction. Any reliable DoD member may act as the
   witnessing official regardless of the individual‘s security clearance. If the witnessing official
   does not have the required clearance, allow the individual to see only the short title of the
   document/keylist being destroyed. COMSEC kits will be updated IAW security directives
   throughout the mission.
14.10. Information Assurance (IA).
   14.10.1. This policy applies controls for all operations, maintenance, and logistics support
   activities associated with the classified/unclassified information systems and Local Area
   Networks (LAN) onboard the VIP fleet. The aircraft LANs provide customer access to
   secure/non-secure home domains and networks. The subsequent paragraphs detail the
   responsibilities of all organizations responsible for IA on the VIP fleet.
   14.10.2. Aircraft information system users are the first line of defense in maintaining a
   vigilant IA posture. Users are afforded access to VIP Aircraft information systems/networks
   based on need-to-know, security clearance, and qualifications. VIP Aircraft information
   systems users are required to:
       14.10.2.1. Protect system information, user identifications, passwords and network
       resources according to established AF and DoD regulations.

       to connection to the aircraft network systems.
       14.10.2.6. Ensure they do not use non-standard software (i.e., Freeware, Shareware,
       public domain software, etc.) unless approved for use by their Designated Approval
       Authority (DAA).
   14.10.3. The aircraft CSO/DSO are the second line of defense in maintaining a strong IA
   posture. They are also in a unique position as being the only interface with the user to
   advocate IA policies and regulations. Additionally, the CSO/DSO is the liaison between the
138                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010

                     AIRCRAFT SECURITY (RAVEN) PROCEDURES

15.1. General. This chapter outlines aircrew responsibilities and procedures for aircraft security
NCOs (RAVENs) assigned to VIP missions. On missions, they are under the authority of the
PIC. The RAVEN NCOIC will be pre-designated and will supervise the other RAVENs during
the mission.
15.2. Responsibilities. RAVENs protect Presidential, Presidential Support, and certain other
VIP missions and associated equipment according to AFI 31-101, 31-104V1, AFJI 31-102,
Physical Security and Chapter 7 of this AFI. RAVENs are responsible to the PIC, who approves
and coordinates any authorized deviations from the procedures in AFI 31-101, 31-104, and AFJI
31-102. RAVENs coordinate aircraft security protection with local military and civilian
authorities. Assure local security efforts are smoothly integrated into the total security system to
protect the aircraft. WG/CCs may authorize the use of augmentees to RAVEN teams.
15.3. Premission Procedures. All RAVENs will attend the PIC's aircrew briefing, when
applicable. EXCEPTION: When RAVENs are not collocated, ensure the RAVEN NCOIC is
verbally briefed by the PIC on the day the aircrew brief is held and that the entire RAVEN team
is briefed by the PIC on the day of departure. The RAVEN NCOIC briefs his team on mission
requirements, threat analysis, and specific duty assignments for the mission. The RAVEN
NCOIC contacts the PIC when notified of the mission and assists in coordinating advance
security support at en route destinations as required.
15.4. Preflight Procedures. RAVENs will arm themselves and will normally report to the
aircraft not later than 2 hours prior to scheduled departure time.
   15.4.1. Security Check. Conduct a complete security check of the aircraft, inside and
   outside. Assume sentry positions as directed by the RAVEN NCOIC.
   15.4.2. Mission Information. The RAVEN NCOIC is responsible for obtaining passenger
   manifests and crew orders, mission itinerary cards, en route stop cards, and the AF Form
   1109, Visitor Register Log.
   15.4.3. Aircraft Access Control. Personnel listed on the applicable unescorted entry list or
   the passenger manifest will be granted unescorted entry on the aircraft. Manifest changes for
   Presidential aircraft must be approved by the duty military aide to the President. Manifest
   changes for Presidential Support aircraft are approved by the PIC. Manifest changes for all
   other aircraft are approved by the mission contact officer or PIC. RAVENs board the aircraft
   only after all passengers and other aircrew members have boarded.
   15.4.4. Baggage Control. One RAVEN will be positioned as a sentry at the baggage
   compartment until all baggage is loaded and the compartment is secured. Assure all baggage
   is properly identified. Cross-check baggage labels against the passenger manifest.
15.5. In-Flight Procedures. Report all security problems to the PIC. When the aircraft is
transporting space available passengers, the RAVEN NCOIC assigns team members (if required)
to occupy seats in each passenger compartment where passengers are seated. Don't allow
passengers to have access to their stowed baggage in-flight.
 140                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


15.6. Post-Flight Procedures. When the aircraft blocks in, RAVENs deplane first. Take up
pre-designated positions fore and aft of the aircraft. When the baggage compartment is opened,
one RAVEN monitors baggage unloading and remains as a sentry until the baggage
compartment is secured. If crew baggage will be out of crewmember‘s control, (e.g. clearing
customs) a RAVEN will accompany the baggage at all times. If using secured fuel supplies, one
RAVEN checks the numbered seals against the documents provided by the mission contact
officer or advance agent.
   15.6.1. Local Security. If local security forces will augment RAVENs during ground times,
   the RAVEN NCOIC will brief them on their duties and responsibilities.
   15.6.2. Miscellaneous. At least one RAVEN will always be stationed as primary sentry at
   all times. Presidential, Presidential Support, and certain other VIP missions protected by
   RAVENs are not sealed. The RAVEN NCOIC schedules RAVENs for sentry duty.
15.7. Post Mission Procedures.
   15.7.1. Continued Security Protection. If the aircraft is Presidential, Presidential Support or
   if the aircraft is to maintain upgraded security status, the RAVEN will maintain security
   protection until relieved by appropriately cleared military sentries.
   15.7.2. Terminating Security Protection. If the aircraft security status is to be terminated,
   RAVENs remain at the aircraft until all passengers and baggage are unloaded and the PIC
   terminates the upgraded security status according to AFI 31-101.
   15.7.3. After Termination. When relieved, turn in weapons and ammunition to the armory.
   Comply with local debriefing requirements. The RAVEN NCOIC turns in the completed AF
   Form 1109, Visitor Register Log.
15.8. AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Consult local directives concerning completion
and authentication procedures for this form.

   16.3.2. In-flight Duties. FCCs will not perform in flight duties/maintenance unless in the
   opinion of the PIC an emergency condition exists requiring FCC‘s assistance.
   16.3.3. For All Arrivals (Intermediate or Overnight). Perform scanner duties outside of the
   aircraft (as required) during ground operations as required by the PIC. Extend aircraft stairs
   (if applicable). Deplane before DV and passengers (with the flight engineer if applicable).
   Assist in positioning boarding steps and ramps. Ensure aircraft is safely blocked-in.
   Coordinate necessary ground support and equipment for departure and servicing procedures.
   Accomplish all servicing (if applicable to MDS) and perform required maintenance. Perform
   any required inspections. Ensure required AGE is available for departure.
       16.3.3.1. For Overnight Stops. Accomplish post-flight inspections. Perform or assist all
       servicing operations. Install required FOD/dust covers and plugs IAW the FCM.
   16.3.4. If Maintenance Is Required. When aircraft parts are required, use available MSK
   parts to the maximum extent possible. Coordinate with PIC or EAC before ordering or
   purchasing parts from available sources. Always determine the applicable part number
   through the Illustrated Parts Catalog, or contracted servicing partner prior to ordering and/or
   purchasing parts. Coordinate with the PIC to determine delivery location for all shipped
   parts. Ensure home station maintenance is informed and can aid in coordination for parts.
   Advise unit C2 (CP or AMD) of estimated ETIC for dispatch release. Typically, ETIC =
   parts delivery time to aircraft + job completion time. Communicate this time to PIC when
   able.
   16.3.5. On Return to Home Station. Comply with local debriefing requirements. Replace
   (or back order) any used MSK items. Turn in all AF Form 15 and AF Form 664 to unit
   resource manager.
16.4. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols in the AFTO 781A. IAW TO 00-20-1, when
authorized by the home station maintenance group commander and CLS agreement, certified
FCCs are authorized to clear red X write-ups.

                                            Chapter 17

                                       FUEL PLANNING

17.1. Fuel Requirements. This paragraph implements standard minimum fuel requirements
and will be used in conjunction with procedures established in the applicable FCMs.
17.2. General. As a minimum, required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine
start, taxi, warm-up, APU operation, takeoff, climb, cruise, en route reserves (if required),
alternate/approach/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, and landing.
17.3. Reserve Fuel Planning. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an
alternate is required).
   17.3.1. Reserve fuel will be computed using consumption rates providing maximum
   endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an alternate is required,
   compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing reserve fuel for remote
   destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.
   17.3.2. En route reserve fuel. Compute using 10% of the flight time fuel over Class II
   airspace, not to exceed 1 hour at normal cruise OR contingency fuel as designated on
   commercially dispatched flight plans.
17.4. Alternate Fuel Planning. If required, plan fuel to an alternate IAW AFI 11-202V3 and
chapter 6 of this regulation.
   17.4.1. If two alternates are required, compute fuel from destination to most distant alternate.
   17.4.2. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In such
   situations, use 2+00 reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45 fuel reserve
   IAW 17.3.).
   17.4.3. When determining fuel required for holding in lieu of an alternate, compute using
   holding tables at 20,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight.
17.5. Required Ramp Fuel for EROPS Capable Aircraft. Block to block fuel must be
greater than or equal to: fuel required to fly to the ETP, experience a simultaneous engine failure
and loss of cabin pressure, and proceed from the ETP to a recovery field at 10,000 feet or 13,000
feet (if sufficient crew oxygen is available) using single engine cruise procedures. If extra fuel is
required, it will be added as identified extra. NOTE: If passengers are not onboard and all crew
are equipped with supplemental oxygen, flight may be planned and flown using recovery from
the ETP at Single Engine Service Ceiling (up to FL 250), instead of 10,000 feet.
17.6. Equal Time Points (ETPs).
   17.6.1. If the flying time to a suitable alternate airfield exceeds 60 minutes, computed at
   10,000 feet, single-engine cruise speed, in still air, from any point along the route of flight,
   computation of an ETP is required. ETPs may be computed by MAJCOM certified CFPs.
   Annotate it along the planned route of flight on the OPC/Global Navigation Chart.
   17.6.2. Compute ETPs according to the following formula:
                       FL100 ETP (nm) = D x GSR , where:
 144                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


                                       GSR+ GSC
D - distance in nautical miles between destination field and recovery field (not necessarily the
departure field).
GSR - average ground speed to continue to return to a recovery field at 10,000 feet. To compute
groundspeed, apply forecast headwind/tailwind component at 10,000 feet to true airspeed.
GSC - average ground speed to continue to destination at 10,000 feet.
Example: D = 1040nm, 10,000 feet winds forecast 60 kt headwind to continue, 80 kt tailwind to
return, TAS at 10,000 feet, Long Range Cruise (LRC), is 324 kts at std day, 86,000 lb gross wt.
                       ETP = (1040)(404) = 629 nm from the recovery base.
                               (404 + 264)
NOTE: The computation above will yield an ETP based on recovering or continuing at 10,000
feet. This is the most limiting case, and will ensure an accurate ETP in the event of an
emergency such as a rapid decompression.
17.7. Safety. PICs must ensure that all factors be considered when determining ramp fuel. For
all aircraft, factor in payload and the risk involved in fuel planning over oceanic and
mountainous regions and the resultant OEI performance capability during all phases of the flight.
Consider fuel needed at ETPs and en route alternate suitability. Utilize EROPS planning, if
applicable, to enable increased capability or safety in the event of emergency. Finally, consider
weather patterns at the destination alternate. If it is too close to a poor weather destination,
increase ramp fuel to provide a more suitable alternate.
17.8. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight
and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize
flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent
profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Aircrew should
employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or
jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment:
   17.8.1. Use optimized CFPs when possible. LRC and optimum altitude should be flown.
   Limit the use of the APU when possible. Delay engine start. Cruise Center of Gravity (CG)
   should be aft if practical. Fly en route descents when possible.
   17.8.2. Normal cruise speeds are as follows: C-9/C-40: mach 0.78; C-20/C-32/C-37: mach
   0.80; VC-25: mach 0.84. Use high speed cruise only when needed to satisfy the
   requirements of the DV. Do not exceed FAR or host nation aircraft speed restrictions.
   17.8.3. Extra fuel (identified/unidentified) may be added to required ramp fuel load.
   Unidentified fuel allows crews some flexibility when dealing with unplanned contingencies
   (e.g., unreliable NAVAIDs, weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc.) and should be kept to a
   minimum. Do not carry extra fuel for convenience; roughly 3 percent of the excess will be
   burned each hour. Use the following guidelines when determining extra fuel requirements:
       17.8.3.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               145


       17.8.3.2. When compressed ground times during single multi-day sortie missions
       preclude refueling at en route stops.
       17.8.3.3. When en route refueling would delay or be detrimental to mission
       accomplishment.
       17.8.3.4. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
       17.8.3.5. For anticipated off course weather avoidance to include avoidance of forecast
       turbulence detrimental to passenger comfort.
       17.8.3.6. If decompression with passengers would cause a descent to an unplanned
       altitude resulting in consumption in excess of planned fuel; add fuel to recover at a
       suitable alternate at the appropriate altitude.
       17.8.3.7. To offset increased fuel consumption due to icing.
       17.8.3.8. When destination NAVAIDs, ATC services, or landing aids are unreliable or
       insufficient.
17.9. Fuel Limitations. VIP Aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100 except in
emergency conditions. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs, the aircraft will be
immediately de-fueled prior to flight. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean
JP-8 capability to support transient aircraft. Every effort must be made not to allow aircraft
flight while serviced with JP-8+100. If emergency refueling occurs utilizing JP-8+100, flight
crews will make an AFTO 781 entry stating, ―CAUTION: Aircraft refueled using JP-8+100,
preventive measures must be taken when de-fueling. Close coordination with maintenance and
POL fuels personnel must be accomplished.‖

                                          Chapter 18

                                      AIR REFUELING

18.1. Air Refueling (AR) Limitations. This chapter establishes guidelines applicable to VC-25
aircraft and aircrews, and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other
applicable directives. The PAG training for air refueling includes simulators and alternate USAF
B-747 derivative aircraft. The use of Presidential Aircraft for air refueling training is at the
Presidential pilots‘ discretion.
   18.1.1. Refueling During Training Missions.       AR should not be accomplished during
   training missions when:
       18.1.1.1. Conditions are encountered that, in the opinion of the PIC, result in marginal
       control of either aircraft or the boom.
       18.1.1.2. Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines
       operating.
   18.1.2. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots must notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used. If the tanker copilot is required to fly autopilot-off for training,
   unqualified receiver pilots will not fly the aircraft. Tanker pilots must notify the receiver
   when copilot autopilot-off training is conducted and receive confirmation that the receiver
   pilot flying the aircraft is qualified.
   18.1.3. AR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. AR will not be conducted
   after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability.     EXCEPTION: Fuel emergency
   situation. NOTE: When conducting AR without tanker automatic disconnect capability,
   limit contacts to the minimum number necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not
   accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or practice emergency separations while in the
   contact position.
   18.1.4. Override Boom Latching. This is an emergency procedure. Tanker automatic
   disconnect limits and tanker normal and manual disconnect capability is inoperative. If
   approved, use of this procedure will be authorized in the mission directive. NOTE: Boom
   operator and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives
   and checklists when making AR contacts using emergency boom latching procedures.
   18.1.5. Reverse AR procedures can be accomplished for operational necessity only.
   18.1.6. Practice Emergency Separations:
       18.1.6.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
       Coordination must include when the separation will occur and who will give the
       command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone
       with the boom operator.
       18.1.6.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver‘s AR system
       must be in normal, and a boom operator disconnect capability with the receiver must
       exist.
 148                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


       18.1.6.3. Practice emergency separations will not be accomplished with passengers on
       board unless passengers are seated with seat belts fastened.
   18.1.7. Receiver AR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes copilots, AC
   upgrade candidates and ACs refueling from the right seat). In-flight training will be
   accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following procedures apply:
       18.1.7.1. The receiver pilot must inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker.
       The boom operator operating the boom controls must be qualified for the applicable
       category receiver. (This restriction does not apply during school house training provided
       the student boom operator is under direct instructor supervision.)
       18.1.7.2. If the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker copilot will not fly the aircraft. (This
       restriction does not apply during school house training provided the student receiver pilot
       and the student tanker copilot are under direct IP supervision.)
       18.1.7.3. For receiver pilot initial qualification or re-qualification, the receiver
       instructor/examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the
       controls through all phases of the refueling from pre-contact until post air refueling.
   18.1.8. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at least
   the pre-contact position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor pilot.
   18.1.9. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the
   tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker until
   the seat change is completed.
   18.1.10. When conducting AR behind a KC-135, tanker disconnect capability must be
   demonstrated by a boom operator initiated disconnect prior to conducting a limit
   demonstration or a practice emergency separation from the contact position.
   18.1.11. Weather Limitations.
       18.1.11.1. Turbulence: Do not launch if severe turbulence is forecast on the refueling
       track. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       18.1.11.2. Visibility: Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for receiver or tanker cell
       formations) unless you have visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-
       flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.
       18.1.11.3. Recovery airfield must meet the weather criteria of AFI 11-202V3 for
       alternate airports.
18.2. Not Used.
18.3. Not Used.
18.4. Not Used.
18.5. Receiver Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
   18.5.1. Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater
   than 3 miles.
   18.5.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the
   aerial refueling block altitude and cleared to the AR frequency by ATC.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    149


18.6. ATC Clearance.
   18.6.1. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV). Air refueling operations normally are done on
   tracks or anchor areas published in the DoD FLIP. Certain missions or operational
   considerations may require air refueling operations in areas not published in FLIP in which
   an ALTRV is often used.
      18.6.1.1. An ALTRV may include all, a portion, or portions of a published route. On
      operational missions, an ALTRV is usually provided for the refueling portions of the
      route. In some cases, an ALTRV is provided from the point of departure to a specified
      point short of the destination.
      18.6.1.2. Aircraft operating on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and
      areas specified. Actual fix timing will not exceed 10 minutes from ALTRV estimates;
      otherwise the ALTRV will be canceled by ATC.
      18.6.1.3. The mission must be airborne within a certain time period. The end of this
      period is the assigned ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not Airborne (AVANA) time. This
      ensures separation between aircraft. Unless otherwise specified, AVANA is 1 hour after
      ALTRV published departure time.
      18.6.1.4. If a mission is delayed beyond AVANA, rescheduling normally is by 24hour
      increments based on the original departure time. It may be less provided the Central
      Altitude Reservation Facility and affected ATC agencies concur.
      18.6.1.5. An ALTRV does not preclude ATC from using ALTRV airspace provided
      standard separation is applied between all aircraft.
   18.6.2. ALTRV Format. See FAA 7610.4H, Special Military Operations.
   18.6.3. Filing:
      18.6.3.1. An ALTRV approval includes a complete description of the route, including
      altitudes to be flown. When filing a DD Form 175, you do not need to repeat this in the
      route of flight portion of the flight plan. When filing a DD Form 1801, this information
      is repeated in the route of flight portion. In either case, include the term ALTRV plus the
      nickname/code name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan.
      18.6.3.2. If the ALTRV is to a point short of destination, the route of flight after the
      ALTRV must be identified on the flight plan. To complete the route of flight portion of
      the flight plan, identify the ALTRV as before, immediately followed by end ALTRV
      coordinates or fix, and a subsequent route description.
18.7. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AR shall continue flight IAW the following procedures:
   18.7.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   18.7.2. Aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit
   the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of
   the flight and proceed IAW "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR" set forth in
   the FIH.
 150                                                    AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


18.8. MARSA (M ilitary Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft)--Applicability
for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises
ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized term. If in doubt as to
what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is responsible for, query the
tanker and/or controlling agency.
   18.8.1. If MARSA has not been accepted by the tanker before the receiver reaching the air
   refueling initial point (ARIP), the receiver may be required to hold at the ARIP.
   18.8.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   18.8.3. Upon completion of the rendezvous, receiver aircraft will remain within 3 miles of
   the tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   18.8.4. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established, ATC accepts
   control at end of refueling and ATC advises ―MARSA is terminated.‖

                                TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT

NOTE: Certain technical information was intentionally omitted or generalized to keep this
chapter unclassified. Users should be aware that written additions to any portion of this
document could cause it to become classified.


19.1. General. Each unit will have a tactics ground training program tailored to the unit‘s
combat taskings. Using a building block approach, the ground tactical training program forms
the base of the unit‘s tactics program. Each unit‘s tactics ground training program may be
different due to differences between unit mission taskings and MDS capabilities and equipment.
19.2. Responsibilities. The tactics ground training program will be a coordinated effort
between unit tactics, intelligence, training, stan/eval and plans offices in order to ensure that
continuity and the unit‘s specific mission taskings are addressed. The program is the
responsibility of the squadron commander and is managed by the unit tactics officer.
   19.2.1. Unit Tactics Officer. Responsible for the development, maintenance, and currency
   of the instructional materials used in the tactical training of aircrew. Responsible for
   ensuring motivated, informed, and credible instructors administer these materials. The
   tactics officer ensures the tactics training syllabus is comprehensive and covers all
   aforementioned topics. More importantly, it is his/her responsibility to teach and infuse
   tactics throughout the unit‘s operations. This is primarily accomplished by developing
   ground and flight training profiles to ensure aircrew members are trained in tactical mission
   planning and employment.
   19.2.2. Tactics Library, Publications and Publicity. The unit tactics officer, with intelligence
   assistance, is responsible for developing tactics, techniques, and procedures for timely
   dissemination of tactical and intelligence information to unit aircrew members.
       19.2.2.1. Tactics Library. The tactics library, unclassified and classified, is maintained
       by the unit tactics officer. Library contents are specified in appropriate MAJCOM
       supplements. AMC and AMC-gained crew will use AMCI 11-207, AMC Weapons and
       Tactics Program. This library provides comprehensive tactical reference and study
       material at the unit level. The most current MDS-specific AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3 must be
       part of the library. Each unit is encouraged to provide constructive updates to the
       AFTTPs and attend periodic AFTTP conferences. AMC/A3D will validate AFTTP
       changes/recommendations.
       19.2.2.2. Tactics Publications.
           19.2.2.2.1. Aircrew Tactics Guide. An Aircrew Tactical Guide/Tactical Flimsy
           should be developed by wing/group tactics. This in-flight guide should be
           unclassified and based primarily on MDS-specific AFTTPs.           AMC Tactics
           (AMC/A3D), acting as lead MAJCOM, will validate all tactical guidance.
           19.2.2.2.2. Combat Entry and Exit Checklists. As detailed in the MDS-specific
           AFTTP 3-3, Combat Entry and Exit Checklists should be checklist inserts for use on
 152                                                     AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


          training and operational missions into simulated or actual threat environments.
          Expanded Combat Entry and Exit Checklists with detailed explanations/instructions
          should be included in the Aircrew Tactics Guide for in-flight reference. In the
          absence of specific directives, the Combat Entry Checklist is initiated prior to
          entering the threat environment. The Combat Entry Point is determined by theater
          guidance or known/suspected weapons engagement zone (WEZ). In the absence of
          more specific directives, initiate this checklist no later than 30 minutes prior to
          entering the threat environment. If the aircraft will depart an airfield within a threat
          environment, or will enter the threat environment within 1 hour after takeoff, the
          checklist should be run prior to the line-up checklist. The Combat Exit Point is
          determined by theater OPORD/SPINS guidance or known/suspected WEZ.
       19.2.2.3. Tactics Publicity. In order to disseminate current and relevant tactical
       information to crew members, the tactics office should create a variety of publicity
       sources. For example, the tactics office can create an unclassified and/or classified
       Tactics Read File, periodic tactics newsletter, AOR mission planning binders, etc. In
       addition, tactics should be periodically discussed at aircrew meetings, operations
       meetings, or commander calls. In addition to hosting the Tactics Review Board (TRB),
       the tactics office should be involved in unit/group/wing Stan/Eval Boards (SEBs) and
       Realistic Training Review Boards (RTRB).
19.3. Tactics Flight Training.
   19.3.1. Scope. Tactics flight training will be based upon the maneuvers detailed in interim
   MAJCOM-released tactical employment supplements and, once formally published, on
   complete AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volumes. Due to the unique nature of VIP Missions, in-flight
   maneuvering should primarily emphasize exposure reduction (as a function of time and
   aircraft signature) in a threat environment. Finally, do not attempt any tactical maneuver that
   is not specifically mentioned in this publication without parent MAJCOM/A3 approval.
   19.3.2. Objectives. The tactics flight training program is designed to provide VIP aircrews
   with the training necessary to confidently and successfully survive the combat threat
   environment without endangering aircrews or aircraft in peacetime. Simulators are the
   preferred medium for tactics training, but specific MDS tactics flight training syllabi may be
   comprised of aircraft-based training as well.
   19.3.3. Tactical Maneuvers. In accordance with the more specific Maneuver Restrictions
   outlined in paragraph 19.4 of this AFI, the following tactical maneuvers are authorized for
   training and operational employment:

19.4. Maneuver Restrictions.
 154                                                      AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010


   19.4.1. For operational missions, see paragraph 5.4.1. of this AFI, regarding seat restrictions.
   Tactical maneuver training missions will include direct IP supervision with unqualified pilots
   (pilots gaining initial tactical certification) in the seat.
   19.4.2. Passengers are not permitted when performing tactical maneuvers for training or
   currency. This restriction does not preclude performing tactical training maneuvers for
   currency or semi-annual training requirements on operational missions when no passengers
   are onboard (i.e. position/de-position legs).
   19.4.3. All loose items aboard the aircraft will be secured prior to initiation of maneuver(s).
   19.4.4. Crew must be fully briefed on all maneuvers. Consider notifying passengers prior to
   aggressive maneuvering on operational missions.
   19.4.5. Complete combat entry/exit checklists and appropriate approach/departure checklists
   prior to initiation of maneuver(s).
   19.4.6. Do      not     exceed       aircraft     operating      or     performance       limits
   (thrust/speed/bank/configuration) at any time.
   19.4.7. All low altitude departures must meet obstacle clearance criterion IAW paragraph
   6.16 of this AFI. OG/CC or equivalent is waiver authority.
   19.4.8. The final portion of all approaches will be stabilized. Stabilized is defined as on
   speed for configuration, gear down, on 3 degree glidepath and runway centerline. This stable
   platform must be established no later than ½ mile from runway threshold.
       19.4.8.1. Initiate go-around if not stabilized for the approach.
   19.4.9. Minimum weather for all operational and training tactical maneuvers is VMC.
   19.4.10. Do not fly these tactical maneuvers for training at uncontrolled fields.
   19.4.11. Ensure aircraft operations comply with all airspace rules unless waived.
       19.4.11.1. During training, pre-coordinate procedures with local ATC any time tactical
       maneuvers will be accomplished. For frequent tactical training at a particular airfield,
       consider establishing a LOA. LOAs boost safety of flight and efficiency of maneuver by
       standardizing phraseology and dimensions for various tactical flight maneuvers between
       aircraft and controller.
19.5. Exercises.
   19.5.1. Scope. Exercises provide realistic combat-scenario training. This training is
   representative of the unit mission tasking. Unit planners should ensure exercises are planned
   and flown to maximize training objectives.
   19.5.2. Objectives. Tactics training should be integrated into each exercise during the
   planning stage. Training objectives include, but are not limited to tactical deception, threat
   advisories, and defensive tactics. Consider the following elements during exercise planning:
       19.5.2.1. Utilize warning, alerting, deployment and execution orders.
       19.5.2.2. Theater OPORD/SPINS/ATOs should be sent by secure comm/data means
       during day of exercise.
AFI11-2VIPV3 12 FEBRUARY 2010                                                          155


      19.5.2.3. Conventional exercises should stress the ―ability to survive and operate‖
      (ATSO) in a chemical environment as much as possible within the constraints of unit
      equipment, budget, and supplies.
19.6. Tactical Operations Employment. Reference MDS-specific AFTTPs.
19.7. Tactical Evaluations. Evaluation of aircrew tactics should validate the unit tactics
training as specified in AFI 11-2SAMV2.
