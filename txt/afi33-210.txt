                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This AFI implements DIACAP for authorizing the operation of Air Force ISs
consistent with federal, DoD, and Air Force policies. This AFI along with the IT Lean Re-
engineering Guidebook will provide the basic framework of the C&A process, the AF
connection approval process, and procedures for individual task accomplishment. Compliance
with this AFI supports the following tenets:
     1.1.1. Standardized Air Force C&A approach to meet DoD requirements.
     1.1.2. Dynamic process capable of supporting all types of ISs.
     1.1.3. Development of secure, interoperable, supportable, sustainable, and useable ISs.
     1.1.4. Management of the IA posture of DoD information systems across the Air Force-
     provisioned portion of the Global Information Grid (AF-GIG).
1.2. Applicability. This AFI is applicable and mandatory for the development and operation of
all Air Force ISs, and applications with the exception of those systems indicated in paragraph
2.2. below.
     1.2.1. AF sponsors of Guest ISs (formerly known as Non-Air Force ISs) seeking connection
     to the AF-GIG must ensure the Air Force connection approval requirement is followed. This
     includes ANG ISs wholly funded by ANG.
     1.2.2. While the Air Force accepts other service, agency, or department C&A
     documentation, such C&A documentation must be reviewed to ensure that any detrimental
     impacts on the networks supporting Air Force warfighters are unlikely to occur and that
     appropriate Ports, Protocols, and Services (PPS) are available to the IS seeking connection.
     1.2.3. Joint organizations and Joint bases hosted by the Air Force with Air Force receiving
     accreditation from the other services will follow the connection approval process of this
     publication. Joint organizations and Joint bases hosted by the Air Force with Air Force
     providing C&A services will follow the AFCAP in its entirety.
1.3. Objectives. To ensure IA for all Air Force procured Information Systems, and Guest
systems operating on or accessed from the AF-GIG. The central component used to satisfy
policy requirements of DIACAP is the completion of IT Lean and the Security, Interoperability,
Supportability, Sustainability, and Usability (SISSU) checklist in the Enterprise Information
Technology Data Repository (EITDR). This dynamic application provides an automated
certification and accreditation workflow capability. IA will be implemented with IA controls as
defined by DoDI 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation and the DIACAP
Knowledge Service, as well as specific IA controls required by the Air Force. Air Force specific
IA controls will be limited to those that only affect Air Force ISs and will be posted to the
DIACAP Knowledge Service (https://diacap.iaportal.navy.mil). Air Force IA controls must be
applied to Air Force ISs; Guest ISs are not required to implement Air Force component IA
controls.

1.4. Transition from DITSCAP to DIACAP. All ISs are to convert from Department of
Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP)
to DIACAP. In addition to the information below, the IT Lean Re-engineering Guidebook
provides additional information for systems in various activities of C&A transition. The
guidebook is available on the Air Force IA Community of Practice (CoP).
   1.4.1. Follow the DIACAP Transition Timeline and Instructions outlined in the DIACAP
   policy.
   1.4.2. PM/SM (or Information System Owner (ISO) if the IS does not have a PM/SM) shall
   submit a copy of the IS’s strategy and schedule to transition to DIACAP as stated in
   Enclosure 5 of the DIACAP policy. This document will be uploaded in EITDR as an artifact
   to the system record. If IA Controls are found to be non-compliant, a POA&M is required to
   be uploaded in EITDR immediately.

                                          Chapter 3

                                           POLICY

3.1. AFCAP.
  3.1.1. Completion of the IT Lean process provides for the following possible accreditation
  decisions by the system DAA:
     3.1.1.1. Authorization to Operate (ATO). Authorization granted by a DAA for a DoD IS
     to process, store, or transmit information. An ATO indicates a DoD IS has adequately
     implemented all assigned IA controls to the point where residual risk is acceptable to the
     DAA. ATOs may be issued for up to 3 years. (see Table 3.1. for a correlation of IT Lean
     and DIACAP processes)
     3.1.1.2. Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO). An IATO accreditation decision is
     intended to manage IA security weaknesses. It is not intended to be a device for signaling
     an evolutionary acquisition. If IA/security is adequate for the intended processing time,
     the version of an DoD information system acquired in one of a planned series of
     acquisition increments or development spirals may (and should) be granted ATO, even if
     additional or enhanced IA capabilities and services are planned for future increments or
     spirals. The ATO accreditation decision should not be reserved for DoD information
     systems for which no change is planned or foreseen. Such thinking engenders an abuse of
     the IATO accreditation status and an inaccurate portrayal of the DoD information
     system’s IA posture. SAF/XC, as the Air Force Chief Information Officer (AF-CIO), is
     the only Air Force member that may authorize an Air Force IS to operate (receive an
     IATO) with “CAT I” weaknesses, as described in DIACAP. Delegation below the AF-
     CIO is not authorized. Likewise, ISs with CAT I weaknesses, which are accredited by
     other DoD Components, wishing to connect to the AF-GIG require their component CIO
     approval, and joint systems require DoD CIO approval.
         3.1.1.2.1. Information Systems with unmitigated CAT I vulnerabilities must submit
         their DIACAP packages to the AF-CIO prior to making an accreditation decision.
              3.1.1.2.1.1. After validation of the Build & Test phase in IT Lean the CA will
              inform the ISO (who acts as the affected military commander as described in
              DIACAP) to justify the critical nature of the system to military operations and the
              necessity to allow operation of the system to prevent mission impact.
              3.1.1.2.1.2. The ISO will send justification to the AF-DAA Rep, who will then
              submit the DIACAP Executive package to the AF-CIO with the certification
              determination and the ISO’s request for an IATO for 180 days. That time will be
              used to mitigate or correct the identified weakness.
              3.1.1.2.1.3. The AF-CIO will provide an accreditation decision (IATO or DATO)
              and return the Accreditation decision to the AF-DAA Rep, who will then upload
              the decision outcome in to EITDR for continued staffing of the Authorization to
              Connect (ATC) package.
              3.1.1.2.1.4. A copy of the AF-CIO authorized IATO will then be forwarded to the
              DoD Senior IA Officer (SIAO) and the System DAA.
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                   13


     3.1.1.3. Interim Authorization to Test (IATT). The IATT accreditation decision is a
     special case for authorizing testing in an operational information environment or with live
     data for a specified time period. An IATT may not be used to avoid ATO or IATO
     validation activity and certification determination requirements for authorizing a system
     to operate. If required and requested, an IATT decision will be provided during the Build
     & Test phase in IT Lean.
         3.1.1.3.1. The term “operational information environment” may be defined as a
         composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the
         employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. It
         encompasses physical areas and factors (of the air, land, maritime, and space
         domains) and the information environment. Included within these are the adversary,
         friendly, and neutral systems that are relevant to a specific joint operation (Joint
         Publication 3-0).
     3.1.1.4. Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO). A DAA decision that a DoD IS
     cannot operate because of an inadequate IA design, failure to adequately implement
     assigned IA controls, or other lack of adequate security. If the system is already
     operational, the operation of the system is halted.
  3.1.2. A connection approval is the formal approval for an IS to connect to the AF-GIG and
  the acceptance of risk associated with the IS connection by the AF-GIG Designated
  Accrediting Authority (AF-DAA) or delegated individual. The AF-GIG connection approval
  authority shall be delegated only to a qualified government official (see AFPD 33-2) with a
  rank/grade of O-6 (or civilian equivalent) or higher as follows:
     3.1.2.1. Mission Assurance Category (MAC I) systems (see DoDI 8500.2 for guidance).
     Air Force Network Operations (AFNETOPS)/CC or AFNETOPS/CV has connection
     approval authority.
     3.1.2.2. MAC II systems. AFNETOPS/CC delegates connection approval authority to
     AFCA/CC or CV.
     3.1.2.3. MAC III systems. AFNETOPS/CC delegates connection approval authority to
     AFCA/EV or EV Deputy.
     3.1.2.4. In addition, AFNETOPS/CC may appoint additional connection approval
     authorities as needed, following the same guidelines as listed in par. 3.1.2.
     3.1.2.5. A connection approval decision is acquired by completing the Security discipline
     of the IT Lean process. AFCA/EV performs an IA review, validates the implementation
     of the IA controls, and provides comments to AFCA/CC, as the AF-DAA Representative,
     who in turn provides the approval recommendation to AF-DAA. The AF-DAA will then
     issue a decision for an ATC. By awarding an ATC, the AF-DAA ensures the IS is
     certified and accredited (has an approved accreditation decision prior to the ATC
     decision) and is in compliance with the assigned IA controls to perform mission related
     activities. More information on the IT Lean process can be found in the IT Lean Re-
     engineering Guidebook.
         3.1.2.5.1. Connection approval decisions are limited to:
            3.1.2.5.1.1. Authorization to Connect (ATC) to the AFIN/DODIN.
14                                                          AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


                 3.1.2.5.1.1.1. An ATC is granted to allow a system to connect to the AFIN.
                 For enclaves requiring a circuit connection from DISA, ISSMs must follow
                 the      DISN        Connection      Process     Guide,     located     at
                 http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/Enterprise-
                 Connections/Connection-Process-Guide, to ensure all required artifacts are
                 provided on initial submission.
                 3.1.2.5.1.1.2. Systems authorized through the AF Enterprise AO will receive
                 an ATC as the system is reviewed for its authorization.
                 3.1.2.5.1.1.3. Systems that are authorized by another AO are required, at a
                 minimum, to provide a topology and valid authorization(s) for the system that
                 is being connected. In addition, the following RMF artifacts, or their
                 equivalent, are required: Sponsor memo (for guest systems), scorecard, SIP,
                 PPS, hardware/software list, risk assessment report, and POA&M.
                 3.1.2.5.1.1.4. Both systems/enclaves involved in the ATC must have a current
                 authorization. The ATC’s expiration date will be the earlier of the two
                 authorization package dates (e.g., whichever one expires first).
                 3.1.2.5.1.1.5. Guest system sponsors or PMs are required to initiate the ATC
                 request in eMASS.
             3.1.2.5.1.2. Denial of Authorization to Connect (DATC). AF-DAA determination
             that an IS cannot connect to the AF-GIG because of an inadequate IA design,
             failure to adequately implement assigned IA Controls, or other lack of adequate
             security. If the IS is already connected, the connection of the IS must be
             terminated. All denial decisions must be signed by the AF-DAA, not delegated to
             AFCA as for certain approval decisions.
         3.1.2.5.2. AF sponsor of Guest ISs is required to enter minimal system information
         into EITDR and upload Executive DIACAP package or equivalent information to
         obtain connection approval to the AF-GIG; the IS will be tracked by its DITPR
         number.
             3.1.2.5.2.1. ISs accredited under the authority of the Director of National
             Intelligence (DNI) use the DNI C&A number as applicable for entry into EITDR
             and will follow guidance set by DNI for registration. These systems will follow
             the Guest ISs process as applicable for ATC approval.
  3.1.3. Systems for which AFNETOPS/CC is the DAA will have an ISO appointed who will
  have direct oversight and management (as related to Information Assurance) of the system
  and will perform all responsibilities outlined in this policy and AFPD 33-2.
  3.1.4. POA&M. A POA&M, also referred to as a corrective action plan, is a tool that
  identifies tasks that need to be accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish the
  elements of the plan, any milestones in meeting the task, and scheduled completion dates for
  the milestones. The purpose of the POA&M is to assist agencies in identifying, assessing,
  prioritizing, and monitoring the progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses found
  in IT programs and systems. For further POA&M information, refer to the AF POA&M
  Guide located on the IA CoP.
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                     15


     3.1.4.1. SAF/XCPPI will monitor and track the overall execution of system level IT
     Security POA&Ms (on behalf of the AF CIO and SIAO) until identified security
     weaknesses have been closed and the C&A documentation appropriately adjusted.
     3.1.4.2. The PM is responsible for implementing the corrective actions identified in the
     IT Security POA&M and, with the support and assistance of the IAM, provides visibility
     and status to the ISO, DAA, and SAF/XCPPI.
  3.1.5. AF Enterprise AO Authorization timelines.
     3.1.5.1. Packages with a licensed Agent of the Security Control Assessor (ASCA)
     review/recommendation must be uploaded in eMASS at least 30 days prior to mission
     need date and/or expiration dates of previously provided approvals and pushed to Step 5
     (CA Representative review) in eMASS to begin the review.
     3.1.5.2. Packages without an (ASCA) review/recommendation must be uploaded in
     eMASS at least 60 days prior to mission need date and/or expiration dates of previously
     provided approvals and pushed to Step 5 (CA Representative review) in eMASS to begin
     the review.
     3.1.5.3. The RMF Comprehensive Package must include the System Implementation
     Plan (SIP), RMF Implementation Plan (DIP), RMF Scorecard, IT Security Plan of Action
     & Milestones (POA&M), network topology and supporting documentation to include
     artifacts associated with the implementation of cybersecurity controls. Packages that do
     not include the required documentation will be given a maximum of five business days to
     provide the necessary artifacts.
     3.1.5.4. Authorization packages that have a residual risk level of CAT I (High or Very
     High), will require additional time to process the package IAW paragraph 3.1.1.2.1.
     3.1.5.5. If the above timelines are not met, the circuit will be at risk for disconnection as
     directed by US CYBER COMMAND.

3.2. Registration.
   3.2.1. All systems on which AF dollars are spent must be registered in EITDR, the official
   Air Force registration vehicle for ISs, with the exception of those identified by other policy
   (e.g. SPACE, Special Access Programs/Special Access Required, Joint, etc), to be registered
   in another registration vehicle. EITDR will systematically assign a temporary registration
   number for each IS until the next scheduled replication with DoD Information Technology
   Portfolio Repository (DITPR). A DITPR number will then be systematically assigned and
   included in EITDR as the permanent “official” information technology (IT) registration
   number. See IT Lean Re-engineering Guidebook for procedures on how to use EITDR.
3.3. IT Lean. The IT Lean process is a tailored version of the DoD 5000 series acquisition
process that must be applied to small IT programs when appropriate and approved by the
Milestone Decision Authority. When used in conjunction with the IT Lean process, this tailored
process replaces the Certificate of Networthiness and Certificate to Operate processes through
the use of the ATC process.
   3.3.1. The IT Lean process applies to systems in acquisition or sustainment including
   upgrades or modernizations. A modified IT Lean/SISSU process will also be used for
   commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) products being
   integrated into the AF-GIG. The requirements of DOD 5000 series; Chairman, Joint Chief of
   Staff Instruction 3170.01F, Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, 1 May
   2007; Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3170.01C, Operation of the Joint Capabilities
   Integration and Development System, 1 May 2007; and AFI 10-601, Capabilities Based
   Requirements Development, 31 July 2006 still apply. The program scope for the IT Lean
   process is limited to programs that meet all of the following criteria:
       3.3.1.1. Must be an IS as defined in DoDI 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition
       System.
       3.3.1.2. Designated acquisition category (ACAT) III (as defined in DoDI 5000.2) or
       Non-ACAT with a $15M or below – in development or enhancement costs; and must
       have a Joint Potential Designator (JPD) of “Independent” (programs with no JPD are
       assumed to be “independent”).
       3.3.1.3. Approval to enter the IT Lean process from the appropriate acquisition authority
       (See references listed for additional guidance).
   3.3.2. The IT Lean process provides a standardized and streamlined approach to develop and
   field SISSU compliant IT capabilities. The process has four distinct phases: Define Need,
   Design, Build and Test, and Release and Support. The process has five milestone reviews:
   Define Need Review (DNR), Design Review (DR), Test Readiness Review (TRR) I and II,
   and Field Readiness Review (FRR). IT Lean is consistent with the DIACAP 5-activity
   approach.
   3.3.3. Air Force IS which have not been designated as SPACE or Special-Access
   Program/Special Access Required (SAP/SAR) systems will complete the IT Lean process to
   obtain an ATO. In addition, all ISs connecting to the AF-GIG must obtain an ATC using IT
   Lean (see Table 3.2.).

      3.3.3.1. Additionally, use of PPS required for the ISs to operate through a firewall on the
      AF-GIG, will be registered by the Security Validators at the completion of Phase 2 of the
      IT Lean process.
          3.3.3.1.1. PPS for Guest systems will be provided to the AFNOC NOG for AF PPS
          registration.
      3.3.3.2. Systems which process classified information may follow the IT Lean process in
      EITDR if the actual artifacts and documentation do not include classified information.
      Users must work directly with AFCA/EVSS to address classified components of a C&A
      package.

3.4. Software (COTS & GOTS).
   3.4.1. Software is computer code that executes on behalf of the operating system, using the
   services of the computer’s operating system and other supporting software to perform a
   specific function directly for the user or another software program.
      3.4.1.1. Government off the shelf software (GOTS) is developed by the technical staff of
      the government agency for which it is created. It is sometimes developed by an external
      entity, but with funding and specification from the agency.
20                                                         AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


     3.4.1.2. Commercial off the shelf software (COTS) is software that is ready-made and
     available for sale, lease, or license to the general public. To include software developed,
     tested, and sold by commercial companies to the general public. Examples include word
     processors, databases, application generation, drawing, compiler, graphics,
     communications, and training software.
     3.4.1.3. Specific web services as described in DODI 8500.10 could be included under the
     COTS process.
         3.4.1.3.1. Web Services. Self-describing, self-contained, modular units of software
         application logic that provide defined business functionality. Web services are
         consumable software services that typically include some combination of business
         logic and data. Web services can be aggregated to establish a larger workflow or
         business transaction. Inherently, the architectural components of Web services
         support messaging, service descriptions, registries, and loosely coupled
         interoperability.
         3.4.1.3.2. Web service may also be required to meet minimum standards imposed by
         the host information system. For example, web services installed on the AF Portal
         have specific security requirements that must be met prior to implementation.
  3.4.2. All software planned for use or in use on the AF-GIG must be certified for placement
  on the Air Force Evaluated/Approved Product List. This also includes hardware devices that
  contain embedded software. For a detailed step by step process see the IT Lean Re-
  engineering and IT Lean Process Guide Book located on the AF IA COP. If the software is
  part of a system then it gets C&A through the normal IT Lean process, only software not part
  of a system goes through the COTS process.
     3.4.2.1. Applications are considered software programs that perform a specific function
     directly for a user and can be executed without access to system control, monitoring, or
     administrative privileges. Examples include office automation, electronic mail, web
     services, and major functional or mission software programs.
     3.4.2.2. Information Systems are a set of information resources organized for the
     collection, storage, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, disposition,
     display, or transmission of information. Systems include AIS applications, enclaves,
     outsourced IT-based processes, and platform IT interconnections.
     3.4.2.3. If it does not fit the definition of an Information System or is excluded by
     another rule, it is by default an application. It cannot be an application if it meets the
     requirements of an Information System.
  3.4.3. All software submissions must flow through the enclave Configuration Control Board
  (CCB) in which it is meant to be implemented to ensure the CCB has a current and
  comprehensive baseline inventory of all software and hardware, establishing a single focal
  point for submissions into the process.
     3.4.3.1. Potential Users/Sponsors (heretofore called Sponsors) of product must fill out
     the Software Request Worksheet and submit it to their requirements review office. The
     worksheet can be found on the IA Community of Practice website.
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                       21


       3.4.3.2. The CCB determines if this is a suitable requirement and forwards approved
       requests to AFCA/EVSN for processing. A suitable requirement includes; a substantiated
       mission need, available funding, and core functionality that is not already available in
       currently certified products as well as the Air Force Standard Desktop (SDC).
       3.4.3.3. The CCB should determine if the requested software is already on the AF E/APL
       (located on the IA CoP). If the software is already on the AF E/APL, then the CCB can
       approve the request without contacting AFCA/EVSN and add the software to the
       software/hardware baseline. The sponsor will then be allowed to implement the new
       software.
   3.4.4. When an approved request is received by AFCA/EVSN they will review the Software
   Request Worksheet and determine the testing and documentation required for certification.
   AFCA may request the sponsor to provide one copy of the software for testing purposes (all
   products will be returned to the sponsor after completion of testing). AFCA/EVSN will also
   determine if the product is a candidate for a certification letter. If the product is a desktop
   product that will reside within the SDC and is not part of a larger system, then the product
   can be issued a certification letter.
       3.4.4.1. If a certification letter is issued then the CCB adds the product to the
       software/hardware baseline and allow the sponsor to implement the software. Once the
       certification letter is issued the product will be placed on the AF E/APL.
       3.4.4.2. If the software is not a desktop product, AFCA/EVSN can only issue a
       certification letter. The certification letter states that the software meets DoD IA controls
       and is a low risk to the network. The sponsor will then be required to include the software
       as part of, or as, an IS and complete the IT Lean process in order to implement the
       software on the network.
       3.4.4.3. If the product testing results do not meet the Air Force security standards the
       product sponsor will be notified by AFCA/EVSN that the product is not approved for use
       on the AF-GIG at this time. Note: Even products that are disapproved will be posted to
       the AF-E/APL (as Disapproved), this will preclude resubmission of previously
       disapproved products.
           3.4.4.3.1. If the product under test produces positive results AFCA/EVSN will
           submit a certification letter recommendation to AFCA/EV (AF Certification
           Authority (AF-CA). This recommendation (if signed by the AF-CA) will be used to
           authorize posting of new products on the AF-E/APL and publication of the
           certification letter.
   3.4.5. Implementing sites must ensure they adhere to specific guidance in the certification
   letter and associated installation/configuration guides located on the E/APL prior to installing
   the COTS/GOTS.
3.5. Changes to Systems with an Established ATC. The requirements for systems to maintain
their certification and accreditation status after the implementation of a change are listed in the
following paragraphs.
   3.5.1. The system must have been previously assessed by AFCA/EVSS and granted an Air
   Force network connection authorization (ATC) in IT Lean.
 22                                                         AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


   3.5.2. The system IAM reviews proposed changes and determines if system and network
   security will be affected by the release of these changes and communicates the results of the
   IAM review to the CA & System DAA. Continued approval to operate and connect is
   contingent on the sustainment of an acceptable IA posture.
       3.5.2.1. The system IAM provides a written or DoD PKI-certified digitally signed
       statement to the CA (AFCA/EVSS) and DAA indicating the results of the security review
       and declaring system and network security have not been affected by the changes. That
       statement will be uploaded into EITDR as artifacts until EITDR is capable performing
       digital signature.
   3.5.3. Any changes which negatively affect security cannot be considered a minor change
   and must; therefore be revalidated using the Security Discipline of IT Lean.
       3.5.3.1. If the IS is an Air Force system, the IAM must notify the PM who will initiate a
       new version in IT Lean and complete all phases of the Security Discipline.
       3.5.3.2. Sponsors or PMs of Guest systems are required to initiate a new version in IT
       Lean and submit an updated DIACAP Executive Package for review.
       3.5.3.3. If a new version has been entered in EITDR, the PM also must identify if this
       system is replacing a previous version, and if so, take appropriate actions to
       decommission the previous version. See IT Lean Re-engineering Guidebook for
       decommissioning procedures.

3.7. Post-Accreditation Reviews & Assessments.
   3.7.1. Phase 4 (Release and Support) of IT Lean incorporates annual reviews to ensure the IS
   continues to operate in the manner in which it was certified and accredited. These reviews are
   a requirement in FISMA guidelines and are reported annually to DoD and OMB.
   3.7.2. IAMs will conduct a review of all applicable IA controls and perform validation
   procedures on those controls as identified in the annual FISMA reporting requirements
   3.7.3. AFCA/EV will conduct random assessments on IA Control compliance to give
   AFNETOPS operational oversight of the security of the AF-GIG. The assessment will
   consist of performing validation procedures on a sub-set of the IA Controls. These
   assessments may then count as annual reviews for the IAM, but it will be up to the IAM to
   identify, mitigate, and correct findings in the FISMA reporting section of EITDR.
 24                                                          AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


3.8. Circuit-Enclaves.
   3.8.1. As defined by DoDI 8500.2, an enclave is a collection of computing environments
   connected by one or more internal networks under the control of a single approval authority
   and security policy, including personnel and physical security. Enclaves always assume the
   highest mission assurance category and security classification of the AIS applications or
   outsourced IT-based processes they support, and derive their security needs from those
   systems. They provide standard IA capabilities such as boundary defense, incident detection
   and response, and key management, and also deliver common applications such as office
   automation and electronic mail. Enclaves are analogous to general support systems as
   defined in OMB A-130 (reference (n)). Enclaves may be specific to an organization or a
   mission, and the computing environments may be organized by physical proximity or by
   function independent of location. Examples of enclaves include local area networks and the
   applications they host, backbone networks, and data processing centers. The most common
   Air Force circuit-enclaves are base networks; however, systems that use dedicated DISA-
   provisioned circuits and in doing so form isolated networks, are by definition circuit-
   enclaves. The latter must still adhere to all DISA Connection Approval Process (CAP)
   requirements, but are not considered circuit-enclaves for the purposes of this instruction and
   the processes outlined within.
       3.8.1.1. Air Force owned and operated enclaves receive connection to the DISN via
       DISA provisioned circuits and require a valid accreditation to do so. These enclaves are
       referred to as circuit-enclaves since each is connected to one or more unique DISA
       provisioned circuits. Each DISA provisioned circuit is assigned a unique Command
       Communications Service Designator (CCSD) for identification and tracking purposes.
       Each CCSD related to a circuit-enclave must be referenced in the appropriate circuit-
       enclave accreditation package.
   3.8.2. All Air Force owned and operated circuit-enclaves must follow the SISSU process
   using EITDR to receive an accreditation which will be used for the subsequent DISA
   Approval to Connect process. The base-level PM/SM or IAM is responsible for EITDR
   registration; for enclaves without a PM/SM, the ISO is responsible for ensuring this
   registration is completed. The process for EITDR registration and SISSU is outlined in the
   IT Lean Guidebook.
   3.8.3. The Air Force network is accredited using the Combat Information Transport System
   (CITS) Block 30 gateway construct. There is one accreditation package for each of the 16
   NIPRNet and SIPRNet gateways for a total of 32 gateway accreditation packages. Each of
   these 32 gateway packages is comprised of multiple base-level enclave sub-packages. Any
   enclave not assigned to a CITS gateway is accredited on a case-by-case basis.
   3.8.4. The circuit-enclave accreditation process will utilize IA Control inheritance to
   complete C&A packages. The primary source for infrastructure IA Control inheritance shall
   be CITS Lead Command. Circuit-enclave PMs will coordinate with the CITS Lead
   Command office to obtain inherited IA Control implementation information.
   3.8.5. Unique Circuit-Enclave Accreditation Scenarios
       3.8.5.1. Exercise circuits
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                   25


         3.8.5.1.1. The requirements for exercise circuits may vary from operational circuits.
         Refer to the IASE website (http://iase.disa.mil) for these requirements.
     3.8.5.2. Cross Domain Solutions (CDS)
         3.8.5.2.1. Systems that operate cross domain solutions have additional accreditation
         requirements as outlined in CJCSI 6211.02B, Defense Information System Network
         (DISN): Policy, Responsibilities and Processes (to be superseded by CJCSI
         6211.02C). All Air Force requests to operate cross domain solutions must be
         coordinated through the AFCA Cross Domain Solutions Office (CDSO) located at
         Scott Air Force Base. The AFCA CDSO may be contacted at DSN 779-6498;
         Commercial (618) 229-6498 email afcaea3.cdso@scott.af.mil . CDS connections
         have additional requirements. Refer to the IASE website for this process and
         associated documentation requirements, as well as the CDSO for assistance.
  3.8.6. Roles and Responsibilities.
     3.8.6.1. DISA.
         3.8.6.1.1. The connection approval authority for all DISN/DVS connections. The
         connection approval process and associated requirements are outlined in CJCSI
         6211.02B and the IASE website.
     3.8.6.2. CITS Lead Command:
         3.8.6.2.1. Responsible for the design and implementation of the Air Force
         Architecture to include CITS Block 30.
         3.8.6.2.2. Maintains and updates the CITS architecture system accreditation package.
         3.8.6.2.3. As the provider of numerous IA services via the CITS architecture, CITS
         Lead Command is responsible for providing and maintaining the answers to all
         inheritable IA controls for which they provide services. These inherited controls and
         the associated answers will be maintained in EITDR.
     3.8.6.3. AFCA
         3.8.6.3.1. Is the SISSU security validator of the circuit-enclave accreditation
         packages and assumes all associated responsibilities as defined in the IT Lean
         Reengineering and SISSU Process Guidebook.
         3.8.6.3.2. AFCA/EV is the certifying authority for the Gateway accreditation
         packages.
     3.8.6.4. AFNetOps
         3.8.6.4.1. AFNetOps/CC will serve as the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA)
         for all Air Force circuit-enclaves unless explicitly delegated to an individual meeting
         the requirements as outlined in AFPD 33-2.
         3.8.6.4.2. Maintains the consolidated gateway circuit-enclave accreditation packages
         in the AFNETOPs portfolio and any portfolio management functions this will require.
         It will maintain all administrative oversight of these packages including ensuring
         updates are made to base-enclave packages and routing for validation and DAA
         signature.
26                                                         AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


        3.8.6.4.3. Serves as the primary Air Force administrative point of contact to DISA
        Unclassified Connection Approval Office (UCAO) for NIPRNet connection requests
        and the SIPRNet Connection Approval Office (SCAO) for SIPRNet connection
        requests. In this capacity AFNetOps will provide Air Force circuit-enclave
        accreditation status information, provide the necessary accreditation support
        documentation and field all documentation requests from DISA.
        3.8.6.4.4. Stores and maintains any Air Force-level supplemental accreditation
        documentation. This includes the SIPRNet and NIPRNet Air Force level Consent To
        Monitor (CTM) as well as standardized topology maps and SIPRNet Connection
        Questionnaire (SCQ). AFNetOps will ensure these documents are updated by the
        Enclave ISO prior to submitting for accreditation. For DISA documentation
        requirements unique to the circuit accreditation process refer to CJCSI 6211.02B and
        the IASE website.
        3.8.6.4.5. Ensures the consolidation of base-level enclave accreditation sub-package
        POA&Ms into the Gateway-level POA&Ms.
        3.8.6.4.6. Tracks the accreditation status of all Air Force circuit-enclaves and ensures
        a current accreditation is maintained. In doing so, AFNetOps is responsible for
        ensuring all necessary actions are taken by the responsible parties for maintaining
        compliance.
        3.8.6.4.7. Notifies enclave accreditation sub-package owners              of   pending
        accreditation expiration at a minimum of 30, 60, and 90 day intervals.
        3.8.6.4.8. Ensures gateway accreditation packages are submitted for re-validation and
        re-accreditation as a result of any updates to the enclave packages.
     3.8.6.5. I-NOSC.
        3.8.6.5.1. I-NOSCs must provide an SLA to circuit-enclave PMs outlining any
        operational network services, related to enterprise IA activities, for which they are
        responsible.
        3.8.6.5.2. The I-NOSCs shall assist AFNetOps in taking necessary action to ensure a
        current accreditation is maintained by serving as an intermediary between AFNetOps
        and the circuit-enclave PMs. The I-NOSCs will assist PMs in the development of
        C&A packages by providing any technical information necessary to accurately
        answer IA controls for which the I-NOSCs provide operational network services.
     3.8.6.6. Enclave Information System Owner (ISO).
        3.8.6.6.1. The circuit-enclave Information System Owner (ISO) (as defined in AFPD
        33-2) must ensure an IAM is appointed to maintain the IA posture of the circuit-
        enclave; this individual assumes all responsibilities of the IAM described herein and
        DODI 8510.01. If no IAM is appointed, the circuit-enclave ISO assumes all IAM
        responsibilities.
        3.8.6.6.2. Enters and completes respective enclave sub-packages within EITDR for
        the assigned gateway circuit-enclave accreditation package.
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                      27


           3.8.6.6.3. Updates respective circuit-enclave accreditation packages within EITDR to
           reflect any changes made to their enclaves.
           3.8.6.6.4. Alerts AFNetOps of any changes to the topology or software affecting the
           security posture of the enclave boundaries so that the gateway package can be
           reaccredited if necessary.
           3.8.6.6.5. Updates all supporting documentation required for their circuit-enclave
           accreditation sub-packages including SCQs and topology maps.
           3.8.6.6.6. Enters and updates DISA CAP records within the SNAP database.
       3.8.6.7. Other System ISOs/PMs/SMs
           3.8.6.7.1. It is the responsibility of an information system owner to notify the enclave
           ISO of any system changes so the enclave ISO can determine if said changes will
           impact the enclave and its security posture in any way.
3.9. Exercises.
   3.9.1. All exercises performed on the AF-GIG require an IATT from the System DAA, an
   ATC signed by AFNETOPS/CC, and must follow appropriate policies regarding exercise
   connections (e.g. CJCSI 6211.02B, CJCSI 6510.01E).
   3.9.2. Exercise requests will be coordinated thru AFNETOPS/A3 to determine applicable
   processes required to obtain the ATC and assign a priority status for security validation.
   3.9.3. Expected impacts to systems (which includes enclaves), will be coordinated with ISOs
   and DAAs thru an SLA/MOA/MOU.
       3.9.3.1. Impacts and changes are defined in a Version Description Document (VDD)
   3.9.4. Systems which are expected or intended to become operational upon termination of
   the exercise are required to follow normal system ATO/ATC C&A processes.
   3.9.5. POA&Ms are to be provided for systems which have identified vulnerabilities in
   previous versions or exercises. Classified systems will provide their POA&M s over the
   SIPRNET since classified information cannot be entered into EITDR.
3.10. Networked Medical Devices. Networked medical devices follow approved C&A policy,
including IT Lean. Changes to networked medical devices may not be able to occur in a timely
fashion or at all due to regulatory requirements (e.g. maintaining Food and Drug Administration
certification) and will be part of the assumed risk for that IS. In some cases, medical equipment
may be considered Platform IT and follow IA and C&A policies accordingly.
3.11. Cross Domain Solutions. Systems that operate cross domain solutions have additional
accreditation requirements as outlined in CJCSI 6211.02B (to be superseded by CJCSI
6211.02C). All Air Force requests to operate cross domain solutions must be coordinated
through the AFCA Cross Domain Solutions Office (CDSO) located at Scott Air Force Base. The
AFCA CDSO may be contacted at DSN 779-6498; Commercial (618) 229-6498 email
afcaea3.cdso@scott.af.mil
 28                                                          AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


3.12. Foreign National Access. Specific requirements for accessing information systems must
provided in the DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP). Procedures for foreign nationals requiring
access must also be included in the DIP. See AFSSI 8522, Access to Information Systems for
guidance.
3.13. Protective Distribution System (PDS). Communication Security (COMSEC) policy
calls for a PDS to physically secure unencrypted, classified transmission lines in unsecured
areas. This requirement must be built into the solution. See AFI 33-201, Vol 8 Computer
Security: Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) (will become AFSSI 7703) for further guidance.
3.14. Type Accreditation. DODI 8510.01 defines type accreditation as the official
authorization to employ identical copies of a system in specified environments. This form of
C&A allows a single DIACAP package (i.e., SIP, DIP, supporting documentation for
certification, DIACAP Scorecard, and IT Security POA&M (if required)) to be developed for an
archetype (common) version of an IS that is deployed to multiple locations, along with a set of
installation and configuration requirements or operational security needs, that will be assumed by
the hosting location. Automated Information System (AIS) applications accreditations are type
accreditations. Stand-alone IS and demilitarized zone (DMZ) accreditations may also be type
accreditations.
   3.14.1. Type accredited systems follow the DIACAP process as outlined in DODI 8510.01
   and requires an accreditation decision and AF connection approval prior to deployment thru
   the use of the IT Lean Process.
   3.14.2. An approved accreditation and AF connection decision for a type-accredited system
   is valid for implementation at all AF sites (enclaves). Coordination with the enclave IAM
   and any updates to all appropriate enclave accreditation documentation is required prior to
   implementation at any AF site.
   3.14.3. A type-accredited system must have centralized program management (PM)
   oversight to ensure implementation at multiple locations is satisfactorily implemented IAW
   with the DIACAP Implementation Plan and that implementation plan and any associated
   configuration guidance is provided to each site implementing the type accredited system.
       3.14.3.1. For each IA control expected to be implemented by the local enclave
       (inherited), the system PM must provide minimum implementation guidelines and
       requirements expected to be met by the implementing enclave. In other words, the system
       will identify minimum requirements for all IA controls; regardless if the system
       implements the IA Control itself, or if it will be inherited by the enclave in which it is
       being deployed and implemented.
       3.14.3.2. To ensure type accredited systems can be implemented at all intended sites
       (enclaves) using the implementation guidelines provided, the PM should identify site
       representatives on the stakeholders list and consult them during each phase of IT Lean.
       3.14.3.3. All site-specific weaknesses resulting from the implementation of a type-
       accredited system will be identified in the system POA&M. It is a programmatic (PM)
       responsibility to ensure those weaknesses are addressed/mitigated or accepted at a
       program/system level (and not left up to the individual sites/enclaves to address). System
       versioning cannot be utilized to avoid addressing site-specific weaknesses. All
       weaknesses (include those that are site-specific) must be adequately addressed per the
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                    29


       requirements outlined in DODI 8510.01 before an ATO can be issued for a type-
       accredited system and the guidelines regarding the issuance of consecutive IATOs still
       applies.
       3.14.3.4. It is PM responsibility to ensure site coordination prior to system deployment
       and to ensure the site (enclave) IAM has reviewed the type-accredited system
       accreditation documentation, assessed the impact the introduction of this system will
       have on the enclave and, if necessary, updated all applicable enclave-specific
       accreditation documentation prior to implementation.
       3.14.3.5. Each funding source associated with a type accredited system must be
       accounted for in its associated system resource table maintained in EITDR.
       3.14.3.6. In the event that the system-appointed IAM is not implementing the type-
       accredited system at the local enclave, it is the responsibility of the enclave IAM to
       ensure the system is implemented in accordance with the implementation guidance
       provided by the system PM.
          3.14.3.6.1. The IAM implementing the type-accredited system must sign a memo
          attesting to conformance to the system implementation and configuration guidelines
          and provide said memo to the system PM to file with the C&A documentation. To
          ensure system accountability and PM oversight, there must be an IAM-signed memo
          on file with the PM for each implementation of a type-accredited system.
          3.14.3.6.2. If at the time of implementation it is determined the type-accredited
          system cannot be implemented IAW its implementation plan and associated
          configuration guidance, the system IAM must coordinate with the PM to resolve
          these issues or update the type-accredited system POA&M to reflect these
          outstanding non-compliance issues as necessary (see 3.15.3.3).
       3.14.3.7. The system IAM ensures annual reviews and FISMA requirements are
       performed IAW associated policies for every configuration implementation of that type-
       accredited system. System and Enclave IAMs must will elevate any identified security
       issues to PM, CA, & DAA.
       3.14.3.8. It is the responsibility of the appointed type-accredited system IAM to mitigate
       and identify IA vulnerabilities, and report and respond to IA violations and incidents
       IAW DODI 8500.2. This includes ensuring all ongoing security requirements (to include
       items such as patch management) are met.
3.15. Stand-Alone IS. Stand-Alone systems may be single machines, enclaves, or IS fielded at
multiple locations (may be type accredited); which, are not physically connected to any other
network. Each configuration of the Stand-Alone IS must have its own IT Lean version approved.
3.16. IT Lean Re-engineering Guidebook. The IT Lean Re-engineering Guidebook is the Air
Force’s resource for implementing and executing C&A in the acquisition process. The IT Lean
Re-engineering Guidebook supports the policies in this AFI by providing specific procedures and
is capable of implementing changes as industry and policy dictate. The IT Lean Re-engineering
Guidebook will be coordinated with SAF/AQ prior to new releases to the field.

3.17. ACA Licensing. The number and complexity of ISs in the Air Force make it necessary
for the CA to designate qualified entities as ACAs to perform certification actions. The Agent of
the Certifying Authority Licensing Guide establishes processes for applying for a license to
conduct assessments and validations, evaluation of the license request, recommendation for
award of a license, and award of an ACA license by the Air Force Chief Information Officer (AF
CIO).
3.18. Software     Research,      Development,      Testing,     &    Evaluation    (RDT&E)
Enclaves. Enclaves considering themselves Software RDT&E enclaves must review DISA’s
Enclave STIG to determine the appropriate architecture zone. Enclaves which meet the Zones
A&B criteria will complete C&A using the AFCAP. Enclaves meeting Zones C&D criteria as
described in the Enclave STIG will only register their enclaves in EITDR and not be required to
perform C&A. The Zone C or D enclave IAM must ensure that technical and non-technical
controls are employed to isolate these systems from unauthorized access and exploitation IAW
the DISA STIG and CJCSI 6510.01.
   3.18.1. Zone D: Stand-Alone Test Environment. Zone D systems refer to a single system or
   collection of systems that have no network connectivity other than to themselves (except in
   rare cases where there is an ISP connection with ASD and GIG waiver approval). The system
   or collection of systems must be completely closed and isolated. There are no direct external
   (DoD, AF or Internet) connections.
   3.18.2. Zone C: Closed Network Test Environment. In Zone C, the network may be
   completely closed and isolated; or connected only to another Zone C testing facility or Zone
   C subnet. Traffic is isolated and restricted via source and destination IP addresses or host
   names. There are no direct external (DoD or Internet) connections to these networks. The
   network connectivity to another Zone C testing facility or subnet may be accomplished via
   tunneling mechanisms such as VPNs, private circuit (preferred method), TACLANE, MPLS,
   or other means of complete traffic isolation. At no time will the Zone C system data be
   commingled with the General Business Enclave LAN or with DoD network traffic.
   3.18.3. Zone B: Limited External Network Connected Environment. Zone B systems
   require external access utilizing a DoD network as the transport mechanism.
   3.18.4. Zone A: Full DoD Network Connectivity. Zone A systems require external
   (live/production) access and may mirror a live, production environment for final stage testing
   and development.
3.19. Platform IT (PIT), Platform IT Systems (PIT Systems), and Research, Development,
Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) systems.
   3.19.1. Cybersecurity risk for PIT, PIT Systems, and RDT&E systems may only be accepted
   by an AO appointed by SAF/CIO A6. Risk acceptance must be clearly documented by the
   AO before a system may commence testing or operations in the form of an ATO, ATO with
   conditions, IATT, or other digitally-signed authorization decision. The AO will provide
   specific guidance on how the C&A package for a PIT, PIT System, or RDT&E system will
   be developed and submitted.
       3.19.1.1. Normally C&A is not required for Platform IT, however Security requirements
       must be addressed in system design and operation as prescribed in Acquisiton policies.
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                 31


     3.19.1.2. If the Platform IT has connectivity to an external network then C&A is required
     as a Platform IT Interconnection
  3.19.2. All PIT, PIT System, and RDT&E systems will fall within the authorization
  boundary of an AO. The authorization boundaries will be specified in the AO appointment
  letter. In addition, the boundary definitions will be posted to the AFCKS AFCAP site,
  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFCKS/Compliance/AFCAP/SitePages/Home.aspx.            For
  questions regarding authorization boundaries, contact the SAF/CIO A6 Cybersecurity
  Division, usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a3ci-a6ci-cybersecurity@mail.mil.
     3.19.2.1. C&A packages are required for Platform IT Interconnections and should focus
     on the interconnection(s), not the Platform IT itself. Document any additional measures
     required of external network to extend IA services or to protect the platform IT from
     interconnection risk.
     3.19.2.2. IA Controls must be selected as applicable and consider the mission assurance
     category and confidentiality level of both the Platform IT and its interconnecting IT.
  3.19.3. For a system to be approved to be PIT, PIT System, or RDT&E, the PM must obtain
  an approved Determination Letter.
     3.19.3.1. PMs will submit a Determination package IAW the respective Information
     Assurance                     Platform              IT               Guidebook,

        3.19.3.1.1. ICS is a general term that encompasses several types of control systems:
            3.19.3.1.1.1. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Centralized
            control of dispersed assets, such as a metropolitan electrical network.
            3.19.3.1.1.2. Distributed Control Systems (DCS) - Control production systems
            within a local area, such as a power plant.
            3.19.3.1.1.3. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) - Discrete control for
            specific applications, such as a thermostat.
        3.19.3.1.2. Follow the rules for Platform IT and Platform IT Interconnection as
        applicable
        3.19.3.1.3. System Security Plans and IA strategies as defined in Acquisition policies
        must consider using a cross-walk of the DoD IA Controls and the NIST Security
        Controls in an effort to meet security requirements.
     3.19.3.2. The results of the determination will be returned to the PM and ISSM for the
     system. 3.19.3.3. The PM will work with the SCA to determine the specific C&A
     process and applicable security controls for their system.
        3.19.3.2.1. Follow the rules for Platform IT and Platform IT Interconnection as
        applicable. Also C&A is required for the M&S Enclave itself (i.e. the network
        infrastructure in the M&S Enclave
 32                                                          AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


          3.19.3.2.2. Treat training/exercise type M&S Enclaves as “Platform IT” and just
          focus on the interconnectivity of the Enclaves. The IAM is responsible for the internal
          Enclave security.
   3.19.4. PMs are responsible to identify candidate PIT systems and document PIT
   determinations in their program’s Cybersecurity Strategy.
   3.19.5. PIT, PIT System, and RDT&E systems require cybersecurity risks to be identified
   continually and assessed throughout system design and operation. PMs must establish a
   cybersecurity risk management program. PMs should use a multi-disciplined Integrated
   Product Team (IPT) or equivalent science/research team to identify and assess cybersecurity
   risk. The team should include all necessary stakeholders and will recommend risk
   management solutions to the PM.
   3.19.6. PIT PMs will use the Information Assurance Platform IT Guidebook developed by
   the Platform IT Working Group to assist with the C&A of their systems. The current version
   of       the       guidebook      can       be     found        on      the      AFCKS,
   https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFCKS/Compliance/AFCAP/Shared%20Documents.
   3.19.7. RDT&E PMs will use the AF RDT&E SharePoint site, https://eis.af.mil/cs/rdte, for
   specific procedures to assess and authorize their systems.
3.20. Real Time Services.
   3.20.1. Real Time Services (RTS) are defined as IP-based network, two-way voice, and/or
   video capabilities, not wireless, and official conferencing capable. Examples include, but are
   not limited to: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Voice over Secure Internet Protocol
   (VoSIP), Video Teleconferencing over Internet Protocol (VTCoIP), Video Teleconferencing
   over Secure Internet Protocol (VTCoSIP), and Voice and Video over Internet Protocol
   (VVoIP). This policy does not cover Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), Land Mobile
   Radio (LMR), or Radio over Internet Protocol (RoIP).
   3.20.2. This applies to all implementations of AF RTS capabilities connecting to AF
   enclaves configured within the AFIN boundary to include IP VTC capabilities registered
   within the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Information Systems
   Network Video Services (DVS).
   3.20.3. All AF RTS capabilities supported by AF enclaves must be implemented using
   components listed on the DISA Approved Products List Integrated Tracking System (DISA
   APLITS: https://aplits.disa.mil/processAPList.do), and configured IAW applicable
   guidance
   3.20.4. RTS shall be assessed and authorized through the enclave that it is connected to
   according to DoD Cybersecurity RMF Process , http://iase.disa.mil/diacap/, and the RMF
   Knowledge Service, https://diacap.iaportal.navy.mil/login.htm.
   3.20.5. Changes to Systems with an Established Authorization Decision.
      3.20.5.1. After an authorization decision has been issued and a security baseline
      established (i.e., ATO), positive or negative changes to the system must be assessed by
      the system's ISSM to determine if the change has a security impact. The ISSM is critical
      in initiating the change review process. The ISSM will consult the SCA for an assessment
      of any change to the system to determine if re-authorization is required. If the
AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                     33


     implementation of a cybersecurity control is affected by the change (especially for
     cybersecurity or cybersecurity-enabled products), there must be a validation of the
     cybersecurity control. This change may impact the authorization status, and the SCA
     must assess the implementation and validation of the cybersecurity control against
     functional and security guidelines. They will determine if system change does not affect
     the security baseline of the system, and that the residual risk level remains consistent with
     the current authorization.
     3.20.5.2. If the ISSM determines the system change does not affect the security baseline
     of the system (i.e., no security impact (NSI)), the system may continue to operate under
     its current authorization decision. Changes are documented and included with the system
     security and C&A documentation. The ISSM will provide a synopsis of the NSI to the
     SCA for concurrence. If the SCA concurs or ASCA recommends and ACA concurs with
     the NSI, a new authorization decision and connection approval is not required. However,
     if the SCA does not concur with the NSI, the ISSM must take the actions identified in
     paragraph 3.20.5.3.
     3.20.5.3. If the ISSM determines a change impacts the security baseline of the system,
     the SCA must evaluate the change and determine the appropriate course of action. If the
     SCA concurs the change impacts the security baseline of the system, and/or a weakness
     cannot be mitigated in a timely manner to bring the risk back to the level the AO
     accepted in the current authorization, a new authorization decision and connection
     approval is required. NOTE: If the change results in a new “High” or “Very High”
     (formerly known as a CAT I) vulnerability that can be corrected within 30 days or a new
     CAT II weakness that can be corrected/satisfactorily mitigated within 90 days, the system
     can continue to operate under the existing authorization decision and connection
     approval.

Acquisition Authority—The person responsible to sign a contract on behalf of the U.S.
Government (e.g. Contracting Officer).
Air Force Provisioned Portion of the Global Information Grid—The AF-GIG is a system
that provides a set of value-added functions operating in a global context to provide processing,
storage, and transport of information, human interaction, systems and network management,
information dissemination management, and information assurance. These functions must be
fully integrated and interoperable with one another to achieve overall success across the AF-
GIG. As a result, the AF-GIG is an information environment comprised of interoperable
computing and communications components. The AF-GIG is part of the Global Information Grid
(GIG). Therefore, the AF-GIG is the interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities,
associated processes, and personnel for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and
 38                                                          AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. The AF-
GIG includes all owned and leased communications and computing systems and services,
network operating systems, data, security services, and other associated services necessary to
achieve information superiority. [AFI 33-115v1]
Authorization to Connect—The official AF-DAA approval for system connection to the AF-
GIG. The AF-DAA assumes all risks associated with the connection of the system on the AF-
GIG. Usually granted to systems where the acceptable residual risk after proper countermeasures
and safeguards are implemented.
Connection—The process of establishing communication between ISs.
Denial of Authorization to Connect—AF-GIG DAA determination that an IS cannot connect to
the AF-GIG because of an inadequate IA design, failure to adequately implement assigned IA
Controls, or other lack of adequate security If the IS is already connected, the connection of the
IS is terminated.
Enterprise IT Data Repository (EITDR)—The Air Force database of record for registering all
systems and applications as required by public law and DoD directives. Registration in the
EITDR is mandatory for all systems and applications developed by the Air Force, or for which
the Air Force is the lead agency, or that requires connection to the AF-GIG. The EITDR is also
the database of record for IT statutory and regulatory compliance. The repository contains
compliance data for Information Assurance (IA), Internet Protocol version 6 (Ipv6), Public Key
Enabling (PKE), Clinger-Cohen Act, etc. It is the primary data source for Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) reporting and the principal vehicle for gathering and storing
system and application data to support planned and ad hoc data calls. The EITDR contains
information about program management; system and application interfaces; networthiness;
funding; Capital Investment Reports (CIRs) and other supporting data to facilitate IT portfolio
management.
Information System (IS)—Set of information resources organized for the collection, storage,
processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, display, or transmission of information.
NOTE:—The Air Force is adopting DoD cyberspace terminology from recently published DoDI
8500.01 and DoDI 8510.01.
Guest Information Systems—Information systems which do not follow the normal AFCAP
requirements for C&A. They may follow other DoD or Federal C&A processes such as NIST
800-37, DCID 6/3. They also include other DoD Agencies which have performed DIACAP and
are coming to the AF for connection to the Air Force provisioned portion of the GIG. These
were formerly called Non-Air Force Information Systems.
Platform Information Technology (PIT)—A special purpose system which employs
computing resources (i.e., hardware, firmware, and optionally software) that are physically
embedded in, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the mission performance. It only performs
(i.e., is dedicated to) the information processing assigned to it by its hosting special purpose
system (this is not for core services).

    IA CONTROL EVALUATION METHOD AND VULNERABILITY SEVERITY
                     CATEGORY ASSIGNMENT

A2.1. IA Control Validation Procedure Evaluation Method.
   A2.1.1. The assigned DoD IA Controls are expected to be validated IAW the DIACAP
   Knowledge Service guidelines. Additionally, the following methodology will be used when
   performing and documenting IA Control validation procedures:
   A2.1.2. There are four potential evaluation methods used while performing the validation
   procedures. They include:
      A2.1.2.1. Interview (I) - provides an effective means of validating the results obtained
      with other methods. For example, an initial security training requirement may exist which
      is verified by inspection of training materials and documentation, but to validate the
      effectiveness of the training, interviews with users would be necessary. Interviewees also
      frequently provide more information than is initially asked of them, which ensures a more
      comprehensive validation activity By itself, the interview method in most cases is not
      appropriate, but when combined with another method, will give a better overall "picture"
      of the security environment.
      A2.1.2.2. Document Review (D) - involves a review of descriptive documentation, a
      comparison of the appropriate characteristics with the defined security requirements, and
      a comparison with approved security specifications to verify conformance with the
      methodology applied. Reviews can also include the verification of accuracy and
      completeness of documentation or records.
      A2.1.2.3. Observation (O) - is the physical observation of a predictable event, initiated
      by a specific input or set of inputs that will always yield the same output or response.
      Testers may use live or simulated data, actions, or a lack of action to stimulate the
      predicted response.
      A2.1.2.4. Test (T) - is the collection, analysis and evaluation through systematic hands-
      on measurement under all appropriate conditions.
      A2.1.2.5. The evaluation methods are listed in order of complexity and depth from least
      to most. If more than one method exists to validate an IA Control, the personnel
      performing the validation procedures should use the most in-depth method (more than
      one type may be used per control).
   A2.1.3. The AFCAP TAG will review suggested evaluation methods and adjudicate any
   potential discrepancies with the approved types and post to the IA CoP.
A2.2. Vulnerability Severity Category Assignment
   A2.2.1. DISA has provided guidance for assigning Vulnerability Severity Category
   Assignments, which the Air Force is adopting as the standard within the IT Lean process.
40                                                     AFI33-210 23 DECEMBER 2008


  A2.2.2. The AFCAP TAG will review Vulnerability Severity Category Assignments, as
  suggested by DISA, and provide the final approved guidance in the AFCAP approved IA
  Control Evaluation Method and Vulnerability Severity Category Assignment Table. See AF
  IA CoP for the AFCAP approved IA Control Evaluation Method and Vulnerability Severity
  Category Assignment Table.
