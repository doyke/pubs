This supplement applies to all Edwards AFB (EAFB) organizations involved in modification of
aerospace vehicles. This supplement assigns duties and responsibilities to EAFB organizations
when Configuration Control Board (CCB) and/or Modification Engineering Authority (MEA) for
T-2 modifications are delegated to EAFB. The Instrumentation Division will maintain copies of
all letters delegating T-2 Modification CCB and MEA authority to EAFB. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records       Disposition   Schedule     (RDS)      located     at   https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Changed from an AFFTC Supplement to an EAFB Supplement and reformatted to meet current
standards. This revision updates office symbols for the responsible offices. Paragraphs
renumbered to align with AFMCI 21-126, 19 July 2005. Paragraphs 1.4.1, 1.5.1, and 3 expanded
and added to further define hardware change actions and ground tests.
2                                                                AFMCI 21-126/EAFB Sup 1, 12 Apr 07

AFMCI 21-126, 19 Jul 05 is supplemented as follows:
1. Temporary 2 (T-2) Modifications Defined
1.4.1. (Added - EAFB) Hardware & Software Change Actions. Where EAFB has hardware and
software T-2 modification configuration management responsibility, each Flight Test Squadron
(FLTS) will develop its own hardware and software T-2 modification policies and general procedures
in an FLTS Operating Instruction (OI). The 412 MXG and 412 TENG/ENI must coordinate and
review these OIs before granting hardware and software change action CCB and MEA delegation to
the FLTS. Changes to the FLTS OI will be coordinated with 412 MXG and 412 TENG/ENI, in order
for the CCB and MEA delegation to remain in effect. The Instrumentation Division will maintain
copies of all such OIs.
1.5.1. (Added - EAFB) Ground Tests. For modifications conducted strictly for ground testing and
then removed before flight, airworthiness and electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic
interference (EMC/EMI) are not critical issues. In lieu of using T-2 Modification policies and general
procedures for such modifications, each FLTS may develop its own policies and general procedures
in an FLTS OI for accomplishing modifications intended strictly for ground tests. Any such policies
and general procedures must be approved by the T-2 Modification CCB authority prior to their use.
Changes to the FLTS OI will be coordinated with 412 MXG and 412 TENG/ENI, in order for the
CCB and MEA delegation to remain in effect. These local FLTS policies and general procedures
shall ensure operational safety, appropriate electrical loading, and complete removal before flight.
The Instrumentation Division will maintain copies of all such OIs.
3. Acronyms and Terms Explained
Terms (Added - EAFB) Hardware Change Action The replacement item has the same
physical and functional characteristics (form, fit, and function) of the item it replaces.
4. Uncertified External and Internal Stores (General)
4.1. The EAFB Program Manager (PM) will identify non-certified stores during test program
planning and notify the T-2 Modification Manager (T2MM), who will prepare the AFMC Form 244,
T-2 Modification Configuration Control Board Directive, and brief the Design Review Board (DRB)
for initial approval. The T2MM will then forward a copy of the AFMC Form 244, along with an
engineering data package, to the stores compatibility activity (e.g. AFSEO, Eglin AFB, FL).
7. Approval Authority:
7.3.2. Configuration Control Board Delegation. The 412 MXG/CC or 412 MXG/CD will chair the
T-2 Modification CCB for EAFB. The Instrumentation Division will serve as EAFB's MEA. The
412 MXG/CC may delegate the T-2 Modification CCB approvals and the Instrumentation Division
may delegate MEA approvals to Det 2, 412 AMXS and 410 FLTS/CC by letter.
15. Contracted Modifications and Lease or Loan Agreements
AFMCI 21-126/EAFB Sup 1, 12 Apr 07                                                            3

15.1. The EAFB PM (or CTF Director if no EAFB PM is assigned) will notify the
Instrumentation Division of all contracted modifications that will involve EAFB assets. If the
modification is to be accomplished under EAFB’s CCB authority, the Instrumentation Division
will ensure that a T2MM is appointed for the modification. For contracted modifications on EAFB
assets, the EAFB PM will ensure AFMCI 21-126 and applicable portions of MIL-STD-27733, its
associated Data Item Description (DI-MISC-81562), and SAE-AS50881 are included as
contractual requirements, as well as the requirement to support inspections by EAFB personnel at
selected points. Exceptions to these requirements may be granted by the EAFB’s CCB. For
modifications contracted by other agencies (System Program Office, laboratories, etc.), the EAFB
PM (or CTF Director) will ensure the agency is informed of these requirements. The
AFFTC/PKMQ will perform quality assurance functions related to those aircraft modified by
contractor personnel and coordinate with the Maintenance Quality Assurance section.
