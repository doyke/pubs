SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction is updated and the 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record, has been
revised.
1. General Policy: The act of withdrawing blood samples to determine level of intoxication is
termed Blood Alcohol Testing (BAT). Since the results of examinations of biological specimens
as well as the specimens themselves may be used as evidence in military and civilian judicial or
administrative proceedings, the Air Force Medical Service must cooperate in collecting and
presenting such evidence (See AFI 44-102, paragraph 16.3.1.). The 8 MDG personnel will
cooperate in the collection and testing of blood in accordance with AFI 44-102 and with the
provisions of this instruction. In every situation, the medical needs of the individual must
receive primary attention. A BAT should not be drawn if the health of the individual will be
endangered. If this is believed to be the case, the matter should be referred to a credentialed
medical provider for determination. Military medical personnel may not take biological
specimens solely at the request of and for use of civilian law enforcement authorities (See AFI
44-102, paragraph 16.3.2.3.6.).
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. All Commanders must provide an updated Personal Health Information appointment
     letter to the 8 MDG TRICARE Office designating individuals authorized to pick up legal
     BAT results from TRICARE.
     2.2. 8th Security Forces Squadron (8 SFS) when it is appropriate will consult and coordinate
     with the 8 Fighter Wing, Staff Judge Advocate (8 FW/JA) prior to escorting individuals
     (active duty military, DOD civilians, and dependents) for blood alcohol testing. For those
     individuals who do not consent to the blood alcohol testing, the 8 FW/JA must be contacted
     at 782-4283 during duty hours. After normal duty hours personnel shall contact the 8 FW
     Command Post (8 FW/CP) at 782-6000 to contact the on-call judge advocate. Do not extract
     blood without having contacted the 8 FW/JA. A signed Consent for Search and Seizure/AF
     IMT 1364 form or an AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize, must be completed
     before blood samples can be collected.
     2.3. The Laboratory Technician responds to BAT requests and can be reached via on-call
     cell phone by calling Ambulance services during non-duty hours or by telephone at 782-
     4090/4507 from 0800-1700, Monday through Friday. The Laboratory Technician will
     complete Section III, of the 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record.
     2.4. The Laboratory Technician ensures that BAT samples and 8 FW Form 23, Blood
     Alcohol Testing Record, are secured in the lock-box until the specimen is sent to the 51
     MDG Laboratory via the courier.
3. Withdrawal of Blood from Military Patients:
     3.1. The following procedures will be used only on active duty military patients. (NOTE:
     Unlike the urinalysis program, command directed blood testing is NOT authorized.)
     Although a commander/first sergeant may ask a member to submit to voluntary legal BAT
     (See paragraph 3.1.1. below), if the member refuses the only recourse is to request search
     authorization approval. (See paragraph 3.1.2. below).
8FWI44-102 10 MAY 2012                                                                      3


     3.1.1. Voluntary: When requested for a judicial or administrative purpose, and if the
     member is competent, law enforcement personnel, commander or first sergeant will
     usually ask the member to consent. It is not a requirement to advise military subjects of
     their rights under Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), before
     requesting consent to withdrawal of blood for legal BATs. However, the act of
     requesting the member to consent to a blood alcohol test is a function of Law
     Enforcement or Command and should be done only by these personnel (who will fill out
     an AF IMT 1364, Consent for Search and Seizure). If the subject freely and voluntarily
     gives his/her consent, and if there is no reason to believe that withdrawal of blood will
     endanger the subject’s health, then blood may be withdrawn by a laboratory technician in
     the laboratory.
     3.1.2. Involuntary:
        3.1.2.1. Search authorization:
            3.1.2.1.1. If medical personnel are presented with a search authorization for an
            active duty person, blood may be obtained from the military member without the
            member’s consent. The installation commander may issue such an authorization
            or the military magistrate based on a finding of probable cause.
            3.1.2.1.2. If written authorization, AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize,
            is not immediately available; an oral search authorization must be received by 8
            FW/JA. Written authorization must be accomplished and added to other
            documentation within the next duty day.
     3.1.3. No consent and No Search Authorization: Medical personnel may take blood
     without the donor’s consent and without a search warrant authorization when there is
     clear indication that evidence of a crime will be found and authorities have reason to
     believe that the delay would result in the destruction of evidence (See AFI 44-102,
     paragraph 16.3.2.3.2.). In such an instance, prior to the extraction of blood, contact
     should be made with the Chief of Military Justice during duty hours at 782-4283. After
     normal duty hours personnel shall contact the 8 FW Command Post to contact on-call
     Judge Advocate General (JAG). (See paragraph 6, infra.)
     3.1.4. Procedure for Involuntary Blood Extraction for Active Duty Members:
        3.1.4.1. Extraction of the blood will occur in the Ambulance Services or the
        laboratory by the lab tech on duty/call.
        3.1.4.2. The 8 SFS is responsible for restraining the subject. The 8 SFS personnel
        must have adequate 8 SFS personnel present to restrain the member, if available
        owing unit or medical personnel not directly involved in caring for the subject can be
        utilized to assist SF personnel in restraining the subject. Upon request and when
        necessary, Ambulance Service personnel will provide a gurney with appropriate
        restraining straps, if necessary to restrain the subject.
        3.1.4.3. If necessary, 8 SFS personnel can assist in maintaining adequate exposure of
        the members arm to obtain a blood sample and to insure the safety of both the
        individual and medical staff.
 4                                                                   8FWI44-102 10 MAY 2012


            3.1.4.4. If there are insufficient 8 SFS or owning unit personnel present to subdue the
            subject or the 8 SFS personnel cannot adequately restrain the subject, medical facility
            personnel will not attempt to extract blood.
            3.1.4.5. Involuntary extraction of blood will be performed in a reasonable fashion by
            the laboratory technician.
4. Withdrawal of Blood from Non-Military Patients: A BAT for use in judicial or
administrative purposes generally will not be performed on non-military personnel unless law
enforcement personnel have obtained the patient’s consent. However, blood may be extracted
for medical purposes, as described in paragraph 5.
5. Blood Extraction for Medical Purposes: If a provider determines that a blood alcohol test
is necessary for medical treatment, a medical BAT may be performed. No search authorization
or consent obtained by law enforcement personnel is required. Proceed according to established
medical protocols.
6. Contact Chief of Military Justice or On-Call JAG If Problems or Questions Arise: If
problems or questions arise during duty hours, medical or 8 SFS personnel shall contact the
Chief of Military Justice, 8 FW/JA, at 782-4283. If problems or questions arise during non-duty
hours, medical or 8 SFS personnel shall contact the 8th Fighter Wing Command Post (8 FW/CP)
at 782-6000 to contact the on-call JAG.
7. Procedures:
     7.1. 8 SFS personnel escort all detained individuals (Unit Commander or designee, First
     Sergeant can escort their personnel in cases where the person is not detained by 8 SFS) for
     non-medical BAT determination to the Ambulance Services at Building 405 to provide blood
     samples for BAT. It is essential to draw the BAT sample as soon as feasible to minimize
     metabolic reduction of blood alcohol content. The individual being tested and the escorting
     official will report to Ambulance Services and inform personnel on shift on duty or the lab
     tech on call during non-duty hours to come to Ambulance Services to obtain the sample.
     7.2. An 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record, must be utilized for all legal BATs.
     7.3. The 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record, initiates a chain of custody
     document. There should not be any changes on this form. However, if a change must be
     made cross it through with one line and initial and date the correction. If the error is too
     large, re-accomplish the form completely.
     7.4. The escorting personnel will follow the instructions of the laboratory personnel in
     accomplishing the 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record.
     7.5. The 8th Medical Group Laboratory will collect two (2) Sodium Fluoride (NaFl) (Grey
     top) tubes, (approximately 14 mLs of blood). One sample will be placed in a secured lock-
     box along with the 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record, to be shipped to the 51st
     Medical Group Laboratory Osan, AB, Korea for whole blood BAT testing via courier. The
     second specimen will be stored in the 8 MDG Laboratory’s secured lock box maintained in
     the laboratory for additional testing, if necessary.
     7.6. If at any time the 51 MDG Laboratory cannot run the specimen the 8 MDG Laboratory
     will ship the specimen to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner’s System (AFMES) located in
     Rockville, MD for testing.
8FWI44-102 10 MAY 2012                                                                         5


8. Reports and Release of Results:
   8.1. Test values are reported in Part V of the 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record.
   A reportable value is defined as any specimen containing a concentration greater than the test
   detection threshold (0.01gm%). Legal intoxication on Kunsan AB is a blood alcohol content
   of 0.10gm% (100mg/dL).
   8.2. The completed 8 FW Form 23, Blood Alcohol Testing Record, will be distributed as
   follows: A copy of the original will be hand-carried to the TRICARE office and given to the
   TRICARE technician on duty; a second copy will be on filed by the Kunsan Laboratory and
   kept for two years; while the original will be maintained by the 51 MDG Laboratory. Results
   received from AFMES will be distributed in the same manner.
   8.3. The Privacy Act governs the release of a legal blood alcohol test result. The 8th
   Medical Group’s TRICARE office may provide a copy of results during normal duty hours to
   8 SFS, 8 FW/JA, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, or to the member’s
   Commander/First Sergeant (or commander designee). A commander designee must be
   named in writing within a letter on file in the medical records release office. The member
   will normally obtain result from his/her Commander or First Sergeant. For all other requests
   for release, consult with the Chief of Military Justice. No results will ever be released over
   the telephone.
   8.4. TRICARE personnel will contact the 8 SFS Desk Sergeant at 782-4944 and the
   member’s commander when the test result is available to arrange for the result to be picked
   up. Under no circumstances will results be given over the telephone.
   8.5. The member’s Commander, First Sergeant, Air Force Office of Special Investigations
   (AFOSI) agents, 8 FW/JA, and the appropriate 8 SFS representative are authorized recipients
   of BAT results. Only TRICARE personnel are authorized to release BAT results.
   8.6. Interpretation of BAT results from 8th or 51st Medical Group are reported as milligrams
   per deciliter (mg/dL) of alcohol present in the individual’s blood, is as follows:
Result in mg/dL (gm%)                       Interpretation
Less than 13    (0.01)                      Negative, below detectable limits
14 – 49        (0.01 – 0.04)                Possibly under influence of alcohol
50-99           (0.05 – 0.09)               Under influence of alcohol
100 or greater  (0.10) or greater           Legally intoxicated
