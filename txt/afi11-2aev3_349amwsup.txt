                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
   Operations. It is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates
   information found in aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other
   Air Force directives. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source
   document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source
   document, waiver authority is in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4.2. For matters where
   this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the
   basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors shall make current copies of this AFI available
   to appropriate personnel. Transportation and base operations passenger manifesting agencies
   will maintain a current copy of this AFI. This AFI will be used by all units and agencies
   involved in or supporting AE operations. Copies will be current and available to planning
   staff from HQ to aircrew level.
   1.1.3. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. Potentially contaminated
   patients must be decontaminated before entering the AE system. However, in extreme
   circumstances, the AMC/CC is the policy waiver authority for movement of
   contaminated/contagious casualties/personnel. If a waiver is approved, AMC will provide the
   capability to move a small number of contaminated/contagious casualties (a combination of
   approximately 50, with a maximum of 20 contagious personnel). AMC will equip AE crew
   operating in designated high-threat areas with the required equipment/supplies to carry out
   this mission.
   1.1.4. Mission. The mission of the worldwide AE system is to transport by fixed-wing
   aircraft, casualties:
      1.1.4.1. Requiring en route health care management.
      1.1.4.2. From forward airfields in the combat zone to points of definitive medical care.
      1.1.4.3. From one theater of operation to another.
   1.1.5. AECMs prepare for the AE mission during peacetime by:
      1.1.5.1. Training.
      1.1.5.2. Organizing and equipping assigned personnel.
      1.1.5.3. Instructing Department of Defense (DoD) medical treatment facilities on the use
      of the AE system.
      1.1.5.4. Exercising and evaluating contingency AE capabilities.
      1.1.5.5. Identifying medical and support equipment necessary to meet mission
      requirements.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               15


  1.1.6. These AE missions may be directed at any time by Command and Control (C2)
  agencies. The type of aircraft used will be with the concurrence of the appropriate medical
  validating authority.
  1.1.7. Determining Factors. Consider the following factors when transporting patients on
  aircraft; patient's diagnosis, condition, equipment, oxygen requirements, in-flight time, in-
  flight patient care requirements, and the number of medical personnel required. Emphasis
  must always be on providing quality, safe and appropriate care while minimizing potential
  risks during transport.
  1.1.8. Patient Load Planning Factors. The tasking AE command element determines the
  size/composition of the patient load on AE missions. AE mission planning factors will be per
  applicable AFI/H 11-XXX and 41-XXX series publications.
  1.1.9. Patient Preparation. A flight surgeon (FS), if available, will determine the patient's
  suitability for AE on a specific aircraft. Medical authorities requesting the patient's
  evacuation must be informed of the impact of in-flight physical stresses on the patient. In the
  event the Medical Crew Director (MCD) has determined a patient is not stable/stabilized, is
  at significant risk for flight, or requires care beyond the scope of the AE crew, the MCD will
  coordinate with the patient movement requirements center (PMRC) and one of the following:
  tanker airlift control center (TACC), air mobility operation control center (AMOCC), or
  airlift operations center (AOC) before refusing the patient. Depending on the
  contingency/tactical environment, refusing a patient for flight may not be applicable.
  1.1.10. In determining the risk for the patient in flight versus remaining in place,
  consideration must be given to the medical capability of the sending facility, the receiving
  AE crew, and the current operational situation.
  1.1.11. Airlift Resources. The primary USAF aircraft supporting intratheater AE are the C-
  130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster, C-21 and the KC-135 Stratotanker. Overseas theater
  commanders have operational control of theater-assigned or attached aircraft through the
  Airlift Operations Center (AOC), who allocates those airframes as required to meet
  operational mission requirements. Primary intertheater aircraft are KC-135 Stratotanker, C-
  17 Globemaster and C-141 Starlifter. C-5 Galaxy and the KC-10 Extender can be used when
  available and if suitable to meet patient requirements. Additionally, the Civil Reserve Air
  Fleet (CRAF) can be used when tasked through activation.
  1.1.12. Opportune Airlift. Opportune airlift is preferred to launching a special airlift aircraft.
  The C2 agency should direct the move. Use of opportune airlift is considered an unscheduled
  AE mission, and managed/reported in the same manner as any other AE mission, to include
  the change of the mission number when patient(s) is/are onboard. AECMs on these missions
  will be qualified or under supervision while gaining qualification in the affected aircraft.
  1.1.13. Aircraft Availability. AE missions are supported by:
     1.1.13.1. Dedicated aircraft (scheduled or designated channel missions).
     1.1.13.2. In system select (ISS - opportune aircraft).
     1.1.13.3. Patient/cargo mix missions.
  1.1.14. In all cases, use of specific aircraft are based on:
 16                                                AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


       1.1.14.1. Specific clinical requirements.
       1.1.14.2. Specific aeromedical equipment needs.
       1.1.14.3. Timeliness of patient movement.
       1.1.14.4. Financial constraints.
       1.1.14.5. Aircraft availability.
       1.1.14.6. Airfield constraints.
   1.1.15. Medical Crew Director (MCD) Authority. The MCD is responsible for, and is the
   final authority regarding the Aeromedical Evacuation mission of the aircraft.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with aeromedical operations.

   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
   the MAJCOM/DO with mission execution authority. Obtain waivers to deviate from
   provisions in this AFI via MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature. List MAJCOM/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement
       (see para. 1.5).
       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ
       AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) copies of MAJCOM/DO-approved long-term waivers.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PIC shall use the

2.4. Not Used.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. AMC C2 facilities will normally transmit arrival, departure,
and advisory messages to the TACC as appropriate. Aircrews on AMC TACC-controlled
missions are responsible for transmitting these messages via L-Band SATCOM, HF, DSN, etc.,
when transiting stations without an AMC C2 (fixed or mobile) presence. Crews on missions not
controlled by the AMC TACC will report to their appropriate controlling agency.
   2.5.1. Aircrew Responsibilities. The PIC is the focal point for interaction between aircrew
   and mission support personnel. The local C2 agency is the focal point for all mission support
   activities. PICs must inform C2 of any factor that may affect mission accomplishment. When
   transiting a stop without a C2 agency, it is the responsibility of the PIC to ensure necessary
   mission information is placed into the C2 system by the most expeditious means available.
   The PIC will establish a point of contact with the appropriate C2 agency prior to entering
   crew rest. The MCD is the focal point between the AE Crew and medical support personnel.

   AFB, IL.
   2.11.2. INTERTHEATER: The Tanker Airlift Control Center Aeromedical Evacuation Cell
   (TACC AE Cell) located at Scott AFB, IL manages intertheater AMC missions. Most
   intertheater AE missions cross between one theater to another theater and are flown on AMC
   aircraft. The respective Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center/ Global Movement
   Requirements Center (TPMRC/GPMRC) will validate patient requirements for the
   aeromedical evacuation system and will pass those requirements on to the appropriate
   agency.
   2.11.3. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). The TACC AE Cell is responsible for
   executing all intertheater AE and CONUS AE missions. HQ AMC/TACC:

   2.11.4. Air Operations Center (AOC). The respective theater AOC manages airlift
   operations within an overseas theater. The AECT, as part of the airlift system is embedded in
   the Air Mobility Division (AMD), which is part of the AOC. The AECT provides operational
   control for theater aeromedical elements. It manages and executes AE mission operations,
   and is the operation center for overall planning, coordinating and directing of all theater AE
   assets. It also directs Director Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR) in the distribution and
   employment of theater AE ground Unit Type Codes (UTC’s). During contingency
   operations, the AECT or tasking command element is aligned with the AMD and submits
   requests for AE to the AOC. The AMD and AOC work with the AECT to respond to patient
   movement requests submitted by Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC).
   2.11.5. Global Patient Movement Requirements Center/ Theater Movement
   Requirements Center (GPMRC/TPMRC). These regulating offices manage the transit of
   patients within assigned theaters. They ensure patient care requirements are matched to
   existing medical capability. GPMRC is a tri-service, United States Transportation Command
   (USTRANSCOM) agency responsible for global oversight of patient movement and patient
   regulating to and within CONUS. TPMRCs are Unified Command agencies designated to
   regulate patients within their respective theater. TPMRCs also coordinate intertheater patient
   regulating requirements with GPMRC and advise the theater AECT of patient movement
   requirements.

                      AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew –
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking.
   3.2.1. Aircrew or Crew. The full complement of officers and enlisted members required to
   complete an assigned mission. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and this AFI validate
   AECM requirements for flight and define crew complement.
   3.2.2. Basic AE Crew. AE crew positions are required for the mission as explained in AFI
   11-401 and this AFI.
       3.2.2.1. A basic AE crew consists of two FNs and three AETs. NOTE: For deployment,
       a basic AE crew will be tasked. EXCEPTION: Refer to para 3.2.2.2 for C-21 missions.
          3.2.2.1.1. The group/squadron/theater Chief Nurse may adjust the basic crew
          complement to meet patient acuity and en route nursing care requirements.
       3.2.2.2. Basic AE Crew (C-21). The basic crew complement for a C-21 mission is one
       (1) FN and at least one (1) AET but no more than two (2) AETs due to space limitations.
          3.2.2.2.1. For C-21 transports with a Neonatal or Critical Care Air Transport Team
          (CCATT), the AE crew may be limited to one (1) AECM due to weight and space
          limitations.
       3.2.2.3. Alert AE Crew. An alert crew consists of one (1) FN and two (2) AETs. For a
       period exceeding a basic FDP, the alert crew will be augmented as outlined in para
       3.2.2.5.2. Note: For theater missions which routinely exceed a basic FDP, place five
       AECMs on alert to allow for augmentation of the alert crew. In addition, utilize an
       augmented alert crew if the patient load is greater than five.
       3.2.2.4. Minimum AE Crew Complement. The minimum crew complement on
       cargo/tanker aircraft will consist of one (1) FN and two (2) AETs. EXCEPTION: For C-
       21 transports refer to para 3.2.2.2. The MAJCOM DO is the final waiver authority for
       further reducing the minimum crew complement.
       3.2.2.5. Augmented AE Crew. A crew will be supplemented by additional AECMs to
       permit in-flight rest periods for any mission that exceeds a basic FDP. In addition, AE
       missions may be supplemented by additional AECMs due to high patient acuity or large
       patient loads.

NOTE: When the AE crew is "augmented" for FDP and are able to implement work-rest cycles
and also meet the needs of increased patient acuity, consider the crew augmented for both FDP
 24                                                AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


and patient acuity. If patient augmentees can not implement work-rest cycles and meet patient
requirements, additional AECMs will be added to the mission.
          3.2.2.5.1. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer
          than a basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified and MR
          in accordance with AFI 11-2AE, V1. In those situations requiring augmentation, the
          crew will be augmented from the start of the duty period. MAJCOM/DO approval is
          required for crewmembers to join the mission en route for augmentation. If
          augmentees join the mission en route, the crew’s FDP will be computed based on the
          FDP of the most limited person.
          3.2.2.5.2. An augmented AE crew for an extended FDP consists of one (1) additional
          FN and one (1) additional AET.
          3.2.2.5.3. If the AE crew must be augmented due to patient acuity or large patient
          loads, additional AECMs will be added based on patient care requirements. Number
          of AECMs and AFSC may vary. For example, an additional FN and AET may be
          added for large patient loads or 2 additional FNs may be added to assist with
          increased medication administration requirements.
          3.2.2.5.4. Physicians, nurses, medical technicians, or other personnel designated as
          medical attendants (i.e., Critical Care Air Transport Team [CCATT] members) to
          specific patients do not constitute an augmented AE crew and will not extend crew
          duty time.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember. An individual who meets all the following:
       3.3.1.1. Is a non-rated aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service,
       specifically trained to operate safely during ground and flight operations of the aircraft
       and is proficient with onboard emergency procedures and operation of emergency
       equipment. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and perform their principal duties
       inflight. Duties must be essential to performing patient care and operating associated
       equipment used for completing a mission.
       3.3.1.2. Is required for the mission as described in AFI 11-401.
       3.3.1.3. Is designated on the flight authorization to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
3.4. Not Used.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Not Used.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles are
adequate to permit an aircrew time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for
rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the time period starting at mission report time and
   ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                              25


      SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
      route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
           3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 14-16 hours (see
           Table 3.1). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/DO may extend to
           augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/DO shall augment basic
           crew to extend FDP).
              3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
              weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
              augmented FDP, the PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
              long as:
              3.7.1.1.2. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before the
              first takeoff of the day.
              3.7.1.1.3. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate rest en
              route.
              3.7.1.1.4. The PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/DO (mission execution
              authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
              mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
              delays. C2 agents shall not ask the PIC to exercise this option.
           3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18-24
           hours (see Table 3.1).
              3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the mission
              profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en route.

   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCO/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member
   early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties. For AECMs,
   CDT ends when the patients have been delivered to the receiving medical representative
   and/or when aircraft medical equipment has been secured, whichever is later. If the mission
   will RON, the PIC and MCD will coordinate alert/take-off time based on the latest
   crewmember CDT end point.
       3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
       times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
       3.7.3.2. Air Reserve Component (ARC) technicians acting as primary crew members
       may perform transition on local training missions provided their time from start duty does
       not exceed maximum FDP/CDT and actual flight does not exceed 12 hours.

NOTE: CDT/FDP includes both military and civilian work. It begins when the individual reports
for his or her first duty period (military or civilian) and ends at engine shutdown at the end of the
mission.
       3.7.3.3. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. Deadhead time is the time computed traveling in passenger
   status. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning or de-
   positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crew members may
   deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to
   deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
 Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after deadheading,
provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for deadhead flight).
       3.7.4.1. Aircrew members may fly in deadhead status after performing primary crew
       duties for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmembers FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph
   9.7.2. The duty day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. (See AFI 11-202V3). SQ/CCs shall not schedule an aircrew
member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties (PICs shall not violate any of
the following restrictions with an early takeoff):
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3,
   General Flight Rules.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA/ BRAVO standby force legal for alert time) or while under the influence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. Within 12 hours following a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight above 25,000 feet
   MSL. Aircrew members may fly as passengers during this period provided the mission is
   planned for no more than a 10,000 foot MSL cabin altitude. An aircrew member who
   participates in an altitude chamber flight to at or below 25,000 feet may fly without delay
   (primary/deadhead) as long as subsequent cabin altitude does not exceed 15,000 feet.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               27


   3.8.4. Within 24 hours after compressed gas diving (scuba or surface supplied diving), a
   hyperbaric (compression) chamber mission, or aircraft pressurization checks that exceed 10
   minutes. Aircrew members will not perform multiple pressurization checks.
   3.8.5. Within 72 hours of donating blood. Aircrew members in mobility positions or subject
   to flying duties within 72 hours may donate blood with SQ/CC approval (donation requires a
   72 hour Duties Not to Include Flying (DNIF) period).
   3.8.6. When taking oral/injected medication unless the Command Surgeon grants an
   individual medical waiver. Except as noted in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
   Standards, aircrew members will not self-medicate. An aircrew member may use the
   following medications without medical consultation as long as he/she understands the root
   cause of the ailment and that root cause will not impact flight duties:
      3.8.6.1. Skin antiseptic, topical anti-fungal, 1 percent Hydrocortisone cream, or benzyl
      peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not interfere with the performance
      of flying duties or wear of personal equipment.
      3.8.6.2. Single dose of over-the-counter aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to provide
      analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions that do not impede performance of aircrew
      duties.
      3.8.6.3. Antacid for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
      3.8.6.4. Hemorrhoidal suppositories.
      3.8.6.5. Bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
      3.8.6.6. Multivitamin (one per day).
      3.8.6.7. An aircrew member shall only use dietary/herbal supplements following consult
      and approval of a flight surgeon (FS). The FS should consider aeromedical implications
      and probability of the supplement to actually enhance performance.
      3.8.6.8. An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays
      following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Do not use these products to
      treat symptoms of head congestion that exist before flight.
   3.8.7. Immunizations: Crewmembers are not DNIF after receiving immunizations. However,
   a standard observation period is required. If adverse reaction occurs, the individual is
   considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon to fly.
3.9. Counter Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. The counter-fatigue management program for mobility aircrew consists of a range of
   options. First, aircrew should follow a healthy lifestyle to include proper diet, vigorous
   exercise, and most importantly take personal responsibility to get adequate rest. Second,
   leaders at all levels should set up flight schedules that permit aircrew opportunities to rest.
   Additionally, en route or deployed commanders and stage managers should ensure aircrew
   access to timely and nutritious meals and provide quiet, cool, and darkened billeting quarters.
   Finally, aircrew may use medications (with prior approval) that enhance natural rest during
   off-cycle crew rest periods. This section provides guidance with regard to the use of No-Go
   pills (prescriptions) that help aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle crew
   rest periods. Go-Pills are not approved for use in flight.
28                                             AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


  3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use No-Go pills as a first choice counter-
  fatigue management tool. Unit commanders should plan missions to allow aircrew crew rest
  during their normal nighttime sleep cycle. This program permits commanders and unit flight
  surgeons an avenue to educate, test, and provide No-Go pills to individual fliers. No-Go Pills
  can provide a benefit for aircrew members to obtain satisfactory rest during off-cycle crew
  rest periods.
  3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
  with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC, and with each individual aircrew
  member. To minimize potential for harmful interaction, the FS will judge whether or not
  each aircrew member may use No-go pills with any another medication, to include nutritional
  supplements and over the counter (non-prescription) medications.
  3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of No-Go
  medication with OG/CC and FS oversight.
  3.9.5. A home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
  counter fatigue program is the point of contact for No-Go prescription. Upon request, the FS
  will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
  duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
  3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
  the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for No-Go
  medications):
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and
     darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming No-Go Pills.
  3.9.9. Aircrew member’s responsibilities:
     3.9.9.1. Aircrew members shall not take No-Go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
     alcohol.
     3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12 hours after consuming a
     No-Go pill. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12 hour timeline after consult
     with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed No-Go pills have short duration effect. In no
     case will crewmember consume No-Go pills on a timeline where they are under the effect
     of medication while they operate equipment.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                           29


       3.9.9.3. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
       supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
       potential interactions.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place crew
members in crew rest. Mission planners/schedulers shall create mission itineraries that afford
aircrew members sufficient time to perform aircrew-related ground duties and still meet
physiological needs (relax, sleep, and/or dine). MAJCOM/DO may waive any portion of the
crew rest period or ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-station Pre-departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew members
   off station 16 hours or more, Unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead aircrew
   members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before they are legal for alert time. Aircrew
   members may perform limited non-flying duties such as mission planning during the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-
   departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-
   departure crew rest.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
       3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/DO, C2 agents shall
       not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
       members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
       rest period after they complete official duties.
       3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
       flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, storing medical
       equipment/kits, update C2 on patient/mission status, aircrew arming, or mission
       debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews
   allotted ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff IAW MDS specific
   Vol 3.
       3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
          to complete mission planning, cargo up-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
          duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than allotted ground time.
       3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
       times longer than allotted hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from
       the cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
       transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
       (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
   3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-
   of-flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
   report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
30                                              AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning
  to home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (Not applicable to ANG and
  AFRC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Not Used.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/DO-approved crew rest criteria
  in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN) or
  Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. Air Crew billeting. Prime Knight is designed to minimize the time aircrews spend
  getting into billeting at crew rest locations. Billeting success depends on the accuracy of the
  aircrew information. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring billeting requirements are
  passed rest with the PIC, however, the C2 agency will assist the PIC as much as possible.
  The following guidance applies to all aircrews and C2 agencies:
     3.10.8.1. C2 agency Notification Responsibilities. MAJCOM C2 will ensure current
     aircrew orders are transmitted to the next crew rest station's C2 agency NLT 30 minutes
     after the mission departs.
     3.10.8.2. Aircrew Responsibilities. If a mission is departing from a non-AMC facility,
     the aircrew will call the next crew rest station, when able, to pass crew count/make-up,
     expected arrival time, number of officers, number of enlisted, male and female, etc.
     3.10.8.3. Units must ensure the fund cite is clearly indicated on the orders for
     reservations to be made in advance. Lack of a fund cite will require the aircrew to make
     their own advance reservations through use of a government credit card.
     3.10.8.4. AE units will fax a copy of the AEC’s flight orders (AF IMT 4327a, Crew
     Flight (FA) Authorization) to local C2 agency where the AE mission is staging from, or
     will RON, and TACC (as applicable) NLT 24 hours prior to scheduled mission date. This
     fax copy will notify C2 agencies of mission dates, AE POC (MCD) and assist with
     billeting arrangements. At a minimum, include the following:
     3.10.8.4. (349AMW) Initial coordination for billeting is the AES scheduler. The
     scheduler will fax orders for the AE crew to Command and Control (C2) agencies within
     24 hours prior to the mission. If requested by the flight crew, the scheduler will align this
     process with the flight crew so that crew billeting for both crews can be arranged at the
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                         31


       same time. The unit scheduler will provide fax sheets in the MCD mission packet as
       evidence of prior coordination. On the morning of the mission, the MCD will verify that
       this coordination has been completed; if not, the MCD will fax orders to the next
       destination C2 agency.
          3.10.8.4.1. Where the AE mission is staging from and/or RON locations.
          3.10.8.4.2. Identify the MCD.
          3.10.8.4.3. Mission number.
          3.10.8.4.4. Mission date(s).
          3.10.8.4.5. AE Crew names/ranks/gender.
       3.10.8.5. The local C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
       he/she checks on mission status. The Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE
       crews and the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without
       interruption of crew rest.
       3.10.8.6. The MCD will interface with local C2 agencies for all AE missions. The MCD
       will ensure:
          3.10.8.6.1. Orders have been received.
          3.10.8.6.2. C2 agencies have MCD’s contact information.
          3.10.8.6.3. Any mission irregularities are discussed. This will occur prior to crew
          rest, at en route mission stops, and at AE mission termination.
       3.10.8.7. In coordination with MCD, the PIC may modify normal ground time (with
       concurrence of controlling agency):
          3.10.8.7.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.8.7.2. To no less than 12 hours from the start of crew rest until mission
          reporting. Before reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time,
          time to load patients and cargo, and other factors peculiar to the mission. The
          controlling C2 agency will not ask the PIC to accept less than a normal ground time.
          Waivers for exercises and contingencies are IAW AFI 11-202V3.
          3.10.8.7.3. To a maximum of 36 hours, when the crew has completed three
          consecutive near-maximum FDPs.

NOTE: Flight crews should be afforded crew rest times in excess of the minimum at en route
stations, when possible, to give crews the opportunity to overcome the cumulative affects of
fatigue while flying on several consecutive days or transiting several time zones.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Crew alerts will be per applicable MDS. Alert times usually allow 1 hour for
   reporting and an adequate number of hours for mission preparation. Refer to Table 3.2.
 32                                             AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


EXCEPTION: Crew alerts for local training sorties will be per applicable AFI 11-2MDS V3 and
local operating procedures. Self-alert procedures may also be used for normal local training
missions.
   3.11.1. (349AMW) All local training sorties will be "Self Alert." During WOC operating
   hours, crewmembers should call the WOC (424-5678) to ascertain mission and aircraft
   status. Outside of WOC operating hours, crewmembers should call the 60th AMW
   Command Post (424-5517) to ascertain mission and aircraft status.

Table 3.2. AE Crew Alert Times.

                                 Aircraft        Alert Time
                                   C-21             3 + 00
                                  C-130             3 +15
                                  C-141             3 + 15
                                   C-17             3 +45
                                   C-5              4 +15
                                 KC-135             4 +15
                                  KC-10             4 +15


       3.11.1.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD.
       The MCD will alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the primary Pilot in Command,
       local AMC C2 agency and the MCD before mission execution.
       3.11.1.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will
       contact AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The
       MCD will make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission
       irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-
       emergencies. Crew rest will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
       3.11.1.3. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of the
       patient(s) and aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart
       (i.e. MX problems) or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from
       the front-end crew. The MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the
       Pilot in Command and local AMC C2 agency to de-conflict problems.
       3.11.1.4. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
       missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
       avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
       3.11.1.5. (Added-349AMW) The 349th AMW Wing Operations Center (WOC) alerts
       all crewmembers for off station training missions. AES crewmembers self alerting from
       home station for a mission (MSN) will call the 349 WOC (commercial 707-424-5678) to
       verify the MSN show time and inform the WOC that an alert call is not necessary. AE
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               33


       crewmembers who reside outside the local commute area should call the WOC to verify
       mission times and may self alert. In general, crewmembers are encouraged to wait for an
       alert call rather than self alert in the event the aircraft is delayed.
       3.11.1.6. (Added-349AMW) AECMs report to the 349 AES after alert for mission
       briefing and to gather mission equipment and supplies. The pilot and MCD will normally
       brief at the aircraft. When the AES flies with crews from other bases, the flight crews will
       usually arrive the day prior to the mission. The MCD is encouraged to call or have the
       Pilot In Command (PIC) call them to discuss the mission, but in the event this is not
       possible the unit scheduler will normally talk to the pilot or a member of the flight crew
       to establish a communications link and discuss mission information and exchange phone
       numbers. The MCD may call 60 AMW CP to leave his/her contact number so the PIC
       can call him/her prior to going into crew rest.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
       12 hours when deadheading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
       more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
       necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       he/she will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours from
       the time of notification.
       3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if a mission can’t depart within 4
       hours of scheduled takeoff time, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and establish a new
       expected alert time. The PIC may extend takeoff window to 6 hours.
3.12. Stage Management. (Not applicable to ANG and AFRC).
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to Legal For Alert time. This allows crew members 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO

status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/DO may extend this period for contingencies. After 48 hours,
launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest.
   3.13.1. ALPHA Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and aircrew
   as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. Once SQ/CC forms an ALFA
   Standby Force, that aircrew will accomplish follow-on pre-flights required by technical
   manuals. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest.
   Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while
   performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-
   flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Exception: C-21 aircraft
   launch in 2 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP
   when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
   into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby Force
   duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour
   crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.

NOTE: OG/CCs should develop local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
3.14. Not Used.

   the flight authorization or DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
   3.17.5. Touch-and-go landings may be performed with MEGPs, however, simulated
   emergency procedures are prohibited. EXCEPTION: Air-Refueling practice emergency
   separations may be performed with MEGPs on board, as well as AE simulated emergency
   procedures.
3.18. Not Used.
3.19. Policies Governing Attendants.
   3.19.1. If an attendant is determined to be unacceptable, the MCD contacts the C2 agency
   for resolution.
   3.19.2. Medical Attendants (MA) provide patient care, documentation, and support under the
   direction and supervision of the MCD.
   3.19.3. MAs and Non-Medical Attendant (NMAs) accompany patients from point of origin
   to point of destination MTF. AECMs should offer relief to MAs/NMAs when mission
   requirements allow.

NOTE: AE system is not responsible for returning attendants to their originating location.
   3.19.4. A CCATT may also fly with the AE crew based on medical conditions of a specific
   patient(s). CCATT members are classified as Operational Support Flyers.
   3.19.5. Attendants (except flight surgeons and CCATT team members) and Escort Guards
   do not log any type of flight time.
   3.19.6. Guards of Prisoner Patients:
       3.19.6.1. Accompanies assigned prisoner-patients to their destination facility.
       3.19.6.2. Turns in weapons and ammunition to the PIC/LM/BO, as required by
       appropriate AFI 11-2MDS V3 instructions.
       3.19.6.3. Coordinates with the MCD when handcuffs (if applicable) may be removed
       from the prisoner-patient while the aircraft is airborne.
       3.19.6.4. Prohibited from handcuffing prisoner patients to any portion of the aircraft.
   3.19.7. Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW). When/if EPWs are moved through the AE
   system, originating medical facilities will coordinate/arrange for appropriate host support
   agencies to provide guards for prisoners on AE missions. The AE system does not have the
   capability to provide guards, and prisoners will not be accepted into the AE system without
   guards. Guards assigned to medical prisoners must accompany them to the destination
   facility. AECMs will not accept custody of prisoners. The AE system is not responsible for
   returning guards to the originating location.
   3.19.8. Detainee Transport. Detainee missions fall under the responsibility of Security
   Forces and are politically sensitive. Providing AE medical support for detainee missions will

                  AIRCRAFT MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Some medical equipment is incompatible with the airborne environment. AE approved
   medical equipment is identified in AFI 41-309, Aeromedical Evacuation Equipment
   Standards.
   4.1.2. All medical equipment will be tested, deemed airworthy and approved for use through
   HQ AMC/A37VM. A specific test protocol establishing test and evaluation methods is
   developed for each piece of equipment. Tests include altitude/rapid decompression,
   vibration, electromagnetic interference and in-flight performance. In addition, explosive
   vapor testing has been added to all applicable equipment to ensure safety of operation in Fuel
   Vapor Bearing Area (FVBA) i.e. KC-135 aircraft. All applicable equipment listed in AFI 41-
   309 has passed explosive vapor testing.

WARNING: The Airdyne 3500 Air Compressor is not approved for use on the KC-135.
   4.1.3. Medical equipment and supplies are vital to the AE mission. There are many hazards
   associated with the changing in-flight environmental conditions that are not encountered in
   fixed facilities. Equipment used onboard AE aircraft must continue to operate properly under
   flight conditions. It is essential AECMs know the capability and performance limitations of
   each specific equipment item.
   4.1.4. HQ AMC/A37VM ensures standardization for equipment used system wide to
   enhance AECM equipment training, and provide for better equipment management.
4.2. Not Used.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. HQ AMC/A37VM is the waiver authority for non-certified/non-standard
medical equipment required for patient moves. Waiver requests will be routed as follows:
hospital/MTF will notify appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC), PMRC
will contact appropriate C2 agency, C2 agency will contact TACC AE Cell, AE Cell will contact
A37VM. A37VM will consult with 311 HSW/YAML (AE Equipment Lab) during their hours of
operation. Further consultation on clinical impact will occur with the Global Patient Movement
Requirements Center (GPMRC), flight surgeon on duty.
   4.3.1. Waiver will be obtained prior to use of non-certified/non-standard equipment onboard
   the aircraft and applies only to that specific mission.
   4.3.2. HQ AMC/A37VM maintains a historical equipment waiver log which includes:
       4.3.2.1. Type of aircraft, by mission design series (MDS), equipment was used on.
       4.3.2.2. Comment on continuous or intermittent use.
       4.3.2.3. Comment on use during all phases of flight.
       4.3.2.4. Product name.
       4.3.2.5. Model number.

      4.3.2.6. Serial number.
      4.3.2.7. Any problems reported by crew.
      4.3.2.8. The validating flight surgeon makes the medical recommendation for use of non-
      certified equipment. The attending physician must be advised of the known operational
      limitations of the equipment and the possible effect this equipment may have on the
      patient’s status in-flight. The attending physician will determine if transportation onboard
      AE aircraft remains in the best interest of the patient. In these cases, AECMs will be
      informed of any operational limitations applied to any piece of waived equipment.
      4.3.2.9. The MCD must inform the flight crew when waived medical equipment is used
      and any characteristics that may affect aircraft systems. The PIC is the final authority for
      use of the equipment.
   4.3.3. Long-term (permanent) waivers to carry non-certified equipment must be initiated by
   TACC AE Cell with coordination between HQ AMC/A3. HQ AMC/A3 is the approval
   authority for long-term waivers.
4.4. Not Used.
4.5. Not Used.
4.6. Not Used.
4.7. Not Used.
4.8. Not Used.
4.9. Not Used.
4.10. Use of Medical Equipment Onboard Aeromedical Evacuation Aircraft.
   4.10.1. Patient Movement Clinical Coordinators (PMCCs) and AECMs must ensure that
   equipment brought to the aircraft from originating hospitals is airworthiness approved for in-
   flight use.
4.11. Special Considerations:
   4.11.1. Certain items, such as anti-shock trousers, will require special precautions when
   taken to altitude. Altitude restrictions may possibly be imposed or patient transfer delayed.
   The Validating Flight Surgeon will be consulted when such items are required. The
   Validating Flight Surgeon will advise on any special nursing care requirements and the best
   method to affect the transfer.
   4.11.2. All air filled balloon devices (e.g., ET tubes, foleys, etc.) will usually be filled with
   normal saline by the originating MTF to avoid the repeated pressure exposure by
   expansion/contraction of the balloons during changes in altitude. AECMs will check to
   ensure this precaution has been accomplished to prevent soft tissue damage and/or irritation.
   The C2 agency will also coordinate with the MTF. NOTE: The CCATT physician may elect
   to fill endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuffs with air and then attach to a cuff pressure
   monitor to minimize tissue trauma and complications of reintubation.
   4.11.3. Water seal drainage systems, which use fluid to establish suction, will be checked
   frequently to ensure evaporation/changes in pressure does not reduce suction.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                            39


   4.11.4. Electrical equipment will not be plugged in until after the aircraft system has been
   turned on. When using the Electrical Cable Assembly Set (ECAS), follow instructions as
   written in T.O. 8A23-6-1 and AFI 41-309, Aeromedical Evacuation Equipment Standards.
   4.11.5. “Oxygen available” means oxygen can be made quickly available to the patients.
   Positioning of a flow meter, O2 adapter and unopened mask or nasal cannula somewhere in
   the vicinity of the patient, meets this requirement.

NOTE: The AE crew is not required to have therapeutic oxygen immediately available for space
available passengers.
   4.11.6. Emergency drug kits will contain current ACLS Algorithms.
   4.11.7. At RON stations without an AE element/detachment, MCD/CMT will accomplish
   the following:
       4.11.7.1. Ensure there are adequate and secure storage facilities for medical equipment.
       4.11.7.2. The mission assigned AE crew is responsible for the actual cleaning of the
       medical equipment. If the AE crew is required to terminally clean any AE medical
       equipment, the crew duty day does not end until all duties are completed.
4.12. Minimum Equipment List Required For Flight.
   4.12.1. AECMs are responsible for all medical supplies and equipment.
   4.12.2. AE In-Flight Kit, Packaging Guide/Allowance Standard establishes a standardized
   packaging guide for all medications, supplies, and equipment carried in the AE In-flight Kit.
   Each unit is provided a minimum of two operational in-flight kits (increments one and two).
   Increment one supports 1-25 patients. Increment two is added to support 26-50 patients. The
   senior nurse executive is the final authority to determine which increments will best meet
   patient care requirements.
       4.12.2.1. (Added-349AMW) Unless otherwise designated, AE crews will utilize in-
       flight kit increment 1 for AE training missions. The AES Chief Nurse (CN) has
       determined that unless otherwise notified, AE crews will not utilize real Controlled
       Medications for training missions although Medical Crew Coordinators (MCCs) may use
       simulated Controlled Medications kits and drugs if required for training scenarios. The
       AES has two kits, (“red” and “blue”) that are utilized for missions (operational or
       training). Both kits are maintained in operationally ready status. Either set may be used
       for missions, although Medical Logistics personnel should indicate a specific kit for a
       particular mission.
   4.12.3. Personnel will use the Allowance Standard to inventory the kit and when completed,
   turn in to the AE equipment management section. Units will not deviate from the equipment
   standard without concurrence from HQ AMC/A37V. Unit procedures will be established to
   replenish medications, equipment, and supplies and ensure proper equipment maintenance at
   home and RON stations. Units will download most current AE Packaging Guide on the first
   day of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct).
       4.12.3.1. (Added-349AMW) AE crews inventory the in-flight kits on the last mission
       sortie of the day, IAW AFI 11-2AEV3, CL-1, Aeromedical Evacuation Crew (AEC)
       Checklist. Stock levels and expiration dates will be checked. Inventory sheets will be

         derived from the latest Allowance Standard. Missing items will be replaced in the kits on
         mission termination at the unit from stock on hand, or a clear list of items that need to be
         restocked will be left for Medical Logistics personnel. Medical equipment will be tagged
         with Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 350, if maintenance is required or if
         broken and cleaned IAW current infection control procedures found in the Medical
         Logistics equipment cleaning area.
    4.12.4. When the in-flight kit is formally tasked for deployment, both increments will be
    deployed.
    4.12.5. Each mission has unique equipment requirements based on aircraft type, available
    aircraft systems, distances/times and the types of patients being airlifted and the frequency of
    urgent patient movement requests. In order to ensure a minimum level of equipment on all
    patient flights, the following will be carried:

AET for baggage procedures the 3rd AET will proceed to Base Operations to drop off meal
request/money (as applicable) and then proceed to Life Support and request and pick-up
AECM quick-don masks while at home station. Note: Upon return to home station the 3rd
AET is responsible for returning the quick-don masks to Life Support.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.24.1. Aircraft Refueling. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the
   aircraft and prior to enplaning that station's patients.
       6.24.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       6.24.1.2. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft inter-
       phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations
       provided it does not radiate energy. (Do not turn electronic equipment on or off during
       refueling. Exception: Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to
       operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
   6.24.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent servicing (CS) is the simultaneous
   servicing of fuel or oxygen with or without patients and passengers on board while cargo
   loading/unloading or maintenance operations are being performed.
56                                           AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


     6.24.2.1. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members
     and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001 The Fire
     Protection Operations And Fire Prevention Program and TO 00-25-172. The CSS will
     coordinate with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
     6.24.2.2. CS may be accomplished with patients onboard the C-17, C-130, C-141 and
     KC-10 provided the guidance below is met. For C21 aircraft, utilize MDS-specific
     guidance for CS per para 6.24.3.3.2.
        6.24.2.2.1. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients,
        passengers, and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
        6.24.2.2.2. A current and qualified crewmember for the type of aircraft being
        serviced will be appointed as a Passenger Compartment Monitor (PCM) and shall
        continuously monitor patients and passengers during CS. PCMs will not perform
        other duties during servicing. EXCEPTION: see MDS guidance below. ECMs and
        passenger service representatives will not serve as PCMs.
        6.24.2.2.3. The PCM will brief patients and passengers on emergency egress, exit
        prohibitions, and hazards. Ambulatory patients and passengers will remain seated but
        will not wear seatbelts during CS. When possible, the PCM should conduct the
        briefing prior to servicing.
        6.24.2.2.4. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding
        the overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
        6.24.2.2.5. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
        observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
        6.24.2.2.6. The PIC, designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs and
        AECMs when to evacuate patients and passengers.
        6.24.2.2.7. Patients will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers
        may enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with
        the concurrent servicing operation. Individuals must properly ground themselves
        before boarding the aircraft.
        6.24.2.2.8. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the
        refueling process. Onload/offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after
        refueling.
        6.24.2.2.9. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
        combat environment.
  6.24.3. MDS-specific guidance for CS:
     6.24.3.1. C-5 Aircraft.
        6.24.3.1.1. Emergency exits. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary
        emergency exit will remain open and stairs/stands in place. If exits are not open due
        to inclement weather, the loadmaster will configure exits for immediate egress.
        6.24.3.1.2. Stairs/Stands. Unless specifically waived, stairs are required for CS
        (AMC/A3 or MAJCOM/DO may waive stair requirements for C-5 aircraft with
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                             57


        operational escape slides). The CSS and PCM will periodically check and reposition
        stairs that are out of place due to settling. A stair truck operator will remain at the
        aircraft to facilitate repositioning.
     6.24.3.2. KC-10 Aircraft.
        6.24.3.2.1. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will
        remain open and the stairs in place. Fuel servicing is limited to the right side. Close
        and arm all doors except the open entry door. If entry door is closed due to inclement
        weather, do not arm. Stairs will remain in place.
     6.24.3.3. C-17 Aircraft.
        6.24.3.3.1. The PCM may load small floor-loaded cargo, however, loading shall not
        detract from monitoring duties.
            6.24.3.3.1.1. Passengers are not allowed on board unless expressly directed by
            MAJCOM/A3/DO, DIRMOBFOR, or in combat. AE patients are excluded from
            this restriction.
        6.24.3.3.2. C-21 Aircraft.
            6.24.3.3.2.1. IAW Interim Operational Supplement T.O. 00-25-172S-3,
            concurrent servicing is authorized for the C-21. However, the decision to refuel
            with patients on board must be made judiciously and only after the PIC briefs the
            MCD and the patient, on the emergency evacuation plan prior to commencing
            refueling operations. Concurrent servicing is only authorized under the following
            conditions:
               6.24.3.3.2.1.1. If deplaning a critical patient would increase risk by an
               additional move off and back on the aircraft, or
               6.24.3.3.2.1.2. If there is no suitable location on the airfield to house the
               patient during the refueling, or
               6.24.3.3.2.1.3. If no suitable transportation (ambulance) is available to move
               the patient from the aircraft, or
               6.24.3.3.2.1.4. If the patient would be exposed to inclement weather.
            6.24.3.3.2.2. The aircraft door will remain open during all phases of the refueling
            operation with patients onboard. External power may be applied and cockpit
            aeromedical switches may be placed to the ON position prior to the start of
            refueling operations. Medical life support equipment may also be operated on
            battery power during refueling operations.
            6.24.3.3.2.3. As an additional safety measure, the PIC will ensure a fire truck is
            near the aircraft before commencing concurrent refueling and one C-21 pilot must
            remain at the aircraft at all times during refueling. Stable, ambulatory patients will
            routinely be deplaned during refueling if there is a suitable area to provide them
            shelter.
     6.24.3.4. C-130 Aircraft.
 58                                               AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


           6.24.3.4.1. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary exit will remain
           open and stairs in place.
           6.24.3.4.2. DELETE
       6.24.3.5. C-141 Aircraft.
           6.24.3.5.1. Primary exits are crew entrance door and left troop door. The PCM may
           lower, but not lock the left paratroop door during inclement weather.
           6.24.3.5.2. The PCM may load small, floor loaded cargo, however, loading shall not
           detract from monitoring duties.
   6.24.4. Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR).
       6.24.4.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-
       172. Stand-by CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations. A CFR vehicle
       may be available upon request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
       6.24.4.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the
       controlling agency will coordinate CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR
       vehicle coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from
       occurring.
   6.24.5. Ground Operations. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning
   of patients. Exception: ERO procedures as outlined in 20.4.
6.25. Not Used.
6.26. Aircrew Life Support Requirements. Aircrew life support includes those systems,
subsystems, emergency survival equipment, and techniques that will sustain life in-flight, afford
varying degrees of protection and enhance survival potential during and after in-flight
emergencies, crash landing, or ditching.
   6.26.1. Aircrew life support requirements are specified in AFI 11-301, Vol 1, Aircrew Life
   Support (ALS) Program. Emergency/aircrew life support equipment required onboard AE
   missions is specified in the applicable AFI 11-2X-XXX V3, Addenda A.
       6.26.1.1. For C-5, C-17, C-130, C-141, KC-10 and KC-135 missions, the LM/BO is
       responsible for checking aircrew life support equipment. The CMT must coordinate with
       the LM/BO to determine that sufficient aircrew life support equipment is onboard prior to
       departure. The CMT must ensure all aircrew life support equipment is distributed and
       immediately available to all patients before mission departure. The LM/BO is responsible
       for noting unserviceable/missing aircrew life support items on the AFTO IMT 46,
       Preposition Life Support Equipment. For C-21, the PIC is responsible for checking
       aircrew life support equipment.
       6.26.1.2. A MA-1 walk-around bottle satisfies the AECM oxygen requirement for pre-
       planned flights above FL 350.
       6.26.1.3. The A-21 regulators of some MA-1 bottles are modified to restrict flow of
       oxygen during servicing. The modification is designed to reduce risk of fire when
       servicing bottles off aircraft. Unfortunately, restricted flow increases on-aircraft fill time
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               59


       from 30-45 seconds (unmodified regulator) to as much as 3.5 minutes (modified
       regulator). Under certain conditions, bottles are depleted faster than they can be refilled.
          6.26.1.3.1. Identification. Regulator type is determined by viewing the inside of the
          fill nozzle. Unmodified regulators have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling a
          standard tire valve stem. Modified regulators have a brass plate/filter covering inside
          of nozzle.
          6.26.1.3.2. Basic Operation. Except for the fill times, operation of the bottle is not
          affected.
              6.26.1.3.2.1. AE missions. All additional bottles required for AECMs should be
              unmodified. All cargo compartment recharger outlets shall function for
              operational and training missions. AECMs will check regulator type during pre-
              flight.
       6.26.1.4. AECMs will not remove the LM/BO emergency equipment (cargo
       compartment quick dons/smoke masks) for use.
       6.26.1.5. AE units will not maintain MA-1 portable oxygen bottles. Dash 21/Alternate
       Mission Equipment (AME) shops will ensure MA-1 portable oxygen bottles are
       serviceable and properly maintained and stored. Dash 21/AME shops will ensure a
       sufficient number of unmodified MA-1 portable oxygen bottles are delivered to the
       aircraft to meet scheduled AE mission requirements. This information also applies to
       PBEs, EPOS, POKs, etc. MA-1 bottles will be delivered to the aircraft filled.

NOTE: If a MA-1 bottle is accidentally left open or the system is depleted and not recharged
within two hours, bottles will be purged as follows:
          6.26.1.5.1. Fill the bottle using oxygen recharger hose until full (300 psi [+/- 25 psi]).
          6.26.1.5.2. Turn MA-1 bottle upside down and turn to “EMERGENCY” setting until
          empty.
          6.26.1.5.3. Repeat for a total of three times.
       6.26.1.6. If integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft,
       carry POKs or EPOS. POKs or EPOS will be distributed and their use demonstrated prior
       to flight. Ensure litter patients POK or EPOS are readily available for use. Mixing EPOS
       and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized.
       6.26.1.7. Crewmembers check their emergency oxygen equipment during the preflight
       inspection. Oxygen equipment will be immediately available at each crew position and
       individual masks will not be disconnected until all patients/attendants and passengers
       have deplaned.

EXCEPTION: The 3AET may disconnect and off load his/her mask if duties require him/her to
depart the flight line.

EXCEPTION: If all patients and attendants have been deplaned and the AECMs are deplaning
at that station; AECMs may remove oxygen masks if the passengers will be supervised by the
flight crew.

   6.26.2. Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE), if available, are excellent for use in smoke,
   fume, or fire environments. They need not be limited to “escape” only conditions; these
   devices can be used as an oxygen source in a rapid or slow decompression.
   6.26.3. Rafts. On over water flights do not carry more patients and passengers and
   crewmembers than on board life rafts will accommodate.
   6.26.4. LPUs. The loadmaster will place an LPU within easy reach of each seated
   patient/passenger and aircrew member prior to takeoff on over water flights. Crewmembers
   will fit and adjust LPUs (if applicable) for over water flights and will wear them on over
   water missions below 2000 feet. (EXCEPTION: LPUs do not need to be worn for takeoffs,
   landings, or approaches). Ensure the appropriate number of LPU 6P’s are aboard for over
   water missions carrying infants. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for litter patients.

6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Not Mission Capable Supply
(NMCS), Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments,
and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. NMCS/VVIP/FSS shipments should not be moved on AE missions without the
   consent of the TACC AE Cell for CONUS and intertheater AE missions or the respective
   theater Air Operations Center (AOC) for AE missions within the overseas theater.

Section 6D— Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures (home or rotational station) are on time if the
aircraft is airborne within -20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time (or as specified in a
MAJCOM supplement to this AFI).
   6.31.1. Early Departures:
      6.31.1.1. Home Station. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to
      weather, ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission
      flow during a large scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels.
      6.31.1.2. En route Stations. Early departures at en route stations may be authorized
      through C2 channels, provided the impact on local and downrange facilities and crew
      duty is evaluated.
      6.31.1.3. The MCD will document events and circumstances on AF IMT 3829,
      Summary of Patients Evacuated by Air (or TRAC2ES equivalent) IAW current
      Aeromedical Evacuation Forms Guide.
   6.31.2. AE Call Sign and Use of Priority Clearance.
      6.31.2.1. For operational (vice ARM) AE missions, use the call sign “Air Evac”
      followed by the five digit aircraft number (i.e., Air Evac 12345) or mission designator (as
      required by FLIP). Revert to standard call sign when the AE portion of the mission is
      completed.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                            61


       6.31.2.2. AIR EVAC Priority. The PIC may request “AIR EVAC priority” for
       preferential ATC handling if a delay will affect a patient’s well being. AIR EVAC
       priority will only be used for that portion of the flight requiring expedited handling. Do
       not request priority for routine air evacuations to avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It
       is the pilot in command’s responsibility to use this option only for bona fide medical
       situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
   6.31.3. Aircraft Pressurization. The MCD will verify the PIC has been advised of any
   cabin altitude or rate of cabin altitude change restrictions during the pre-flight briefing
   update.

representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew life support, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire or
   remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF IMT
   4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO IMT 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew life support and survival equipment have been certified as
   installed by aircrew life support and that configuration documents match mission
   requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-
   water missions carrying children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. AECMs discovering equipment missing will notify LM/BO.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions. No-show patient or passenger baggage or baggage of patients or
passengers removed from flight will be off-loaded prior to departure.
   6.51.1. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage unless the baggage has been
   processed through traffic management office (TMO) or installation transportation office
   (ITO) and arrives to the aircraft as freight.
   6.51.2. Baggage that becomes separated from the owner becomes freight. Direct personnel
   to turn unaccompanied baggage over to TMO/ITO for proper manifesting.

                                            Chapter 7

                                     AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(Hijacking), AFI 31-101, V1, Air Force Physical Security Program, and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of
the controlling agency. See applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
7.3. Air Force Physical Security Program. See applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance for
aircraft specifics. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Physical Security Program (as needed):
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via
   a roving patrol and a two-person armed response capability within 5 minutes.
   7.3.2. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.3. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft.
   7.3.4. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxies.
7.4. En route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. PICs will receive a threat assessment and en route
security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 agency as required. If required, a security
team (PHOENIX RAVEN) will be assigned to the mission.
   7.4.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of two USAF security force members, but
   may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel status is determined
   by MAJCOM. The team is responsible to the PIC at all times, and in turn, PICs are
   responsible for their welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). PICs will ensure security team
   members receive a full aircrew briefing.
   7.4.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.4.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, the PIC will use AF IMT 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.4.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
 64                                               AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


      7.4.2.3. Inadequate security. If, in the PIC’s opinion, airfield security is inadequate and
      the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the flight duty period limits
      and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base with adequate
      security. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical.
      If departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.
      In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will
      be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk. The PIC should
      rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew
      rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the nearest DoD installation,
      US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
          7.4.2.3.1. MCD responsibilities. Coordinate with PIC regarding the force protection
          for the aircraft. Determine patient needs, assess local area for support, request C2
          support. If unable to depart from local area, MCD will coordinate patients care,
          shelter and protection as required.
   7.4.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199,
   USAF Restricted Area Badge, supported by an entry access list (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
      7.4.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals such as cargo handlers can perform their
      duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
      7.4.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.5. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.5.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC's judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.5.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.5.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.5.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
      7.5.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.5.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the OSI, security forces or local
      authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.5.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel
   wells, baggage compartments, and other aircraft specific locations for unauthorized
   packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security
   forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff
   activities.
7.6. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               65


   7.6.1. Federal law vests the understanding of Transportation for Security with exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) situations involving all aircraft (civil and military) in the special aircraft
   jurisdiction of the United States, whether in-flight or not. (See 49 U.S.C.44903(e), 46501 &
   46502
   7.6.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.6.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with
   all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD
   prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.6.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is onboard and the
   aircraft is operationally ready for flight.
   7.6.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.6.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.6.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.6.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.6.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying patients and passengers, the primary concern is the
   safety of the patients and passengers.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When an aircraft is operating
away from home station, the PIC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207, as
supplemented, are complied with.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service
   representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage
   is accomplished.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
       7.7.2.1. The MCD will ensure that the anti-hijacking statement is included and signed on
       appropriate mission paperwork by MTF/civilian sources, prior to accepting patients for
       enplaning.
 66                                              AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Patients and passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in
   hand-carried baggage onboard an aircraft except special agents, guards of the Secret Service
   or State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons.
       7.7.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical
       situation dictates, weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team
       leader, after coordination with the PIC.
7.8. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.8.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.8.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.8.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.8.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.8.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose area of responsibility (AOR) the airfield
           lies.
           7.8.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.8.1.2.4. PIC.
7.9. In-flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.9.1. Engage the hijackers in conversation to calm him or her and to evaluate what course
   of action might be effective.
   7.9.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.9.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                              67


   7.9.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a hostile,
   country.
   7.9.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.10. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up
with situation reports as circumstances permit. See applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance for
aircraft specifics.
7.11. Not Used.
7.12. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one pilot
(or extra flight deck crewmember) and one LM/BO will carry weapons. All crewmembers should
know who is armed.
   7.12.1. AECMs will not be armed in-flight.
   7.12.2. For contingencies. AECMs will arm IAW mission directive or as directed by the
   AMC Threat Working Group (TWG), OPORD and/or TACC. Unless otherwise directed by
   the AMC TWG, OPORD and/or TACC, AECMs will not be armed in-flight. Weapons will
   be stored in the gun box. Weapons do not need to be unloaded before placing them in a gun
   box. AECMs will re-arm after landing, as required IAW theater policy.

NOTE: Theater in-flight arming policy may differ from policy for missions transiting the AOR.
   7.12.3. Weapons issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapon from home unit.
   7.12.4. Weapons Loading/Transfer. Load and unload weapons in approved clearing areas.
   When transferring a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon on a flat
   surface. Do not use hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.12.5. Weapons Storage During Crew Rest.
       7.12.5.1. AECMs will comply with local arming procedures to include storage at RON
       locations. NOTE: If RON Station is not within the AOR, AECMs will not normally
       wear weapons off the flight line except to and from the C2 and armories. Aircrews,
       including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.12.5.2. If an armory is unavailable, AECMs will store weapons as directed by the Pilot
       in Command.
       7.12.5.3. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
       termination at home station.
7.13. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
The following considerations may help crewmembers avoid becoming victims of terrorism when
operating in overseas locations:
   7.13.1. Personal conduct. Crews must realize their conduct can make them a target for
   individuals dissatisfied with US foreign involvement in their national affairs. Local foreign
68                                               AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


  nationals may or may not condone a military presence - crew conduct will be watched and
  judged. Therefore, utilize the following:
     7.13.1.1. Maintain good military bearing both on and off duty.

           8.1.2.1.9. Inappropriate use of alcohol and effects of hangover that affect in-flight
           duties (crewmembers only).
           8.1.2.1.10. Illness (both acute and pre-existing), including food poisoning,
           dehydration, myocardial infarction, seizure, and so forth.
           8.1.2.1.11. Exposure to toxic, noxious, or irritating materials such as smoke, fumes,
           or liquids.

NOTE: In the event of a physiological episode, all crewmembers and passengers involved will
report to a flight surgeon as soon as practical and request that an AF IMT 711GA Life Sciences
Report of an Individual Involved in an AF Accident/Incident, Section A, Aircraft
Accident/Incident, be accomplished. If these events affected a patient, the MCD will document
events and interventions on AF IMT 3829, Summary of Patients Evacuated by Air (or
TRAC2ES equivalent) IAW current Aeromedical Evacuation Forms Guide, as well as DD Form
2852, Aeromedical Evacuation Event/Near Miss Report, per 8.15 of this AFI.

   of Care, Attachment 14, for AE Patient Safety Program.
8.16. Apparent Patient Death in Flight. When a suspected death occurs in-flight, the planned
itinerary will not be interrupted if the next scheduled stop is that patient’s destination. If the next
stop is not the patient’s destination and the aircraft is not in a critical phase of flight, the MCD
may contact the AE C2 agencies to discuss options. If the aircraft is in critical phase of flight or
has landed the MCD will contact AE C2 agencies and make arrangements to have physician
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                                 73


meet the aircraft if appropriate and pronounce the patient dead. Once pronounced, the patient
will be off-loaded.
8.16. (349AMW)Post Mission Documentation.
   8.16.1. When notified by the MCD that a suspected death has occurred, the PIC should
   immediately provide C2 agencies with the following information: “A suspected death has
   occurred on mission number________. ETA to ________ is __________Z, patient cite
   number______.” The PIC relays this information to the controlling agency for relay to the
   appropriate C2 agencies. NOTE: No personal data such as name, SSN, etc. will be
   transmitted, to preclude premature release prior to notification of the next of kin.
   8.16.1. (349AMW) AFI 11-401, Aviation Management requires one AFTO 781, ARMS
   Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, for each mission number. MCDs will add the AE
   crew to the AFTO 781 for the mission. At mission termination before leaving the aircraft, the
   MCD must ensure that times have been correctly annotated for each crewmember, to include
   night time, along with all required remarks, crewmember status and sortie count. Ensure that
   the flight crew has annotated their unit’s Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)
   office phone number at the bottom of the sheet and that the form is signed. Leave the AFTO
   781 with the flight crew if a home station crew/aircraft. If other than a Travis assigned
   aircraft, the MCD will obtain a certified extract of the AFTO 781 and a copy of the flight
   crew orders.
   8.16.2. If a physician is onboard during the flight he/she may pronounce death in-flight. The
   MCD will document time of pronouncement in “Z” time and the physician will co-sign the
   DD Form 602 or AF IMT 3829. The MCD will contact C2 agencies to alert them of situation
   (using paragraph 8.16.3 guidance) to determine destination.
   8.16.2. (349AMW) MCDs and MCCs will complete Mission Accomplishment Report
   (MAR) sheets and AF 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and
   medical events check list at the end of the mission day. The senior ranking enlisted should
   complete the AFTR worksheet and enter it into AFTRs. Keep a record of flying time in order
   to complete the Travis AFB Form 73, Travis Mission History Report, and the AF 3956,
   Report of Inactive Duty Training Performance –AGTP/AFTP USAFR paperwork. MCDs will
   obtain a copy of the flight crew orders.
   8.16.3. If a patient expires on an AE mission, the MCD has several decision points. First, if
   the next destination is the deceased deplaning point, the body will be off-loaded at that
   destination regardless if military or civilian. The MCD will contact the deplaning airfield’s
   Air Transportation Operations Center (ATOC) and request mortuary affairs at military
   installations or, civilian coroner at civilian airfields. Once the aircraft has landed, follow that
   airfield’s guidelines for death certificate and body removal. Once the patient has been
   pronounced deceased, airlift ceases, unless the MCD/PIC contact C2 authorities for unique
   situations (see paragraph 8.17). Do not continue airlift without a death certificate.
   8.16.3. (349AMW) The SARM, DO, FN and AET should conduct an end of mission review
   whenever feasible.
   8.16.4. In the event of patient death in flight or patient death within 24 hours of flight, upon
   mission completion the AES/CC shall ground the involved AEC and conduct an investigation
   to determine if the AEC followed all aircrew procedures. If necessitated, appropriate actions
 74                                              AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


   will be taken to resolve any digressions (AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification,
   retraining, etc.) prior to returning individual(s) involved to flying status. AE unit commander
   shall notify Operations Group Commander who will notify the MAJCOM DO of incident
   and actions taken.

NOTE: In the event of interfly or deployed AECMs, the home unit Commander or home
Operations Group Commander will be notified of the incident by the C2 agency with operational
control of the mission. Interview may be conducted by phone. If AF IMT 8 action is required,
AECMs will be sent home unit.
8.17. Airlift of Human Remains. Remains of deceased personnel will not normally be carried
on AE missions. However, in the interest of timely movement or other factors, which cannot
otherwise be satisfied by subsequent airlift, transportation of remains may be authorized. For
TACC controlled missions, submit requests for movement of remains on aeromedical aircraft to
the TACC/APCC. The TACC/XOG, will provide approval. Approval authority will not be
delegated below the TACC/XOG level. For non-TACC controlled mission contact appropriate
C2 agency. If approval is granted to move remains on aeromedical mission, the ATOC chief will
ensure loading or offloading is accomplished discreetly; not concurrently with passenger and
patient loading or offloading. In such cases, the PIC will ensure the on-load, position, and off-
load are conducted in a discrete manner.
8.18. Patients Requesting Release from AE System.
   8.18.1. The MCD may release active duty patients/attendants only upon a competent medical
   authority's recommendation and with the concurrence of the active duty member's
   commander.
   8.18.2. The MCD will ensure AF IMT 3841, Certificate of Release, is completed when a
   non-active duty patient/attendant requests release from the AE system during a mission. If
   the patient is under the age of 18 years, the patient’s legal guardian must sign the form prior
   to the patients release.
       8.18.2.1. Whenever completing this form, ensure proper AE C2 agency is informed
       immediately.
       8.18.2.2. Prior to obtaining the signature of the requesting individual, the MCD
       determines if the individual is sufficiently competent to understand the purpose of the AF
       IMT 3841. If not, the MCD requests advice from a medical authority or the staff judge
       advocate at the place of requested debarkation, if such personnel are available. In all
       instances, guidance from the C2 agency should be requested.
   8.18.3. Prepare the AF IMT 3841 in triplicate. The original will be placed in the patient’s
   medical record; one (1) copy will be attached to the AF IMT 3829, (or TRAC2ES equivalent)
   to be filed upon termination of the mission; one (1) copy will be given to the individual
   requesting release from the AE system. Also, complete DD Form 2852.
   8.18.4. When a patient, or their authorized representative, requests release from further
   airlift, the MCD advises the individual requesting release, that the purpose of the AF IMT
   3841 is to release the U.S. Government, its’ agents, and employees from all responsibility for
   further aeromedical airlift services arising pursuant to the patient’s movement and any and all
   liability from resulting damages. The MCD also advises the patient, or their authorized
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                          75


   representative, of any risks which may arise from the patient’s request for release from the
   AE system. These risks are annotated on the AF IMT 3841. Patients requesting release from
   the AE system should be advised that signing the AF 3841 does not prohibit the individual
   from receiving future AE services.

NOTE: The individual's signature on the AF IMT 3841 indicates release of the AE system from
responsibility and liability for the patient requesting release from the AE system.
   8.18.5. Refusal to sign the AF IMT 3841 is annotated in the patient’s medical record.
   8.18.6. Ensure the patient is aware they may not be reimbursed for travel expenses if their
   orders require AE transportation.

         FLIGHT NURSE AND AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION TECHNICIAN
                             PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The primary duty of the FN and AET is to conduct AE operations. Primary
duties include mission planning, coordinating and supervising enplaning and deplaning of
patients, passengers and special medical equipment, and providing in-flight patient care and
assistance to patients and passengers. The FN and AET:
   13.1.1. Are specialists in nursing care of patients in a hypobaric environment.
   13.1.2. Have advanced training in the operation of specialized medical equipment designed
   and approved for use at altitude.
   13.1.3. Are trained and current in the aircraft systems and configurations required for safe
   AE operations.
   13.1.4. Provide in-flight assistance to medical attendants as situations dictate.
13.2. Aircraft Configuration.
   13.2.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during
   preflight, per AFI 11-2AE V3, Addenda A.
       13.2.1.1. Electrical lines will be positioned/attached/secured, equipment pre-flighted,
       plugged in and a functional check performed on the aircraft prior to enplaning patients.
       EXCEPTION: May be modified as situation dictates for operational contingency/combat
       missions.
       13.2.1.2. Oxygen lines will be secured prior to enplaning patients. EXCEPTION: For
       operational contingency/combat missions, oxygen lines will be secured prior to take-off.
       13.2.1.3. Roller conveyors will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets.
       Rollers on the ramp will be stowed during patient onloading and offloading operations.

WARNING: Roller conveyors will not be installed on the ramp during patient onloading or
offloading operations. If roller conveyors are stowed on the ramp, they should be removed
during patient onloading and offloading operations or positioned as close to the ramp edge as
possible.
       13.2.1.4. Litter support straps (C-130, C-141) will be secured to the aircraft floor prior to
       take-off. If litters are not in the tier, loose litter support straps will be secured in a top and
       bottom litter support bracket on the litter stanchion. This will prevent a free-swinging
       strap from becoming a hazard.
       13.2.1.5. A five (5) high configuration using the litter stanchions is approved for all C-
       130 AE missions.
       13.2.1.6. The seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed for all C-130 AE missions
       when cargo requirements permit.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                             81


       13.2.1.7. Ensure adequate space for in-flight treatment of litter patients. The vertical
       distance between each loaded litter will not be less than 21 inches (18 inches on C-130
       when loading 5-high).

NOTE: When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak
vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat and litter
stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear. If situation requires/permits,
remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated area.
   13.2.2. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin’s
   mission configuration.
       13.2.2.1. Refer to Section 20.3 of this AFI for enplaning/deplaning operational
       procedures.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   13.3.1. When patients and passengers are seated in side facing seats, the LM/BO will ensure
   there is sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit patients/passenger leg
   room.
   13.3.2. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps or chains,
   a 30-inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward litter or
   occupied seat. EXCEPTION: N/A on KC-135 and KC-10.

NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must fit under the seat and must not obstruct the safety
aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle-way will be stowed with checked
baggage.
   13.3.3. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 patients and
   passengers/troops. (This does not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape
   hatches are available for egress.) Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not
   considered an obstruction.

EXCEPTION: For KC-135, PSPs and litters cannot be placed in front of hatches.
   13.3.4. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   13.3.5. Ensure that only able-bodied adult, English-speaking patients or passengers are
   seated next to emergency exits.
   13.3.6. Make every effort to seat families together. Do not seat mothers with infants or
   children under 15 years old in seats adjacent to emergency exits.

NOTE: Patients classified as 3C may be seated next to emergency exits at the discretion of the
MCD/FN if they are able-bodied English speaking adults.
   13.3.7. A crewmember will provide individual briefings on the use of the exits.
13.4. Not Used.
13.5. Preflight Duties.

  13.5.1. All AECMs are expected to know emergency procedures. A oral review of
  procedures will be conducted by the MCD. Although a ground support crew may prepare the
  aircraft for an AE mission, it is the AE crew’s responsibility to ensure the aircraft has been
  properly serviced and restocked before accepting the aircraft for patient transport.
  13.5.2. All AECMs are responsible for completing the required aircraft preflight interior
  inspection, using the abbreviated checklist. All deficiencies and supply/equipment shortages
  noted during the preflight inspection will be corrected. AECMs pre-flighting medical
  equipment are responsible for ensuring completeness, serviceability, and functional operation
  of equipment on the aircraft.
  13.5.3. Patient/Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on aircraft. “Space A”
  passengers may be transported on AE missions. The PIC, with concurrence from the MCD,
  will make the final decision on “Space A” seat release. MCD must take into account number
  of seats reserved for litter get-up seats.
     13.5.3.1. The AEC are not passenger monitors. The AE crew will assist the LM/BO with
     observation and care of passengers when it does not interfere with primary duties.
     13.5.3.2. It may be necessary for AE crews to perform passenger service functions at
     stations that do not have this capability. These functions include manifesting, anti-
     hijacking, processing, and ensuring visa/passport requirements are met. Do not hesitate to
     contact TACC/APCC through 1-800 AIR MOBL, if any questions arise such as who may
     travel to specific locations or for passport/visa requirements. File a copy of the passenger
     manifest with the most responsible on-scene agency if there is no base operations or other
     agency responsible for filing the manifest.
     13.5.3.3. Aircraft seats identified in applicable T.O.s as ACM seats will not be used for
     patient/passenger seating.
     13.5.3.4. A passenger service representative or crewmember will assist passengers at the
     bottom of the steps, and an AECM may assist with seating passengers if it does not
     conflict with primary duties.
     13.5.3.5. All passengers, regardless of age, will be assigned a seat. The parent or
     guardian has the option to hold the infant or place them in an FAA approved infant car
     seat (ICS) in the assigned seat.
         13.5.3.5.1. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harness and vest child
         restraints.
         13.5.3.5.2. When a child/infant is held temporarily by an attendant and seated by
         another patient or passenger, they will be seated in a row with the proper number of
         oxygen masks (one [1] for each patient or passenger) if applicable.
         13.5.3.5.3. When a parent or attendant holds a child/infant, the seat belt is never
         placed around both the parent/attendant and the child/infant.
         13.5.3.5.4. In the event of turbulence, the weight of the adult against the child/infant
         could result in injury to the child/infant. The attendant will secure the seat belt around
         their waist, with the seat belt securing mechanism secured to the aisle side of the
         attendant (if possible) to prevent the child/infant from sitting on the securing
         mechanism. A litter strap is placed through the seat belt, around the child/infant, and
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                             83


           then secured. Additional padding should be placed between the child and the litter
           strap buckle.
           13.5.3.5.5. When a small child occupies a seat, a pillow (if available) or some type of
           padding (i.e., blanket) should be placed between the child and the seat belt securing
           mechanism.
       13.5.3.6. Acceptable child/infant safety seats/restraints may be used during all phases of
       flight in forward or aft facing seats.

NOTE: These types of seats/restraints will not normally be used in side facing (web type) seats,
to transport patients or attendants. Passenger Services has approved the transport of passengers
requiring child/infant safety seats/restraints in side facing (web type) seats.
       13.5.3.7. If the aircraft is equipped with airline type seats, seat children/infants in
       child/infant seats/restraints by the fuselage with an adult in the aisle or middle seat.
       13.5.3.8. An adult must be able to reach emergency oxygen/life vest under all
       circumstances.
       13.5.3.9. Never seat young children where they are required to distribute oxygen masks.
       Ensure parents with young children can reach the oxygen mask container.
13.6. Patient/Passenger Handling.
   13.6.1. The FN and AET are the key figures for good patient/passenger relations. Comments
   by the crew and the manner in which they are made often determine patient/passenger
   attitudes about the flight. Address patients and passengers by proper titles. Avoid arguments
   and controversial subjects, national or international politics, criticism of other personnel or
   organizations. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
   willingness to help.
   13.6.2. Always remember that patients and passengers are individuals; address them
   collectively only when making announcements.
   13.6.3. Disabled Passengers. AE crews will make every effort to accommodate disabled
   passengers who are eligible for military air transportation. Disabled passengers will be
   denied travel only when the travel clearly presents unacceptable risks to the passenger.
   Comply with the following procedures when transporting disabled passengers:
       13.6.3.1. The AE crew will assist (duties permitting) during loading, seating, and
       offloading of the disabled passenger. If he/she is unable to board the aircraft using the
       stairs, he/she will be enplaned or deplaned on a litter using the litter ramp. The disabled
       passenger will be seated in a passenger seat and will not travel on a litter.
       13.6.3.2. Disabled passengers will not be seated next to an emergency exit.
       13.6.3.3. Disabled passengers who require in-flight assistance for eating, medications, or
       use of restrooms, will travel with a capable authorized escort.
   13.6.4. Patient Baggage Procedures.
       13.6.4.1. Storage, Inspecting and Processing. Accompanied patient baggage will receive
       expeditious handling and will be processed separately from passenger baggage. Anti-
 84                                             AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


       hijack inspection of all persons and hand-carried articles transported in the AE system is
       required. While this is normally accomplished by the originating MTF, the MCD will
       ensure anti-hijacking statement is included on AF IMT 3851. All baggage requires
       inspection.
       13.6.4.2. The 3AET will annotate all baggage tag numbers on the original baggage
       manifest, which will be given to the MCD at the end of the mission.
       13.6.4.3. Baggage Identification.
          13.6.4.3.1. If hand-carried baggage will not fit under the patient’s seat and is stored
          in the cargo compartment, an AF IMT 3851 will be accomplished.
          13.6.4.3.2. Baggage Identification/Allowances. Refer to AFI 41-301, Worldwide
          Aeromedical Evacuation System.
   13.6.5. Patient/Attendant Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage will not be
   transported onboard AE aircraft. (See 6.51.1).
   13.6.6. Disposition of excess baggage of US non-Armed Forces patients is the responsibility
   of the owner.
   13.6.7. Baggage Restrictions. Special care will be exercised by all AE agencies to ensure
   that stowed and hand-carried baggage does not contain unauthorized weapons, explosive
   devices, or unauthorized drugs.
   13.6.8. Stowed baggage will be restricted to suitcases, duffel bags, hand bags, B-4 bags, A-
   2/3 bags, foot lockers, garment bags, or strong, durable cardboard boxes capable of
   withstanding frequent handling during transportation. Articles having dimensions exceeding
   62 inches in one direction, exceeding overall dimensions of 100 inches (length plus width
   plus height), or exceeding 100 pounds will not be accepted as stowed baggage.
   13.6.9. Due to space limitations onboard the aircraft, patients should be limited to one hand-
   carried item.

NOTE: Except where local laws prohibit their presence, alcoholic beverages may be included in
the hand baggage, but will not be consumed on the aircraft or while in the AE system.
   13.6.10. In-flight Procedures:
       13.6.10.1. Patients and passengers may move about the cabin; however, judgment must
       be exercised on the number of patients and passengers allowed out of their seats at any
       one time. Encourage patients and passengers to remain seated with their seat belts
       fastened.
       13.6.10.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, patients and passengers with
       small children, and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
       13.6.10.3. Do not allow patients and passengers to tamper with emergency equipment.
       Patients and passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
       13.6.10.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means
       to make patients and passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary
       compartment lights.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                                85


       13.6.10.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck, only when approved by the PIC. Use
       good judgment when requesting this authority.
          13.6.10.5.1. At the MCD discretion, ambulatory patients may also have access to the
          flight station. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to meet the
          requirements of AFI 11-202, V3 General Flight Rules. Patients and passengers will
          not be permitted access to primary crew positions.
       13.6.10.6. If extra crewmembers or maintenance personnel are not available, English-
       speaking adults will be utilized to assist in emergency evacuation of patients and
       passengers. Brief assigned assistant on emergency evacuation procedures per guidelines
       established in the applicable flight manual or AFI.
       13.6.10.7. Patients and passengers will be supervised for the entire period of flight. The
       PIC will be notified if any unusual circumstance relating to the patients and passengers
       occurs.
   13.6.11. Meal Service:
       13.6.11.1. Patient meals are the responsibility of the medical crew. Serve special diets
       first, followed by litter patient meals then ambulatory patient meals.

CAUTION: Ensure meals prepared for psychiatric patients are checked for any items that could
be used to harm. themselves or others.
       13.6.11.2. Passenger meal service is the primary responsibility of the LM/BO. AECMs
       may assist with passenger meal service if it does not conflict with primary duties.
       13.6.11.3. Passengers who have boarding passes (AMC 148-series IMTs, Boarding/Pass
       Ticket or Passenger/Boarding Ticket) which shows a meal was ordered are served meals
       in the following sequence: small children requiring assistance, distinguished visitors
       (DV), then all other passengers.
       13.6.11.4. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
       point of departure. Avoid waking patients and passengers to offer meals (unless medical
       condition of patient requires they eat). Ask the PIC about expected flight conditions prior
       to meal preparation.
       13.6.11.5. Use the following procedures for box lunches: after takeoff, distribute box
       lunches to passengers who boarded at the previous station. This lessens confusion when
       flight segments are short and additional passengers board at subsequent stations. Ensure
       each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger's AMC 148-series
       IMT Boarding/Pass Ticket or Passenger/Boarding Ticket.
       13.6.11.6. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
       13.6.11.7. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
       contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of
       spoiled meals (by menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the
       manufacturing agency, and manufacturer's lot number.
       13.6.11.8. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, annotate on the
       individual's AMC IMT 148, to reflect reimbursement is authorized. Inform passengers
86                                            AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


     they may receive refunds at the next station or the originating terminal or destination
     terminal.
     13.6.11.9. Nonmetallic meal trays will not be used in aircraft ovens not explicitly
     designed for their use.
     13.6.11.10. If mission legs are not long enough to complete meal service, meals can be
     served on the ground.
         13.6.11.10.1. Meals will not be served during the refueling process. This could
         hinder the ability to egress in the event of an emergency.
     13.6.11.11. If meals are served while aircraft is on the ground, ensure they are collected
     for disposal prior to aircraft taxi.
     13.6.11.12. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and
     returned to the in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF
     IMT 129, Tally In-Out, is received from fleet service to relieve AECMs of meal
     accountability.
  13.6.12. Nursing Documentation Procedures.
     13.6.12.1. All AECMs must ensure every effort is made to provide patient care
     continuity, and will adhere to patient care standards and documentation procedures
     outlined in AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards
     of Care.
  13.6.13. Deplaning Procedures.
     13.6.13.1. Safe, smooth deplaning activities depend on the coordinated efforts of the
     AECMs and the MTF/passenger service representatives. Careful preplanning and
     advance collection of all patient records, X-rays, and medications before landing will
     expedite the deplaning process.
     13.6.13.2. Complete patient care notes on AF IMT 3899 (or TRAC2ES equivalent) or
     DD Form 602 and ensure entry is signed with name and grade.
     13.6.13.3. Assemble all patient records, X-rays, and medications and prepare AF IMT
     3860, for the MTF representative’s signature and receipt.
     13.6.13.4. Provide a brief detailed report on each offload patient to the MTF
     representative.
     13.6.13.5. Prepare patients for deplaning, considering the climatic conditions at the
     offload station. Ensure that all patient personal belongings are ready for offload.
     13.6.13.6. Supervise an orderly deplaning sequence. Deplaning will require close
     coordination between all AECMs.
  13.6.14. Transfer of Patient Care.
     13.6.14.1. Medical attendants will accompany patients to the destination medical facility.
     FNs must exercise good judgment in determining the need for an AECM to accompany
     patients to the destination medical facility. NOTE: This will extend CDT.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                               87


       13.6.14.2. At scheduled RON stations, when an ASF/ASTS/MTF nurse is not available
       to receive report on the flight line, an AECM is responsible for accompanying patients to
       the facility if the patient’s medical condition warrants clinical observation during
       transport.
       13.6.14.3. At unscheduled RON points where medical personnel are not available for
       transfer of care at the aircraft, an AECM is responsible for accompanying all patients to
       the medical facility and provide report to the staff that will take charge of interim patient
       care responsibilities.
          13.6.14.3.1. Remain with patients until assured of their acceptance onto the
          appropriate medical service and that adequate arrangements for care have been made.
          Include patient disposition in end of mission report to appropriate C2 agency
       13.6.14.4. All female litter psychiatric patients should be provided with a female
       attendant during movement between the aircraft and the destination facility. If
       accompanied by a responsible adult female, attendant, another non-psychiatric female
       patient, or military sponsor, there is no need for an additional attendant to escort the
       patient.
   13.6.15. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, or couriers are onboard, the
   FN, LM/BO will inform the traffic or protocol representative.
13.7. Not Used.
13.8. En route and Post Flight Duties.
   13.8.1. At stations where a crew change is made, and patient onload or offload is required,
   the AEOO, if available, is responsible for supervising flight line execution of AE missions.
   The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-being of patients on the
   aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with the AEOO and supporting
   agencies.
   13.8.2. At crew stage points, provide patient report and ensure all records, medications and
   patient supplies are transferred. Also brief relief personnel about patient/passenger and
   aircraft equipment, any missing items, and the location of through baggage. Point out cargo
   requiring special consideration.
   13.8.3. Mission Delays. To preclude unnecessary patient holding on the flight line, aircraft
   departure times are not established on the basis of an estimated time in commission (ETIC).
   Departure times will be scheduled only on the basis of Fully Mission Capable (FMC).
       13.8.3.1. The MCD must be cognizant that guidelines are not a substitute for sound
       judgment. Decisions should be put into action only after making a thorough assessment
       of the patient’s medical needs and considering surrounding circumstances. With this in
       mind, the following guidance is offered:
          13.8.3.1.1. If the delay exceeds 1 hour, ambulatory patients and passengers should be
          deplaned to a rest area such as a lounge or terminal facility. These patients remain the
          responsibility of the AECMs. If feasible, litter patients should be evaluated and
          appropriate action taken for their care. Meals may be obtained for patients by utilizing
          AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice. Keep patients and passengers
          informed of the current situation.

          13.8.3.1.2. Once the mission is in delay and the aircraft ETIC is more than 3 hours
          after scheduled departure, consider moving all patients to the nearest medical facility
          capable of supporting patient requirements. Before the actual movement of patients
          takes place, contact the FCC at the appropriate C2 agency for consultation and
          assistance. The C2 agency must be promptly notified of the problem as the facts are
          known.

NOTE: Ground transportation time to the MTF should be considered.
   13.8.4. Unscheduled RON Procedures. Normally, AE missions will remain overnight at
   bases where ASFs/ASTSs are located. Exceptions may occur due to weather, equipment
   failure, or patient needs. In these instances, the following procedures apply:
      13.8.4.1. Coordinate with the appropriate C2 agency to ensure that the medical facility
      selected for patient care has the capability to meet patient needs.
   13.8.5. The procedures for reimbursement for patients at civilian facilities are as follows:
      13.8.5.1. The MCD will render a written statement to the civilian hospital concerned
      with setting forth the circumstances requiring admission and including a statement that no
      military medical facilities were available.
      13.8.5.2. Charges for active duty uniformed services personnel are reimbursable through
      the Centrally Managed Allotment (CMA) of the appropriate military service when cited
      for these patients. Bills will be referred to the nearest military medical facility for
      preparation of the necessary payment vouchers.
      13.8.5.3. Charges for accommodations and services rendered to patient attendants
      (dependent or uniformed services personnel) are their own responsibility.
      13.8.5.4. Settlement of charges by United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and
      Department of Veteran’s Affairs (DVA) beneficiaries is the responsibility of those
      agencies.
   13.8.6. In all instances, the MCD or FN will accompany all patients to and from the civilian
   medical facility and assume responsibility for the following items:
      13.8.6.1. Coordinate with the Director of Patient Administration, or equivalent,
      indicating the number of patients involved and their nursing care requirements. Problems
      encountered during the admission process will be managed tactfully, emphasizing patient
      necessity. If personnel at the facility resist the recommendation, the MCD will refer the
      matter to the appropriate C2 agency.
      13.8.6.2. Furnish a complete clinical report to the receiving facility nursing/physician
      staff.
      13.8.6.3. Remain with patients until assured of their acceptance onto the appropriate
      medical service and that adequate arrangements for care have been made.
      13.8.6.4. AECMs will be responsible for care of their patients whenever hospital staffing
      is unable to provide adequate support. The appropriate C2 agency will be notified
      immediately when this occurs in order to alert another medical crew to complete the
      mission when medical crew duty time is exceeded.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                              89


     13.8.6.5. The MCD will ensure that all drugs and medical supplies are adequately
     secured. Narcotics will be placed in the custody of the MTF pharmacy section.
     13.8.6.6. AETs are responsible for obtaining adequate patient baggage storage. Based on
     local situations and/or patient status, bags may be stored centrally or may be given to the
     RON patient. Regardless of process used, patients will be allowed immediate access to
     their baggage while staying in RON facilities at a military installation.
  13.8.7. The MCD will coordinate all aspects of mission departure for the following day.
     13.8.7.1. The MCD will ensure arrangements are made for ordering in-flight meals.
     13.8.7.2. The MCD will ensure adequate preparation of patients and sufficient
     transportation, the hospital Patient Administration office will be notified of the estimated
     departure time.
     13.8.7.3. FNs will report to the medical facility in sufficient time to receive patient report
     and to obtain narcotics and drugs that were placed under security.
  13.8.8. Mission Termination. The following tasks must be completed by AECMs before an
  AE mission may be terminated:
     13.8.8.1. Disconnect all medical equipment and personal flying gear after patients have
     been deplaned.
     13.8.8.2. Accomplish applicable inventories.
     13.8.8.3. The MCD/CMT will ensure:
         13.8.8.3.1. AECM aircraft interior cleaning tasks are completed, which includes the
         cleaning and proper disposal of blood and/or body fluids from the aircraft.
         13.8.8.3.2. Trash and all disposable medical supplies are collected for removal by
         aircraft services.
         13.8.8.3.3. Soiled linen and sharps containers are collected for removal from the
         aircraft.
         13.8.8.3.4. All contaminated items are collected, bagged, and labeled for removal
         from the aircraft as specified in AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient
         Considerations and Standards of Care.
         13.8.8.3.5. The aircraft is properly secured at RON points as specified in local

                                   AE MISSION SAFETY

20.1. Safety Responsibilities and Precautions. All AECMs are responsible for enforcing and
observing safety measures while performing the patient airlift mission.
   20.1.1. Emergency procedures outlined in aircraft T.O.s, required directives, and abbreviated
   checklists must be reviewed frequently to ensure fully coordinated action of all AECMs.
      20.1.1.1. (Added-349AMW) HQ AMC Aeromedical (AE) Clinical Operations and
      Patient Safety Alerts (COPSA)
          20.1.1.1.1. (Added-349AMW) AE COPSA facilitates timely communication of AE-
          focused clinical information and lessons learned from HQ AMC/SG to the global AE
          community. The FCIF process will be used for individual accountability for reading
          and implementing recommendations from COPSAs. Additionally, COPSAs will be
          briefed on the Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) should the information apply to non-
          flying Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) that would not otherwise have access to
          FCIFs.
   20.1.2. AECMs must remain alert for unusual occurrences and immediately report any safety
   hazard to the MCD or PIC.
   20.1.3. Adherence to Crew Resource Management (CRM) procedures/practices and constant
   situational awareness are keys to safe mission accomplishment.
   20.1.4. Abbreviated checklists will be open to the appropriate phase of flight from preflight
   briefing through mission termination.
20.2. Ground Safety. AECMs must exercise extreme caution during enplaning and deplaning
procedures.
   20.2.1. A high accident potential exists due to noise level, vehicle activity around the
   aircraft, blackout/low-light conditions and inclement weather.
   20.2.2. As prescribed by AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
   personnel in the immediate area of an operating aircraft will wear hearing protection.
   20.2.3. Personnel will wear protective goggles, when in prop wash areas or in front of an
   aircraft that is being backed using the aircraft's engines.
      20.2.3.1. AECMs will wear gloves when working with electrical equipment, during
      configuration and patient loading to prevent personal injury.
   20.2.4. No Smoking is allowed within 50-feet of the aircraft.
   20.2.5. Guidelines for Vehicle Drivers. Vehicle operators will follow the guidelines
   prescribed in AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, and AFH 41-318,
   Ambulance Bus (AMBUS) Training Standards, and the following when enplaning/deplaning
   patients and passengers.
      20.2.5.1. Vehicle supervision, movement, and placement in and around the aircraft are
      the responsibility of the LM/BO, or PIC (as applicable).
 98                                               AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


       20.2.5.2. All vehicular movement around the aircraft must maintain the 10-foot “circle of
       safety” from the nose, tail and wingtips of the aircraft. Any movement required within
       this circle will be directed by the LM/BO. EXCEPTION: If a certified vehicle marshaller
       is unavailable, vehicles will not approach the C-21 aircraft within this “circle of safety.”
       For patient loading, vehicle will park outside “circle of safety” and patient(s) will be
       transported from this area.
       20.2.5.3. All vehicles approach parked aircraft with the driver side of the vehicle toward
       the aircraft.
       20.2.5.4. All vehicles moving within 10 feet of the aircraft will use a LM/BO directed
       spotter. The spotter pre-positions wheel chocks between the aircraft and vehicle, to
       prevent vehicles from damaging the aircraft. Additional vehicles can be parked without
       chocks (no closer than 10 feet to the aircraft) providing a chocked vehicle is between the
       un-chocked vehicle and the aircraft. Chocks will remain in position until the vehicle(s)
       are ready for movement.
       20.2.5.5. Vehicles parked on the flight-line will remain unlocked with the key in the
       ignition. If the vehicle driver does not remain in the drivers’ seat after parking, the
       ignition must be turned off and the parking brake applied. In addition, the gear lever will
       be placed in reverse gear on vehicles with standard transmission, park for vehicles with
       automatic transmission. These requirements are not necessary if a driver remains behind
       the wheel.
       20.2.5.6. Only vehicles required to enplane/deplane patients or passengers or service the
       aircraft are permitted to approach the aircraft after it has blocked in. All vehicles will
       stand clear until directed to proceed towards aircraft. More than one vehicle may be
       positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft; however, only one vehicle may be in motion
       toward the aircraft at any one time.
       20.2.5.7. When required, a Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR) vehicle will normally position itself
       in view of the aircraft ramp (if applicable). The airfield’s manager determines the exact
       position.
       20.2.5.8. The AMBUS and/or ambulances will be positioned near the ramp entrance. An
       additional AMBUS may be marshaled towards the aircraft and be parked next to the first
       AMBUS and/or ambulance, to expedite enplaning/deplaning patients.
20.3. Enplaning/Deplaning Procedures. AECMs must carefully check enplaning/deplaning
patients and consider individual abilities/disabilities. All aircrafts should have engine off during
enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   20.3.1. All Aircraft:
       20.3.1.1. Ambulatory:
           20.3.1.1.1. The FN is normally responsible for briefing the ambulatory patients prior
           to enplaning/deplaning.
       20.3.1.2. At stations where there is an AEOO, the MCD will coordinate with the AEOO
       prior to enplaning/deplaning patients.
       20.3.1.3. Keep ambulatory patients grouped together during enplaning/deplaning.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                              99


     20.3.1.4. Patients will not walk under aircraft wings.
     20.3.1.5. Patients and passengers may be allowed to use canes, crutches, or walkers for
     enplaning/deplaning or while ambulating in-flight at the discretion of the FN.
     20.3.1.6. Patient use of aircraft stairs.
         20.3.1.6.1. Ensure all patients keep one hand free for grasping the handrail to
         include:
             20.3.1.6.1.1. Attendants carrying infant patients on and off the aircraft. A chest or
             back carrier may be worn.
             20.3.1.6.1.2. Patients using crutches or canes to ambulate.
     20.3.1.7. Ambulatory patients will be directed to their assigned seats and assisted with
     securing their seat belts as necessary.
     20.3.1.8. Patients and passengers will not be seated in seats that do not lock in the full
     upright position or secure into applicable aircraft track.
     20.3.1.9. In the absence of a passenger representative, a crewmember will brief
     passengers prior to enplaning/deplaning.
     20.3.1.10. The passenger service representative and/or the LM/BO conduct
     enplaning/deplaning of passengers. Passengers normally enplane/deplane through the
     crew entrance door or via air stairs (KC-10/KC-135). Coordination with the AECMs,
     LM/BO/AEOO (if applicable), and passenger service representative is essential to ensure
     timely and safe passenger enplaning/deplaning.
  20.3.2. Litters:
     20.3.2.1. Enplaning/deplaning litters will be coordinated with the LM/BO (or
     equivalent).
     20.3.2.2. In the event of large litter loads, ensure workload is distributed among
     numerous litter bearers, when available.
     20.3.2.3. Litter patients may be enplaned/deplaned as ambulatory if in the professional
     judgment of the FN no contraindications exist (e.g., doctor’s order for bed rest, inability
     to climb stairs or walk long distances, etc.).
     20.3.2.4. The CMT will check litter straps for proper placement/security prior to moving
     patients. However, all AECMs will monitor for safe litter strap placement. When patients
     are delivered to the aircraft during engine running onload (ERO), mobile aeromedical
     staging facility (MASF) personnel are responsible for ensuring patients are on acceptable
     litters with a minimum of two litter straps correctly placed.
     20.3.2.5. Patients should have minimal exposure to the elements. Setting litter patients
     down on the flight-line ramp must be avoided in inclement weather and limited during
     non-inclement weather.
     20.3.2.6. When only one (1) patient occupies a litter tier, the patient will be placed at a
     level that optimizes nursing care, and allows the patient to easily get on and off the litter.
 100                                              AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


       20.3.2.7. When a litter, occupied or unoccupied, is placed in the lowest litter tier, a litter
       must be secured at waist level above it to prevent a tripping hazard.

WARNING: AECMs will be mindful of the potential strike hazard unoccupied litter stanchion
arms (C-17, patient support pallet [PSP]) present. To help eliminate the hazard: remove litter
stanchion arms and store in a secure location on the aircraft. If a secure location is not available,
place an empty litter in a vacant position or cover empty litter stanchion arms with blankets and
secure with litter straps.
   20.3.3. Cargo Aircraft.
       20.3.3.1. On the C-17, C-130 and C-141, litter patients will be enplaned feet first and
       deplaned head first due to minimal degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to
       turn litter patients around on the cargo ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier.
       EXCEPTION: CCATT patients may be positioned with their head towards the flight
       deck if the CCATT physician determines patient condition warrants head first placement.
       20.3.3.2. When the cargo ramp is unavailable or if cargo is already on the aircraft prior
       to enplaning/deplaning litter patients, litters may be loaded through the paratroop
       doors/crew entrance door.
       20.3.3.3. When a comfort pallet is in place (C-17, C-141) first determine if there is
       adequate clearance to safely enplane/deplane the litter and any medical support
       equipment.
       20.3.3.4. C-130, C-141:
           20.3.3.4.1. When using the crew entrance door, assuming there is no access to the
           paratroop doors, remove the entrance ladder (C-141) prior to enplaning or deplaning a
           litter.
           20.3.3.4.2. When enplaning/deplaning litters through the paratroop doors/crew
           entrance door, at least four (4) people must be employed on the ground with an
           additional two (2) to three (3) people inside the aircraft.
           20.3.3.4.3. Position personnel in a way that they can safely hand the litter off to
           others as needed.
           20.3.3.4.4. Under extremely unusual/abnormal circumstances, the side escape
           exits/hatches may be used to enplane/deplane aeromedical equipment or patients (i.e.,
           cargo loaded and no cargo handling equipment available).
           20.3.3.4.5. A minimum of four persons both inside and outside of the aircraft will be
           in position for patient/equipment transfer through the exit/hatch.
       20.3.3.5. C-17:
           20.3.3.5.1. On the C-17, to load through the paratroop doors or the forward
           emergency escape door, a minimum of six people on the ground to lift over the head
           and four on the aircraft is required.
               20.3.3.5.1.1. The stanchion arms are designed                   for   non-sequential
               enplaning/deplaning of individual litter patients.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                              101


       20.3.3.6. Patient/Cargo Mix.
           20.3.3.6.1. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear
           detriment to the health and well being of the patient or passengers can be
           demonstrated. The decision will be made by the MCD and PIC, considering the need
           for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to AFMAN 24-204, Preparing
           Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product special provisions
           rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions. Conflicts will be
           referred to the respective tasking AE command element for decision. EXCEPTION:
           No cargo will be transported with patients on the KC-135.
           20.3.3.6.2. When transporting both cargo and litter patients, litters will be transported
           forward of the cargo pallets, if possible.
           20.3.3.6.3. If not possible, and the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported
           aft of the cargo. The LM/BO must make every effort to stay in the vicinity of the
           crew and patients in-flight, and during critical phases of flight.
           20.3.3.6.4. Cargo will not be bumped except in very unusual/abnormal cases, and
           only after the MCD (through the tasking AE command element) contacts HQ/DO and
           the PIC has contacted the appropriate C2 agencies.
   20.3.4. Tanker Aircraft.
       20.3.4.1. On the KC-135 and KC-10 litter patients will be enplaned head first due to the
       increased degree of ramp incline. This will also eliminate the need to turn litter patients
       around once on the aircraft. EXCEPTION: CCATT patients on the KC-135 may be
       positioned with their head towards the flight deck if the CCATT physician determines
       patient condition warrants head first placement.
           20.3.4.1.1. The PSP stanchion arms are                 designed    for   non-sequential
           enplaning/deplaning of individual litter patients.
       20.3.4.2. On the KC-10 litter patients will need to be rotated and placed in the litter tier
       with their head toward the flight deck for access to emergency oxygen.
       20.3.4.3. The preferred method to enplane/deplane ambulatory patients is the air stairs.

WARNING: The air stairs will not be used to enplane litter patients. If there is no other option
available, the MCD will contact the appropriate C2 agency for A37V waiver.
       20.3.4.4. If litter patients will enplane/deplane, use the patient loading system (PLS) to
       enplane/deplane both litter and ambulatory patients. Maximum PLS weight capacity is
       1500 lbs distributed.
       20.3.4.5. If the PLS is not available, request a Halverson Lift or Tunner (K-Loader), Hi-
       lift truck etc. for patient enplaning/deplaning. Ensure one AECM accompanies the patient
       (s).

WARNING: Ensure all safety precautions are utilized when enplaning/deplaning patients and
passengers on a K-Loader. One AECM should be directing patients and passengers during
enplaning/deplaning. AECM’s should coordinate with BO to utilize ramps to cover gap between
aircraft and K-Loader to prevent personnel from injury.

       20.3.4.6. Planning must take into consideration the limitation of these platforms, i.e.,
       exposure to weather, loading time, loading considerations.
       20.3.4.7. Rollers on alternate platforms such as the Tunner will be turned over before
       beginning enplaning/deplaning operations.

WARNING: Patients and medical equipment will not be placed on the patient support pallet
(PSP) during pallet loading or off-loading.
20.4. Engines Running Onload (ERO).
   20.4.1. General. For AE missions, an ERO is authorized for contingency operations or
   during non-contingency AE missions when requirements dictate minimum ground time.
   EROs will not be used in a non-contingency environment unless mission essential.
ERO procedures may be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint training operations, exercises, etc.

WARNING: Eye protection will be worn during all ERO procedures. EXCEPTION: For the C-
17, eye protection is not necessary, except when operating in parking areas where flying debris
could be picked up from engine exhaust.
   20.4.2. C-5, C-21, KC-10, and KC-135 Aircraft. AE EROs are not conducted on these
   aircraft for AE missions. If EROs are required on these aircraft for maintenance, lack of
   external power carts, etc., the flight crew will direct procedures.
   20.4.3. C-17, C-130, and C-141 Aircraft. Refer to AFI 10-2912, Aeromedical Evacuation
   Contingency Operations Training (AECOT) Standards, Volumes 1-4 (forthcoming), for
   training standards related to AE EROs.
       20.4.3.1. The loadmaster will be positioned at the foot of the ramp on the left side of the
       aircraft and on headset during actual onload procedures. The loadmaster will observe for
       aircraft threats, and will enforce compliance with safety requirements.
       20.4.3.2. A spotter is provided by the ground AE element and is positioned 50 feet aft of
       the aircraft ramp, off center, 5-6 feet to the right.
           20.4.3.2.1. The spotter’s primary responsibility is to indicate to the ground element
           when the AEC are ready for patient loading, and to start/slow/stop the flow of
           patients as needed.
           20.4.3.2.2. In addition, the spotter monitors the litter-bearers to determine if
           assistance is needed and to ensure safe practices are maintained around the aircraft
           (i.e. prevent litter bearers from entering the prop wash/jet blast etc).
       20.4.3.3. Vehicle supervision is the LM/BOs responsibility.
       20.4.3.4. If duties permit, loadmasters will assist AECMs with securing patients.
   20.4.4. Crossloading. Patients will normally be cross loaded during EROs depending on the
   aircraft configuration and cargo requirements.
       20.4.4.1. Litters will be brought onboard and loaded in 3-second intervals, or as safety
       considerations allow, forward to aft, left to right, top to bottom.
   20.4.5. General Procedures.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                          103


CAUTION: When heavy or bulky equipment is rolled up/down the aircraft ramp, ensure an
adequate number of personnel are available to prevent injury to personnel, or damage to
equipment.
       20.4.5.1. Equipment that may be rolled up/down the ramp of C-130, C-141 and C-17:
          20.4.5.1.1. Adult ventilators.
          20.4.5.1.2. Unoccupied transport incubators, securely attached to a wheeled frame or
          containing integral wheels. EXCEPTION: An occupied neonatal transport system
          (NTS) may be rolled up or down ramps due to the weight of the NTS. Ensure the
          infant is properly secured inside the incubator. Four or more people will
          enplane/deplane the NTS. The MCD and CMT should use good judgment and
          common sense to carry out this operation in a safe manner. Occupied or unoccupied
          NTS will not be rolled up or down PLS, jarring may damage components.
          20.4.5.1.3. Unoccupied ambulance-type stretchers/gurneys.

          20.4.5.1.8. Compressed gas cylinders may be utilized as a source to provide oxygen
          or other compressed gas on any AE mission. These cylinders provide the drive
          pressure and gas mixes for ventilator patients and supplemental oxygen as required.
          When a patient is delivered to their final destination and the cylinders are deplaned,
          they will be prepared for return shipment as hazardous cargo per AFJMAN 24-204,
          Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment. When the same mission
          aircraft returns to home station where the cylinders originated, they may remain
          onboard as aeromedical equipment. When returning cylinders, always have the
          regulator removed and the cylinder capped.
              20.4.5.1.8.1. H-Tank securing procedure. To secure H-size compressed air

WARNING: The only acceptable options to run oxygen and electrical lines without the
concurrence of the LM/BO is to utilize the stanchion poles, stanchion straps or PSP securing
devices. Crews must coordinate with the LM/BO prior to securing oxygen/electrical lines outside
of these parameters. Lines looped over moving parts jeopardize the safety of the aircraft, medical
equipment and crew.

NOTE: AECMs will not use tape or any other adhesive type materials on any aircraft surface, or
on any piece of aeromedical equipment.
   20.6.3. Seat Belt Safety. On aircraft without “Fasten Seat Belt” signs, crewmembers will
   receive direction from the PIC or LM/BO when it is safe to get out of their seats.
       20.6.3.1. On aircraft with “Seat Belt” signs, if the sign is illuminated in-flight: in-flight
       activities (i.e., serving meals, routine nursing care, inventorying, etc.) should cease unless
       absolutely necessary and crewmembers should be seated. If the sign remains illuminated
       and crewmembers are allowed to leave their seats to perform essential duties, a PA
       announcement should be made instructing patients and passengers to remain in their seats
       until the sign is turned off.
       20.6.3.2. When the “Fasten Seat Belt” sign is illuminated during descent, crewmembers
       prepare the cabin for landing and assume their seats as soon as possible.

WARNING: Inform the PIC when a situation requires AECMs to be out of their seat during
ascent, descent, or turbulent weather.
   20.6.4. Miscellaneous Mission Safety Items.
       20.6.4.1. To use the C-141 comfort pallet forward latrine, the normal traffic route is on
       the left side of the pallet.
       20.6.4.2. During egress, ramps on all aircraft may be used if already deployed and
       unobstructed.
       20.6.4.3. Crewmembers should keep one hand free in-flight, if possible, to allow for
       stabilization in the event of turbulence.
       20.6.4.4. Smoking in aircraft lavatories is a federal offense. Patients or passengers
       smoking in lavatories or tampering with detectors (if applicable) will be deplaned,
       medical condition permitting, at the next en route stop. Local authorities will be alerted of
       the offense. Notify tasking AE C2 agency for patient offenses, TACC for passenger
       offenses and document actions/details on AF IMT 3829, (or TRAC2ES equivalent).
       20.6.4.5. AECMs should escort patients to the latrine. Same sex AECM should
       accompany mental health patients to the latrine to provide supervision.
       20.6.4.6. Get-down litter requirements. The MCD may reserve get-down litters as
       mission needs dictate. For mission legs exceeding four hours in length; a minimum of
       two litters should be set up for ambulatory patient use. An emergency litter will be set up
       on all AE missions.
   20.6.5. When required/mission load permits, a minimum of one seat will be reserved for
   every three litter patients on all AE missions.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                             109

       accommodate additional medical equipment.
20.7. Defibrillation Procedures.
   20.7.1. To safely defibrillate a patient positioned on the aircraft floor, place a dry,
   woolen/cotton blanket under the patient. If any part of the patient contacts the floor, the
   distribution of current may be affected, resulting in the patient receiving less than the
   programmed amount of defibrillating current and/or possible skin burns. When monitoring
   electrodes are attached to the patient, the ground electrode possesses a ground potential.
   20.7.2. Patients may be defibrillated on litters with aluminum handles. Normal safety
   precautions must be followed (i.e., avoid direct contact with the patient or any portion of the
   litter during the procedure).
20.8. Transporting Battery Powered Wheelchairs. The following procedures are used when
transporting a battery powered wheelchair:

WARNING: Do not charge the battery or electric wheelchairs via the aircraft electrical system.
Ensure the battery is securely attached to the wheelchair. Do not remove the battery from the

              AIRCREW CHEMICAL OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

23.1. Wear of the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). Wearing ACDE will
constrain normal aircraft operations. Procedures and equipment have been tested under restricted
conditions, and "business as usual" will not be possible. Individual situations will dictate what
can and cannot be done. To properly adapt, aircrews must understand hazards involved and the
limitations of their chemical defense equipment.
   23.1.1. This chapter is intended to enhance other aircrew chemical defense training and
   provide the crew member a basic understanding of utilizing ACDE in a chemical-biological
   threat area
   (CBTA). It combines information from technical orders and unit inputs to form a single
   source document.
   23.1.2. This chapter briefly describes the nature of the chemical threat and agents that may
   be faced. Secondly, it discusses some of the situations and problems the aircrew may
   encounter in a chemical threat environment. Preparatory actions and countermeasures are
   examined so the crewmember can make optimal use of the ACDE and fly the mission safely.
   While the information presented may need to be modified, the specific objectives of this
   chapter will help prepare the aircrew member for the unique challenges imposed by chemical
   weapons.
23.2. Factors Influencing the Chemical Warfare (CW) Agent Hazard.
   23.2.1. General. The major instances in which a crew may be exposed to chemicals is
   through inhalation, absorption through the skin and or the eyes, and ingestion. Contaminated
   drink and food are considered harmful, but immediate concerns must be contamination
   avoidance to the maximum extent, limit exposure of the skin and eyes, as well as avoid
   breathing the contaminates. Factors affecting persistence are weather, agent physical
   characteristics, method of dissemination, droplet size, and the terrain.
   23.2.2. Weather. Factors include temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation and atmospheric
   stability. For example, high winds and heavy rains reduce the contamination hazard.
   Conversely, lack of wind, overcast skies, and moderate temperatures favor persistence.
   23.2.3. Agent Dissemination. Disseminated as vapors, aerosols, or liquids. Solids seem
   unlikely, but agents may become solids at lower temperature.
   23.2.4. Agent Droplet Size. Persistence factor is determined by droplet size. Agents may be
   mixed with other chemicals ("thickeners"), and form large drops making removal more
   difficult.
   23.2.5. Surface and Terrain. CW agent clouds tend to follow the terrain, flowing over
   countryside and down valleys. Chemicals persist in hollows, depressions, and other low
   areas. Rough terrain retards cloud movement. Flat countryside allows a uniform, unbroken
   cloud movement. Vegetated areas are more contaminated than barren terrain. Liquid agents
   soak into porous surfaces, making evaporation much slower than for non-porous surfaces.

23.3. Categories of CW Agents. CW agents having military significance may be categorized
as nerve, blister, choking, and blood. Because they are produced biologically, toxins are
technically not chemical agents. However, they are considered a potential CW threat.
23.4. Nerve Agents.
   23.4.1. Military Significance. Nerve agents are the most lethal and fastest acting of the
   standard CW agents. These agents affect the nervous system and are highly toxic whether
   inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Persistency ranges from hours to many days.
   23.4.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Nerve agent exposure is difficult to distinguish. Symptoms
   include runny nose, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, excessive sweating, drooling,
   nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. Nerve agents can also cause muscular twitching,
   dimness of vision, and pinpointing of the pupils.
   23.4.3. Onset of Symptoms. Inhalation produces symptoms within 1-2 minutes. The victim
   may be incapacitated within 5-10 minutes. Death may occur after several hours or days.
   Ingestion may cause the same symptoms, however, incapacitation may take longer. Nerve
   agents are retained by the body for an extended period; thus intermittent, cumulative
   exposure to low amounts can lead to the same ultimate effect as a single exposure to a higher
   amount.
   23.4.4. Protection. The full protective ACDE is effective against nerve agents. When
   properly worn, the various chemical protective masks prevent inhalation of nerve agents and
   all layers of the outer garment must be protected against saturation of liquids, chemical
   agents, water, or petroleum.
   23.4.5. Antidotes. Antidotes are effective in combating effects of nerve agent exposure.
   These antidotes may be effective if given to a victim having advanced symptoms, and as long
   as the victim is made to continue breathing. People who use the antidotes must be seen by
   medical personnel and may not be combat-ready for several days.
23.5. Blister Agents.
   23.5.1. Military Significance. Blister agents are dispensed as vapors or liquids, and may be
   encountered as solids. These agents primarily affect the eyes, respiratory tract, and the skin.
   23.5.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Placed on the skin, a drop the size of a pin head can produce
   a blister one inch in diameter. This action is accentuated by moisture; hence, a more severe
   danger is present during periods of sweating. The groin and armpits, which tend to be sweaty,
   are especially susceptible to blister agents. Blister agents that come in contact with the eyes
   lead to redness, watering of the eyes, blurring of vision, sensitivity to light, and, frequently,
   blindness. Inhalation causes serious damage due to burns and blisters to the mouth, nose,
   throat, and lungs. Incapacitation may last for days or weeks; aircrews will probably be unable
   to fly for indefinite periods. After hospitalization, complications from blister agent exposure
   can arise and may be fatal.
   23.5.3. Onset of Symptoms. Blister agents are quickly absorbed through the skin. However,
   it usually takes several minutes (up to 5 minutes and as long as several hours) for the
   symptoms to appear. They act most rapidly in liquid form, but are also effective in vapor
   form.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                           115


   23.5.4. Protection. The full ACDE is effective against blister agents. Exposed areas must be
   cleaned thoroughly immediately after exposure. Blister agents are easily transferred from
   contaminated surfaces; thus, great care must be taken to avoid contact with any
   contamination.
23.6. Choking Agents.
   23.6.1. Military Significance. These agents are disseminated as vapors and when inhaled
   affect the respiratory system by damaging the lungs. Persistence is very brief, and they
   dissipate rapidly (within minutes) under most field conditions.
   23.6.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Choking agents cause coughing, choking, tightness of the
   chest, nausea, headache, and watering of the eyes. Choking agents can be lethal, with death
   normally from the lungs filling with fluids, making breathing difficult or impossible.
   23.6.3. Onset of Symptoms. Exposure to choking agents has an immediate effect. Victims
   experience slightly delayed effects, such as painful cough, breathing discomfort, and fatigue.
   23.6.4. Protection. Both the aircrew and ground crew protective mask is extremely essential
   to protect against exposure; the entire protective ACDE should be used as directed.
23.7. Blood Agents.
   23.7.1. Military Significance. Blood agents are usually dispensed as vapor or aerosol and
   inhaled. Under most field conditions they may briefly persist on target (up to 10 minutes).
   23.7.2. Symptoms of Exposure. Exposure to a single breath of blood agent causes giddiness,
   headaches, confusion, and nausea. As dose increases, breathing becomes more difficult. The
   victim will have deep, uncontrollable breathing and cramps, then loss of consciousness.
   Death is certain if the victim receives no medical aid.
   23.7.3. Protection. Blood agents are breathing hazards. The full ACDE is most effective
   because the mask provides the breathing protection needed.
   23.7.4. Additional Threats. Blood agents will damage mask filters. All personnel must
   change mask filters at the earliest possible opportunity after a blood agent attack.
   EXCEPTION: Filters installed in aircrew CWU-80/P filter packs will be removed and
   replaced by aircrew life support personnel (AFSC 1T1X1).
23.8. Aircrew Operations. Performance of duties while wearing the ACDE can be extremely
physically and mentally demanding. Special preparation and crew coordination are required to
operate under chemical conditions. The information presented here will enable the aircrew to
successfully operate in a chemical environment by recognizing limits and exploiting the
capabilities of the chemical defensive equipment.

NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask. When ground chemical masks are used, a
FL below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid decompression.
Consider the following factors:
   23.8.1. Non-flying Ground Operations. Ground operations can represent the highest threat to
   aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents is
   paramount. Aircrews should be advised to limit activities to essential duties only, and to
   separate ground duties from air duties. The ground ensemble is designed for quick donning
 116                                             AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


   and heavier levels of concentrations that can be more evident during ground operations. The
   aircrew ensemble is designed for light concentration levels, that could be found during flying
   operations and transiting to and from the aircraft. Also, ACDE requires care during donning
   using "buddy dressing" procedures and aircrew life support expertise during aircrew
   contamination control area (ACCA) processing.
   23.8.2. Equipment Limitations. Due to thermal stress and the degraded performance
   associated with wearing of the ACDE, it is highly desirable to minimize the time and number
   of personnel exposed to chemical agents. Aircrew members must be familiar with the
   limitations of the ACDE and properly plan their duties. ACDE is designed to protect against
   vapor agents only.
   23.8.3. Body Temperature and Fluids Control. Heat stress and dehydration are serious
   hazards while wearing the ACDE. Aircrew members need to control perspiration rates and
   limit activities to essential duties only. The need to consciously slow the work pace while
   performing physical labor, share workloads and monitor each other's physiological condition
   is essential.
   23.8.4. Not Used.
   23.8.5. Limited Dexterity. Wearing three pairs of gloves restricts dexterity; therefore, visual
   confirmation of switch selection and positioning become very important.
   23.8.6. Restricted Communications. Normal communications are limited while wearing the
   chemical defense mask. Communications can be enhanced by using the mini-amplifier and
   speaker with the ACDE and some of the newer ground masks may be issued with a built-in
   amplifier. Otherwise, visual signals, the aircraft's public address system, and the aircraft's
   interphone system can be used to compensate.
   23.8.7. Peripheral Visions Limits. The aircrew chemical defense mask may reduce
   peripheral vision as much as 15 percent.
   23.8.8. Emergency Procedures. Wearing any of the chemical defense masks and filter
   assemblies impose several limitations:
       23.8.8.1. The aircrew member will not be able to detect fumes from fuel, hydraulic fluid
       and oil.
       23.8.8.2. Filter assembly will not protect the user against ammonia fumes and carbon
       monoxide gas.
23.9. Limitations. Aircrews need to be mentally prepared to face the dangers of chemical
weapons. Plans should be developed to limit aircrew exposure during enemy attacks and liquid
agent contamination while engaged in non-flying activities. Flight planning must be thorough
and PICs should emphasized chemical defensive operations during mission planning, hazards
and countermeasures, plans for on-load and off-load in the event of a ground attack, and plans
for the return leg in the event of a contaminated aircraft. Alternate scenario plans should also be
considered in the event conditions change.

   23.9.2. Not Used.
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                            117


23.10. ACDE Issue and Medical Pretreatment. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and
GCDE at home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCDE are available at all times
while in a CBTA. During deployments, at least one ACDE and one GCDE will be issued to each
crew member as directed by unit commander or the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) (or
applicable C2 agency). Aircrew life support technicians will prepare and issue mobility ACDE
"D" bags for aircrew members (AFI 11-301, Vol 1, Chapter 7). Mobility processing personnel
will issue GCDE "C" bags. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and correct
sizes. The local AMC command and control (or applicable C2 agency) will direct aircrews to
undergo medical pretreatment for chemical exposure.
23.11. In a CBTA.
   23.11.1. Establishing Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control channels
   to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alarm condition.
   Diversion of AMC aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless operational
   necessity dictates otherwise.
   23.11.2. Protective Equipment Postures. The following uses U.S. forces alert signals to
   outline ACDE/GCDE procedures for flying personnel:
       23.11.2.1. "ALL CLEAR" Attack is not probable. Notification—verbal; removal of
       warning signs and flags. ACDE requirements—equipment is issued, prepared for flying,
       and kept readily available. GCDE requirements equipment is issued and readily available.
       23.11.2.2. "ALARM YELLOW" Attack is probable. Notification—verbal; posting of
       yellow warning signs and flags. ACDE requirements—if en route to fly or during flying
       operations, all components will be worn except mask and hood, gloves, over-cape, and
       overboots. Mask and hood will be immediately available. GCDE requirements—
       appropriate components should be worn with the mask and hood and immediately
       available commensurate with ground duties.
       23.11.2.3. "ALARM RED." Attack is imminent or in progress. Notification—verbal;
       posting of red warning signs and flags; 1- minute warbling tone from sirens; succession
       of long blasts (3 seconds on—1 second off) from warning devices. ACDE
       requirements—full ACDE will be worn for flying duties. GCDE requirements—full
       GCDE should be worn commensurate with ground duties.
       23.11.2.4. "ALARM BLACK." Contamination is suspected or present. Notification—
       verbal; posting of black warning signs and flags; broken warbling tone from sirens;
       succession of short blasts (1 second on—1 second off) from warning devices. ACDE
       requirements—full ACDE will be worn. GCDE requirements—full GCDE will be worn
       commensurate with ground duties.
23.12. Donning Equipment. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
injectors will be kept in the upper left flight suit pocket. This standardized location will allow
personnel to locate the medication should an individual be overcome by nerve agent poisoning.
M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA
processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit whenever entering a CBTA with a
declared alarm condition of "yellow" or higher. When inbound to CBTA, prior to descent, the
PIC will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective equipment according to arrival
 118                                             AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


destination's mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) level and brief aircrew operations in
the CBTA. As a minimum, this briefing will include:
   23.12.1. Flight deck isolation.
   23.12.2. Oxygen requirements.
   23.12.3. Air conditioning system requirements.
   23.12.4. CW clothing requirements.
   23.12.5. Ground operations and MOPP levels.
23.13. Ground Operations.
   23.13.1. Off and On Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination of aircraft interiors during ground operations, particularly to the flight deck
   area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine covers,
   safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic bags.
   Unloaded cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the aircraft.
   Protective covers will be removed just prior to placing the cargo on the aircraft. It is the
   user's responsibility to determine and decontaminate equipment in his or her charge. Aircrew
   members entering the aircraft will remove plastic over-boots and over-cape portions of the
   aircrew ACDE and ensure flight and mobility bags are free of contaminates and placed in
   clean plastic bags. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a chemical contaminated environment will
   don plastic over-boots and over-cape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   23.13.2. Physiological Factors. MCDs/PICs must be very sensitive to the problems resulting
   from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The MCD/PIC should consider factors such as
   ground time, temperature, and remaining mission requirements when determining on-load
   and off-load requirements. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for adverse
   physiological effects.
   23.13.3. Communications. Conducting on-loading and off-loading operations while wearing
   the complete ACDE complicates communications capability.
   23.13.4. Passengers and Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and
   the ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior decontamination when loading and
   unloading passengers and patients.
23.14. Chemical Attack During Ground Operations. If an attack (condition red) occurs
during on-loading and off-loading operations or transport to and from aircraft, take immediate
cover away from the aircraft or vehicle. Follow "buddy dressing" procedures to ensure proper
donning of ACDE prior to flight.

NOTE: Aircrews should don the ground crew protective chemical mask and protective helmet
(LM/BO), consistent with circumstances and duties. Aircrews could be expected to forward
information concerning medical aid, damage estimates, unexploded ordinance. Appropriate
information may be sent via aircraft radios to the controlling agencies.
23.15. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest or fly in a
contaminated CBTA. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or preflight crews are
not available, the aircrew will normally preflight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to entering
AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014                                                           119


crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations, and preflight
briefings then report to the ACCA for processing with assistance from aircrew life support
personnel who will assist aircrews donning ACDE prior to reassuming flying duties. If possible,
aircrew transport should be provided in covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting
aircraft prior to departure to prevent contamination to themselves and the aircraft. As aircrews
proceed to fly they will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their
aircrew protective over-cape and over-boots prior to entering the aircraft.
23.16. Outbound With Actual or Suspected Chemical Contamination—Venting Aircraft
and Removing ACDE Components. With actual or suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft
must be purged for two hours using Smoke and Fume Elimination procedures to eliminate the
vapor hazard. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close inspection of aircrew,
passengers, flight deck, passenger compartment, and cargo compartment will be conducted using
M-8 and M-9 detection paper. Currently, vapors may be detected using the M-256 kit. Aircrews
and passengers may remove their respective ensemble components if vapors have been purged
and liquid agents are not detected on the flight deck or in the passenger compartment. If liquid
contamination is present, the aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading them
throughout the aircraft, especially on the flight deck. The best course is to identify actual or
suspected contamination and physically avoid those areas for the remainder of the flight.
Aircrews should attempt to maintain a total separation between the cargo compartment and the
flight deck if the cargo area has liquid contamination. The environmental curtain should be fully
installed and the cargo compartment kept as cool as possible (liquid agents are less volatile at
lower temperatures). Personnel who have been contaminated with liquid agents will remain in
their respective ensemble until processed through the applicable CCA.
23.17. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass chemical contamination information
through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be used to
determine if a diversion flight is required. Report the physical condition of any crew or
passengers who are showing chemical agent symptoms and whether they are wearing chemical
defense ensembles.
23.18. After Landing Decontamination Procedures. Strategic aircraft returning from CBTA
bases will be decontaminated at an island base or CONUS off-load station. Advise recovery base
command post of suspected or actual chemical contamination. Decontamination will be done by
the most expedient method. Aircrews will proceed to the ACCA for processing. Ground
personnel will report to GCCA for processing. All personnel will remove protective clothing
according to established procedures located in respective CCA. NOTE: Because of the technical
characteristics of aircrew life support and flying equipment and mission essential aircrew
resources, an ACCA is required to ensure minimum exposure to contaminates. GCCAs are
generally used to process ground crew personnel and typically are subject to potentially higher
concentration levels. The ACCA is equipped and manned by trained aircrew life support
personnel to process aircrews and decontaminate their equipment.
23.19. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing inflight
and ground duties. Figure 23.1 displays degradation factors for wearing a full ground chemical
ensemble, and may also be used to represent the task time multipliers for the ACDE. To estimate
how much time it takes to perform a task or operation; (1) take the task time multiplier for the
appropriate work rate and ambient air temperature, and (2) multiply it by the time it normally
 120                                           AFI11-2AEV3_349AMWSUP 14 JULY 2014


takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy work rate and an air temperature of 70ºF,
the crew member should expect a normal one hour task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE.

                          OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

27.1. General. AFPD 90-9 establishes the Air Force Operational Risk Management (ORM)
Program. The management of risk, all dimensions of risk, is key to maximizing mission
effectiveness and sustainment of readiness. ORM principles, techniques, and tools will be used to
increase mission success, strengthen job performance, and identify opportunities to expand
mission capabilities in all areas and at all levels, thereby strengthening the Air Force’s
warfighting posture.
   27.1.1. AES Commanders will implement a unit specific ORM Program or as directed by
   lead command.
27.2. Principles. The four guiding principles of ORM are: 1) accept no unnecessary risk, 2)
make risk decisions at the appropriate level, 3) accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs, and
4) integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels. To support these principles, the Air
Force will apply ORM during all aspects of preparation (planning, organizing, training,
equipping, and sustaining) and employment of aerospace forces.
27.3. Fundamentals. The fundamental goals of ORM are to:
   27.3.1. Enhance mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving assets and safeguarding
   health and welfare.
   27.3.2. Integrate ORM into mission processes, ensuring decisions are based upon
   assessments of risk integral to the activity and mission.
   27.3.3. Create an Air Force in which every leader, airman, and employee is trained and
   motivated to manage risk in all their on- and off-duty activities.
   27.3.4. Identify opportunities to increase Air Force warfighting effectiveness on the
   battlefield and in the operational aerospace environment, helping to ensure decisive victory
   in any future conflict at the least possible cost.
   27.3.5. All Air Force Personnel will apply ORM principles, concepts, and techniques to
   assess the risks associated with their daily mission and duty-related activities. They are
   encouraged to apply them to all other activities.

provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to aborts
or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Category Patients—A special patient is any patient who can be considered at
significant risk being aeromedically evacuated. To designate a patient as “special” is a matter of
judgment based on many factors. Among these are the patient’s clinical status and degree of
stability, amount of time between origination and destination MTF, and duration of individual
missions if more than one is needed to move. Special patients can be designated by the
MCD/FN, PMCC, VFS or responsible physician and must be coordinated through the PMRC.
Stations Time (Air Force)—Normally, 30 minutes prior to takeoff time for the KC-10, KC-135,
C-130, C-141, and OSA aircraft (45 minutes for C-5 and C-17). Aircrews will have completed
their preflight duties and be at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and cargo will be
secured.
Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)—Operations center that controls tanker and airlift
forces worldwide through a network of computer systems. The TACC is organized into
geographic cells consisting of East, West, and Emergency Action Cells. The TACC contains the

with theater MTFs to allocate the proper treatment assets required to support its role. The
primary role of the TPMRC is to devise theater plans and schedules and then monitor their
execution in concert with the GPMRC. The TPMRC is responsible to the Combatant
Commander through the Combatant Command Surgeon. The TPMRC is also responsible for all
aspect of intratheater patient movement management. A TPMRC provides command and control
for patient movement management operations in its theater of operations, as directed by its
Combatant Commander’s operational policy, and in coordination with USTRANSCOM, acting
as a supporting combatant command, responsible for intertheater and CONUS patient movement.
Time Out—Common assertive statement used to voice crewmember concern when safety may
be jeopardized.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Formerly known as Defense Business
Operations Fund-Transportation (DBOF-T). Part of the Air Force Working Capital Fund
(AFWCF). Normally used to cover costs that can be recovered from an air mobility customer.
Examples include TDY costs, site surveys of TALCE or airlift unit deployment bed down
locations, airlift unit level mission planning expenses, and support or contract costs for deployed
TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—Operations confined to a single service.

hazardous. On decomposition, Halon 1211 has a characteristic sharp, acrid odor, even in
concentrations of only a few parts per million. The odor provides a built-in warning system for
the agent and at the same time creates a noxious, irritating atmosphere for those who are in the
hazard area during and following a fire. Leave and/or ventilate area after fighting a fire.
NOTE: To use the Halon 1211 fire extinguisher, hold a vertical position, about eight feet from
the fire. Remove the pull-ring pin and aim nozzle at base of the fire. Squeeze lever and sweep
agent across base of fire.
