                                             Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. Conduct all T-38 aircrew evaluations according to the
provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction. (T-1).
1.2. Procedures:
     1.2.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this instruction for
     conducting flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). (T-2). To ensure standard and
     objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
     criteria.
     1.2.2. When available, use video tape or Data Transfer System (DTS) information to
     reconstruct or evaluate the mission. (T-2).
     1.2.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position or seat (to include
     chase) that will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.2.4. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
     how it will be conducted. (T-2). The examinee will accomplish required flight planning
     according to the flight position during the evaluation. (T-2). Higher headquarters FEs (and
     unit FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission
     materials, and maps, if required. (T-2).
     1.2.5. Areas required by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, are indicated in Chapter 2 of this AFI.
     When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight, it will be evaluated by an alternate
     method (that is, in a simulator or cockpit procedure trainer [CPT] or by oral examination) to
     complete the evaluation. (T-2). The alternate method of evaluation will be documented in the
     examiner’s remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification. (T-2).
     1.2.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. (T-2). This debrief will
     include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified), and any required additional training. (T-2). A squadron supervisor must be
     debriefed on all evaluations. (T-2). Additionally, a squadron supervisor must attend the
     debrief if the overall grade is Q-3. (T-2).
1.3. Grading Instructions:
     1.3.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in grading,
     provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action, and such deviations do not
     jeopardize flying safety. (T-2). Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall
     grade. (T-2).
     1.3.2. FEs will use the grading criteria in Tables 1.1, 3.1, and 3.2 to determine individual
     area grades. (T-2). FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective
     and specific situations are not covered. (T-2).
AFI11-2T-38V2 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                      5


   1.3.3. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 for basic aircraft control apply during all
   phases of flight (except as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches).

Table 1.1. General Criteria.
   General Area                               Q                          Q-                  U

   Visual Navigation Course       +5 NM                    +10 NM
   VOR/DME or TACAN Arc           +2 NM                    +3 NM

   1.3.4. When grading criteria specify that the airspeed or angle of attack (AOA) be evaluated,
   and the flight manual lists only a minimum, maximum, recommended airspeed or AOA for
   that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed or AOA. (T-2).
   1.3.5. When grading criteria specify “knots,” the performance is based on the appropriate
   airspeed for the aircraft model: knots indicated airspeed for the T-38A or knots calibrated
   airspeed for the T-38C. (T-2).
   1.3.6. When grading criteria includes references to a “procedures manual,” FEs will refer to
   the appropriate manual: AFMAN 11-250, Volume 1, T-38 Flying Fundamentals, AFMAN
   11-251, Volume 1, T-38C Flying Fundamentals, AETCTTP 11-1, Employment
   Fundamentals T-38C/Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF), or 3-3.AT38C, IFF Basic
   Employment Manual (ENJJPT). (T-2).
   1.3.7. When grading criteria includes an evaluation of the aircrew’s interface with ground
   controlled intercept (GCI), airborne warning and control system (AWACS), or other assets,
   performance parameters are based on mission-qualified controllers or aircrew members. FEs
   may make allowances for the controllers’ or other assets’ training requirements.
   1.3.8. When grading criteria includes an evaluation of timing, base the evaluation on an
   ordinance impact for a preplanned time on target (TOT) or TOT for target over flight, as
   agreed to in the briefing. The FE may substitute time at another preplanned point if a delayed
   range clearance affects timing and may widen the timing criteria for extensive threat
   reactions or route weather.
1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). In order of preference, the EPE will be
conducted in a simulator, cockpit procedure trainer (CPT), or verbally. (T-2). Only conduct a
verbal EPE if a simulator or CPT is not available or not configured appropriately for the
evaluation. (T-2). PIT and ENJJPT PIT trainees will accomplish EPEs IAW the syllabus. (T-2).
   1.4.1. The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE: (T-2)
       1.4.1.1. General knowledge to include aircraft systems and operating procedures, as well
       as use of the National Airspace System.

        1.4.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate all BOLDFACE procedures and a minimum of
        one emergency procedure per phase of flight.
        1.4.1.3. Unusual attitude recoveries.
        1.4.1.4. A minimum of one approach and use of standby or emergency instruments.
        1.4.1.5. A minimum of one approach at other than home base (alternate or divert
        airfields).
     1.4.2. Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because
     of an unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a
     successful reevaluation. (T-2).
     1.4.3. For EPEs graded “Q” with additional training required, the FE will indicate whether
     the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight. (T-2). Additional training
     and reevaluations will be accomplished in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
     (T-2).
     1.4.4. Grading criteria for each EPE area is listed in Table 3.2.
1.5. Completion of AF Form 8/8a. FEs will record aircrew member qualification using the AF
Form 8 or AF Form 8a. (T-2).
     1.5.1. Documentation of Evaluation. When an evaluation in any model of the T-38 satisfies
     the evaluations requirements in any other T-38 model, include a remark in the Examiner’s
     Remarks section of the AF Form 8/8a. (T-2).
     1.5.2. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Weapons employment results will
     be documented in the Examiner’s Remarks of the AF Form 8/8a under Mission Description
     as follows: (T-2)
        1.5.2.1. Air-to-Surface Results. Record the results using “hit” or “miss”. (T-2). FEs will
        evaluate weapons employment results based upon the examinee’s ability to achieve valid
        release parameters for the event flown and the type of range. (T-2). FEs will refer to
        applicable training standards for event parameter tolerances. (T-2).
        1.5.2.2. Air-to-Air Results. Record the number of simulated missile or gun firing
        “attempted” and the number that were “valid”. (T-2). Include entries for each type of
        simulated ordnance employed. (T-2). FEs will refer to applicable training syllabus to
        determine valid employment criteria. (T-2).
AFI11-2T-38V2 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                     7


                                           Chapter 2

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. There are six types of evaluation in the T-38: qualification (QUAL), instrument
(INSTM), mission (MSN), instructor (INSTR), rear cockpit (RCP) landing qualification, and
SPOT. Evaluations include requisites and required areas. Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is
required for an evaluation. Table 2.2 prescribes the required areas that must be included in the
flight evaluation profile. Required areas are aligned under the type of evaluation.
   2.1.1. MSN Evaluation Scenarios. Units will conduct MSN evaluations using scenarios that
   represent the unit’s mission. (T-2). FEs will designate mission profiles to evaluate the
   training, flight position, and special qualifications of the examinee. (T-2). To the maximum
   extent possible, IPs and flight leads (FL) will brief and lead the mission. The FE may require
   the FL to fly the wing position to perform events from the wing position.
   2.1.2. Formal Course Evaluations. Conduct formal course evaluations on a mission profile
   developed from syllabus training objectives. (T-2). FEs will use syllabus training standards to
   evaluate tasks not addressed in Chapter 3. (T-2).
   2.1.3. Alternate Methods of Evaluation. If it is impossible to accomplish a required area in
   flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the areas by an alternate method (for example, simulator,
   CPT, orally, etc.) in order to complete the evaluation. The alternate evaluation will be
   documented in the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8 under Additional
   Comments. (T-2). If the FE determines the required area cannot be adequately evaluated by
   an alternate method, the examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the
   evaluation. (T-2).
   2.1.4. Publications Check. The FE will check the examinee’s in-flight guide and the
   appropriate flight manual checklist during all QUAL checks. (T-2). Units may require a
   check of additional publications.
2.2. Requisites. Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When
periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in
the corresponding phase of the AF Form 8. (T-2). Completed requisites may be used for more
than one evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.

     R = Required

2.3. Pilot Evaluations:
     2.3.1. Pilot INSTM and QUAL Evaluations. The pilot INSTM and QUAL evaluations are
     normally combined. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules fulfills the
     objective of the combined INSTM/QUAL evaluation.
        2.3.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at
        airfields other than the examinee’s home field.
        2.3.1.2. The initial (INIT) or requalification (RQ) evaluation will be flown in the front
        cockpit (FCP). (T-2). Pilots who maintain basic aircraft qualification will occupy the
        front cockpit during periodic evaluations. (T-2).
        2.3.1.3. Multiple qualification pilots who complete an INSTM evaluation in another
        aircraft are not required to complete an INSTM evaluation in the T-38. Note: Unit
        commanders may require pilots to complete this additional INSTM evaluation.
     2.3.2. Pilot MSN Evaluations. Mission-qualified pilots will complete an INIT or RQ MSN
     evaluation for each mission for which they maintain qualification: Undergraduate Pilot
     Training (UPT), IFF, Companion Trainer Program (CTP), or T-38A Adversary Pilot
     (ADAIR). (T-2). The INIT or RQ INSTR/MSN evaluation at Pilot Instructor Training (PIT)
     meets the requirement for mission qualification in the UPT, PIT, and CTP missions. The
     INIT or RQ INSTR/MSN evaluation in IFF IP upgrade meets the requirement for mission
     qualification in the IFF and CTP missions. The INIT or RQ MSN/INSTR evaluation in
     ADAIR meets the requirement for mission qualification in ADAIR.
        2.3.2.1. UPT and PIT MSN Evaluations. Mission-qualified UPT and PIT IPs will
        complete a contact, formation, instrument/navigation, or low-level mission evaluation.
        (T-2). The examinee will occupy the RCP on INIT or RQ MSN evaluations during PIT.
        (T-2).
        2.3.2.2. IFF MSN Evaluations. Mission-qualified IFF pilots will complete either an air-
        to-surface or air-to-air MSN evaluation. (T-2).
            2.3.2.2.1. Air-to-Surface Evaluation. The examinee will normally lead a four-ship
            surface attack sortie. However, any air-to-surface profile the examinee is qualified to
            fly may be flown.
            2.3.2.2.2. Air-to-air Evaluation. The examinee will normally lead a basic fighter
            maneuver (BFM) sortie. However, any air-to-air profile the examinee is qualified to
            fly may be flown.
        2.3.2.3. CTP MSN Evaluations. Multiple (aircraft) qualification pilots who complete a
        MSN evaluation in their primary aircraft are not required to complete the MSN
        evaluation in the T-38. All other mission-qualified CTP pilots will complete a contact,
        formation, low-level, or instrument/navigation MSN evaluation. (T-2).
AFI11-2T-38V2 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                  9


      2.3.2.4. ADAIR MSN Evaluations. ADAIR pilots will complete an air-to-air MSN
      evaluation. (T-2).
   2.3.3. Pilot INSTR Evaluations. All instructor evaluations will evaluate INSTR required
   areas and the examinee’s instructor knowledge and ability. (T-2). Instructor pilots must
   complete an INIT INSTR or RQ INSTR evaluation, which is normally combined with the
   INIT or RQ MSN evaluation. (T-2). The examinee will occupy the crew position normally
   occupied when performing instructor duties. (T-2).
      2.3.3.1. INIT INSTR Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor, a crewmember
      must successfully complete a dedicated INIT INSTR evaluation. (T-2). An FE will act as
      a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability. (T-2).
   2.3.4. Pilot RCP Evaluations. All pilots qualified to land in the RCP will complete an INIT
   RCP landing qualification evaluation. (T-2). Periodic RCP evaluations will be combined with
   another evaluation flown in the RCP. (T-2). RCP landing qualification is mandatory for IPs.
   (T-2). The examinee will occupy the RCP. (T-2).
      2.3.4.1. FEs will include “Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification” in the Examiner’s
      Remarks section of the AF Form 8/8a under Mission Description. (T-2).
      2.3.4.2. When the RCP landing qualification is evaluated as a flight requisite for an
      evaluation, record “SPOT” in the flight phase block on the AF Form 8. (T-2).
      2.3.4.3. All RCP landing qualification evaluations will include in-flight evaluation of
      overhead and straight-in patterns, and simulated single-engine (SE), no-flap (NF), and
      normal landings flown in the RCP. (T-2).
   2.3.5. Instructor Pilot Loss of Qualification. Instructor pilots who lose their instrument
   and/or mission qualification will not perform instructional duties. (T-2).
2.4. Weapons System Officer (WSO) Evaluations. All WSO evaluations are combined
QUAL/MSN evaluations. (T-2).
   2.4.1. WSOs will complete the combined QUAL/MSN evaluation using mission profiles that
   support the unit’s mission, for example IFF. (T-2).
   2.4.2. Instructor WSOs (IW) will complete an INIT QUAL/MSN/INSTR evaluation. (T-2).
   Subsequently, all periodic evaluations will evaluate INSTR required areas and the
   examinee’s instructor knowledge and ability. (T-2). Accomplish periodic instructor
   evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible. (T-2). When students are not
   available or mission requirements or crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of
   students, the FE may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s
   instructional ability. Unusual attitude recognition and instrument interpretation will be
   demonstrated during the EPE. (T-2).
   2.4.3. Minimum ground phase requisites are: (T-2)
      2.4.3.1. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
      2.4.3.2. EPE.
      2.4.3.3. Instrument examination.
