flight by squadron/group leadership. This is not a formal evaluation and will not be annotated on
an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. Squadron leadership includes CC, DO,
chief pilot/navigator/flight engineer/loadmaster/flight nurse/AE tech, flight commanders and
instructors. An individual or crew supervisory flight may be conducted from the primary
position. Individuals administering a supervisory flight may log primary time, instructor or
evaluator (if instructor or evaluator qualified), or other time. 908 OG/OGV will be notified if a
supervisory flight highlights any area that requires Stan/Eval attention.

                                           Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The MAF command and control (C2) network consists of the following C2
centers: AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) Global Cell, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)
or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air Mobility Operation Control Centers
(AMOCCs), ANG Readiness Center, AFRC Command Center, theater Air and Space Operations
Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center
(JOSAC), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response
Groups (CRG), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF
commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
   2.1.1. (Added-908AW) Command and Control (C2). The 908 AW/CP (Hank Ops) is the
   action agent for the 908 OG/CC. Report problems or unusual occurrences through the 908
   AW/CP by one of the following means:
       DSN:           493-2717 (After Hours 334-430-9085)
       COMM:          (334) 953-2717
       FAX:           493-2710
       UHF:           Contact ―Hank Ops‖ on published frequency
       Phone Patch:   USAF Global HF Network
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The PIC will execute
missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or
best course of action).
2.2. (908AW)Execution Authority. The execution authority directs mission management
through the controlling agency. Contact the controlling agency through the respective action
agent (908 AW/CP, AFRC/CP, TACC, etc.). All missions, training and operational, require a
Mission Identifier (MI). The 908 OG/CC is the execution authority for local training missions.
357 AS/DOO is the controlling agency when the 908 OG/CC is the execution authority. Local
training missions do not normally require higher headquarters (HHQ) approval.
EXCEPTION: Any sortie with passengers or cargo (excludes local wing airdrop training loads)
requires a HHQ issued MI. Additionally, if a landing is made at other than home station or an
approved transition training base, a HHQ issued MI is required.
NOTE: 357 AS/DOO is responsible for mission management during the planning phase.
Missions enter execution phase at the initial aircrew report time. The PIC assumes responsibility
for the mission at report time.
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for
   procedures and requirements governing OSTs.
   2.2.1. (908AW) Off-Station Mission. The PIC is responsible for contacting the controlling
   agency daily and will report aircraft movements, activities, problems and any unusual
   occurrences.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                           23


       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
       2.2.1.1. (908AW) AFRC/DOOM is the controlling agency when AFRC is the execution
       authority. The AFRC/CP (DSN 497-0680 or commercial 800-223-1784 X0680) is the
       AFRC action agent. The MI for AFRC directed missions begins with Q (does not include
       local training missions that specifically begin with ―QUNRB‖).
       2.2.1.2. (Added-908AW) TACC is the controlling agency and action agent when AMC
       is the execution authority. Refer to AFI 11-2C-130V3, Table 2.1 for TACC contact
       numbers.
2.3. Pilot in Command Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an aircraft
commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a
flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements.
An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC‘s judgment an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, transition
   training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting and accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.8. Responsible for obtaining and maintaining an IMT account to access Aircrew
   Departure Papers.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
 24                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final
   authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate
   ground service agencies of the aircraft‘s impending arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.1. (908AW) Contact the 908 AW/CP with takeoff time as soon as practical after home
   station departure. Before landing at home station (approximately 20 minutes out), contact
   the 908 AW/CP with the proposed landing time, estimated landing fuel and alpha-status to
   include a brief description of any discrepancies. After landing, inform 908 AW/CP of the
   actual aircraft block time. Maintenance personnel will debrief the aircrew following warm
   turns and mission termination at building 1016 IAW 908 AWI 21-108, Aircraft Debreifing .
   For hot turns, the enplaning crew will receive a thorough briefing by the deplaning crew on
   the aircraft‘s maintenance status. When the Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) is not
   manned, the aircrew will provide a complete verbal debriefing to the crew chief on any items
   entered in the AFTO 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2
   agency by any means available (i.e., Defense Switching Network (DSN), high-frequency
   (HF) radio, Iridium phone and L-Band satellite communication (SATCOM), etc.). HF radio
   is the primary method of communication for routine mission information. For critical C2
   communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications
   are the primary method with L-Band SATCOM as the backup.
   2.5.3. En route Reporting.
      2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to TACC, as required:
          2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
          2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
          2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing,
          to update arrival time.
      2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
      the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
      2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
      through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
      FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
      plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-
      ALE), L-Band SATCOM).
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     25


  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
  Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Not Used.
  2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications (HF, DSN, Iridium Phone, etc.) are the primary method. The PIC will
  contact the flight manager before signing the flight plan for each sortie.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to Air Traffic Control
     (ATC) position reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew
     flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting
     normal communication methods.
     2.5.7.2. Crews must also receive a verbal tactics and intel briefing on the leg prior to
     entry into a hostile area/combat zone.
  2.5.8. HF Communications.     HF is the primary means of access to the worldwide C2
  network.
  2.5.9. L-Band SATCOM. L-Band SATCOM provides a worldwide communications
  capability (secondary to HF). L-band SATCOM may be used for routine communication if
  the message is unclassified. Due to large volume of traffic, MAJCOM C2 will only forward
  3-hour out or other L-Band messages when specifically requested. In this case, the L-Band
  message to MAJCOM C2 must include, ―Relay, no C2 agent (or negative HF contact) at
  (include station name)‖ in the message remarks.
     2.5.9.1. Employment. Limit SATCOM communications to operational traffic. Turn the
     transceiver and laptop on during preflight and leave it configured to transmit and receive
     messages until aircraft power down at destination. For missions operating through
     sensitive or classified locations disable the Global Positioning System (GPS) position-
     reporting feature.
     2.5.9.2. Home Station. Operations groups will be responsible for storing, maintaining
     day-to-day control, and administrative accountability of computers. Crews departing
     home station without a laptop computer will inform TACC. Laptops stay with crew not
     airplane. EXCEPTION: For unit deployments, deployed commanders may develop
     alternate laptop transfer procedures for deployed crews.
     2.5.9.3. En route. Issue one laptop to each crew; including stage crews.
         2.5.9.3.1. Laptops may be secured aboard aircraft which have been modified with a
         suitable secure container. On aircraft lacking a suitable secure container, computers
         will be stored in the command post or other suitable MAF C2 Center.

      2.5.9.4. Staging Operations. Control procedures should ensure crews maintain original
      laptop computer issued by home station. Do not store laptop computers on aircraft
      during staging operations.
      2.5.9.5. L-Band SATCOM Messages and Advisories.
          2.5.9.5.1. On-station Message. Transmit an on-station message at the beginning of
          each crew duty day.
          2.5.9.5.2. Arrival Advisory. IAW 2.5.6.
          2.5.9.5.3. Advisories. Transmit (free-text messages) mission delay, in-flight refuel,
          on/off-load reports.
          2.5.9.5.4. When using L-Band SATCOM, include ―TACC please confirm addressee
          received this message,‖ in remarks field.
   2.5.10. Not Used.
   2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
   transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
   2.5.12. Iridium Phones. Crews are authorized to use Iridium phones in VMC with the
   following restrictions:
      2.5.12.1. Limit in-flight phone use to cruise (normally above 10,000 feet AGL) altitude.
      The phone shall be off during takeoff, climb/departure, descent/approach, and landing
      phases of flight.
      2.5.12.2. Do not use Iridium phones if AAR-47 and/or ALE-47 systems are required for
      mission accomplishment.
      2.5.12.3. Do not transmit on secure radios if coupling the Iridium phone to the aircraft
      intercom system using the Iridium Subscriber Unit (ISU). To ensure security of
      classified transmissions, disconnect the ISU and Iridium phone from the intercom before
      using secure radios.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate an MC when more than two aircraft are assembled
   to perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing
   a MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
      designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an airdrop, or
      tactical airland operation. For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit
      involved, the theater AOC shall designate a central planning agency responsible for
      coordinating the entire mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead
      planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade)
      officer qualified in the type mission.

       2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
       2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
       will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
       rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling
       agency and all non-collocated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.
2.7. Not Used.
2.7. (908AW)Operational Control. Although an organization or agency may have execution
authority over a 908 AW mission, the 908 AW retains operational control of 908 AW resources,
including aircrew members and aircraft. EXCEPTION: 908 AW relinquishes operational
control when aircraft and/or aircrew members are chopped to a MAJCOM/combatant command.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Table 2.1 contains a list of TACC phone numbers.
Crewmembers may also use the TACC toll-free number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL, to contact other
offices within the TACC, including flight managers.

2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-
time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned
Estimated Time of Departure (ETD), and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of
the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities‘ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.11. Enroute Maintenance Support. 18 AF TACC/XOCL will support all mobility aircraft
requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance regardless of type of mission or component.

                         AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-related
work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types. EXCEPTION: Crew
complement for specialized mission (e.g. Aerial Spray, Ski, and MAFFS) is addressed in the
Addendas covering those missions.

NOTES:
(1) The PIC maintains ultimate responsibility of overall conduct of the mission. However,
qualified aircrew in the seats when the PIC is not at the controls maintain responsibility for the
actions they take. Transfer of pilot-in-command duties between qualified ACs will be briefed to
the crew.
(2) Sq/CCs or deployed mission commanders may authorize flights without a navigator when
not required for mission accomplishment.
NOTES:
A navigator is required to fly on training missions if reported/forecasted weather includes
thunderstorms or if other inclement weather exists. Units will establish procedures regarding the
use of navigators on proficiency trainers.
A navigator is required to fly on training missions if the mission will be conducted below 3,000
ft AGL outside of radar control.
(3) Two loadmasters may be required, at the unit commander‘s discretion, depending on mission
complexity. Combat or contingency missions with hostilities require two loadmasters.
(4) Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified crewmember are required if more
than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried (except during unit moves or contingencies).
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       29


Both crewmembers must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs
and landings.
(5) Only one loadmaster is required for tactical missions if: using only one paratroop door for
personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs) drops; high altitude (up to 13,000 feet MSL) non-
static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and door or, only one paratroop door is opened.
Dropping only simulated airdrop training bundles (SATBs); a no-drop (dry pass) is planned and
ground time is sufficient to permit on-load or off-load by one loadmaster.

 NOTES:
 (1) NVG preflight and sign-out will be accomplished prior to report time.
 (2) Flight plan, CARP data and 280 will be complete prior to report time. Additional
 training periods (FTP/GTP) are authorized for the mission commander and pilot briefer or
 navigator briefer on any airdrop mission when they report no later than 3+15 hours prior
 to takeoff, regardless of planned sortie duration.
 (3) Loadmaster report time for missions scheduled to airdrop actual Personnel, CDS or
 Heavy Equipment is 3+15 hours prior to takeoff. Additional training periods (FTP/GTP)
 may be authorized for loadmasters who report no later than 3+15 hours prior to takeoff on
 any mission scheduled to airdrop actual Personnel, CDS or Heavy Equipment, regardless
 of planned sortie duration.
 (4) Loadmaster report time for missions with scheduled combination drops is 4+00 hours
 prior to takeoff. Additional training periods (FTP/GTP) may be authorized for
 loadmasters who report 4+00 hours prior to takeoff on any mission with scheduled
 combination airdrops, regardless of planned sortie duration.

   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for local flights is an aircraft commander,
   pilot/copilot, flight engineer and loadmaster. When a mission requires more than one aircrew
   member at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and a Non-Mission
   Ready (NMR) crewmember meet mission requirements.

  3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
  basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
  (MR) IAW AFI 11-2C-130, Vol 1, Aircrew Training. EXCEPTION: A NMR pilot may
  augment provided the other two pilots are MR IPs. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the
  full FDP. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the flight is underway.
  3.2.3. An additional flight engineer or scanner may be used for basic or augmented crews in
  those units without loadmaster Unit Manning Document (UMD) authorizations, provided no
  more than 30 passengers are carried or cargo exceeds 500-lbs (100-lbs maximum per single
  item) or requires special handling in accordance with AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous
  Materials for Military Air Shipment. ANG/AFRC units may use an additional flight engineer
  provided these provisions are met.
  3.2.4. Tactical Airlift Formation Lead Requirements.
     3.2.4.1. Definitions:
         3.2.4.1.1. Flight Lead crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either flight
         lead qualified or are receiving lead upgrade training from an instructor of like crew
         position. Can accomplish mission commander duties and can lead 2 or more aircraft.
         3.2.4.1.2. Element Lead crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either
         element lead qualified or are receiving element lead upgrade training from an
         instructor of like crew position. Can lead a 2-ship or perform element lead duties in a
         multiple element formation.
         3.2.4.1.3. Deputy Lead crew: a flight lead crew that is ready to assume formation
         lead duties if the formation lead aborts. A deputy lead is required for formations
         greater than 4 aircraft. Deputy lead may fly as the number 2 aircraft in the first
         element or may fly as second element lead as long as no other aircraft occupies the
         number 2 position.
         3.2.4.1.4. AWADS crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either AWADS
         qualified or are receiving AWADS upgrade training from an instructor of like crew
         position. Can drop in IMC.
         3.2.4.1.5. An Element consists of 2 aircraft. A Flight consists of 3 or 4 aircraft.
     3.2.4.2. Unilateral training Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) - no special
     requirements.
     3.2.4.3. Unilateral training IMC.
         3.2.4.3.1. Single-element formations. An element lead crew is required or one
         instructor pilot is required in the formation (any position). For IMC airdrops an
         AWADS crew is required in the formation lead position.
         3.2.4.3.2. Multiple-element formation. A flight lead crew or instructor pilot is
         required in the formation lead and deputy lead (if required) positions and in each
         flight lead position. Element lead positions require a flight lead crew, element lead
         crew or instructor pilot. If deputy lead or an element lead aborts after station time,
         any crew can assume their position with the concurrence of the mission commander.
         Any crew can fly the last ship of a formation even if it is a deputy lead or element
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      31


           lead position. For IMC airdrops, the deputy lead crew and every crew in a flight lead
           position must also be an AWADS crew.
       3.2.4.4. Other than unilateral (IMC and VMC). A flight lead crew is required in the
       formation lead and deputy lead positions (single element formations only require an
       element lead crew). Element lead positions require a flight lead or element lead crew.
       Any crew can fly the last ship of a formation even if it is a deputy or element lead
       position. For IMC airdrops, every crew in a flight lead position must also be an AWADS
       crew.
   3.2.5. NVG Aircrew Complements. Normally, an NVG crew will consist of an NVG
   certified crewmember in each of the primary crew positions (a crewmember in upgrade
   supervised by a qualified instructor meets this requirement). However, the pilots, navigator,
   and engineer may use NVGs even if the loadmaster is not NVG certified.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF IMT 8)
   or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position
   when under direct instructor supervision.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log ―FP/FN‖ for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log ―OP/ON‖
   for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781.

   PIC shall brief the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Not Used.
   3.4.3. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF IMT
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot under direct IP supervision may fly with
       passengers on board.
       3.4.3.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers on board. Touch-and-
       go and stop-and-go landings are authorized with MEGP on board.
   3.4.4. An AWADS or IMC airdrop qualified AC will be in the seat during IMC personnel
   airdrops.
3.5. Navigators. A non-current or unqualified navigator may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner.
 32                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


3.5. (908AW)Navigators. Navigators are required when any of the following conditions are
present: 1) passengers are on board; 2) the mission will not remain within the local training area
(200NM radius of the MXF TACAN); 3) NVG training is conducted; 4) VLL/SKE/airdrop

6) the aircraft will be operated below 3,000 ft AGL outside of radar control.
   3.5.1. An AWADS or IMC airdrop qualified navigator will be in the seat during IMC
   personnel airdrops.
   3.5.2. Grid Navigator requirement. SQ/CC shall include a grid-qualified navigator on
   aircrews tasked to fly north of 65°N latitude, south of 70°S latitude, or in airspace where
   FLIP en route charts indicate compass indications may be erratic or depict airways, tracks, or
   navigational aids as oriented to true or grid north (i.e. Canadian Northern Airspace).
   EXCEPTIONS:
       3.5.2.1. Flights within Alaskan airspace.
       3.5.2.2. Flights on published airways using magnetic references.            Destination and
       alternates must have published magnetic instrument approaches.
       3.5.2.3. Aircraft equipped with two or more operable independent navigational systems.
3.6. Flight Engineers and Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified flight engineer or
loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a
qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period. FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time and
   ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP
   when the autopilot fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after
   the departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to
   preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include
   diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and
   comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot is inoperative). If the autopilot fails after departure, consider mission
       requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude further mission delays
       due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting to an airfield with
       maintenance capability. Contact C2 to coordinate intentions, and comply with
       limitations. Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend the
       FDP to an augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall
       augment basic crew to extend FDP).
           3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
           weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
           augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
           long as:
               3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                   33


            the first takeoff of the day.
            3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
            rest en route.
         3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
         authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
         mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
         delays. C2 agents shall not ask a PIC to exercise this option.
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion
     of the aircrew when the autopilot is inoperative.
     3.7.1.3. Maximum FDP for nuclear airlift missions is 16 hours. 12 hours when the
     autopilot is inoperative (regardless of augmentation).
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training, Tactical, JA/ATT, and Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check
     Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
         3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, tactical, and FCF/ACF missions is 16 hours
         (12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local
            training missions provided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16 hours
            and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
                3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military and
                civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first
                duty period (military or civilian).
         3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station or a deployed staging base
         following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time. CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform combined
  ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission duties
  within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for other
  missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. Maximum CDT is
  18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 20+00 hours for an augmented aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. For Self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
     times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
     3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
 34                                        AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      3.7.3.3. For BRAVO standby: CDT/FDP begins when an aircrew member shows for
      duty.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, deadhead time is the time
   computed traveling in passenger status. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the
   purpose of positioning or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support
   function. Crewmembers may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent
   may approve crewmembers to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      flying in deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for deadhead flight).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties for a
      maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo on-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   under the influence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
   provides AMC/A3 guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help
   aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest
   periods. Fliers on augmented aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
   3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
   fatigue management tool.
   3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
   with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than
   squadron commander), and with each individual aircrew member. During extended
   deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight
   surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home unit medical team prior to
   dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
   3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
   medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
   for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A37V website.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       35


  3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
  counter fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS
  will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
  duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures if prescribed no-go pills.
  3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
  the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go
  medications):
  3.9.7. (908AW) 357 AS/DOO and/or 908 AES/DO shall inform the 908 OG/CC and the
  SME FS when missions fall under the conditions outlined in AFI 11-2C-130V3, C-130
  Operations Procedures section 3.9.7.
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, climate
     controlled, and darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming no-go pills (consider duties not including flying (DNIF)). EXCEPTION:
  Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm
  prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect [6 hours for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours
  for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline
  where they would be under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties
  (use mission report or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
  3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
     3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
     surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
     3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within the DNIF periods for each
     of the no-go pills as specified in paragraph 3.9.8 of this instruction.
     3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
     alcohol.
     3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
     supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
     potential interactions.
     3.9.9.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no
     more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
 36                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      3.9.9.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28
      days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
3.10. (908AW)Crew Rest/En Route Ground Time. Aircrew schedulers will notify their
respective crewmembers to enter crew rest. Aircrew schedulers will advise the 908 OG/CC if
aircrew members are not notified in time.
   3.10.1. Home Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
   aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest at least 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
   Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
   first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers
   to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG and AETC in accordance with
   AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
      load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
   16 hours (nuclear airlift missions will be IAW AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations)
   ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
   3.10.3. (908AW) Off-station/En route Ground Time. 357 AS/DOO will plan a minimum of
   16+15 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff when crew rest is
   required.
      3.10.3.1. Missions planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify normal ground time as
      follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
          to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
          duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16 hours ground time.
      3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
      times longer than 16 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
      cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          37


     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A to AFRC, ANG and AETC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that kept an aircrew off station 16 hours or more, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the
  deployed FCC or MEGP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. The PIC is the final
  authority on FCC‘s work/rest schedule. See AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
  Management, for detailed guidance.
  3.10.6. (908AW) Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. Upon arrival at en
  route/transient locations, the FCC‘s primary job is preparing the aircraft (e.g. inspect, service,
  maintain) for the next sortie/mission. The FCC does not automatically enter crew rest with
  the aircrew upon arrival at the en route/transient location unless the duty day was exceeded.
  Because the FCC is assigned to the mission/aircraft, the PIC decides when the FCC‘s rest
  cycle begins for the next mission and coordinates with en route location supervisors (if
  applicable). The PIC ensures that the work/rest plan takes the entire FCC duty day into
  account (report time through aircraft duties after landing). The PIC ensures that the FCC
  receives adequate rest prior to aircraft launch at en route locations.
     3.10.6.1. Upon arrival at en route locations the PIC will determine how long the FCC can
     safely perform aircraft maintenance duties on assigned aircraft. PIC will ensure the FCC
     has coordinated with en route maintenance supervision prior to entering crew rest with
     the crew.
     3.10.6.2. During extended ground times (non-stage operations) the PIC should
     coordinate with en route maintenance supervision to determine FCC duty requirements
     for assigned aircraft.
     3.10.6.3. (Added-908AW) FCC oxygen requirements are the same as passenger oxygen
     requirements.
 38                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       3.10.6.4. (Added-908AW) The FCC duty day begins when the FCC reports with the
       crew or shows at the aircraft and begins pre-departure activities (whichever occurs first).
       While away from home station, the FCC must coordinate report/show time with the PIC.
       3.10.6.5. (Added-908AW) Flight time is considered duty time if adequate rest facilities
       are not available. The availability of adequate rest facilities during flight should be
       considered when determining FCC work/rest plan. NOTE: Crew rest platforms, bunks,
       or properly installed litters are considered adequate rest facilities.
       3.10.6.6. (Added-908AW) The PIC will establish a work/rest plan to ensure the FCC
       has minimum rest IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
       The FCC must be afforded the opportunity for 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep during a 24-
       hour period.    Interruptions will only be made during exceptionally unusual
       circumstances.
       3.10.6.7. (Added-908AW) The FCC duty day will not normally exceed the basic
       aircrew duty day, however, the PIC may extend the FCC duty day provided the FCC has
       use of adequate in-flight rest facilities as described by paragraph 3.10.6.5 . The FCC‘s
       duty day must end if fatigue jeopardizes safety.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
   waivers in the Exercise or Contingency OPORD, OPLAN or Concept of Operations
   (CONOPs).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
   3.10.8. (908AW) 357 AS/DOO and/or 908 AES/DO will make a reasonable effort to seek
   out adequate government lodging facilities at en route locations. The ultimate responsibility
   for ensuring that lodging facilities meet the best interests of the USAF rests with the aircraft
   commander.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew‘s orders to a POC for the next crew rest location‘s Prime Knight
       function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        39


  3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+l5 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
  hour for reporting and 2+l5 hours for mission preparation). OG/CCs may publish alert
  procedures for local training missions.
  3.11.1. (908AW) Minimum report times for home station departures are annotated in Table
  3.1 or as printed on the 908 AW weekly flying schedule. The SOF/PIC briefing will occur
  at report time.
     3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
     alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
     may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
     cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
     agency.
     3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and T.O. 1C-
     130-9 section VI cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2 hours before normal
     alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the
     loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster more than 1 hour
     before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the loadmaster‘s show time.
     3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
     is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
     aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
     3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
     3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
     aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
     3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
     coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
     missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
     avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
     3.11.1.5. (908AW) Aircrew members will self-alert for missions that originate from
     home station. The PIC will determine alert procedures at en route locations.
  3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
     3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
     agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
     3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
     alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
     12 hours when flying in deadhead status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC
     to accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the
     window as necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return
     Time (FSRT).
     3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
     during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
     the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
     from the time of notification.
 40                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if a mission can‘t depart within 4
       hours of scheduled takeoff time, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and establish a new
       expected alert time. The PIC may extend takeoff window to 6 hours.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their FSRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped
   aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure
crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force
Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be
   placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.
   Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew entrance
   door with the lock box or other controllable device, which will prevent entry without damage
   to the door or lock. The aircrew preflight portion remains valid if performed by one crew,
   cocked on alert, and launched by another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a
   standard procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        41


   designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure
   command and control and the controlling agency are notified when uncocking and recocking
   generated aircraft. Pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest.
   Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while
   performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-
   flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Pre-flights, if required,
   interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter
   them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby
   force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
   12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
   able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
   hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DOD                   4515.13-R,    Air
Transportation, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to specific operations,
exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such
as unit conversion to another model design series (MDS). Participating aircrews shall use
guidelines established by the lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly
operations as follows:
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the Mission Design Series (MDS)
   (aircraft and model), as well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the
   aircraft/mission.
 42                                        AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command for the MDS. The MC or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.
   3.15.3. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. MDS conversion training.
      3.15.4.1. Units may request interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs
      will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include
      as a minimum a list of affected units, duration of agreement and purpose.
3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are
authorized ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility
operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany
the normal crew compliment are allowed ACM status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
      3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
      3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
      3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
      Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
      military duty status.
      3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
      aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
      3.16.1.5. Travel on SAAMs when specifically restricted by the mission directive.
      3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by
      JOSAC through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM
   status. OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other ACM. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the Air
   Terminal Operations Center (ATOC), who in turn will coordinate with the passenger
   terminal; seats not previously assigned may be used for ACMs.
   3.16.5. The PIC or designated representative will brief ACMs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an ACM aircrew-related duties for which the ACM is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                   43


3.17. MEGP. Procedures and policies regarding MEGP are contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI
11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized.
   3.17.1. (Added-908AW) The 908 OG/CC is the mission essential ground personnel
   (MEGP) approval authority for all missions conducted by the 908 OG. Coordinate MEGP
   requirements through 357 AS/DOTF.
3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document; include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft
status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A
PIC who accepted an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
   governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, and paragraph. Initiate
   waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight managers.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         45


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority
   for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes
   Operational Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For
   AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/A37V through TACC.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station Departure/Main Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and en route (Column B). An
asterisk (*) in the Required column indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to
the Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. AMC and AMC gained aircrews
will consider Pope AFB, Little Rock AFB and Dyess AFB as MOBs. Aircrews transiting a
MOB on the retrograde portion of a mission may treat a MOB as an en route location. For
example, a Little Rock AFB C-130 transiting Pope AFB en route to Lajes AB will use Column
A. However, when transiting Pope AFB en route to Little Rock (de-positioning) use Column B.
NOTE: Column B requirements will not normally be waived when transiting a MOB on a de-
positioning leg. Local training missions, to include off-station trainers, fall under Column B.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: Normally a Red X discrepancy is downgraded for
       a one-time flight. This condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers. The
       priority is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must coordinate with
       appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the destination. One-time flights
       may include en route stops only when necessary to recover the airplane. Example: An
 46                                             AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


        airplane departs on a gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an en-route fuel
        stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
             4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
             nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
             4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
             nearest repair capable facility.
        4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
             4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
             scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
             item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
             determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
             with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
             4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
             not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with
             repair capability, after engine start the FE discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is

4.6. C-130 MEL. This MEL applies to all C-130 models and lists the minimum equipment and
systems to launch the aircraft under routine operations. The MEL does not include all equipment
or systems essential to airworthiness. The MEL is not intended to promote continued operation
of the aircraft for an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. Due to the various
configurations of C-130s, the number in the ―Installed‖ column is a representation of the
majority of the aircraft. If your series requirement is different than the number shown, there is
no waiver requirement for the number installed.

4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. Navigation Systems.
   4.8.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the
   North Atlantic Region or the Composite Hawaii/Mainland US Route System, the following
   fully operable navigation systems are considered the minimum necessary to permit
   compliance.
       4.8.1.1. SCNS aircraft. Fully operational SCNS, to include the navigator‘s IDCU and
       either the pilot or copilot‘s IDCU.
       4.8.1.2. Compass systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational.
       If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is
       affected.
   4.8.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the PIC determines the minimum
   navigational capability required to safely accomplish the mission. Consider the following:
   length and route of flight, weather, and experience and proficiency of the crew.
   4.8.3. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory.
   Loss of any component before track entry requires return to a station with maintenance
   capability or re-filing via specified routes.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-130-1-1 do not account for a gear-
   down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that
   they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and
   alternates).
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval or OG/OGV.
4.10. Minimum Equipment for NVG Operations. The following equipment is required for
NVG operations (in addition to the equipment listed above):
   4.10.1. Pilot‘s Radar Altimeter.
   4.10.2. Navigator‘s Radar (NVG airland/assault only) . Must be operational for initial
   takeoff. If the radar fails en route, PIC will determine whether or not to continue mission
   based on ORM assessment.
   4.10.3. SCNS with integrated GPS and a minimum of one INS must be operational for low-
   level flights flown using NVG en route altitudes.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                    57


      4.10.3.1. If any of the components listed in 4.10.3 are inop or fail en route, conduct
      operations no lower than minimum safe altitude (MSA). EXCEPTION: Wingmen may
      fly in-trail at NVG en-route altitudes as long as all components in paragraph 4.10.3 are
      operational in the lead aircraft.
4.11. (Added-908AW) Over-Torque of T-56-15 Engines. In the event an over-torque is
experienced, comply with the following guidelines extracted from T.O. 1C-130A-6, Aircraft
Schedule Inspection and Maintenance Requirement.
   4.11.1. (Added-908AW) 19,600 to 21,500 in-lbs. Record over-torque on AFTO Form
   781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. (No inspection required)
   4.11.2. (Added-908AW) 21,500 to 23,000 in-lbs. Record over torque on AFTO Form
   781A. When over-torque is due to throttle movement alone and no other engine malfunction
   is suspected, local flights or off-station missions may continue until aircraft is normally
   returned to maintenance.
NOTE: DO NOT EXCEED 25 FLIGHT HOURS after the over-torque prior to an inspection by
qualified maintenance personnel.
   4.11.3. (Added-908AW) Greater than 23,000 in-lbs. Record the over-torque on the AFTO
   Form 781A. Local or off-station missions, at the discretion of the aircraft commander and
   home station maintenance supervisor, may continue with the scheduled sortie. Upon mission
   termination the aircraft will not be flown again until required inspections are completed.
NOTE: DO NOT EXCEED 25 FLIGHT HOURS after the over-torque prior to an inspection by
qualified maintenance personnel. Extensive maintenance action is required.

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc. are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts
   IAW AFI 11-215. For AMC and AMC-gained units, AMC/A37V is the checklist insert
   approval authority. The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in
   an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall approve local in-flight
   guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out. Do not challenge these items during checklist accomplishment.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, PICs
may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical
phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Only one pilot, or the flight engineer,
may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the PIC prior to departing assigned
primary duty station.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight. The total number of persons permitted is limited to the
number of seats with operable seat belts and a sufficient oxygen source. Passengers and
observers will not be permitted access to primary crew positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
       5.4.1.2. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance. EXCEPTION:
       Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) trained pilots may perform takeoffs and landings
       during aircraft emergencies.
       5.4.1.3. Tactical/Max effort operations or landings with substandard airfield operations.
       5.4.1.4. Missions operating in areas of hostile activity, unless conditions prevent
       compliance.
       5.4.1.5. Situations when in the opinion of the PIC, marginal conditions exist.
   5.4.2. ACs who possess less than 100 Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) hours in the C-130
   since certification will perform all takeoffs and landings from the left seat. EXCEPTION:
   They may allow current ACs or higher to perform takeoffs and landings from the right seat
   when required to maintain currency.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          59


   5.4.3. Copilot Takeoff/Landing Policy. Copilots may takeoff or land from the right seat if an
   AC with over 100 hours since certification in the C-130 occupies the left seat. Copilots may
   takeoff and land from the left seat only if an IP provides direct supervision from the right
   seat. Copilots will not takeoff or land from the right seat when in formation.
   5.4.4. MPD trained pilots may takeoff or land from either seat if an AC with over 100 hours
   since certification in the C-130 (200 hours for tactical events) occupies the other seat.
   NOTE: MPD trained pilots in Mission Upgrade may occupy the left seat on formation
   departures/recoveries and assault or substandard airfield operations with an IP in the right
   seat.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) the aircraft will
command configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) the aircraft will verify appropriate
airspeed and configuration prior, then echo the gear or flap actuation command, and finally,
actuate the appropriate switch.
5.6. Outside Observer/ACM Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during
taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless
   crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing unless crew
   duties dictate otherwise. Fasten shoulder harness unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties or are in upgrade training to
   instructor or flight examiner are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a
   primary crew position; however, they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, may remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations Movement on
the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may
   dictate the use of all, some, or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the
   mission commander. Landing lights will be extended and ready for use prior to all landings.
   The tactical situation will dictate if the landing lights will be used during landing. Lights-out
   operations during peacetime will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3. Follow the exterior
   lighting guide in AFTTP 3-3.25 for all NVG training situations.
       5.8.1.1. Total lights-out operations are authorized with concurrence of the controlling
       agency in restricted airspace and warning areas.
   5.8.2. Cargo compartment lighting will be dictated by the situation and will be coordinated
   between the mission commander/PIC and loadmaster(s). During cargo compartment
   emergencies the loadmaster should discontinue NVG use and select full bright on the cargo
   compartment lights (situation permitting).
 60                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   5.8.3. Interior lighting will be set-up using NVIS compatible lighting for all NVG airland
   operations (C-130E/H and H-2 ―harness‖ filter kit or Glendale Filter system (GFS) are also
   acceptable). ―Taping‖ with NVG compatible chemical lights is not an acceptable lighting
   scheme for NVG airland operations. WARNING: NVGs adjust to the brightest source of
   light; for that reason, poor cockpit lighting discipline may prevent a successful transition to
   landing during IMC. Therefore, do not perform an instrument approach in IMC to an NVG
   landing without NVIS compatible flight deck lighting.
   5.8.4. Aircraft Preparation. For NVG en route and airdrop operations, aircrews are allowed
   to ―tape‖ incompatible lighting and use NVG compatible chemical ―glow‖ sticks. Some
   techniques for taping are outlined in AFTTP 3-3.25. NVIS compatible lighting (including
   lighting ―harness‖) is required for all NVG airland operations.
       5.8.4.1. Loadmaster Aircraft Preparation. Taping of lights may be accomplished;
       however, no more than one layer of tape will be used.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops, handheld (HH) GPS, and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Tables 5.1
through 5.4 depict mandatory calls for nonprecision approaches, precision approaches, climbout
and descent, respectively.

Table 5.1. Nonprecision Approaches.

(1) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go around
will be made.
(2) With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The pilot
may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not descend
below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the
red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
(3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond
intention to ―Land‖ if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown
and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
(4) Both pilots and navigator will state the altimeter setting.
   5.11.1. Deviations:
       5.11.1.1. The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed,
       or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made
       to correct the deviation.
       5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in
       airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.
       Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.

5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000
   feet MSL.
   5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance are cleared prior
   to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.12.3. Command Radios:
       5.12.3.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls.
       5.12.3.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
       unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
       on the inbound and outbound legs.
       5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and will read back all ATC clearances. The navigator
       or communications systems operator (if applicable) will record the clearance instructions,
       monitor the read back, and ensure compliance with all instructions.
       5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
       maximum extent possible.
       5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission prohibits the use of unauthorized
       frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.12.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement ―Time Out‖:
       5.12.4.1. ―Time Out‖ is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers.
       The use of ―Time Out‖ will:
          5.12.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational
          awareness.
          5.12.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
          5.12.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew
          departing from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
          uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
       5.12.4.2. As soon as possible after a ―Time Out‖ has been called, the aircrew will take
       the following actions:
          5.12.4.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
          5.12.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
          5.12.4.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
          inputs relative to the stated concerns.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         63


          5.12.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
          current course of action or direct a new course of action.
5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DOD 4515.13R.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic
beverages.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements:
   5.15.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. For peace-time do not use runways
   less than 3,000 feet. Minimum runway width is 80 feet (60 feet for max effort). Minimum
   taxiway width is 30 feet. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive runway/taxiway width
   requirements.
   5.15.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Minimum runway length for normal take-
   off is Critical Field Length or Minimum Field Length for Maximum Effort Take-Off for max
   effort operations. All speeds and distances will be computed ―without nose wheel steering.‖
   For mission accomplishment the PIC may authorize ―with nose wheel steering‖ corrections
   on dry hard surfaced runways in lieu of downloading cargo/fuel. Minimum runway for
   normal landing is Landing Distance or Ground Roll plus 500 feet for max efforts. For peace-
   time compute landing performance with two engines in reverse, and two engines in ground
   idle.
      5.15.2.1. Runway Length for Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate
      takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision
      to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.15.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.15.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or runway condition
      reading (RCR) for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of 40 feet either side
      of centerline should be cleared (30 feet for maximum effort operations). If 40 feet either
      side of centerline is not cleared (30 feet for max effort ops), compute takeoff data based
      on the uncleared portion.
      5.15.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
      if needed.
   5.15.3. Arresting Cables.
      5.15.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
      recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
      to have the cable inspected.
64                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


     5.15.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
     slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
     (ATIS), or ATC.
     5.15.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems are installed,
     with an eight point cable tie-down system, without regard to the Dash-One Caution.
     When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown
     if the BAK-12 system includes eight point tiedowns, aircrews should recognize the
     increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
  5.15.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
     5.15.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
     guidance. Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield
     suitability based upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed
     in the ASRR.
     5.15.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A36AS for all questions
     pertaining to airfield weight bearing capability and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
     before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
     in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
     specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
     Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A36AS. HQ AMC A37V is the
     OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for
     non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews that have
     access to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield data base via
     the HQ AMC Aircrew Portal. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
     5.15.4.3. For other than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways, the airfield must be listed in
     the ASRR as certified or have a current landing zone (LZ) survey.
  5.15.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to the flight manual
  for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative when
  dealing with unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways).
  Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported
  low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the
  runway. The runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a
  reflective glare.
     5.15.5.1. RCR and RSC. The performance charts used to determine braking action are
     based on concrete runways. The RCR values for the following runway surfaces in Table
     5.5 are estimates based on operational experience and should be used only as a guide.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      65


Table 5.5. RCR Values.
    TYPE SURFACE                          RCR (DRY)        RCR (WET)
    Asphalt                               23               12
    Aluminum Matting                      20               10
    M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP)             20               8

    Crushed Rock                          16               5

      5.15.5.2. Limit C-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a
      covering of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is
      equal to one inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than one inch of slush
      or water is present may not be accurate.
   5.15.6. Wind Limitations. All tactical/max effort operations must fall in the ―recommended‖
   area of charts unless otherwise approved by OG/CC.
   5.15.7. Takeoff Speeds. If Vmeto is used for takeoff, climb until clear of the real or
   simulated obstacle at max effort obstacle clearance speed.
      5.15.7.1. If obstacles are a factor, use Vmeto and max effort obstacle clearance speed
      without Vmca corrections. If unable to clear obstacles using Vmeto and maximum effort
      obstacle clearance speed, reduce aircraft gross weight or delay mission for more
      favorable conditions.
      5.15.7.2. The PIC will ultimately make the decision to use Vmeto or Vmca based on a
      consideration of all available data including: weather, runway length, Vmeto, Vr, Vmca,
      Vmcg, applicable airfield survey, and a review of hazards, obstructions, and terrain both
      laterally and along the climb out flight path. Peacetime restrictions: take-off at Vmca or
      Vmeto, which ever is greater unless obstacles are a factor. WARNING: Max effort
      operations at high altitude, gross weight, and temperatures are critical; climb angles as
      low as 2.5 degrees may prevent the aircraft from accelerating. Any further climb angle
      increase may result in the loss of airspeed and the onset of a pre-stall buffet.
   5.15.8. Anti-icing fluid. AMS 1428, Type II anti-icing fluid is authorized for use in extreme
   climatic conditions. Due to the shearing properties of Type II anti-icing fluid, it may be
   necessary to increase takeoff speed. When Type II anti-icing fluid is used, increase takeoff
   speed to a minimum of 110 KIAS and make necessary distance corrections to performance
   data.
5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without
   marshalers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to
66                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


  ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is
  permanent. Parked aircraft are not considered permanent, and 25 feet of clearance, or a wing
  walker, is required.
  5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
  unavailable, the PIC will deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction
  clearance and provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned
  crewmembers, or a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) to act as
  an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
  marshalers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to
  have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all
  times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
  5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
  Crews should:
     5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout, paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
     requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
     5.16.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
     5.16.3.3. Use low speed ground idle whenever possible.
     5.16.3.4. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If it becomes necessary to accomplish a
     180° turn on a narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a
     link taxiway or at a designated turn around pad.
     5.16.3.5. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
     unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, use low speed ground idle on that
     engine (to the maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
  5.16.4. Reverse Taxi: The PIC shall coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the
  loadmaster and marshaler (when available). Before reverse taxiing, the loadmaster shall:
     5.16.4.1. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
     5.16.4.2. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12-inches above
     horizontal.
     5.16.4.3. Position himself/herself on the aircraft ramp to direct reverse taxi, report any
     hazards, and to provide the PIC with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance
     remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
     5.16.4.4. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
     5.16.4.5. During night reverse taxi operations without NVGs, the PIC and loadmaster
     will ensure the taxi area is sufficiently lighted. CAUTION: Prop Blast during ground
     operations is capable of causing extensive damage to other aircraft, flight line equipment,
     and airport facilities.
  5.16.5. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the PIC, the loadmaster
  may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above horizontal
  to prepare for cargo off/on-load provided equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secure in
  the cargo compartment.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          67


5.17. Not Used.
5.17. (908AW)Hot Brake Procedures. No single area has been designated a hot brakes area at
Maxwell AFB. Aircrews experiencing hot brakes should, if able, exit at the end of the runway
and follow published evacuation procedures.
5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.18.1. AMC policy is to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight dictates an
   immediate jettison (as determined by the PIC). Except in the case of an emergency, before
   jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude,
   and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas, except when safety of
   flight would be compromised.
   5.18.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency (TACC,
   AMOCC, CAOC, etc.) may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement
   dictates immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2
   agency may provide fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.18.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.18.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental Impact
   Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
   5.18.4. (908AW) The fuel jettison area for unit aircraft is north of Maxwell AFB, over
   unpopulated terrain, above 20,000 feet.
   5.18.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing (AMC Form 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual
   Occurrence Worksheet). Submit AMC Form 97 through unit OGV to AMC/A37V. Unit
   OGVs will retain AMC Form 97 for 6 months. Document all pertinent information,
   including the following items:
       5.18.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
       5.18.5.2. Actual Duration.
       5.18.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
       5.18.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
       5.18.5.5. Recovery Field.
       5.18.5.6. Runway Available.
       5.18.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
       5.18.5.8. Jettison Amount.
       5.18.5.9. Reason for Jettison.
       5.18.5.10. Approval Authority.

5.19. Aircraft Speed. IAW this AFI, AFI 11-202V3 and the applicable Dash 1.
5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
       pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
       required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.20.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
   landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
   Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR
   Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance
   instructions.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.20.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized CONUS bird
   migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest
   news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) website is another source for real time
   bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC aircrew mission
   planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments. PIC should complete AF Form 853 and fax to nearest
   Air Force Flight Safety Office
5.21. FCFs and ACFs. FCFs and ACFs will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1-1-300, Functional
Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, T.O. 1C-130X-6CF-, Acceptance and/or
Functional Check Procedures Manual, and AFI 21-101. Crews should only perform tasks or
functions contained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard
function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        69


5.21. (908AW)FCFs, ACFs and OCFs. An FCF certified aircrew is required to perform an FCF,
ACF or OCF.
   5.21.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
      5.21.1.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
      procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
      require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
      5.21.1.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional
      guidance in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial
      FCF to check only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or
      modification.
      5.21.1.2. (908AW) Functional Check Flight (FCF) area for the 908 AW is the local
      training area (200NM radius of the MXF TACAN). FCF aircrews will review the
      guidance contained within TO 1C-130E(H)-6CF-1 ACCEPTANCE AND FUNCTIONAL
      CHECK FLIGHT MANUAL prior to flight.
      5.21.1.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base
      from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under
      specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
      5.21.1.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility
      of the MAJCOM/A3/DO.
      5.21.1.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF
      crewmembers. The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM
      assessment for that specific FCF flight.
      5.21.1.5. (908AW) As a minimum, the AC and the FE will be designated (in writing) as
      ―C-130H Functional Check Flight‖ certified by the 908 OG/CC.
      5.21.1.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under
      a combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all
      systems are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR
      on Top‖ for the altitude phase of the flight.
      5.21.1.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the LG/CC may subsequently release the
      aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
      FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
      5.21.1.8. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW
      the flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum
      fuel necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will
      permit a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn
      on the anti-skid system. The FE will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned
      and ensure runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions
      without exceeding normal brake energy limits.

5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial
Events, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Aerial events must be sanctioned and
individually approved by the appropriate military authority, and the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). AFI 11-209 and AMC Supplement 1 identify events sanctioned for
support and specify the approval authority for each type. AFI 11-209 stipulates that units
participating in aerial events will ensure activities are coordinated with the FAA through the
regional Air Force representative.
5.23. Hand-held (HH) GPS with Laptops for Moving Map Display (MMD).
   5.23.1. The HH GPS and MMD are designed as a situational awareness tool. The pilot
   monitoring and navigators are designated the primary users of MMD. PICs may authorize
   other crewmembers to use the MMD to assist with situational awareness. Falcon View is the
   only AMC approved software for MMD use.
   5.23.2. Aircrew members using MMD will immediately discontinue monitoring if safety of
   flight is inhibited or during any other situation the PIC determines it unsafe to use.
   5.23.3. Do not use HH GPS/MMD for primary navigation. All chart and fixing
   requirements are still required. The hand-held GPS will not be used to update navigation
   equipment (SCNS/INS).
   5.23.4. Before using the HH GPS in-flight, aircrew members must receive training and
   aircraft must be capable of supporting the HH GPS equipment.
   5.23.5. Only GPS units approved for use with laptop computers will be used.
5.24. Terrain Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
5.25. Radar Altimeter.
   5.25.1. Any crewmember detecting the illumination of the radar altimeter Low Altitude
   Warning Light will immediately notify the pilot flying the aircraft. Terrain clearance and
   aircraft position must be verified.
   5.25.2. Before departure set the radar altimeter for emergency return.
   5.25.3. The navigator and pilot will use the same radar altimeter setting unless briefed
   otherwise.
   5.25.4. Set the radar altimeter to the Height Above Touchdown/Height Above Airport
   (HAT/HAA) during instrument approaches.
5.26. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts may be performed
when approved by the OG/CC or DIRMOBFOR. This authority may be delegated to the
squadron commander or MC when the unit is deployed. This authorization will not be construed
to allow repeated buddy or windmill starts at various scheduled en route stops. Nonessential
crewmembers and all passengers will be loaded after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi
start.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         71


5.27. Reduced Power Operations (N/A for 3 Engine Operations). Pilots will normally use
reduced power for takeoffs provided refusal speed (Vr) is equal to or greater than takeoff speed.
Use normal takeoff power if Vr is less than takeoff speed.
5.27. (908AW)Reduced Power Operations. Aircrews are encouraged to use fuel conservation
measures and the lowest power settings commensurate with safe mission execution.
   5.27.1. Reduced power operation for normal takeoffs and takeoffs from stop-and-go
   landings will use a predicted torque corresponding to 900 degrees C TIT not to exceed
   19,600 inch-pounds of torque. Power settings up to maximum power may be used during
   stop-and-go takeoffs to comply with training restrictions listed in this chapter. Maximum
   continuous power (970 degrees TIT for -15 engines) should be used to takeoff and climb to
   cruise altitudes.
   5.27.2. Do not exceed maximum continuous power (932 degrees TIT for -7 engines or 970
   degrees TIT for -15 engines) during cruise. For normal cruise operations 932 degrees TIT
   for dash 7 engines and 970 degrees TIT for dash 15 engines will be used. Cruise at a
   constant KTAS (280 KTAS for dash 7 engines and 300 KTAS for dash 15 engines),
   adjusting TIT at least every hour. For legs of 2 hours or less consider cruising at 260 or 270
   KTAS (280 or 290 for dash 15 engines). On short legs with cruise altitude under 10,000
   MSL, KIAS should be limited to 210 or less. On missions that are not time critical consider
   flying at a TAS corresponding to 850 degrees TIT (900 degrees TIT for -15 engines) to
   preserve first stage turbine vanes. This reduction in TIT will decrease fuel consumption by
   approximately 4%, increase turbine life, decrease sulfidation corrosion by approximately
   200%, and increase thermocouple life.
   5.27.3. Reduce power for formation takeoffs to a torque corresponding to maximum
   continuous power (970 degrees TIT for -15 engines). Formation leaders will brief takeoff
   torque when different series C-130 aircraft are in the same formation.
   5.27.4. Reduced power is not authorized for max effort takeoffs.
5.28. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through TACC or appropriate C2 agency.
5.29. (Added-908AW) Propeller Arc Danger Area. Personnel will not enter the static
propeller arc unless necessary in the performance of duties. The propeller arc is defined as:
fuselage abeam inboard propeller to the outer edge of the outboard propeller.
5.30. (Added-908AW) Home Station Aircraft Recovery Procedures.
   5.30.1. (Added-908AW) Reconfiguring Returning Aircraft. Aircrews will make every
   effort to reconfigure their aircraft before returning to home station to the configuration
   previously coordinated by 357 AS/DOO and 908 MOF/MOC. In-flight reconfigurations
   should not be accomplished if the PIC/loadmaster determines that such actions would be
   detrimental to mission accomplishment or safety of flight (e.g., forecast moderate turbulence,
   passenger/cargo requirements dictate otherwise, low-level operations).
72                                        AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


  5.30.2. (Added-908AW) Aircraft Cleanliness. Aircraft commanders will ensure that the
  aircraft is maintained in an orderly and professional manner. After flight, loadmasters will
  consolidate all waste into a plastic trash bag for maintenance personnel to remove.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         73

   when staging or transiting Elmendorf AFB AK.
6.2. Personal Requirements.
   6.2.1. Passport. Crewmembers will carry a valid passport on all missions outside the
   CONUS. EXCEPTION: Unit commanders may authorize newly assigned personnel who
   have applied for, but not yet received, a passport to act as crewmembers on missions not
   scheduled to transit locations where passports are required.
   6.2.2. Shot Record. Crewmembers must maintain worldwide shot requirements and carry
   their shot records on all missions outside the CONUS (except overseas units on local training
   missions).
   6.2.3. Not Used.
   6.2.4. Driver‘s License. A valid state driver‘s license is required on each TDY where use of
   US government general purpose vehicles may be required. Crewmembers will contact the
   local airfield manager before driving on the flight line.
   6.2.5. Identification Tags. Crewmembers will carry two identification tags on all flights.
   6.2.6. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, or

74                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


  elastic hair fasteners and/or pins, clips, or barrettes providing they do not interfere with the
  wearing of headsets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. They will be accounted for before
  and after flight.
     6.2.6.1. (Added-908AW) Crewmembers must account for all equipment and personal
     items after each flight. Ensure that any lost items are documented in the AFTO Form
     781A. If an item is lost, a red ―X‖ will be entered in the 781A and the aircraft will be
     impounded. Notify maintenance immediately.
  6.2.7. Helmets and Oxygen Masks. Loadmasters will always carry their helmets. Other
  crewmembers will carry a personal helmet:
     6.2.7.1. Anytime parachutes are required to be carried by the mission directive.
     6.2.7.2. Whenever the aircrew requires night vision goggles or flash-blindness devices
     (MIL-G and/or PLTZ goggles).
     6.2.7.3. When required for wear of the aircrew chemical defense ensemble.
     6.2.7.4. For unpressurized flight operations above 10,000 feet MSL.
  6.2.8. Flashlights. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight for night flights.
  6.2.9. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on flight lines during hours of
  darkness or periods of reduced visibility.
  6.2.10. Tool and Airdrop Kits. At least one engineer‘s and one loadmaster‘s tool kit will be
  on board for all missions. One loadmaster airdrop kit will also be aboard the aircraft for
  aerial delivery missions. Units will identify tool kit contents and inventory procedures in
  their local supplement. As a minimum, the flight engineer tool kit will contain the tools
  necessary to perform the emergency actions in section 3 of the flight manual and hostile
  environment repair procedures. One NVG aircraft preparation kit will be on board for NVG
  missions.
  6.2.10. (908AW) Tool and Airdrop Kits. The aircraft toolbox (CTK) suffices for the flight
  engineer and loadmaster requirement to carry an individual tool kit. The following
  procedures will be followed for security and accountability of the toolbox.
     6.2.10.1. (Added-908AW) CTKs located on board aircraft will be managed in the
     following manner: The AFRC Form 177, Consolidated Tool Kit and Inventory and
     Control Log, AFRC Form 175, Missing/Removed Tools and Equipment, and AFRC Form
     174, Lost Tool/Object, will remain with the CTK and inventory listing. At home station
     the crew chief that is using the CTK will sign it out and will sign it in at the end of the
     shift. When the flight crew accepts the aircraft for a mission (missions without an FCC),
     one member of the flight crew will inventory and sign the AFRC Form 177 accepting
     responsibility for the CTK until it arrives or returns where a crew chief will inventory and
     sign the CTK back in. The AMXS superintendent/expediter/supervisor will perform a
     beginning and end of shift inventory for CTKs that are located at home station.
     6.2.10.2. (Added-908AW) For missions with an FCC assigned, the FCC will take
     responsibility for the CTK using the procedure outlined in Paragraph 6.2.10.1 . Upon
     return, if there are no flight line personnel available to take responsibility for the CTK,
     the key will be left in the AFTO Form 781 binder.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        75


   6.2.11. Hostile Environment Repair Kit. One Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) will
   be onboard for all OCONUS and contingency deployment missions. The HERK will not
   normally be onboard the aircraft for CONUS and non-contingency missions. Units will
   identify where the HERK will be stored on the aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI.
   The flight engineer will ensure the HERK is onboard and servicable (sealed) during the
   aircraft preflight prior to departure. Additionally, the fight engineer will ensure one-each
   generator and starter pad is onboard the aircraft for missions requiring the HERK. The Herk
   will not be removed from the aircraft until mission completion, and then only by the owning
   unit.
      6.2.11.1. (Added-908AW) HERK Kit. All 908 AW aircraft will have a HERK kit
      installed for deployments where the aircraft may be directed into a hostile or a potentially
      hostile environment (e.g., CORONET OAK, JOINT ENTERPRISE, Operation IRAQI
      FREEDOM, etc.). The HERK kit will be positioned in the far left lower galley
      compartment behind the galley floor (when in the up position). If the HERK kit is used
      (seal broken), record the reason and new seal number in the AFTO Form 781A.
      Annotate which part was used in the AFTO Form 781A, if applicable. In the event that a
      seal is found inadvertently broken, perform an inventory. If all items are accounted for,
      replace the seal with a spare located in the HERK kit and record the new seal number in
      the AFTO Form 781A as an INFO NOTE. Use of the HERK will be IAW AFI 11-2C-
      130V3.
   6.2.12. NVGs. All crewmembers will carry and preflight their own NVGs prior to flight for
   missions using NVGs. If available, one spare set of NVGs will be carried per crew. Each
   crewmember will carry approved spare batteries for their own NVGs. The spare will also be
   preflighted.
   6.2.12. (908AW) NVGs will be preflighted and signed out prior to mission report time.
      6.2.12.1. Both Pilots will wear the same type NVGs.
      6.2.12.2. (Added-908AW) NVG Glendale Filter Kit. Flight Engineers will ensure that
      a NVG Glendale Filter Kit is positioned on the aircraft for all missions requiring NVG
      operations. Normally the kit will remain on the aircraft and be stored on the flight deck
      upper/lower bunk.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
   information necessary to successfully operate there. The review should include (but is not
   limited to):
   6.3.2. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
   6.3.3. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country Risk
   Assessment (CRA), and FLIP.
   6.3.4. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion).           Obtain
   necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
   6.3.5. Obtain required customs forms.
 76                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   6.3.6. Obtain worldwide FLIP and sufficient communications security (COMSEC) materials
   for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.7. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.8. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.9. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
   6.3.10. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
   6.3.11. Release available seats to passenger terminal. Coordinate with C2 agency to release
   available seats to the passenger terminal.
   6.3.12. Consider any foreseeable safety risks and risk mitigation factors IAW Operational
   Risk Management (ORM).
   6.3.13. (Added-908AW) 357 AS/DOO will provide mission setup information for all off-
   station 908 OG missions. As a minimum, a GDSS2 Mission Detail, ―Giant Report‖ and
   point of contact information for aircraft passenger/cargo load (if applicable) will be provided
   to the PIC at mission report time.
   6.3.14. (Added-908AW) Parachute and other aircrew flight equipment requirements will be
   coordinated by 357 AS/DOO. If requirements change after mission report time, the SOF/PIC
   will be responsible for informing the aircrew flight equipment section of the change.
   6.3.15. (Added-908AW) 357 AS SARM will provide the AF Form, 4327A, Crew Flight
   (FA) Authorization, GDSS2 Aircrew Mission Set-up report and Mission Accomplishment
   reports (MAR) for all 357 AS aircrew members at mission report time.
   6.3.16. (Added-908AW) 908 AES SARM will provide the AF Form 4327A and Mission
   Accomplishment reports (MAR) for all 908 AES aircrew members at mission report time.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications
specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Units may specify additional publications in their unit
supplement. When the crew includes two additional crewmembers in the same specialty (i.e.
two loadmasters on airdrop missions) each will carry a checklist but otherwise only one set of
publications is required.
6.4. (908AW)Aircrew Publications Requirements are IAW AFI11-2C-130V3 Table 6.1 and the
908 OG Flight Crew Bulletin.

   6.4.1. (Added-908AW) Aircrew Electronic Publications Program.
       6.4.1.1. (Added-908AW) AFI 11-215 authorizes the distribution of electronic
       publications to individual crewmembers to take advantage of technology which offers
       distribution efficiencies and significant reproduction cost reductions. The 908 OG
       Aircrew Publications Program is designed to take advantage of new technology and save
       printing costs while meeting the requirements of applicable AFIs. The Program consists
       of four parts: Individual Pubs, Section Pubs, Aircrew Pubs Kits and AES Trip Kits. OGV
       is the overall manager of the publications program. The OGV Loadmaster is the POC
       with the OGV Engineer as the alternate; Section Pubs Monitors will be responsible for
       the currency and content of section pubs, the pilot section will be responsible for the
       aircraft Aircrew Pubs Kits and the AES will be responsible for the AES Trip Kits.
       6.4.1.2. (Added-908AW) Individual Pubs.      Consist of electronic-Pubs (e-Pubs) and
       paper pubs.

        All electronic publications will be available to aircrew members for download
        from the Maxwell S:\ drive.
        6.4.1.2.4.2. (Added-908AW) All aircrew members are still required to carry and
        use the appropriate paper checklists. Electronic or paper flight manuals may be
        used as the primary document in the event of an emergency. In all cases, paper
        flight manuals are required to be onboard the aircraft for flight as a back up to
        electronic media.
        6.4.1.2.4.3. (Added-908AW) Only Air Force approved equipment (in
        accordance with AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules) will be used to display "e-
        pubs" in flight. Reference ASC/ENAD Carry-on Equipment Certification Letter
        located on the AMC/A3V website. 908 AW crewmembers will use an Air Force
        approved laptop from the flight planning room as the only equipment approved
        for viewing e-pubs in flight on 908 AW aircraft.
        6.4.1.2.4.4. (Added-908AW) For aircrew members participating in the e-pubs
        program, the publications review conducted as part of an evaluation will include a

                6.4.1.2.4.4.3. (Added-908AW) Individuals who do not have access to a
                personal computer may participate in the e-pubs program. After receiving a
                storage device, the individual may sign out a laptop computer from the
                squadron or paper pubs from their respective section for use outside the
                squadron.
                6.4.1.2.4.4.4. (Added-908AW) Crewmembers‘             responsibilities       for
                participating in the e-pubs program. OGV will issue storage devices when
                available. It is the member‘s responsibility to return or replace any devices
                issued. Devices must be returned in the original issued condition. These
                devices are for official use only and are not approved for classified use. The
                member must update electronic or paper pubs from an approved              source
                immediately upon notification. The device will be carried on all flights.
            6.4.1.2.4.5. (Added-908AW) E-pubs will be standardized and will include all
            publications and technical orders that are required to be issued to aircrew
            members. Crewmembers will not rearrange the documents on the storage device.
            E-pubs will include the following folders/tabs.
                6.4.1.2.4.5.1. (Added-908AW) ―FM" (flight manuals). All flight manuals
                required to be issued to aircrew members (if available in digital format).
                6.4.1.2.4.5.2. (Added-908AW) ―AFI‖ (Air Force Instructions). All AFI's
                required to be issued to aircrew members. This folder will also include all
                other pubs other than the Flight Manual to include TO's, AFI's, Pamplets, ect.
                6.4.1.2.4.5.3. (Added-908AW) OGV may further divide these folders and
                may include other folders for local publications. The AFI folder will include
                an excel spread sheet labeled "Copy of AIRCREW PUBS, MISSION KIT &
                FCIF LIBRARY with hyperlinked pubs. The AFI folder will also include a

     pubs kit will enter the e-Pubs #, date, name and signature on the form. These pubs will
     be checked for currency by OGV through supplemental evaluations.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-908AW) Aircrew Pubs Kits. AFI11-202V2AMCSUP1 states either
     electronic or paper flight manuals may be used as the primary document in the event of
     an emergency. In all cases, paper flight manuals are required to be onboard the aircraft
     for flight as a back up to electronic media. Since aircrew members are not issued paper
     copies of all inflight pubs, a complete set of inflight pubs for each crew position (AFIs
     and TO‘s) will be inventoried and signed out by the co-pilot prior to the SOF/PIC
     briefing. The Aircrew Pubs Kit will be carried to the aircraft by the loadmaster on all
     flights. Co-pilots are responsible for carrying the Aircrew Pubs Kit from the aircraft back
     to the squadron, accomplish an inventory and place back in storage. Aircrew members
     are relieved from carrying individual pubs, however they will carry their own Checklists
     which are not included in the Aircrew Pubs Kits. Aircrew Pubs Kits are maintained by
     the pilot section. The pilot section is responsible for each kit's content and currency.
        6.4.1.4.1. (Added-908AW) Each Aircrew Pubs Kit will contain an inventory list.
        The Aircrew Pubs Kit Update Sheet across from the SOF counter will be used to
        document updates. The individual updating the pubs kit will enter the e-Pubs #, date,
        name and signature on the form. As with FLIP publications, Aircraft Mission Kits,
        and Aircraft Forms 781, it is ultimately the aircraft commanders‘ responsibility to
        ensure content and currency. OGV flight evaluators will include a check of Aircrew
        Pubs Kits during flight evaluations.
        6.4.1.4.2. (Added-908AW) 908 AW crews delivering or returning aircraft from long
        term maintenance or other units must carry the pubs kit with them to ensure they have
        paper pubs for use in flight.
        6.4.1.4.3. (Added-908AW) When a navigator is not required for the mission (Local
        PRO, etc) a pilot will ensure all FLIP pubs required for the mission are on board the
        aircraft. An Air Force approved laptop will be carried on all missions when a
        Navigator is on board.
        6.4.1.4.4. (Added-908AW) AES Trip Kits.           These kits will be maintained and
        updated by the 908 AES.
     6.4.1.5. (Added-908AW) Pubs Changes. 908 OG/OGV will notify flyers of pubs
     changes via FCIF. Changes to e-Pubs will be posted by OGV in the e-Pubs Folder on the
     Maxwell s:\ drive. The 908 OG E-Pubs folder will have a folder with a reference number
     (07-01) displayed to show the latest update. Inside the latest update folder will be a word
     document with the names of the publications that were changed and the release date. 908
     OGV will obtain and distribute required paper changes to individuals and section pubs
     monitors. Changes which require small quantities of paper may be downloaded from the
     Maxwell S:\ drive, copied and then distributed. Larger changes will be sent to Base
     Repro. Tech Order changes, ISS, OSS, etc., are ordered through appropriate channels.
     Section pubs monitors will ensure changes to the section pubs and the pilot section will
     ensure the Aircrew Pubs Kits are promptly and properly posted.

   11-2C-130V3, C-130 Operations Procedures, Table 6.2 are met.
6.12. Briefing Requirements.
6.12. (908AW)Briefing Requirements. Home station departures require a SOF or PIC briefing
at report time. The SOF/PIC briefing will include aircrew member go/no-go status, aircraft
status, weather condition, bird watch condition, airfield status and special interest items. A SOF
 84                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


will be present at the 357 AS operations desk 30 minutes prior to the earliest aircrew member
report time (e.g. 3+45 hours prior to takeoff on missions dropping actual Personnel, CDS or
Heavy Equipment). The SOF duty period ends 30 minutes after landing.
EXCEPTION: A SOF is not required during periods of reduced flying operations; however, a
squadron duty officer (normally, the 357 AS/DO or the 908 AES/DO) will be immediately
available by telephone, pager or radio. Contact the squadron duty officer directly or through the
908 AW/CP. When a SOF is not required, the PIC and squadron duty officer will share those
duties normally performed by the SOF.
NOTE: Two or more aircraft or aircrews scheduled simultaneously will not be considered
reduced flying operations and will require a SOF.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
   hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
   manuals, and OPORD procedure.
       6.12.1.1. (Added-908AW) Reporting Procedures. Aircrew members and mission
       essential ground personnel (MEGP) will report ready for duty at the 357 AS operations
       counter at report time. Prior to report time, aircrew members will don proper flight
       clothing, preflight/sign-out mission required flight gear, read and sign off the latest FCIF
       in pencil, remove all materials from their publications bin and review the flight
       authorization. Aircrew members will initial the flight authorization in pen (adjacent and
       to the right of their name) to indicate compliance with these requirements. Any changes
       to the flight authorization will be made in pen and initialed by the SOF/PIC prior to
       takeoff. The SOF/PIC will transmit a copy of the official flight authorization to the 908
       AW/CP prior to takeoff. Mission changes that effect the flight authorization (e.g. aircrew
       member added or removed) after the aircrew has assembled at the aircraft will be relayed
       to the SOF and/or 908 AW/CP prior to takeoff.
NOTE: Not applicable to 908 AES aircrew members when assigned to missions operated by
another wing or agency.
           6.12.1.1.1. (Added-908AW) 908 OG/OGV, 357 AS/DOT and 908 AES will each
           maintain a monthly Go/No-Go letter in the SOF logbook. Any aircrew member
           restrictions will be found here. The aircrew member/PIC/SOF is responsible for
           ensuring that aircrew members are properly supervised (if required) during all phases
           of flight and that all Go/No-Go restrictions are observed.
           6.12.1.1.2. (Added-908AW) 357 AS SARM/908 AES SARM will ensure that
           aircrew schedulers are informed of aircrew member flying status changes resulting
           from DNIF actions, overdue flight physicals, overdue altitude chamber training or
           aeronautical order changes. 357 AS SARM will post their respective information in
           the SOF logbook behind the Go/No-Go letters.
           6.12.1.1.3. (Added-908AW) Return to unsupervised flight status. Upon completion
           of required training/clearing actions, the flight instructor will line through (in pen) the
           accomplished event in the Go/No-Go letter (OGV/DOT) contained in the SOF
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      85


         logbook. Instructor initials and date cleared will be annotated in pen, adjacent and to
         the right of the deleted restriction.
     6.12.1.2. (Added-908AW) Crew Assembly Times. The AC will direct time of aircrew
     assembly at the aircraft.
  6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing,
  including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), and ORM. Brief crewmembers
  on the specific mission details if not previously accomplished. Use briefing guides contained
  in AFTTP 3-3.25.
     6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted
     prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission
     details for that day‘s sortie(s) and the ORM factors for the mission. Complete this
     briefing prior to engine start.
     6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. For missions conducting NVG operations crews
     will review and coordinate NVG failure procedures for all phases of the mission. Any
     crewmember who experiences NVG problems will inform the rest of the crew. During
     cargo compartment emergencies, return to normal lighting until the emergency is
     resolved. Discuss actions for Smoke and Fumes in the aircraft.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
  peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
  Specialized briefings review formation tactics and procedures, and technical instructions for
  specialized equipment operations.          All crewmembers should attend each briefing.
  Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties; however,
  the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. PICs will use AFTTP 3-3.25 briefing guides. If
  the briefing guide is not contained in AFTTP 3-3.25, then a MAJCOM approved briefing
  guide will be used.
  6.12.3. (908AW) Specialized Briefings. SOF/PIC briefings will be immediately followed
  by a concept briefing. Concept briefings for all multi-ship and AES missions will be
  accomplished in the 357 AS Mission Briefing room. Concept briefings for single-ship
  missions may be accomplished in the mission planning area. Flight engineers and
  loadmasters are not required to attend concept briefings; however, the PIC will provide
  detailed mission information during the AC Crew Briefing. Include (as applicable) type,
  number and condition of patients/passengers, AE training scenario, cargo upload/download,
  terrain and weather considerations, flight profile to include tactical ingress/egress, enemy
  threats, type airdrops and AGL altitudes, recoveries, etc. Some missions require an early
  report for loadmasters crewmembers. They will receive a PIC/SOF brief at their scheduled
  report time.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
     takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
 86                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       use TACC weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting
       the theater AMOCC) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
       6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location.
       6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight, OWS, or TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any means
       available prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
       6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
       are not required
   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
   zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. On flight managed sorties, the PIC or the designated representative
   will, after reviewing the Aircrew Departure Papers, contact the flight manager to obtain final
   sortie details and to resolve any discrepancies or disagreements.
   6.12.8. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
   obtain a current intelligence briefing.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
       6.13.1.1. (Added-908AW) In the absence of a HHQ assigned call sign, the 357 AS
       standard call sign is HANK followed by the last two digits of the aircraft tail number.
EXCEPTION: Formation flights will use the 357 AS standard formation call sign HANK 61 for
day sorties and HANK 71 for night/NVG sorties. Single ship sorties with the 908 AW/CC on
board will use the call sign HANK 01.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters ―RCH‖
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and the 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation. For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac‖ followed
   by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator. Refer to
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        87


   FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call signs will
   be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call signs
   when required.
   6.13.5. Search and Rescue. On actual search, rescue, and recovery missions, use the call
   sign ―Air Force Rescue‖ plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
   6.14.1. (Added-908AW) Aircrews departing home station for the purpose of immediately
   entering the LATN may file VFR at their discretion. In this case, the use of ATC flight
   following service is highly encouraged.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       TACC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
       6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude is verified for each
       waypoint.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
   6.15.3. The flight engineer will complete AF IMT 4064, C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data
   Card and AF IMT 4063, Mini C-130 TOLD Card, as specified in Chapter 12. Pilots and
   copilots will use AF IMT 4063. A pilot crewmember, or additional flight engineer, will
   cross-check the AF IMT 4063 for accuracy by using the performance manual or approved
   tabulated data. As a minimum, the person checking the data will:
       6.15.3.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF IMT 4063.
       6.15.3.2. Cross-check air minimum control Vmca (one engine inop in ground effect),
       takeoff, and landing speeds.
       6.15.3.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
       (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.
 88                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. The PIC will provide the obstacle
height, distance, and gradient information necessary for performance computations to the flight
engineer.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures. NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
       VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
       high terrain are avoided.
       6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
          departure route.
          6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
          emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
          with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that
          are more favorable exist.
       6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
       CONUS.
       6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
       clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
   in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
       6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
       IAW 6.16.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument
       approach.
       6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
       are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
       IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1) NOTE: Screen height requirements for
       departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
       departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
       height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
       when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
       (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
       appropriate authority.
          6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     89


         6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
         6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
         published.
         6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
         6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
         published.
         6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
         6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.16.2.3. Aircraft must be able to meet the published climb gradient for the departure
     runway with all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm
     will be used. NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL
     ENGINE climb gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that are more
     favorable exist.
     6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route if unable to meet the published climb
     gradient with OEI:
         6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedures (SDPs). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI
         escape procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the
         loss of an engine and, where available, should be used for engine-out departure
         planning. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through
         OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A37V authorizes the use
         of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 30 days after the analysis date. The SDP analysis
         date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet.
         6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
         is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
         ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
         available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
         gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
         gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
         Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
         crews may subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-
         out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
         obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
         published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
         must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles by computing the MTOGW for
         the obstacles and comparing it to that calculated for the climb restriction. NOTE: If
         the requirements of 6.16.2.4.2 cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until
         more favorable conditions exist.
  6.16.3. Critical Field Length (CFL). Takeoff GW must never exceed that which would
  require CFL in excess of the runway available for a normal takeoff. In some cases, a
  minimum altitude is required at the published screen height. For screen height of 50 feet or
  less, use DER correction on the balanced critical field length chart to determine if runway
 90                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   available and aircraft performance meet departure restrictions. For higher screen height
   (greater than 50 feet), add 50 feet to balanced CFL for every foot of required altitude at DER
   (Example: 55 feet screen height drives a 250 feet increase to balanced CFL).
   6.16.4. Gross Weight (GW). Ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the maximum GW,
   zero fuel weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in the aircraft flight manual. GW
   may be further restricted by operating conditions such as, icing, temperature, pressure
   altitude, runway length and slope, aerodrome weight bearing capacity, departure
   maneuvering, required climb gradients, and obstacles.
       6.16.4.1. Takeoff GW must not exceed that which would, in the event of an engine
       failure, lower the rate of climb to less than a 2.5 percent climb gradient (152-feet per
       NM).
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Minimum RVR for takeoff is 1600.
   6.17.1. For RVR less than 1600 but equal to or greater than 1000, takeoffs are permitted for
   operational missions provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum
   RVR 1000 on both), runway centerline lighting is operational, and both pilots are fully
   qualified in their respective crew position. If any of the above criteria is not met, minimum
   RVR is 1600 on all RVR readouts.
       6.17.1.1. When weather is below landing minimums, a departure alternate is required
       (see paragraph 6.19).
       6.17.1.2. If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be
       reported to be 1/2 mile (800 meters) or better.
6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for an
   available approach (at departure aerodrome). If planning an ILS approach, Category I
   minimums will be used.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          91


       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for one hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DOD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not
   exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
   geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
   The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
       precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
       precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
       minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
       considerations to a remote or island destination.
   6.20.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes
   greater than 59°N, see Chapter 14 for fuel planning considerations.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
       6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft to which the forecast turbulence
       applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture
       for their route of flight. The C-130 is a category III aircraft for turbulence.
       6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
       fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
       WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
       and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
92                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


  6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
  operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
  NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
  Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
  equivalent to severe icing.
     6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
     conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
     IAW flight manual procedures.
     6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
     ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
     icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
         6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
         flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
         associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
         times.
         6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 (Type I and Type II) and AMS 1424 (Type I) de-icing fluids
         are approved for use on the C-130. These deicing fluids do not provide any anti-icing
         benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times.
         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
  6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
     6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL 230.
     6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
     6.21.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air
     temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a
     rapidly moving thunderstorm. WARNING: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more
     from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
     thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203 Volume 1, Weather for
     Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
     6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
     6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
     6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       93


  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
     6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
     6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
     6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
     feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8° C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
     or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
     they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
     gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
     observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
     missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH,
  and other altitudes inside the FAF. Additional procedures for temperature corrections
  beyond the requirements listed in the FIH are contained in AFI 11-202 V3.
  6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
  turbulence.
  6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
  flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
  weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
  6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
  volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid flying downwind of
  volcanic activity, and in all cases by at least 20 NMs.
  6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
  strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
     6.21.11.1. Within 8C of freezing level.
     6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
     thunderstorm activity.
  6.21.12. (Added-908AW) Adverse Weather at home station. Aircraft commanders and
  formation mission commanders should exercise good judgment when thunderstorms are in
  the vicinity at home station. Flightline ground personnel will be cleared from the ramp when
  lightning is within 5 NM of the field. Use extreme caution and plan to avoid departures and
  recoveries when operating under these conditions.
     6.21.12.1. (Added-908AW) During Taxi Operations, the PIC will determine the safest
     course of action, (i.e., hold in place, proceed to parking or takeoff). If returning to
     parking, a lineman will not be available. The merits of deplaning a crewmember to park
     the aircraft should be weighed heavily due to the increased exposure to lightning strikes.
 94                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       Takeoffs should only be attempted with total adherence to AFI 11-2C-130V3
       thunderstorm criteria.
       6.21.12.2. (Added-908AW) When parked, the PIC will decide whether the aircrew
       remains with the aircraft or seeks shelter. If the PIC elects to leave the aircraft, the SOF
       should be contacted for pickup. Flightline vehicle operations are permissible, however, a
       concerted effort should be made to proceed as expeditiously and safely as possible.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management.. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. (Added-908AW) ORM. The 357 AS/CC and 908 AES/CC will promote unit level
   ORM programs that foster the operational use of principles, concepts, and techniques that
   assess the risks associated with daily duty and non-duty related activities. The PIC/MCD
   will ensure that 1) the ORM worksheet remains with the finalized flight authorization on file
   at home station, and 2) the ORM worksheet is included with post-mission paperwork upon
   mission termination. The 357 AS/908 AES SARM will maintain mission ORM records.
       6.22.1.1. (Added-908AW) Aircrews flying AMC missions will complete the AMC
       Aviation ORM worksheet prior to takeoff for all flight duty periods. The AMC ORM
       worksheet should be part of your package for the mission. Additional copies are located
       at the SOF counter. The AMC ORM worksheet is a 4 Tier system. Each Tier evaluates
       risk factors for each flight, scores known items in their column and takes all appropriate
       abatement actions. The AMC Aviation ORM worksheet will originate at the planning
       level (Tier 1) and down the supervisory chain to the crew. In some circumstances not all
       Tiers are accomplished. At a minimum Aircrew (Tier 4) must be completed prior to
       departure. Success of the ORM program requires participation by all Tiers applicable to
       the mission.
       6.22.1.2. (Added-908AW) Aircrews flying other than AMC missions will complete the
       908 OG Aircrew Operational Risk Management (ORM) worksheet located at the SOF
       counter. The 908 ORM worksheet is divided up into 3 TIERS.
       6.22.1.3. (Added-908AW) AES medical team will complete an AMC AE ORM
       worksheet for all AE missions prior to alert. The worksheet is a standardized tool for AE
       missions to identify operational risk and to assist the chief nurse (CN) in determining the
       appropriate crew complement based on patient requirements. The form is designed to
       provide an objective, weighted score to assist with crew supplementation decisions. For
       aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs), the MCD may complete the entire worksheet at
       mission brief and will consult the CN or designee for MODERATE or HIGH operational
       risk categories. The AE ORM worksheet is divided up into 5 sections.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. AFTO IMT 781.
   6.23.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         95


   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.24.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will
   comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and refueling job guide. Aircrews will only refuel in cases
   when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
   Crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams at en route stops.
   6.24.2. Aircraft Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
      6.24.2.1. The aircraft dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
          6.24.2.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours provided the aircraft is
          sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
          6.24.2.1.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
      6.24.2.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick turn, a thorough visual
      inspection will be performed.
   6.24.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
      6.24.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
      for fire protection during engine start.
      6.24.3.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC/APU.             A
      crewmember or ground controller may act as fireguard.
   6.24.4. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
   6.24.4.1. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish
   engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for maintenance
   purposes, the following procedures apply:
          6.24.4.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
          preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
          intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
          documentation.
 96                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


           6.24.4.1.2. Use the pilot, flight engineer, and loadmaster checklists. Begin with the
           ―cockpit checklist,‖ and complete all appropriate checklists through the ―before
           leaving the airplane‖ checklist.
           6.24.4.1.3. Only deviate from the flight crew checklist when maintenance requires
           less than four engines to be started.
           6.24.4.1.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
           required.
   6.24.5. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. If
   required to occupy cockpit positions during towing operations conducted by personnel not
   familiar with C-130 towing procedures, the PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance
   officer or superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-
   USAF installations, the PIC must have approval from the airfield operations officer or
   manager prior to towing. The PIC will ensure the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on
   their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as
   to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to
   tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances
   will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor.
6.25. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. The PIC is responsible for
ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified aircraft
maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet
subsequent mission taskings.
   6.25.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       6.25.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       6.25.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
       6.25.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       6.25.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       6.25.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       6.25.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       6.25.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   6.25.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   6.25.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       97


6.26. Life Support Requirements.
   6.26.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) should oxygen be required (minimum 5 liters).
      6.26.1.1. Since the C-130 flight deck can accommodate more crewmembers than there
      are oxygen regulators, all C-130 aircraft will have three emergency escape breathing
      devices (EEBD), or emergency passenger oxygen system (EPOS), or passenger oxygen
      kits (POK) permanently pre-positioned on the aircraft. The EEBDs/EPOS/POKs may be
      stored on the overhead storage rack when not required on the flight deck.
      6.26.1.1. (908AW) Aircrew Flight Equipment will ensure adequate Emergency
      Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) and five additional Emergency Escape Breathing
      Devices (EEBDs) are aboard during all AE missions and prior to all scheduled missions
      with passengers. 908 MXS will provide the aircraft with five portable oxygen bottles for
      all AE missions.
      6.26.1.2. On missions carrying passengers, distribute EPOS (if available) to each
      passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. If the POKs are used, the kits need only
      be positioned on the aircraft and distributed to each passenger for scheduled flights above
      FL250. Mixing EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. EPOS/POKs
      will be distributed and their use demonstrated before departure.
      6.26.1.2. (908AW) Standard EPOS Configuration. Forty EPOS will be permanently
      installed on aircraft sidewalls. One EPOS will be positioned above each available seat
      position with the opening flap facing inboard. No EPOS will be positioned above the
      tool box and only two EPOS will be positioned above the four one man seat
      positions. The mission loadmaster will be responsible for ensuring permanent EPOS are
      in place and positioning required EPOS above the center isle and remaining sidewall
      seats as required.
          6.26.1.2.1. (Added-908AW) The PIC will advise the loadmaster before flying above
          FL 250.
      6.26.1.3. Do not remove the loadmaster‘s emergency equipment (cargo compartment
      quick dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crewmembers.
      6.26.1.4. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
      6.26.1.5. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask with
      communication connected and readily available for use from before engine start until
      engine shutdown.
      6.26.1.6. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have
      a POK, or EEBD within arm‘s reach for flights above 10,000 feet.
      6.26.1.7. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 feet cabin
      altitude (except HALO). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000
      will prebreath 100 percent oxygen in accordance with Chapter 19.
      6.26.1.8. (Added-908AW) Assembly and operation of Portable Therapeutic Liquid
      Oxygen (PTLOX). Do not wear gloves when connecting oxygen lines. Authorized
      gloves will be worn when carrying and tying down the PTLOX.
 98                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       6.26.1.9. (Added-908AW) 908 OG aircrews will arm for OCONUS missions (flight
       engineer and one loadmaster). Aircrew Flight Equipment will issue weapons and
       ammunition. Armed aircrew members will possess and carry an AF Form 522, USAF
       Ground Weapons Training Data and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear
       Firearms.
           6.26.1.9.1. (Added-908AW) Weapons may be secured in the aircraft gun box until
           departing the CONUS.
           6.26.1.9.2. (Added-908AW) Non-stage aircrews may store weapons in the aircraft
           gun box. When storing weapons in the gun box at stations with an AMC/ACC C2
           center, advise C2 which aircrew member possesses the gun box key. The aircrew
           member must be available during crew rest in case the aircraft is staged.
           6.26.1.9.3. (Added-908AW) Stage aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in
           the most secure facility available, normally the base armory. When an adequate
           facility does not exist, the weapons may be secured in the aircraft gun box. Weapons
           will not be taken to quarters.
   6.26.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than
   wing well life rafts will accommodate.
   6.26.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. The loadmaster will
   place an LPU within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on
   overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs
   (if applicable) for overwater flights and will wear them on overwater missions below 2,000
   feet. (EXCEPTION: LPUs need not be worn for takeoffs, landings, or approaches). Ensure
   the appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying
   children and infants.
   6.26.4. Parachutes:
       6.26.4.1. Parachutes will be carried on aircraft IAW AFI 11-301V2.
       6.26.4.2. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
       in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or wear a parachute.
       6.26.4.3. Either wear, or have prefit and prepositioned, parachutes and helmets during
       specified combat conditions or exercise. Loadmasters will wear a restraining harness
       instead of a parachute during airdrops below 800 feet AGL or when performing duties
       near an open exit above 14,000 MSL.
6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.27. (908AW)Fleet Service. The assigned duty section (Flight Engineer/Loadmaster) will
order in-flight meals each Monday morning for all inactive duty enlisted aircrew members
scheduled for flight duties during the respective week. The daily duty driver will pick the meals
up each day at 0800 hours. For all other crewmembers desiring a meal, the order must be placed
prior to 1400 of the day of the mission. If ordering by phone prior to report time, the
crewmember will place the meal order with his/her respective aircrew section. The section will,
in-turn, notify the SOF and pay for the meal. Once the SOF receives payment he/she will place
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          99


the meal order with the in-flight kitchen and alert the duty driver to pick the meal up prior to
report time. The aircrew section is responsible for collecting funds from the individual.
   6.27.1. (Added-908AW) In-flight meals for 908 AES aircrew members will be ordered and
   picked up by the 908 AES. Money for the meals will be left with 908 AES/DO or a
   designated representative.
6.28. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.28.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing TACC-directed
   mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the aircrew will
   collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first station, which has
   such a function. The report will be submitted on AF IMT 4075, Aircraft Load Data
   Worksheet.
6.29. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
   6.29.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description
   of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. PICs are responsible for
   ensuring that all procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are complied with when airlifting
   hazardous cargo on AMC missions.
       6.29.1.1. Procedures in paragraph 6.29.2 apply when any quantity of the following
       materials are transported:
           6.29.1.1.1. DoD class or division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (explosives).
           6.29.1.1.2. Class or division 2.3 (poison gas).

       6.29.1.2. Procedures also apply to nuclear related cargo, toxic chemical ammunition,
       highly toxic substances, hazard division 1.1 through 1.3 explosives, and infectious
       substances (including biological and etiological materials). In addition, it applies to Class
       7 (Radioactive materials), withich require a yellow III Label, and all ogher hazard classes
       or divisions, (except class 9 and other regulated material (ORM-D) when shipped in
       quantities of 1,000 pounds (455 Kgs) or more aggregate weight. NOTE: Quantities not
       covered in paragraph 6.29.1.1 and paragraph 6.29.1.2 are expemt from these
       procedures.
       6.29.1.3. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204,
       Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.
   6.29.2. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
       6.29.2.1. Enter ―Hazardous Cargo‖ and the mission identifier or flight number in the
       appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD 175, Military Flight
 100                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       Plan and Other Information section of DD 1801, International Flight Plan, DOD. Refer
       to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when transporting
       hazardous materials cargo.
       6.29.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
       otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
       6.29.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
       remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material,
       DOD class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
       required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
       etc.).
       6.29.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
       preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
       hazardous cargo information. listed in paragraph 6.29.1.3. If available, C2 will relay
       required information to next destination.
6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable Parts (MICAP),
Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier
Material.
   6.30.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD 2130-2, C-130A/B/E/H Cargo Manifest or similar automated product (such
   as CALM or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
   classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD1907,
   Signature Tally Record, must be used.
       6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
          6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
   6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
       6.30.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
          6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier.
          6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         101


          6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
          6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
          6.30.2.1.5. US military guards.
          6.30.2.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
   6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier
   Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD 1907, for unit moves. The PIC will be briefed on the urgency
   of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -
20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.31.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good a time over target (TOT) or
   time of arrival (TOA). PICs shall notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled
   takeoff time.
   6.31.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated. When on a flight managed sortie, contact
   the flight manager with the early go request at the earliest opportunity.
6.32. NVG Departures.
   6.32.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG departures for
   crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG
   aircrews may fly NVG departures in weather down to 300/1. Crews must give careful
   consideration to potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other weather
   limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
   which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather
   conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and
   weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
   6.32.2. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences
   NVG failure takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC. If NVG malfunctions
   occur after the PM states GO, consideration should be given to either continuing the takeoff
   as the PF transitions to an IMC takeoff or transferring control of the aircraft as the situation
   dictates. If either pilot‘s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climb out and follow the
   appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs. The PM will be ready to immediately assume
   aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Pilots
 102                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   must exercise sound and conservative judgment to continue NVG operations with aircraft
   malfunctions.

Section 6E—En Route

6.33. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor SCNS/GPS/INS
performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Use the
following procedures for flight progress:
   6.33.1. Before an oceanic flight, plot the oceanic portion on an appropriate chart. Annotate
   the chart with the mission number and date. If practical, chart may be reused. Refer to
   Chapter 11 for chart requirements.
   6.33.2. Another pilot or navigator will verify waypoint data inserted into the SCNS/INS.
   Check both the coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight
   plan.
   6.33.3. Category I Routes.
       6.33.3.1. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I route, the PM will recheck
       coordinates for the next two waypoints.
       6.33.3.2. Navigators will use the procedures in Chapter 11 for flight following.
   6.33.4. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
   computer flight plans to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the charts, computer flight
   plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 3 months.
   6.33.5. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for
   further guidance). US military aircraft and DOD personnel entering another nation to
   conduct US government business must have the approval of the foreign government
   concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are
   obtained through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
       6.33.5.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
       airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states‘ territorial
       seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
       state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,
       inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted
       in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
       6.33.5.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs.
       Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
       operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
       provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
       by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
       beyond 12 NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
       limits, which differ from the standard.
       6.33.5.3. Flight Information Region. An FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
       information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         103


      borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
      approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
      6.33.5.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
      into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
      amend entry point(s).
      6.33.5.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
      departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
      clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
      6.33.5.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
      penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
      country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
      6.33.5.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
      to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal
      response will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to
      planned destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is ―in
      international airspace.‖   Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
      continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes
      their mission over sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic
      channels before mission departure, as being valid authorization.
      6.33.5.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
      will normally be briefed at home station, on-load station, and/or by the last C2 facility
      transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
      6.33.5.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked
      to and should not fly ―due regard‖ routings unless coordinated with the appropriate
      MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The ―due regard‖ or
      ―operational‖ option obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate
      their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, ACs may
      exercise the ―due regard‖ option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air
      traffic services as soon as practical. Additional information on ―due regard‖ is contained
      in FLIP General Planning, Chapter 7.
6.34. Navigational Aid Capability.
   6.34.1. MNPS standards are established in FLIP. NOTE: Airspace and associated
   navigational aid equipment capability are rapidly evolving. Pilots must maintain an in depth
   knowledge of current FLIP requirements/policies.
      6.34.1.1. Aircraft that lose required equipment prior to oceanic airspace will return to the
      nearest maintenance repair facility.
   6.34.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
   is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific
   aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2
   and the following for RVSM requirements:
 104                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       6.34.2.1. Both pilots‘ altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       6.34.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       6.34.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.            Record
       readings of both altimeters.
       6.34.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
       6.34.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       6.34.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
       6.34.2.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment.
   6.34.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the
   world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes.
   Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
   RNP-10 airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
   malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. C-130 aircraft is approved for RNP
   operations only with a qualified navigator at the navigator‘s station, but limited to operational
   time restrictions based on the navigation equipment.
       6.34.3.1. RNP-10. C-130 aircraft may operate up to 6.2-hours (after entering the nav
       mode in SCNS) of flight in RNP-10 airspace without an update. If an automatic update is
       made, the aircraft may continue for an additional 5.7 hours in RNP-10 airspace after the
       update is complete. If a manual update (Radar update, etc.) is made, the aircraft may
       continue for an additional 5.2-hours in RNP-10 airspace after the update is complete.
   6.34.4. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is
   considered special qualification airspace. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5.
   Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
   BRNAV airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
   malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. C-130 aircraft are approved for
   BRNAV operations only with a qualified navigator at the navigator‘s station.
6.35. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as
indicated in FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       105


   6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFI 10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.36. In-flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF
   radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact
   before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling
   HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base.
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform the passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
   action checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other
   pertinent information. When on a flight managed sortie, contact the FM listed in the
   departure papers via phone patch or any available means for emergency divert assistance
   such as routing, weather, NOTAM and ATS clearance.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL when additional expertise is
   necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
       are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
       connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
          6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
          6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
          6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
          6.38.2.3.4. Position.
          6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
          6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
          6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of all primary crewmembers.
          6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
 106                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and the major
complaint in the request.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are TACC weather operations (for TACC flight-managed sorties),
OWSs, and USAF weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF
aeronautical station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact
USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan
AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots and navigators will review
appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary
crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach
monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions, if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational mission
   requires a tactical approach.
       6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights at familiar fields, pilots may fly non-precision
       approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The
       PM will monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
       6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The C-130 is a category ―C‖ aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   140 knots, the minimums for category ―D‖ will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
       6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
           6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
           meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
       6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
           6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
           required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
           rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         107


         add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
         which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
         feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
         minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
         visibility.
     6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½
     SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
     approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not
     to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
     6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DOD or NACO
     precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
     requirements before initiating en-route descent, penetration, or approach.
  6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
     6.42.4.1. If full flight instrumentation is not available and operational, aircraft are limited
     to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300 feet and RVR 40, or ¾ mile visibility (1220
     meters) with no RVR.
         6.42.4.1.1. Category I ILS. Full flight instrumentation consists of: dual flight
         displays (one flight director plus ADI repeat), complete differential pressure
         instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot
         positions.
         6.42.4.1.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR) consists
         of: complete differential pressure instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude
         indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures.
     6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
     certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
     procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
 108                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   6.42.6. Not Used.
   6.42.7. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
   conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS and the ASRR. Back up
   each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the
   FMS or SCNS.
   6.42.8. Not Used.
   6.42.9. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When cleared for or established on a
   segment of the approach and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach
   minimums, the PF has the option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point
   (MAP)/DH. If the approach is abandoned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required
   for the missed approach procedure). Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
   amended clearance is received.
       6.42.9.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
       is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.9.2. If the approach is continued, the PIC must have sufficient fuel available to
       complete the approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with
       normal fuel reserve.
       6.42.9.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.10. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.10.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.10.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and crewmembers who are non-current and/or
   unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews may fly IFR approaches which
   transition to NVG landings with weather 300/1 or approach minimums (whichever is higher).
   Crews must give careful consideration to the potential hazards during these critical phases of
   flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NOTE:
   NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions.
   Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn
   and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
   6.43.2. NVG Malfunction during Approach and Landing. If one of the pilots experience
   NVG failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC whether or not to transition
   to normal lights or perform a go-around. If the PF‘s NVGs fail after touchdown, transfer
   control to the PM for the landing rollout. Use normal lights for illumination until both pilots
   are ready to resume NVG operations. The PM will be ready to immediately assume aircraft
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        109


   control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Pilots must
   exercise sound and conservative judgment to continue NVG operations with aircraft
   malfunctions.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DOD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting
   liaison/OPLOC citing TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from
   the local financial analysis and/or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF
   IMT 616, Fund Cite Authorization is already established at these locations to charge the
   routine lodging costs for transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF funded travel
   orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DOD facilities are available and AMC TWCF
   funds are not available, the PIC will utilize AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice
   authority to acquire the appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station,
   the PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members‘ group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF IMT 15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of
   the unit whose aircraft was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DOD facilities and TWCF funds are
   unavailable, the PIC will utilize AF IMT 15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals,
   quarters, and transportation to support the service members. Upon return to home station, the
   PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members‘ group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF IMT 15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of
   the unit whose aircraft was delayed. NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers
   on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a per diem or space available status, except for
   those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders delayed at locations where TWCF
   funds are available.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO IMT 781 after each flight.               After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On AMC missions, notify TACC Logistics Control (TACC/XOCL).
6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, ―Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray‖ (state lowest
altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except for takeoffs
and landings.

6.46. Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains
       ultimate responsibility. When a C-130 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air
       traffic function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
       6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when
       not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers.
       The loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
       prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC‘s signature.
       6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
       ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
       6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
       which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
       in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
       cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
       offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
       proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
       completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
       intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
       manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
       center.
       6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
       normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
       passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
       and property (loadmaster excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         111


     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
     Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
     exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
112                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
      and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US on-load or off-load
      base, or at the foreign on-load or off-load base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.

                 observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                 representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander‘s
                 certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
                 not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
                 representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
                 officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
             6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                 6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for

                 media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD 1854, Customs
                 Accompanied Baggage, US, or Customs Form 6059B.
                 6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                 representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
                 debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
                 discretionary examination of the baggage.
      6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
         6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the PIC will ensure
         all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
         6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
      6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
         6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        113

       6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
          6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
          6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
              6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
              milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
              and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
              personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
              foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
              equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
              accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign and Domestic Quarantine Regulations for
   Vessels, Aircraft, and Other Transports of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense
   FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or
   on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with
   passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
 114                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


           6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
           loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
           wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
           6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
           use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
           minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not on-load or off-load cargo or passengers until the
   inspection is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or
   local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify TACC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of
   routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.

AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        115


   Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-water missions
   carrying children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF IMT 4076 and AFTO IMT 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF IMT 4076 and AFTO IMT 46
       on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A37TL (or MAJCOM life support office) and
       appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF IMT 4076 or AFTO IMT 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions.
   6.51.1. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be
   downloaded prior to departure. See exception at paragraph 13.4.2.6.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, and previously unknown obstacles, airfield
   markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A36AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency
for further instructions.
6.54. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.54.1. The maximum number of persons on the flight deck will be the minimum
   commensurate with the mission requirements. At no time should this exceed seven (unless
   otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement).
   6.54.2. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed behind the condition levers or on the
   throttle quadrant during critical phases of flight.

   6.54.3. Place only soft items on the top bunk.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP)
section 5-37 for more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.56. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (ANG/DOD for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for
AFRC-directed missions).
6.57. Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
   6.57.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.
   6.57.2. The loadmaster or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check
   all chaff/flare dispensers for hung ordnance or damage. NOTE: ALE-47 flare squibs that fail
   to fire are not considered hung ordnance.
   6.57.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
   cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
   personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
   personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
   6.57.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
6.58. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.58.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock
   and seal the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards
   employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
   classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.58.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC
   will only be transferred to authorized DOD personnel.
   6.58.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         117


   6.58.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor
   cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode IV, except when the aircraft will transit an area
   where safe passage procedures are implemented.
   6.58.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode IV on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode IV interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.58.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV will continue to their intended destinations.
   Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
   maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
   aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace
   control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.58.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode IV, when conducted, are a mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode IV on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
   6.58.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode IV on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
   6.58.9. (Added-908AW) COMSEC Procedures. The Standard Form (SF) 153, COMSEC
   Material Report, is the form used for home station receipt of all COMSEC materials.
       6.58.9.1. (Added-908AW) COMSEC Check-out (Home Station). When mission
       requirements dictate, the designated pilot not in command (PNIC) will report to the
       COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) to receive all mission required COMSEC. Once
       these materials have been signed for, the responsibility for these materials belongs ONLY
       to the individual whose name appears on the SF 153.
       6.58.9.2. (Added-908AW) COMSEC Turn-in (Home Station). The PNIC will use the
       Standard Form 153 to annotate any transfer or destruction of issued classified materials.
       Upon return to home station, the PNIC will turn in all COMSEC materials and/or destruct
       receipts and receive a receipt of release. During duty hours, COMSEC will be returned
       to a designated CRO. During non-duty hours or in the absence of a CRO, COMSEC
       material can be secured by the 908 AW or 42 ABW Command Posts. DO NOT leave
       COMSEC unsecured at any time.
6.59. (Added-908AW) Transfer of Aircraft. For aircraft that will be delivered to a contractor
for modification or programmed depot maintenance (PDM), the items listed in Table 6.3 will be
on board the aircraft being delivered or picked up. Equipment required for overwater flight must
be considered if mission requirements dictate. All items will be installed or positioned in the
standard locations. Unless previously coordinated and approved, the aircrew will plan the flight
directly to the facility with no en route stops or delays. En route delays or navigation legs should
be coordinated prior to scheduled input or pickup date.
   6.59.1. (Added-908AW) Aircraft Commander Responsibilities:
   6.59.2. (Added-908AW) 908 MOF/MOFP will ensure that the aircraft commander has
   reviewed the 908 AW Letter of Instruction (LOI), Transfer Procedures and received the
 118                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   aircraft forms. If picking up the aircraft from off station, review the AFTO Form 290,
   Aerospace Vehicle Delivery Receipt, and the maintenance records. Sign for the aircraft and
   return the aircraft and aircraft forms to unit maintenance personnel.
   6.59.3. (Added-908AW) Ensure the equipment listed in Table 6.3 is on the aircraft prior to
   departure for delivery or is carried to the transfer facility for aircraft pickup. The loadmaster
   and flight engineer will act as the PIC‘s agent and inventory the required equipment.
   Additional aircrew flight equipment requirements are contained in AFI 11-301V2,
   Maintenance And Configuration Requirements For Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Aircrew And
   Aircraft-Installed Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE).
   6.59.4. (Added-908AW) Ensure appropriate navigation publications are available to meet
   mission requirements.

                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-130 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific
MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the
public.
7.2. Security. The C-130 is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, requirements for C-130 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via
   a two-person External Security Response Team, (ESRT) with response capability within 5
   minutes.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Provide ESRT 5-minute response and the ISRT from existing areas can resopond to
   this area it able to maintain 3-minute response withing their primary area. Portable security
   lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not
   available.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crew members. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a ―Remain over night‖ (RON)
   on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.6).
   7.3.7. (Added-908AW) Aircraft will be locked at all times when not attended by members
   of the flight crew, cargo loading crew or maintenance personnel when not in a secured area.
   If required at certain US military bases, the PIC may give the aircraft combination to Base
   Operations, Command Post or Transient Alert personnel after the aircraft is secured.
   7.3.8. (Added-908AW) PICs are responsible for determining if the aircraft is adequately
   secured. If security is determined to be inadequate, the organization with operational control
 120                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   of the aircraft will be contacted for instructions. If the issue can‘t be resolved, the PIC will
   take the actions necessary to secure the aircraft.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door with a box car seal, or other controllable device,
which will prevent entry without damaging the door or lock. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency
the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate
the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a
sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or
designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the
aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
sealed, and flown by another aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for
documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of at least two US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team‘s travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEGP status and is responsible to
   the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for its welfare (transportation, lodging,
   etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger
   briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DOD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199,
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         121


   Air Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
      7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
      duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
      7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC judgment, the aircraft needs to be
   locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
      Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
      thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include: inside main landing gear pods, and
   crew/troop O2 service panels, for personnel or other unfamiliar devices.. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DOD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DOD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DOD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
 122                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.9. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-130 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as a ―RAVEN in-flight arming required.‖
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         123


       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.               Ensure
       troop/aircraft commander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DOD 5210.41M, paragraph 9B(3), for additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
 124                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up
with situation reports as circumstances permit.
   7.11.1. If possible, transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Controllers
   will assign IFF code 7500 (does not preclude subsequent selection of code 7700).
   7.11.2. If in-the-clear transmissions are not possible, report ―am being hijacked‖ by setting
   transponder to code 7500. If unable to change transponder code, or when not under radar
   control, transmit a radio message to include the phrase ―(call sign) transponder seven five
   zero zero.‖
   7.11.3. Controllers will acknowledge receipt and understanding of transponder code 7500 by
   transmitting ―(call sign) (facility name) verify squawking 7500.‖ An affirmative reply or
   lack of reply from the pilot indicates confirmation and proper authorities are notified.
   7.11.4. To report ―situation appears desperate; want armed intervention,‖ after code 7500 is
   used, change to code 7700. If unable to change transponder code to 7700, or when not under
   radar control, transmit ―(aircraft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero.‖
       7.11.4.1. When changing from code 7500 to code 7700, remain on 7500 for at least 3
       minutes or until a confirmation of code 7500 is received from ATC, whichever is sooner,
       before changing to code 7700. ATC acknowledges code 7700 by transmitting ―(call sign)
       (facility name) now reading you on transponder seven seven zero zero.‖
       7.11.4.2. Aircraft squawking 7700 after squawking 7500, which are not in radio contact
       with ATC, are considered by ATC to have an in-flight emergency (in addition to
       hijacking), and the appropriate emergency procedures are followed. Notification of
       authorities in this case includes information that the aircraft displayed the hijack code as
       well as the emergency code.
   7.11.5. To report ―situation still desperate, want armed intervention and aircraft
   immobilized,‖ leave flaps full down after landing, or select landing flaps while on the
   ground. To facilitate message distribution, transmit ―(aircraft call sign) flaps are full down.‖
   7.11.6. To report ―leave alone, do not intervene,‖ retract the flaps after landing. Pilots who
   retract flaps after squawking 7700 should return to code 7500 and remain on code 7500 for
   the next leg of the hijacked flight unless the situation changes. Transmit ―(aircraft call sign)
   back on seven five zero zero‖ to emphasize the fact intervention is no longer desired.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one flight
engineer and one loadmaster will be armed. All crew members should know who is armed. The
following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming And Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     125


   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and
   from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms,
       authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they
       will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew
       will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their
       pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crew members will be armed before beginning
   preflight, on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no
   passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory
   stowaway check. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded
   before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the
       most secure facility available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member’s
Personal Protection Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Air Force
Antiterrorism Standards, for force protection measures.

  8.5.6. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury
  to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2
  agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what,
  when, where, why and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
      8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
      Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
      of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter EMI will report
      the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system
             function, name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system
             description. The operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile,
             pulse doppler, search, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets,
             reduced intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
             8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if
             known, otherwise state as unknown.)
             8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
             8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their
             location or distance and bearing from your location.
             8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the
             EMI, with any actions taken to resolve the problem.
             8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level
             of security clearance expert requires).
             8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
             8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
             and Duty hours).
         8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
         intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC‘s
         judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
         8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
         adversaries‘ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       131


           accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
           interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
           would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
           in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
       8.5.6.2. (Added-908AW) There are three types of OPREP-3 reports: ―Pinnacle‖
       (National Command Authority Interest), ―Beeline‖ (Air Force Chief of Staff Interest),
       and ―Homeline‖ (MAJCOM Interest). The seriousness of the event determines the type
       and distribution of the report.
       8.5.6.3. (Added-908AW) If an unusual incident occurs, notify the controlling agency as
       soon as you are aware of the incident. The duty controller will decide whether an
       OPREP-3 is necessary. At home station (local area), contact 908 AW/CP.
       8.5.6.4. (Added-908AW) Report all near mid-air collisions on an AF Form 651,
       Hazardous Air Traffic Report.
       8.5.6.5. (Added-908AW) Report all collisions with any creature (bird, mammal, reptile,
       etc.) on an AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum
Products and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station. Use the Multi Service Corporation
(MSC) air card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial
airports (and some military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all
U.S. government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government
aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no
changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting
merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44,
Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of AIR card could
   create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/de-fuel USAF aircraft at DOD locations when ever possible. If DOD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:          DOD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.3. Open market AIR card purchase to include Shell International Trading Company
       (SITCO) agreement.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. DD 1898, Fuels Sales Slip, is the fuels transaction receipt used for purchases at
       other DOD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the
       DD1898 inside the AF IMT 644. The PIC or designated representative shall complete
132                                       AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a unique invoice along with the DD 1898,
      annotate the vendor‘s invoice with ―DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.‖
      8.6.3.2. AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
      AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off station transactions on the front of the form
      and insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF IMT 664, with
      supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC
      or designate representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
      8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
      ground services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.
         8.6.3.3.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
             8.6.3.3.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an
             FBO refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and
             attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the
             SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a
             separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the FBO
             must invoice DESC for the fuel and the customer for non-fuel product and

9.17. Aborted Maximum Effort Takeoff. Direct IP supervision required. Authorized for AC
upgrades and above during formal upgrade training. Restricted to the main runway during
daylight. Crosswind component must be within the recommend zone of the takeoff crosswind
chart. Runway must be dry, hard surfaced, 147 feet wide and long enough to allow refusal and
takeoff speeds to be equal. Simulate a runway length less than CFL. Initiate the abort by stating
―REJECT‖ at or below a refusal speed based on simulated runway length. Compare the distance
traveled to runway length and point out the ramifications of operating with less than critical field
length. Cool brakes between aborted takeoffs. Do not shut down an engine due to simulated
malfunctions. Do not practice aborted max effort takeoffs from stop-and-go landings. Requires
OG/CC approval.
9.18. Maximum Effort Takeoff. ACs may accomplish maximum effort takeoffs. Maximum
effort takeoffs should be performed from the main runway when it is available (i.e., safe and
practical to taxi from an assault landing zone). Takeoffs from the assault zone are authorized
during formal mission qualification training or when approved by the OG/CC for currency or
proficiency.
   9.18.1. (Added-908AW) Maximum effort takeoff for training. Aircrews will use a
   minimum of 18,000 inch-pounds of torque to simulate maximum power, takeoff at Vmca,
   and clear simulated obstacles at Vmca+10 knots.
9.19. Training Aircraft Not Capable of Flight (Not applicable to AFRC and ANG). If an
aircraft is not capable of departure within four hours after scheduled departure time, cancel the
training mission. The unit CC/DO may grant exceptions. Provide a planned minimum of 1 ½-
hours for aircraft preflight duties before the end of the 4-hours.

       AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
         NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-
Yield Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security
threats to the global operations of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRNE threat,
passive defense measures to mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in
a contaminated environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRNE Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   radiation and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear
   detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
   10.2.5. High-Yield Explosives. High-yield explosives are conventional weapons or devices
   that are capable of a high order of destruction or disruption. Passive defense measures
   include hardening of facilities and establishing stand-off distances for personnel and key
   assets.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      147


10.3. CBRNE Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRNE attack. Passive defense
measures include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRNE threat
through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRNE
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD.
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
      landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
      engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
      doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
      protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and teh attack
      is a missile attack, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the
      attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
   10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
   protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRNE
   environment. Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective
   protection, and hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
      shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
      (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
      canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
      gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
      They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
      The ACDE requires care during donning using ―buddy dressing‖ procedures and Aircrew
      Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
      Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask.

         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRNE threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
      to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. Crewmembers should avail
      themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection, seal
      windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems and use rooms above the first floor
      whenever possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful in-flight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
         contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         149


      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A35.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of
   CBRNE weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRNE hazards and countermeasures, in-flight
   diversion, plans for on-load/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination‘s alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate ―clean‖ locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue dosimetry for potential radiological
   hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the ―buddy dressing‖ procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AMCVA 11-304, and the C-130 T.O., to ensure proper wear. When
   wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper
   left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2
   PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This
   standardized location will enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual be
   overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid
   chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior
   to entering the CBRNE threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared.
 150                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   When inbound to a CBRNE threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure
   crew and passengers don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination‘s MOPP
   level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRNE threat area. As a minimum, this briefing
   will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system
   requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels. Aircrew members
   must determine if the wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict
   dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the
   equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead
   of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support.          Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. On-load and Off-load Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW T.O. requirements. Aircrew members entering the aircraft
   will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure
   flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. On-load cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user‘s responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     151


  shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
  of the senior transportation commander.
  10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
  ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
  passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
  contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
  aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. NOTE: An altitude below
  10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
  10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
  resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
  consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
  determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
  adverse physiological effects.
  10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
  thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
  performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
  full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A
  more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602.
  10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
  actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
  and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
  inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
  detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
  hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
  hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
  fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
  every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
  area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
  remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
  passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
  stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
  (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
  cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
  10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
  aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
  biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
  in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment. Before clearance of a Red X for
  contamination, Bioenvironmental Enigneer or higher DOD authority will be consulted.
  10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
  protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
  locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
  safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
  whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
  associated with the 10-foot rule.
 152                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


        10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
        whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
        seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
        chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
        10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves (i.e.
        leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated equipment.
        Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be
        present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent
        residue is avoided.
        10.5.10.3. Table 10-2 shows ―estimated‖ times associated with initial and follow-on
        phases of the 10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to
        use the worst case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for
        the initial phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                         Chapter 11

                         NAVIGATION PROCEDURES AND FORMS

11.1. General.
   11.1.1. This chapter contains C-130 navigation procedures and forms.           Publish local
   procedures, in the unit supplement to this AFI.
   11.1.2. General instructions for completion of AF IMT 4116, C-130 Flight Plan and
   Record, are provided in this chapter. MAJCOM-approved computer flight plans may be
   used as a substitute for AF IMT 4116.
       11.1.2.1. The AF IMT 4116 was developed to provide a tool for all possible missions of
       the C-130. Most missions will not require all sections of the IMT. In the interest of
       conservation navigators are encouraged to print and use only those sections of the AF
       IMT 4116 required for their respective mission.
11.2. Mission Planning Procedures.
   11.2.1. The PIC and navigator will jointly verify routing, altitude, and fuel load prior to
   departure. On flight managed sorties, the PIC and the navigator will review the flight plan
   provided by the FM. Any disagreements/discrepancies/requests for change will be
   coordinated with and through the FM. Use the chart updating manual or host nation chart
   updating product to update charts within 10-NM of the approach, departure, emergency and
   divert bases for airfields without a DOD or Jeppesen approved approach plate. FalconView
   generated charts with updated ECHUM overlays fulfill this requirement. A copy of the
   navigator‘s flight plan will be provided to the copilot to verify routing and aid in position
   reporting. Navigator crew changes (engine running offload or augmented crews) will
   include, as a minimum, a briefing on equipment status.
   11.2.2. When practical, plan the most direct routing possible or utilize wind optimized CFP
   routing to enhance fuel conservation.
   11.2.3. A MAJCOM-approved CFP, AF IMT 70, or AF IMT 4116 is required for all flights
   except local area training flights with an established standard procedure.
   11.2.4. A fuel plan is required for all flights except local area training flights with
   established standard ramp fuel loads.
   11.2.5. The navigator will sign in the indicated block on page 2 of the AF IMT 4116 to
   certify accuracy of all entries. Any entries not required for a particular mission on the AF
   IMT 4116 may be left blank.
11.3. Flight Planning.
   11.3.1. Most entries on the AF IMT 4116 are self-explanatory or explained below.
       11.3.1.1. HIGHEST ACC FL - Highest Acceptable Flight Level.             This altitude is
       obtained from the appropriate aircraft performance manual.
       11.3.1.2. WPT - Waypoint. Use this column to indicate the number of each waypoint as
       entered in the aircraft computer.
 154                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       11.3.1.3. A/B - Ahead or Behind. Compare ETA based on the original flight plan to
       actual time of arrival (ATA) at each waypoint. Record the difference in this column. If
       the flight plan changes in-flight, non-applicable ATA spaces may be left blank.
   11.3.2. When an alternate destination is required, use a flight planning line to indicate, as a
   minimum, the name of the alternate and the time, course, and distance to the alternate.
   11.3.3. Aircrews may use ACFP, PFPS or any other MAJCOM approved flight planning
   program. On a flight managed sortie, the FM uses AMC certified ACFP to create the CFP.
11.4. Equal Time Point Computations.
   11.4.1. Use the worksheet on the AF IMT 4116, page 2, to calculate the time to ETP.
   11.4.2. Recompute ETP in-flight when the actual time of arrival at a reporting point is 15
   minutes or more ahead or behind the planned time if the change was caused by erroneous
   wind information.
   11.4.3. ETP Computations (see Figure 11.1). Computations are required on Category I
   routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield
   (LSAF) and the first suitable airfield (FSAF) is 5-hours or more.
11.5. Flight Charts.
   11.5.1. Show the following items on the chart:
       11.5.1.1. Navigator‘s name and coordinated universal date. Chart number and edition
       will be annotated on a stripped chart.
       11.5.1.2. Flight plan course line and waypoints (if not pre-labeled) will be annotated with
       waypoint number, identifier, radial and DME, or latitude and longitude.
       11.5.1.3. Annotate suitable emergency airfields.      Optimum emergency airfields are
       located within 50 NM of the intended route.           Refer to the GDSS/GDSS2(when
       available)/ASRR for suitability.
       11.5.1.4. Portions of Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ)/FIR boundaries (if not
       depicted accurately) pertinent to the route will be annotated.
       11.5.1.5. Annotate the approximate location of the ETP.
   11.5.2. Plot each fix or position along with the time at that position. Use standard symbols
   from AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation.
   11.5.3. In the interest of conservation, flight charts for high level missions may be reused
   whenever such reuse would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.
   11.5.4. FalconView produced Lambet-Conformal charts may be used.
11.6. In-flight Procedures.
   11.6.1. The navigator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed to do
   otherwise. The navigator will record ATC clearances and monitor the read back. This will
   normally include all ATC instructions involving departure, en-route, and approach
   procedures. This procedure is not applicable when ATC instructions require immediate
   execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes with the timely performance of other
   time-sensitive navigator duties.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       155


   11.6.2. On approach or departure, the navigator will monitor the aircraft position using an
   appropriately scaled chart (ONC, TPC, JOG, etc.). In IMC or at night the navigator will use
   all available navigational aids (including aircraft radar) to keep the aircraft clear of all
   obstructions.
   11.6.3. The navigator will flight follow on all missions using a suitable plotting chart (JNC,
   JNCA, or GNC).
   11.6.4. Compute a TAS check on all Category I routes of 3 hours or longer. Use the
   procedures in paragraph 11.11.
   11.6.5. Maintain a flight log on Category I routes or route segments of 3 hours or longer.
   Time between fix/MPP plots will not exceed 1 hour. NOTE: Malfunctions or loss of
   navigational capability, which degrade course centerline accuracy, will be reported
   immediately to ATC.
   11.6.6. On Category I routes, when the time between the LSAF and FSAF is 5-hours or
   more, the following procedures are required: wind factors, equal time point (ETP)
   calculations, and in-flight fuel management.
   11.6.7. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II routes, tactical routes, or
   on aircraft without compasses. On Category I routes or route segments of 3-hours or longer,
   compute heading deviation for each compass system as soon as practical after initial level-off
   or coast out. Record deviation for all compass systems (see paragraph 11.10).
11.7. Laptop Computers. Laptop computers running Falcon View moving map software and
connected to a handheld GPS provide invaluable situational awareness. Laptop computers and
handheld GPS must be approved for unrestricted use in flight IAW AFI 11-202 V3.
   11.7.1. Navigators should carry a USAF approved laptop on all missions.
       11.7.1.1. Handheld GPS units should be connected and the Falcon View Moving Map
       Display should be operating.
   11.7.2. Laptop computers with handheld GPS Falcon View moving map displays will not be
   used as the primary source of navigation.
11.8. Flight Records. Flight progress will be recorded for Category I routes of 3-hours or
longer. Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission. Units may publish local standards for
log procedures in the unit supplement. See Figure 11.2 for an example of a completed AF IMT
4116.
   11.8.1. This form will consist of planning and in-flight progress data. It will be completed in
   sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. Page 1 of the form should be
   completed when a CFP is not available on Category I routes. Page 4, the in-flight section,
   will be used to record present positions and spot readings. The procedures below are general
   in nature and designed to accommodate a wide range of C-130 navigation equipment
   configurations.
       11.8.1.1. As soon as practical after level-off or coast-out, whichever occurs latest,
       navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          11.8.1.1.1. Record the fix in AF IMT 4116 Section VII.

          11.8.1.1.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution and
          corresponding deltas for all other navigation solutions in AF IMT 4116 Section V.
          11.8.1.1.3. At the time of the fix record, as a minimum, GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot wind, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF IMT 4116
          Section VIII.
       11.8.1.2. After coast out, record current position every 30 minutes on AF IMT 4116,
       Page 3 in Section V, Fix/Computer Position.
          11.8.1.2.1. Record the present position for the primary navigation solution.
       11.8.1.3. Plot the current position every hour or within 10 minutes of crossing an oceanic
       reporting point, whichever occurs first.
          11.8.1.3.1. Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true
          heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude, ETA to the next point, and corresponding
          deltas for all other navigation solutions.
       11.8.1.4. Between recorded positions, record spot readings at regular intervals to allow
       for calculating a DR in the event of a navigation system failure.
          11.8.1.4.1. Spot readings will include, as a minimum, time, heading, drift angle,
          ground speed, wind vector, and true airspeed.
       11.8.1.5. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position by
       either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          11.8.1.5.1. Record the fix in AF IMT 4116 Section VII.
          11.8.1.5.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution and
          corresponding deltas for all other navigation solutions in AF IMT 4116 Section V.
          11.8.1.5.3. At the time of the fix record, as a minimum, GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot wind, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF IMT 4116
          Section VIII.
   11.8.2. In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures will be
   implemented. Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a DR up to the present
   position. Plot a fix/MPP at a minimum of once per hour. A DR associated with the fix/MPP
   will be plotted on the chart prior to plotting the position. If the navigation system failure is
   resolved, the navigator may resume log procedures as outlined in paragraph 11.8.1.
       11.8.2.1. At the time of the fix/MPP record the GMT, current position, true heading, spot
       w/v, true air speed, altitude and ETA to the next point.
       11.8.2.2. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position by
       either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
11.9. Celestial Procedures.
   11.9.1. See AFPAM 11-216 for a comprehensive discussion of celestial concepts.
11.10. Deviation Check Procedures.
   11.10.1. Heading checks should be computed in Section IV of AF IMT 4116, page 3. Mid-
   time celestial heading checks may be recorded in the Section IX. When a heading check is
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                    157


   performed based on INS/SCNS, note that in the pre-comp area of the deviation checks
   section. The AF IMT 4116 deviation checks format solves for ―deviation‖ (DEV) for all
   heading reference systems. Some navigation computers such as the SCNS allow the
   navigator to input compass ―deviation.‖ In this case reverse the sign of the ―deviation‖ to
   arrive at ―deviation correction.‖ NOTE: Compass deviation is not necessarily constant over
   time or after significant course changes. Navigators should reconfirm deviation on CAT I
   legs every 3 hours or after planned course changes of greater than 30 degrees.
EXCEPTION: A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of less
than three hours if:
(1) The aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the standby compass is
not considered a system for this requirement).
(2) The difference between systems does not exceed 2-degrees.
   11.10.2. Dual INS Heading Checks. Deviation check not required.
   11.10.3. Single INS/SCNS Heading Checks.         Record and compare the INS/SCNS true
   heading with all compass systems.
   11.10.4. In order to obtain an accurate celestial heading check, the exact ZN must be
   derived. Exact ZN is obtained by interpolating using exact longitude, latitude, declination,
   and LHA. ZN may also be derived from SCNS immediate page and the subpoint of the
   celestial body used for the heading check.
11.11. True Airspeed (TAS) Check Procedures.
   11.11.1. Accomplish within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Record time of the check and
   altitude on the pressure altimeter. If using free air temperature gauge, record indicated
   outside air temperature (IOAT). Use the heat of compression table on AF IMT 4116 to
   convert IOAT to true outside air temperature (TOAT). If using SCNS temperature, record
   TOAT.
       11.11.1.1. TAS check not required for C-130H3 aircraft.
   11.11.2. Normally, navigators on all C-130 models can use 0 knots for indicated airspeed
   (IAS) to calibrated airspeed (CAS) correction and minus 3 knots for CAS to equivalent
   airspeed (EAS ) correction for TAS above 270 (or minus 2 knots if less than or equal to
   270).
   11.11.3. ITAS - Indicated TAS. Record the TAS reading from the TAS meter and the
   SCNS/INS or other computer (if the aircraft is so equipped). Record the difference between
   computed TAS and this reading in the CORR block.
11.12. In-flight Fuel Management Procedures.
   11.12.1. Record the fuel readings listed below at level off time and regular time intervals
   (coinciding with entries on aircraft performance record), not to exceed 1 hour and 30
   minutes. Use the worksheet on page 3 of the AF IMT 4116 to complete in-flight fuel
   management computations.
       11.12.1.1. ETA DEST. Best known arrival time at destination.
       11.12.1.2. TIME. Time of the fuel reading.
158                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      11.12.1.3. TERMINAL FUEL FLOW.
      11.12.1.4. CURRENT FUEL FLOW.
      11.12.1.5. AVG FUEL FLOW. Calculate by adding terminal fuel flow to current fuel
      flow and dividing the sum by 2.
      11.12.1.6. FUEL REM. Fuel quantity at time of calculation. In the interest of safety, use
      the lower of the calculated or gauge fuels.
      11.12.1.7. O/H FUEL. Required overhead fuel (item 13 of the fuel plan).
      11.12.1.8. DIFF. Subtract O/H Fuel from FUEL REM.

      11.12.1.10. ETE DEST. Subtract TIME from ETA DEST.
      11.12.1.11. EXT TIME. Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Report this value to the
      pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If they are
      correct, evaluate your destination options.
  11.12.2. Use the following formulas to accomplish in-flight fuel management:
      11.12.2.1. [(Terminal fuel flow + Present fuel flow)]/2 = Average Fuel Flow
      11.12.2.2. Present fuel - Overhead fuel = Usable Fuel
      11.12.2.3. Usable fuel/Average fuel burn rate = Fuel ETE
      11.12.2.4. Fuel ETE - ETE to destination = Extra Time
  11.12.3. AF IMT 4125, Range Control Chart may also be used for in-flight fuel
  management.
      11.12.3.1. Manual Construction. (Figure 11.4)
         11.12.3.1.1. ―POINT NUMBER‖ represents the approximate level-off point (initial
         cruise altitude), 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the flight plan distance as indicated on
         AF IMT 4116 or CFP.
         11.12.3.1.2. Column A, ―EN ROUTE AND DESTINATION FUEL‖: AF IMT 4116
         takeoff fuel minus en route reserve fuel.
         11.12.3.1.3. Column B, ―EN ROUTE FUEL‖: The fuel (en route + identified extra
         fuel) planned to be burned off by the time each of the given points defined in
         paragraph 11.12.3.1.1 are reached.
         11.12.3.1.4. Column C, ―MINIMUM FUEL‖: Subtract Column B (EN ROUTE
         FUEL) from column A (EN ROUTE AND DESTINATION FUEL). This fuel is the
         minimum, at each given point, to fly from that point to destination with sufficient fuel
         to make a missed approach (if required), continue to the destination alternate, hold,
         make the planned approach, and land with 4,000 pounds of fuel. Minimum fuel will
         also include any identified extra fuel needed overhead the alternate (e.g., excess
         holding, for succeeding legs, etc.). The minimum fuel at the 100 percent point should
         be the same as required overhead fuel.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       159


           11.12.3.1.5. Column D, ―DISTANCE‖: The flight plan distance for the given points
           listed in paragraph 11.12.3.1.1, obtained from AF IMT 4116. This can be
           graphically depicted as either distance flown or distance remaining.
           11.12.3.1.6. ―DISTANCE FLOWN/REMAINING‖: Label the nautical miles to the
           destination along the horizontal scale. For distance flown start with 0 at the left and
           allow the major blocks to represent convenient increments of mileage. NOTE: The
           distance scale should be expanded to the maximum to give as large a presentation as
           possible.
           11.12.3.1.7. Draw a vertical line on the graph representing total distance to
           destination and label this line with the destination name.
           11.12.3.1.8. Estimated Performance/Minimum Arrival Fuel Lines.              Estimated
           Performance is based on planned fuel at T/O, level off, and arrival plotted parallel to
           the minimum fuel line.
           11.12.3.1.9. A ―minimum arrival‖ line will be constructed by plotting fuel in column
           C versus distance in column D.
           11.12.3.1.10. An ―estimated performance‖ line will be constructed by plotting a line
           parallel to the minimum arrival line based on planned take-off, level off and arrival
           fuel.
NOTE: The difference between the estimated performance line and the minimum arrival line is
reserve and unidentified extra fuel.
NOTE: Plot vertical lines representing ETPs if required at the appropriate distance
flown/remaining.
   11.12.4. The navigator may terminate these procedures one hour from destination, when the
   Category I route segment is completed, or at the discretion of the PIC.
11.13. Airborne Radar Approach Procedures.
11.13. (908AW)Airborne Radar Approach Procedures. The 908 OG Inflight Guide provides
procedures for conducting ARA approaches at Maxwell AFB.
   11.13.1. VFR Operations. Units will construct VFR ARA approaches IAW AFI 11-230,
   Instrument Procedures, and submit VFR ARA approach plates for approval to MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval. During VFR, the minimum ceiling and visibility will be 1,500 feet and 3 miles.
   VFR cloud clearances will be maintained at all times while performing VFR ARAs. Publish
   approved VFR ARA approaches in local supplements. The local supplement should include
   SCNS ARA input data. If available, pilots will back up the navigator using a published
   instrument approach.
       11.13.1.1. Navigators will load ARA information into the SCNS for all NVG airland
       operations. Navigators may modify existing approaches to meet this requirement. Units
       should publish local procedures in the unit supplement to this AFI.
   11.13.2. IFR Operations. Crews are only authorized to perform ARAs in IMC with a valid
   TERPSed approach. Weather minimums will be established by the approach, but will be no
   lower than 500-feet and 1 mile (300-feet and 1 mile for AWADS certified crews).
 160                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   11.13.3. Planning and Coordination. Prior to entering the terminal area, the navigator will
   coordinate the following items with the PF:
       11.13.3.1. Desired pattern altitudes and headings.
       11.13.3.2. Distance on final where descent will commence.
       11.13.3.3. Glide slope angle and initial rate of descent (normally not greater than 400-
       feet per NM). Refer to Figure 11.3 for descent rate examples.
       11.13.3.4. Minimum descent altitude and missed approach point/procedures. Missed
       approach will conform to published procedures for a useable approach, if able.
   11.13.4. Terminology and Procedures.
       11.13.4.1. Pattern Control. The navigator will advise the PF when positive radar
       identification of the airfield complex is made.
       11.13.4.2. The navigator will direct the aircraft by headings to the final approach course.
       For AWADS equipped units, navigators may advise the PF to intercept the bank steering
       bar (as required), when flying computer ARAs.
       11.13.4.3. During the approach, the navigator will advise the PF of the drift and
       groundspeed. If PFs can view this information on the selected SCNS/INS display, this
       advisory is not required.
       11.13.4.4. The turn onto base leg (if required) should be made to allow for a 10 NM final
       (or as required).
       11.13.4.5. The navigator will state the distance from touchdown each mile from the end
       of the runway beginning 10-miles out. A glide path warning should be given 10 seconds
       prior to the ―begin descent point.‖
       11.13.4.6. The navigator will give heading information at least every nautical mile
       during the final approach. AWADS-equipped units are authorized to perform computer
       ARAs using AWADS equipment in VMC or IMC according to paragraph 11.13.1 and
       paragraph 11.13.2.
       11.13.4.7. Use Chapter 5 procedures for required non-precision approach calls upon
       reaching the MDA.
11.14. Grid Procedures.
   11.14.1. Definitions and formulae. See AFPAM 11-216.
   11.14.2. Grid Log. The navigator will use page 6 of the AF IMT 4116 when grid navigation
   procedures are required. Block entries are as follows:
       11.14.2.1. Time. Time of celestial heading/system heading observation.
       11.14.2.2. TH. Observed/computed true heading.
       11.14.2.3. CA/LONG. Enter +W -E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle.
       11.14.2.4. GH. Observed/computed grid heading.
       11.14.2.5. GYRO #1, GYRO #2. On aircraft equipped with two independent gyro
       stabilized systems with numbers corresponding to aircraft systems (e.g. C-12 No. 1, N-1
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     161


     No 2), circled number denotes the primary steering gyro. On aircraft whose systems are
     not numbered or do not correspond to the aircraft system, identify the primary steering
     gyro in ―REMARKS‖.
     11.14.2.6. GR. Gyro reading. Record the reading from the primary compass.
     11.14.2.7. PREC. The amount of precession since the last heading shot (period
     precession): GH - GR = PREC.
     11.14.2.8. RATE/CUM. The hourly precession rate based upon the precession indicated
     at the time of observation. Precession rate is derived from the period precession and the
     applicable elapsed time period (since the last compass reset). Example: 2 degrees
     precession in 40 minutes equals a 3 degrees/hour precession rate. This entry is required
     only when period precession is greater than one degree. The cumulative portion of the
     block is used for tracking the cumulative precession rate once a false latitude has been
     set.
     11.14.2.9. LAT. The mid-latitude between the current observation and the next proposed
     observation.
     11.14.2.10. FALSE LAT. The false latitude setting being used to eliminate precession.
     This entry is required only when a false latitude setting is used.
     11.14.2.11. RESET. Whenever a gyro is reset, place a check mark in this block.
     11.14.2.12. GC. Measured grid course to the next checkpoint.
     11.14.2.13. DRIFT. The number of degrees (+ or -) of drift.
     11.14.2.14. DGH. Desired grid heading. Apply anticipated DRIFT to GC.
     11.14.2.15. RT/2 CORR. See formula on the bottom of the AF IMT 4116.
     11.14.2.16. IGH. Initial grid heading. Used for alter heading.
     11.14.2.17. GRID ENTRY. Apply grivation (GRIV) to Magnetic Heading (MH) to
     obtain desired grid heading (DGH); or apply (LONG) or convergence angle (CA) to True
     Heading (TH) to obtain DGH. See formulas on the AF IMT 4116.
     11.14.2.18. GRID EXIT. Apply GRIV to DGH to obtain MH; or apply LONG or CA to
     DGH to obtain TH. See formulas on the AF IMT 4116.
  11.14.3. Grid Celestial Computations:
     11.14.3.1. When plotting celestial lines of position (LOPs) in grid reference, apply
     longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle to the true azimuth and plot the grid
     azimuth.
     11.14.3.2. When taking heading checks at high latitudes, it is advisable to place data into
     the periscopic sextant to give the true heading and convert this heading to grid by
     applying the assumed LONG/CA.
  11.14.4. Construction and use of the ZN graph is optional. The ZN graph is based upon the
  route of flight and dead reckoning. See AFPAM 11-216 for construction procedures.
  11.14.5. Departure Requirements:
162                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      11.14.5.1. Polar true/grid courses as reflected in FLIP terminal charts will be used for
      departures in polar areas. Before takeoff, visually align the aircraft with the runway
      heading and set the polar true/grid course of the runway in the aircraft‘s directional gyros.
      The navigator will set applicable systems in gyro mode with the correct latitude set.
      11.14.5.2. After reaching flight altitude, determine the polar true grid heading and reset
      the primary and secondary gyros. The type of chart being used will determine whether
      the heading will be polar grid heading or convergence grid heading.
  11.14.6. En Route Requirements:
      11.14.6.1. The Grid Entry/Exit section of the AF IMT 4116 will be completed prior to
      heading reference changes. When entering grid operation, spot grivation should be
      applied to the computed magnetic heading to obtain DGH. The aircraft will be
      established on the computed magnetic heading prior to resetting the heading references.
      When exiting grid, the computed magnetic headings will be the target heading when the
      compass systems are reset. In both cases, the computed magnetic headings will be
      compared to the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion
      data used. This will ensure the validity of initial entry headings and provide precise
      target headings for exit.
      11.14.6.2. Normally, the grid heading will be checked each 30-minutes after grid entry.
      If the compasses are precessing 3 degrees per hour or less, hourly checks may be
      obtained after the first hour. NOTE: On aircraft with reliable SCNS/INS, if the
      SCNS/INS heading is within 2 degrees of the initial celestial-derived grid heading, the
      SCNS/INS may be used to determine gyro precession.
      11.14.6.3. Determine the precession information for each gyro after each heading check.
      When a gyro‘s precession is greater than 1 degree, reset the gyro to correct grid heading.
      When the period precession is 1 degree or less, the navigator may either reset the gyro or
      treat the precession as zero.
      11.14.6.4. Whenever the period precession is greater that 1 degree (optional for 1 degree
      or less), the hourly precession rate may be removed by use of a false latitude setting.
      When the combined earth rate and gyro precession are less than +15 degrees/hour, the
      false latitude setting will totally compensate for precession. Two considerations are
      necessary:
         11.14.6.4.1. Predicted precession becomes zero.
         11.14.6.4.2. It may be necessary to adjust previous DR and air plot positions if the
         precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks. If this occurs, adjustments
         normally will be small and have negligible effect on DR and air plot accuracy;
         however, the effect should be considered.
      11.14.6.5. To determine false latitude correction, enter the earth rate table with the
      desired latitude and extract the tabulated earth rate value. Algebraically combine the
      earth rate value and the observed hourly precession rate (use cumulative precession rate
      once a false latitude has been set). Re-enter the earth rate table with the combined value
      and extract the corresponding false latitude.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          163


     11.14.6.6. Only 15 degrees/hour can be removed by a false latitude setting. When the
     sum of earth and primary gyro precession rates exceeds +15 degrees, the navigator must
     artificially steer the aircraft (in effect, the aircraft will fly a gentle arc) to compensate for
     the amount of precession in excess of +15 degrees/hour. The formula used to correct the
     DGH to an initial grid heading (IGH) to fly appears on the AF IMT 4116 as ―RT/2
     CORR‖ (note that the formula produces a correction, so the precession rate must be given
     its opposite sign). The precession rate used in the formula must be adjusted to reflect the
     time period in the DR ahead. When ―carrying‖ precession as suggested above, the
     navigator should consider several aspects of the navigational problem: NOTE: When
     precession exceeds 15 degrees per hour, consider the compasses unusable.
         11.14.6.6.1. If alter headings are not made at heading check times, precession will
         have accumulated by alter heading times and a correction (opposite sign of
         precession) should be applied to the IGH using the total precession correction portion
         of the AF IMT 4116.
         11.14.6.6.2. If the precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks, it may be
         advisable to adjust previous DR and air plot positions described at paragraph
         11.5.7.6.
  11.14.7. Miscellaneous Procedures:
     11.14.7.1. Normally, when changing charts or crossing the 180 degree meridian, only the
     reference changes; the heading of the aircraft is not altered. The change is made by
     comparing the grid courses and applying the difference to the gyro reading (old chart GC
     350 degrees; new chart GC 331 degrees; GR 353; 350 - 331 = 019 = 334; reset the gyro
     to read 334).
     11.14.7.2. Do not use the combined rhumb line/coriolis correction when flying DG. Use
     only coriolis correction for celestial observations.
     11.14.7.3. Always recheck computations and formulas when a radical change in
     precession is observed.
     11.14.7.4. Grid qualified navigators will maintain proficiency in grid procedures.

                                            Chapter 12

     FLIGHT ENGINEER/AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains flight engineer procedures not contained in the flight
manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the PIC for all inspections and
procedures required by the applicable technical orders and regulations.
12.3. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to
clear a Red X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified
maintenance personnel are not available to clear it, the flight engineer may obtain authorization
to clear the Red X from the home station MXG/CC or designated representative in accordance
with TO 00-20-1. Other crewmembers are not authorized to clear a Red X. Flight engineers and
maintenance personnel are not authorized to clear a Red X caused by CBRNE contamination
(see paragraph 10.5.9). EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear Red Xs for engine panels
and covers, pitot covers, gear pins, and SPR drains when qualified maintenance personnel are not
available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC or designated
representative.
12.3. (908AW)Specific Red X. Specific Red X conditions may be cleared by the flight engineer
IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel or de-fuel
aircraft; however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
maintenance personnel are not available. This policy is designed for support of the aircraft and
its mission while away from home station. TO 00-25-172, and TO1C-130H-2-12JG-10-1 will be
used during all servicing operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the PIC will
designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. A flight engineer may assist the
normal maintenance function when critical contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this
action does not impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
       12.4.1.1. AMC program aircraft are authorized to use JP-8+100. C-130 units at bases
       with JP-8+100 are program aircraft and may use either JP-8+100 or JP-8.
       12.4.1.2. AMC non-program aircraft will not operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency
       conditions. Non-program C-130 units will not use JP-8+100 and will make all efforts to
       avoid refueling with JP-8+100. JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8
       capability to support transient aircraft. If JP-8+100 refueling occurs comply with the
       following:
           12.4.1.2.1. De-fuel the aircraft prior to flight.
           12.4.1.2.2. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry stating ―Caution: Aircraft refueled using
           JP-8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.‖
172                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      12.4.1.3. When crewmembers are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
      refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel
      operators will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and applicable T.O. 1C-130xx series T.O.s.
      Two other crew members are required to assist in the refueling, one for safety duties and
      the other to act as fire guard.
  12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor
  (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent
  servicing (CS) in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews
  performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must
  have cooperation and close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous
  intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation.
  Team members include CSS, Single Point Refueling (SPR) monitor, refueling panel monitor,
  fuel specialists, and one person to monitor the opposite side wing fuel vents. When the
  aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft operations and shall
  inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/safety. In
  keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CS
  operations to include personnel participating in the refuel.
      12.4.2.1. Use the following guidelines when CS operations are conducted with
      passengers on board:
         12.4.2.1.1. A current and qualified crew member will be designated the passenger
         compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor passengers during CS.
         PCMs will not perform other duties during servicing.
         12.4.2.1.2. Designate a current and qualified crew member to remain on the flight
         deck to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request for emergency
         assistance on a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to an
         emergency response team. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an
         emergency.
         12.4.2.1.3. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions,
         and hazards. Passengers will remain seated but will not wear seat belts during CS.
         When possible, conduct this briefing prior to servicing. If servicing is in progress, the
         briefing will be given immediately after boarding.
         12.4.2.1.4. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the
         express purpose of loading for departure or off-loading upon arrival. Boarding or
         exiting must be opposite of servicing operations. Once onboard, except for
         emergencies, passengers shall not deplane once servicing commences.
         12.4.2.1.5. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
         12.4.2.1.6. Passenger representatives will assist the PCM when passengers board and
         exit. Passengers must remain outside the vapor hazard area, the fuel servicing safety
         zone, oxygen servicing area, and 25 feet from fuel vents during servicing.
         12.4.2.1.7. The PIC, or designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs
         when to evacuate passengers.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      173


         12.4.2.1.8. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will
         remain open and stairs in place.
         12.4.2.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
         combat environment.
         12.4.2.1.10. The loadmaster shall ensure cargo loading or unloading does not
         jeopardize passenger safety. Winching is prohibited. Do not load/unload cargo
         containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during CS. Loadmasters
         may on/off-load cargo only when the cargo barrier net is in place. EXCEPTION:
         Small floor-loaded cargo may be loaded without the cargo net in place.
     12.4.2.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
     12.4.2.3. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is
     authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
     servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
     completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
     safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized. EXCEPTION: Diesel and
     turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can be on-loaded or off-
     loaded without having to stop fuel flow.
  12.4.3. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations only:
     12.4.3.1. Electric and electronic equipment may be left on provided it does not radiate
     energy; but it must not be turned on or off during refueling.
     12.4.3.2. TACANs and radar altimeter must be turned off.
     12.4.3.3. Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
     12.4.3.4. IFF/SIF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
     12.4.3.5. SCNS/INU may be ―on‖ and may be updated. Do not turn on or off during
     refuel operations.
  12.4.4. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
  conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235,
  Forward Area Refueling/Rearming Point (FARRP) Operations.
  12.4.5. In order to comply with the intent of Primary Fuel Management and provide the
  greatest flexibility for maintenance and operations, standard ramp fuel loads in excess of
  30,000 pounds should be loaded as follows:
     12.4.5.1. Outboard main tanks. 8,000 pounds each is the minimum to be considered full.
     12.4.5.2. Inboard main tanks.      7,200 pounds in each tank is the minimum to be
     considered full.
  12.4.6. Operational commitments, availability of fuel services or planned landing criteria
  will in some cases dictate that these procedures be adjusted however, every effort should be
  made to comply with these guidelines and the flight manual to maximize airframe life.
  12.4.7. (Added-908AW) Fuel Load and Distribution. In order to comply with Primary Fuel
  Management (IAW T.O 1C-130H-1), to prevent fuel venting on the ramp and to operate as
 174                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   efficiently as possible, fuel loads will be IAW Table 12.1 . The exact fuel load will be
   coordinated by 357 AS/DOO prior to each mission flown and forecast in the 908 AW
   Weekly Flying Schedule. Aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for ensuring that
   fuel load and distribution meet mission requirements.
        12.4.7.1. (Added-908AW) T.O 1C-130H-1 recommends that landings be made with
        little, if any, usable fuel in the external tanks. When more than 30K fuel is required for
        ―Short Hop‖ missions (local PRO/TAC, Lawson JAATT, etc) extra fuel will be placed in
        the auxiliary fuel tanks. When more than 30K fuel is required for ―Long Hop‖ missions
        (AE/OW, lengthy en route sorties, etc) extra fuel will be placed in the external fuel tanks
        provided that the planned flight duration is sufficient to exhaust the external fuel tank
        supply prior to landing.

   12.9.3. Additional Information. AF IMT 4108 provides as a simple method of recording
   aircraft fuel data and is adequate for normal operational requirements. When additional
   information is required for identifying trends in engine failure or performance or for special
   test programs, the directing headquarters will furnish necessary forms and instructions to
   complete the program.
   12.9.4. Instructions. Form heading entries are self-explanatory.
       12.9.4.1. Block 1-FUEL GAGE POUNDS. Record fuel quantity from the fuel quantity
       indicators before and after flight. This reading is normally taken prior to engine start
       with the indicators powered and after flight prior to power being removed from the
       indicators.
       12.9.4.2. Block 2-WEIGHT DATA. Record operating weight and cargo weight
       (including passenger weight) from DD Form 365-4. Ramp fuel weight is obtained from
       block 1 (Fuel Gage). The blank space may be used for last minute changes prior to
       engine start or as required.
       12.9.4.3. Block 3-FUEL ON/OFFLOAD. Enter total weight of fuel on or offload during
       air refueling in this block.

      12.9.4.6.1. WU/TAXI/TAKEOFF-Indicates warm-up taxi and takeoff conditions.
         12.9.4.6.2. 1 Climb. Initial climb is indicated by symbol (1). Secondary and
         subsequent climbs are shown as (2, 3, etc.). The number here indicates sequence of
         condition in flight profile. This is also true of cruise segments and descents. Climbs
         of 4,000 feet or less will not be recorded separately but will be included in preceding
         cruise increments. When constant climb is maintained to cruise altitude, use fuel
         flow reading taken at 2/3 climb altitude. When constant climb cannot be maintained
         to cruise altitude due to air route traffic control (ARTC) clearances, etc., enter
         difference between sum of individual fuel quantity gage readings at beginning and
         end of climb.
         12.9.4.6.3. Cruise operating conditions are indicated by the number in cruise
         sequence and an arrow (1, 2, 3, etc.). Instrument readings will be averaged for this
         period. Normally, cruise entries will be no more than 1 hour. However, the first
         cruise, the cruise immediately prior to en route or step climb and/or the last cruise
         prior to descent, may be no less than 30 minutes, nor more than 1 hour and 30
         minutes.
         12.9.4.6.4. Descents are shown as (1, 2, 3, etc.). Do not confuse descent with the
         final letdown that occurs when your landing procedures begin. The loss in altitude
         during final letdown is indicated by ―L & T.‖ Landing and taxi is that condition from
         the end of the last entry in the sequence of descents to engine shutdown on the ramp.
         Holding time, however, must he accounted for as an additional cruise () condition
         after descent when necessary. Descents of 4,000 feet or less will not be recorded
         separately but will be indicated in the preceding cruise increment. When descent
         exceeds 4,000 feet, blocks 10 through 18 need not be completed.
         12.9.4.6.5. AR-Air Refueling Tanker Operation, ARR Air Refueling Receiver
         Operation. Cruise, climb, or descent to refueling altitude (end this condition
         approximately at start of on/offload of fuel.) Indicate AR and ARR 1, 2, etc., in
         condition block, for refueling condition. Blocks 10 through 18 need not be
         completed. Blocks 19, 20, 22, 25, and 28 entries are not required for ARR. At
         completion of on or offload of fuel, a new cruise, climb, or descent condition will be
         initiated. NOTE: Rescue. search, storm penetration, combat/combat support, or any
         special mission which requires constant variations in altitude and airspeed may use
         the same procedures as air refueling operations. For this type of condition use an ―S‖
         in the condition block.
      12.9.4.7. Block 7-END. Enter GMT for end of condition.
      12.9.4.8. Block 8-SET.      Enter increment time duration for the condition for
      WU/TAX/TO. All warm-up and taxi times will be entered in the circle of the SET block.
      Takeoff time is computed from brake release to the first change of power (when reduced
      power procedures are used, compute take-off time using 2 minutes).
      12.9.4.9. Block 9-TOTAL. Enter cumulative total time of SET time, excluding the
      warm-up and taxi times entered in the circle SET time.
      12.9.4.10. Block 10-OATI. Enter indicated outside air temperature reading.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     177


     12.9.4.11. Block 11-OAT/VAR:
        12.9.4.11.1. OATC. Enter corrected outside air temperature as determined from the
        appropriate performance manual.

        Aviation (ICAO) temperature.
     12.9.4.12. Block 12-HP. Enter the pressure altitude for the condition with altimeter set
     at 29.92 Hg.
        12.9.4.12.1. For climb, enter HP for 2/3 the intended climb as soon as the altitude to
        which the climb is to be made is known. The entry (2/3 HP) reflects pressure altitude
        for 2/3 of the actual climb. If a climb starts at 15.000 feet and terminates at 30,000
        feet, you compute the pressure altitude for 2/3 of the 15,000 difference, which is
        10,000 feet. This HP added to the 15,000 foot beginning HP equals 25,000 feet HP,
        which is the appropriate entry for this climb.
        12.9.4.12.2. For cruise, enter the actual HP.
        12.9.4.12.3. When descent exceeds 4,000 feet, blocks 10 through 18 need not be
        completed.
     12.9.4.13. Block 13-CRUISE CEILING. Enter 4-engine cruise ceiling for the aircraft
     from the appropriate performance manual.
     12.9.4.14. Block 14-CRUISE IAS. Enter indicated airspeed from the appropriate

     reading and total for the period. Engine instrument fuel flow (lbs/hr) will be the complete
     figure (4800 not 4.8).
     12.9.4.19. Block 19-PERIOD (FUEL USED). Enter fuel used for engines for the period
     as computed using total of fuel flow readings. NOTE: For fuel used during WU/TAXI,
     use 50 pounds per minute. For fuel used during TAKEOFF, use 300 pounds. Enter all
     fuel used, fuel remaining, and gross weights in thousands. EXAMPLE: 127,300 = 127.3.
     All weights are to be carried to the nearest hundred. EXCEPTION: Engine instrument
     fuel flow (lbs/hr) will be a complete figure.
     12.9.4.20. Block 20-EXTRA (FUEL USED). Enter extra fuel used during flight
     condition period for fuel jettisoning, APU, etc. Fuel transferred to a receiver during air
     refueling will be entered in this block.

Section 12A---Hostile Environmental Repair Procedures
12.11. General. Authority to use the Hostile Environment Kit and Repair Procedures is granted
by Operations Group Commander/Deputy Commanders for Operations when the aircraft is
directed into a hostile or potentially hostile environment or in extreme cases where recovery of
the aircraft or completion of the mission dictates their use. This authority is documented on the
FRAG or Air Tasking Order. The Operations Group Commander/Deputy Commander for
Operations may delegate this Authority as necessary in cases where: (1) The unit is
geographically separated from the parent unit, or (2) the unit is deployed or otherwise not co-
located with the Operations Group Commander/Deputy Commander for Operations. All normal
avenues of repair/recovery should be exhausted (when practical) prior to use of the Hostile
Environmental Repair Procedures. When Hostile Environmental Repair Procedures are actually
employed, inform MAJCOM Stan/Eval by letter. Include a brief description of the
circumstances and conditions leading to the decision to approve Hostile Environmental
Procedures.

                                          Chapter 13

                 CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations
centers or shipping agencies; plans loads; and supervises loading or offloading operations.
Performs preflight and postflight of aircraft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and
balance. Provides for safety and comfort of passengers and troops, and security of cargo, mail,
and baggage during flight. Prepares and rigs equipment for airdrop, and participates in the aerial
delivery of equipment, supplies, and personnel.
13.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Air freight personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning, computing load
       distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure.
       They will advise the loadmaster of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified,
       hazardous, etc.) before starting loading operations to permit proper positioning. They
       will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading and assign
       sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air freight personnel are
       responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to or from the
       aircraft cargo door, ramp, or auxiliary ground loading ramps. Under supervision of the
       loadmaster, air freight personnel prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown
       equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft and tie down
       cargo and equipment, and release tiedown and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning; preparation
       of DD365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical; certifying
       load plans; operating aircraft equipment; supervising and directing loading and offloading
       operations; and cargo tie down. He or she coordinates with the loading crew supervisor
       to verify cargo against manifests. The loadmaster supervises loading operations and is
       responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. The loadmaster will
       notify the PIC, command post, or terminal operations officer if loading personnel are
       injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during loading or
       offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and cargo
       jettisonability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF and MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
       standardization and evaluation through standardization channels. AMC personnel attach
       an AMC IMT 54, Aircraft Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities.
       EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster may deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of
       on-load or off-load of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration without
       submitting documentation. The aircraft loadmaster must take into consideration the next
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      181


      station‘s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight
      and balance limits. A new load plan is not required for this exception.
      13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for
      airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
      loadmaster to use his or her best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge,
      to determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise,
      they should seek advice of other personnel (i.e., available loadmasters and squadron,
      group, wing, NAF, or MAJCOM standardization personnel).
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified
   personnel and material handling equipment for loading or offloading. Loadmaster‘s
   responsibilities and authority are the same as described in paragraphs 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3.
   13.2.3. During JA/ATT, SAAM, USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster
   can accept DD2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment
   being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user
   and transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the T.O. 1C-130A-
   9CL-1. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials.
   This will be accomplished using the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Safety aisles will be according to AFI 11-2C-
130V3, Addenda A, C-130 Configuration/Mission Planning, and this chapter.
   13.3.1. When passengers are seated in side facing seats, the loadmaster will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit passenger leg room. NOTE: All
   passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
   safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisleway will be stowed
   with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit must be available for each 20
   passengers/troops. (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape
   hatches are available for egress.) Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not
   considered an obstruction.
   13.3.3. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-inch
   space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward occupied litter, occupied
   seat or nuclear cargo. When the cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with
   chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION: Maintain 30 inch spacing on AE
   missions, when carrying occupied litters.
13.4. Pre-mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
      13.4.1.1. Aircraft loadmasters in coordination with aerial port personnel establish
      loading times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence will be
      established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading time
      is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized,
      etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When
182                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      reporting for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the ATOC or other designated location
      to obtain load breakdown and assist in load planning as required.
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated
      statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
      available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
      cargo listing or electronic storage medium containing manifest information must
      accompany the load. NOTE: Computer generated load plans are not an acceptable
      substitute for proper cargo documentation described above.
      13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If
      this is not possible, annotate the AF IMT 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-
      AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. It may be necessary
  for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability.
  These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport
  requirements are met. Do not hesitate to contact TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center;
  DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial (618)229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as to who
  may travel to specific locations or passport/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within
  other MAJCOMs which have operational command and control over that aircraft will contact
  the appropriate AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the passenger manifest with the
  most responsible on-scene agency if there is no base operations, or other agency responsible
  for filing the manifest.
      13.4.2.1. Manifesting.     Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest
      passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.1.1. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible to ensure all passengers are
         properly manifested.
         13.4.2.1.2. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity, aircrew will
         manifest all passengers using DD2131, Passenger Manifest, and leave a copy of the
         manifest with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of
         the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
         13.4.2.1.3. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing will
         also be completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207.
      13.4.2.2. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned to the
      in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF IMT 129, Tally
      In-Out, is received from fleet to relieve the loadmaster of meal accountability.
      13.4.2.3. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on TWCF funded
      missions (including ANG and AFRC flown missions) for passenger consumption only.
      Complimentary snacks are not authorized on JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)
      exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port operations officer will ensure snacks
      and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC stations. When departing from
      other stations and no snacks or beverages are to be placed onboard, the loadmaster may
      obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-flight kitchen. Direct the in-flight
      kitchen to bill the accounting and finance office at the aircraft‘s home station. Record all
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      183


      unused snacks and beverages on AF IMT 129 and return to the in-flight kitchen for turn-
      in credit.
      13.4.2.4. Ensure the auxiliary power unit/gas turbine compressor is shut down before
      boarding passengers unless adequate hearing protection is provided. A passenger service
      representative or crew member will assist passengers at the bottom of the steps, and the
      loadmaster will assist in seating passengers. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking
      passengers are seated next to emergency exits. Do not seat mothers with infants, children
      under 15 years old or physically challenged persons in seats adjacent to emergency exits.
      Make every effort to seat families together.
      13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
      has the option to either hold the child or place him or her in a Department of
      Transportation-approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children
      processed through AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer
      mandatory, all passengers (duty and space A), regardless of age, are required to be
      assigned their own seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a
      dedicated seat allowing the use of an ICS at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors current
      FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses,
      and vest child restraints.
          13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, these seats will be secured
          to a seat using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant seats during any phase of
          flight.
          13.4.2.5.2. If the mission aircraft is equipped with aft facing ―airline style‖ seats,
          secure the seat in the same manner as in an automobile. However, if the aircraft is
          configured with side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is adequately secured.
          The design of the sidewall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack to
          secure the ICS. Crewmembers may need to reroute the seatbelt by crossing the belt,
          between the sidewall and the seatback webbing, routing the belt back through the
          webbing and through the securing point on the ICS. When removing slack from the
          seatbelt ensure the buckle remains on one side or the other so that it can be easily
          accessed for release. The PIC is the final authority for determining whether the ICS
          is adequately secured.
      13.4.2.6. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
      In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with Tanker
      Airlift Control Elements or deploying unit commanders to decide if downloading of
      baggage is necessary.
   13.4.2.7. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101V15, Military
   Airlift - Baggage Service. The loadmaster will ensure ATOC provides a copy of the AMC
   IMT 70, Rush Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of rush baggage.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The loadmaster is the key to good passenger relations. The following common sense
   rules should be observed:
      13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
184                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


      13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
      criticism of other personnel or organizations.
      13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
      willingness to help.
  13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
      13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
      judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
      one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
      concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
      baggage. WARNING : Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat
      belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
      13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
         13.5.3.2.1. Cabin temperature.
         13.5.3.2.2. Passengers with small children.
         13.5.3.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
      13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will
      not be permitted access to checked baggage.
      13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
      make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
      13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
      judgment when requesting this authority.
  13.5.4. Meal Service.
      13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
      point of departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected
      flight conditions prior to meal preparation.
      13.5.4.2. Passengers having a boarding pass, AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket,
      showing a meal was ordered are served meals in the following sequence:
         13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
         13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
         13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
      13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
         13.5.4.3.1. After takeoff, distribute box lunches to passengers who boarded at the
         previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and
         passengers board at subsequent stations.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         185


          13.5.4.3.2. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the
          passenger‘s AMC Form 148.
       13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
       13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
       contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of
       spoiled meals (by menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the
       manufacturing agency, and manufacturer‘s lot number.
       13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, the loadmaster
       will annotate the individual‘s boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized.
       Inform passengers they may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or
       destination terminal.
13.6. Over-Packed Meal Procedures: Not Used.
13.7. En Route and Post Flight Duties.
   13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is
   responsible for planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.7.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.).
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are aboard, the loadmaster will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.
   13.7.4. (Added-908AW) Return Aircraft Configuration. Loadmasters will roll and/or stow
   all tie down equipment and interphone cords upon mission termination. Any equipment used
   for a particular type mission will be de-configured and stowed (e.g. ground loading ramps,
   CDS pulleys, litter straps). Loadmasters will inspect the cargo compartment for cleanliness
   and dispose of all trash. The FCC (if aboard) will assist and provide return configuration
   guidance.
       13.7.4.1. (Added-908AW) When returning from missions airdropping paratroopers, the
       loadmaster will (as a minimum) de-rig and stow A-frame braces, paratroop jump
       platforms, static line retriever cables and anchor cables installed for the mission. The only
       exception is a follow-on paratroop airdrop mission utilizing the same aircraft and exits.
       13.7.4.2. (Added-908AW) The loadmaster(s) will debrief the crew chief on what was
       not accomplished before leaving the aircraft. The loadmaster will also pass this
       information to the PIC/SOF prior to leaving the squadron.
13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
 186                                        AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   coordinate with the loadmaster prior to directing personnel to load any weapons. This
   applies to airborne assaults and airland missions.
   13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective.
   Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.9. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this airplane according to T.O.
1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, TO 1C-130X-5, Basic Weight Check List and Loading Data, and
AFI 11-2C-130V3, Addenda A. The unit possessing the airplane maintains the primary weight
and balance handbook containing the current airplane status and provides a supplemental weight
and balance handbook for each airplane. Enclose the supplemental handbook in a wear-resistant
binder (preferably metal), stenciled ―Weight and Balance‖ with the airplane model and complete
serial number on the cover or spine.
   13.9.1. The supplemental handbook will include TO 1C-130X-5, AFI 11-2C-130V3
   Addenda A, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4 to complete the mission and a certified copy
   of the current DD Form 365-3, Chart C-Basic Weight and Balance Record. Chart C will
   include the airplane‘s basic weight, basic moment, and center of gravity.
   13.9.2. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the airplane will maintain the
   required documents.
   13.9.3. Obtain the total fuel weight from the flight engineer or read directly from each gauge
   and compute the sum for total fuel weight. Do not rely on the fuel totalizer gauge.
   13.9.4. Loadmasters, in units who authorize the use of Canned Forms F, will still compute
   and provide the flight engineer with an accurate operating weight.
   13.9.5. The loadmaster will turn in the original DD Form 365-4 to be filed at the departure
   airfield and maintain a physical or electronic copy for the duration of the flight.
13.10. Cargo Validation On-loading and Off-loading Procedures and Format. To assist in
the cargo validation process, a cargo validation on-loading and off-loading format is provided in
this chapter. After completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A37V. Use
the following format when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any
cargo you feel requires special or specific on-loading, off-loading or tiedown procedures not
currently listed in T.O. 1C-130A-9.
   13.10.1. General Loading Data:

                                           Chapter 14

                                       FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter provides general C-130 fuel planning considerations and
procedures. Publish local procedures in unit supplements to this AFI.
14.2. Fuel Conservation.
   14.2.1. Conservation of fuel requires everyone‘s active participation. Do not carry extra fuel
   for convenience. Unidentified extra fuel should not exceed required ramp fuel load (RRFL)
   by more than 2,200 pounds.
   14.2.2. Extra fuel (identified extra) may be added to RRFL:
       14.2.2.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
       14.2.2.2. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
       14.2.2.3. For anticipated off course weather avoidance.
       14.2.2.4. For Wing Relieving Fuel (WRF) NOTE: WRF is additional fuel kept in the
       main tanks intended to counter wing bending moments. These wing bending moments
       are most pronounced with heavy cargo loads and lighter fuel weights. WRF is an
       element of primary fuel management essential for the long term structural integrity of the
       C-130. WRF is considered unusable fuel until the cargo is off-loaded (except in an
       emergency). In practical terms, it is the minimum landing fuel for a particular load in a
       specific aircraft. It is calculated using the appropriate T.O. 1C-130xx-1 Section V
       Weight Limitations Chart.
   14.2.3. Planning guidelines for fuel conservation:
       14.2.3.1. Use optimized CFPs when possible.
       14.2.3.2. Long range cruise (LRC) and/or optimum altitude should be flown (when
       possible).
       14.2.3.3. Limit the use of the APU/GTC when possible.
       14.2.3.4. Delay engine start.
       14.2.3.5. Cruise CG should be aft if practical.
       14.2.3.6. Fly en route descents when possible.
14.3. Fuel Planning.
   14.3.1. Entering Arguments:
       14.3.1.1. Weight. Add OPERATING WT, CARGO/PAX WT, and RAMP FUEL to
       obtain RAMP WT. Subtract TAXI fuel (item 9 on the AF IMT 4116) to obtain
       TAKEOFF WT.
       14.3.1.2. TEMP DEV - Temperature Deviation. Compare the forecast temperature at
       cruise altitude to the standard temperature for that altitude. The algebraic difference is
       TEMP DEV.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     189


14.4. Fuel Loads.
   14.4.1. Use the appropriate TO 1C-130xx1-1 as listed in Table 14.1 for fuel planning. Use
   95 percent engine charts and the En route Fuel Computation Worksheet on page 2 of the AF
   IMT 4116 to compute required en route fuel. All other items of the fuel analysis portion of
   AF IMT 4116 are explained in Table 14.2 ANG and AFRC OG/CC may establish standard
   ramp fuel loads for C-130 aircraft home station departures. See Figure 14.1
   14.4.2. En route fuel calculation. All times are calculated in minutes and all performance
   data computed using 95% engines.
      14.4.2.1. There are three distinct phases of flight for which required fuel quantities and
      or fuel flows must be calculated. These three phases are: initial climb out, start cruise
      and end cruise. Procedures for the necessary calculations are as follows:
          14.4.2.1.1. Prior to any calculations, use the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 4
          Figures to extract Time to Climb (TTC), Distance to Climb (DTC), and Fuel to Climb
          (FTC). Apply the correct temperature deviation and correct for pressure altitude to
          compute all climb data.
             14.4.2.1.1.1. Using TTC and DTC, calculate climb TAS.
      14.4.2.2. Climb Fuel. In the climb section of the en route fuel computation worksheet
      enter takeoff gross weight (TOGW), TTC, and FTC in the appropriate blocks.
      14.4.2.3. Start Cruise.
          14.4.2.3.1. Subtract climb fuel from the TOGW to obtain the start cruise gross
          weight.
          14.4.2.3.2. Enter the total flight time from the flight plan in the total time block.
          Subtract TTC from the total time to obtain cruise zone time.
          14.4.2.3.3. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
          Entering arguments are start cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
          deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four
          to arrive at fuel flow total.
          14.4.2.3.4. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the zone time to obtain
          start cruise zone fuel.
      14.4.2.4. End Cruise.
          14.4.2.4.1. Subtract cruise zone fuel from the start cruise gross weight to obtain end
          cruise gross weight.
          14.4.2.4.2. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
          Entering arguments are end cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
          deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four
          to arrive at fuel flow total. This is also the terminal fuel flow (TFF).
      14.4.2.5. Average Cruise Fuel Flow.
          14.4.2.5.1. Average the start cruise and end cruise fuel flow to obtain the average
          cruise fuel flow.
 190                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


           14.4.2.5.2. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the cruise zone time to
           obtain cruise zone fuel total.
       14.4.2.6. Total en route fuel. Add the FTC to the cruise zone fuel total to determine total
       en route fuel.
   14.4.3. Compute preflight endurance using the Average Cruise Fuel Flow. When computing
   preflight endurance, always subtract 1,300 pounds from actual ramp fuel to account for start,
   taxi and takeoff.
   14.4.4. When computing fuel using TO 1C-130X-1-1, use the appropriate drag index.
   Standardized drag indexes may be established by local OGVs and published in local
   supplements.
14.5. Multi-Leg Fuel Planning. See Figure 14.2 A multi-leg fuel plan becomes necessary
when a mission includes multiple stops where fuel is unavailable. Use the following procedure
for multi-leg fuel planning, assume a four leg mission with legs labeled A, B, C, and D in
succession:
   14.5.1. Begin with the final destination leg (C to D) and fuel plan as normal to obtain
   required ramp fuel.
   14.5.2. Next, fuel plan the leg preceding the final destination leg (B to C). Include the
   required ramp fuel from the C to D leg as identified extra fuel. Do not include alternate fuel
   or holding fuel unless those totals exceed the required ramp fuel for the C to D leg. Use
   1,000 lbs. for approach and landing.
   14.5.3. Plan the next preceding leg (A to B) as in paragraph 14.5.2.
       14.5.3.1. Unidentified extra is only entered for the first mission segment (A to B).
NOTE: Fuel requirements must be verified at each stopover airfield. Requirement must be
recomputed whenever the planned burnoff changes; for example, en route altitude changes,
actual cargo/passenger load differs from the estimate, holding is accomplished, diversion to
alternated is required, etc.
NOTE: Regardless of the number of mission segments involved, fuel planning is always
accomplished by planning the last leg‘s requirements first. The remaining leg requirements are
planned in the reverse order to be flown until the refueling airfield is reached.

                                          Chapter 16

                              COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for general C-130 tactical operations. It
provides parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.25. Mission
planning is normally conducted the day prior to the mission. Operations group commanders may
elect to use a ―same day mission plan‖ option. The aircrew is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy of the mission materials. Unit mission planning facilities should possess essential
mission planning material.
   16.1.1. NVG Mission Planning. One full day of planning should be allocated to missions
   that will operate in the NVG low-level environment. This planning may be accomplished by
   the pilot, navigator, or appropriate representative designated by the mission commander for
   formation flights.
16.2. DZ Restrictions.
   16.2.1. Planners will attempt to ensure that the DZ is long enough to avoid multiple passes in
   a hostile environment. If multiple passes become necessary, they may be accomplished by
   planning a racetrack/re-attack or an abbreviated route. In any case, multiple passes will not
   be performed unless they have been coordinated with the user, they have been planned and
   briefed, and they have been annotated on navigational charts (including the racetrack/re-
   attack flight path).
   16.2.2. Locate subsequent Multiple Points of Impact (MPIs) a minimum of 500 yards from
   the previous Point of Impact (PI). If MPIs are placed laterally, increase the width of the DZ
   accordingly. Ensure the PI distance from leading edge complies with AFI 13-217. Compute
   minimum size DZ required for the most restrictive aircraft in each element relative to their PI
   to ensure it fits within the surveyed DZ boundaries. Limit the number of MPIs to three
   without MAJCOM approval. All aircraft within an element must drop on the same PI. The
   coordinates for each PI must be provided to the aircrews. Use the most accurate PI altitude
   available. Thoroughly deconflict and brief all salvo and escape procedures as well as DZ
   markings prior to mission execution. Only the first PI will be marked. The user accepts
   responsibility when employing MPI for all injury/damage to personnel/equipment.
   16.2.3. Use of unmarked DZs requires OG/CC approval for unilateral missions, and
   MAJCOM/DO approval for all other peacetime training missions. Authorization to use
   unmarked DZs for contingency airdrops will be contained in SPINs or ATO. NOTE: Certain
   combat/contingency situations may prevent marking the DZ. Aircrews may be required to
   airdrop on unmarked DZs; however, supported units must be made aware that drop accuracy
   may be reduced. Planners and aircrews must thoroughly develop runins with good visual
   points for timing. Specific airdrop procedures are in Chapter 19 and AFI 13-217.
16.3. Route Planning.
   16.3.1. Low-Level Altitude Restrictions. The following minimum altitudes are established
   for C-130 airlift operations. Higher altitudes may be dictated by FLIP/ICAO procedures,
   training considerations, terrain, or operational directives. WARNING: Aeronautical charts
   do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a change in terrain until it
196                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


  exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot tower sat
  on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC (1:500,000) with
  a contour interval of 500 feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above
  charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the
  highest terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Planners must ensure accurate
  terrain analysis be evaluating both spot elevations and the highest contour level. CAUTION:
  Some charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g., JOG and
  TLM charts in some areas of the world).
      16.3.1.1. Day VMC En-Route. Fly no lower than 300 feet AGL modified contour
      altitude above the terrain using visual references and radar altimeter.
      16.3.1.2. Night VMC En Route (Non-NVGs). Fly no lower than an indicated altitude of
      500-feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or
      spot elevation), or 400-feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted
      terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NMs of route centerline to include the
      aircraft turn radius over each turnpoint. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the
      current leg altitude, climb will be completed prior to the turnpoint. If the altitude for the
      next leg is lower than the current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turnpoint.
      Legs may be divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain
      differential or threats in order to allow flight closer to the ground. Once the obstacle or
      terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may
      descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower.
      16.3.1.3. NVG En Route. Fly no lower than indicated altitude of 500 feet above the
      highest spot terrain elevation, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the
      highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3 NM on centerline. During
      mission planning, aircrews must identify a start climb point appropriate for the location
      and height of the ―man-made‖ obstacles within 3 NM of planned course centerline. If the
      aircrew does not visually identify the charted ―man-made‖ obstacles within 3 NM of
      planned course centerline by the planned start climb point, the crew will climb to attain
      an altitude of 500 feet above the obstacle. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than
      the current leg altitude, complete the climb prior to the turnpoint. If the altitude for the
      next leg is lower than the current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turnpoint.
      Legs may be divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain
      differential or threats in order to allow flight closer to the terrain. Once the controlling
      obstacle or terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear,
      the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude. NVG modified contour will not be
      flown. WARNING: If either the pilots‘ NVGs, SCNS, pressure altimeter, radar altimeter,
      GPS, or aircraft radar fail, climb to MSA until resolving the problem. In addition, climb
      to MSA to resolve any T.O. 1C-130(x)/(x)-1 Section III procedures, commensurate with
      the tactical situation.
         16.3.1.3.1. Minimum altitude capable training will not descend below NVG en route
         altitude for the leg/segment being flown.
      16.3.1.4. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA in an initial VFR altitude that provides
      additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption
      of low-level operations (route disorientation and equipment malfunctions or when either
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      197


     pilot must leave the seat during low-level operations, etc.). Plan MSA at an indicated
     altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain
     feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest
     depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NM of route centerline to include
     the aircraft turn radius. An MSA will be computed for each leg, route segment, or entire
     low-level route.
     16.3.1.5. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC
     terrain clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low-level structure.
     Planners may compute several ESAs for route segments transiting significant terrain
     differentials, or a single ESA for the entire low-level route. To compute ESA, add 1,000
     feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest obstruction to
     flight within 22 NM either side of the planned route. An ESA will be computed for the
     route and conspicuously annotated on the chart.
     16.3.1.6. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training
     Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be the computed leg MSAs unless a higher
     altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B.
  16.3.2. Airdrops will not be conducted below the following altitudes: WARNING: DZ
  surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction clearance. Planners and aircrews are
  responsible for ensuring clearance through mission planning/chart preparation.
     16.3.2.1. Day VMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum day VMC airdrop altitudes as
     specified in AFI 11-231, visually avoiding high terrain and obstacles in the vicinity of the
     drop zone.
     16.3.2.2. Night VMC Drop Altitude. If not on NVGs fly minimum night VMC run-in
     altitudes, from slowdown through escape, at an indicated altitude of 500-feet above the
     highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
     400-feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
     is higher, within 3 NM of run-in centerline. If on NVGs, fly NVG en route altitude
     through slowdown. After slowdown, when the drop zone is in sight and will remain in
     sight, or when a positive position is identified and adequate terrain clearance is assured,
     the aircraft may descend from run-in altitude to drop altitude specified in AFI 11-231,
     AMT, SPINS, or mission planning sheet.
     16.3.2.3. IMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum IMC drop altitudes at 500 feet above the
     highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
     400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
     is highest, within 3 nautical miles either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point
     to DZ exit point or as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.
         16.3.2.3.1. DZ Entry Point. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft is
         at or past the DZ entry point.
  16.3.3. Night VMC Tactical Approach Altitude. Compute IAW AFTP 3-3.25, Chapter 7.
  16.3.4. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific
  country or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes will not be
  flown:

      16.3.4.6. Below 1000' AGL within a 2000' radius over cities or towns shown as magenta
      shaded areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts.
      16.3.4.7. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically
      designated as prohibited or restricted areas.
      16.3.4.8. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
         16.3.4.8.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
         16.3.4.8.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and
         surveyed for 300-foot AGL operations. NOTE: This restriction does not apply to
         one-time-use routes. Consult FLIP AP/1B for published Military Training Route
         restrictions.
      16.3.4.9. For the airdrop portion of all SKE missions in uncontrolled airspace, the
      mission command unit must comply with appropriate FAA exemptions. Provide a
      NOTAM to the FAA flight service station nearest the objective area at least 48 hours in
      advance of the intended activity, regardless of actual or forecast weather. NOTAM
      information will include:
         16.3.4.9.1. Name of the nearest city or town and state.
         16.3.4.9.2. Date and time period of intended activity.

         expressed in radial and DME from a VORTAC.
  16.3.5. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for
  mission briefings and aircrew reference. Copilot and navigator crewmembers will use
  individual tactical navigation route charts for each mission. Low-level navigation charts will
  be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information in the most recent CHUM or
  supplement. In no case will CHUM coverage be less than 22 NMs either side of the entire
  planned route of flight. Crews may trim charts to no less than 10 NMs after establishing the
  ESA. Color copies, if available, of a master chart reduce the probability of missing or
  misplotted data on aircrew charts.

                                 AIRLAND EMPLOYMENT

17.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for general C-130 airland operations.              It
provides parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.25.
17.2. Passengers on Tactical Flights.
   17.2.1. Passengers are allowed, including Space-A passengers, on any flight, single ship or
   formation that:
       17.2.1.1. Is not air dropping or conducting NVG operations on that sortie. This
       restriction does not apply if specifically tasked in the mission frag, OPORD, or SPINS.
       Passengers receiving orientation flights are also exempt from this restriction.
       17.2.1.2. Meets the provisions of AFMAN 24-204 concerning passengers with hazardous
       cargo.
       17.2.1.3. Is not prohibited by international agreement.
       17.2.1.4. If on a SAAM, the user does not object to Space-A passengers.
   17.2.2. Personnel, i.e., crew chiefs, tasked to support JA/ATT airdrop and/or airland
   operations are allowed on airdrop missions.
   17.2.3. The PIC will report the number of seats available to aerial port/passenger terminal.
   Passengers will be briefed by passenger service personnel and may refuse transportation on
   tactical missions due to potential roughness of the flight at no loss to their order of priority
   for movement.
17.3. ARA. Use the following guidance when planning ARAs:
   17.3.1. Day VMC. Plan a minimum of 300 feet AGL modified contour altitude above the
   terrain using visual references from the IP to a point where the approach begins. If a high
   approach is used, mark a start climb point.
   17.3.2. Night VMC. ARAs will be planned for all night VMC tactical LZ operations IAW
   Chapter 11.
   17.3.3. IMC. Except for contingencies, ARAs conducted in IMC must use approach plates
   published by the Defense Mapping Agency Aeronautical Center (DMAAC) or approved by
   MAJCOM. During contingencies, the MAJCOM A3/DO/XO, or DIRMOBFOR may
   approve IMC ARA approach plates. Units must comply with any restriction in FLIP or the
   host nation agreement, and receive written approval from ATC and airspace management
   authority.
17.4. Tactical Arrivals.
   17.4.1. Low Altitude Arrivals.               See AFTTP 3-3.25 for discussion of
   advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival. These maneuvers may be
   flown on continuation training and operational missions with passengers aboard. In all cases
   plan to roll out on final at approach speed no lower than 300 ft AGL.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       201


   17.4.2. High Altitude Arrivals.              See AFTTP 3-3.25 for discussion of
   advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival. These maneuvers may be
   flown on continuation training and operational missions with passengers aboard. In all cases
   plan to roll out on final at approach speed no lower than 300 ft AGL.
17.5. Engine Running On-load and Off-load (ERO) Procedures. Use ERO procedures when
necessary to expedite aircraft or cargo movement, meet time requirements of unit moves, joint
training exercises, and contingencies or enhance crew duty day. The PIC is responsible for prior
coordination with TACC or the controlling agency for early takeoffs. With the exception of
small arms ammunition (Hazardous Class/Division 1.4), do not use ERO procedures when
explosive cargo is involved unless authorized in the JA/ATT, exercise operation or contingency
air tasking order. ERO procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. Material
handling equipment should be used if palletized cargo is to be on-loaded or off-loaded. PICs
must assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe operations.
WARNING: Do not on-load or off-load through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and door
at the same time. Paratroop doors will not normally be used.
NOTE: A ramp support/milk stool will be installed when on/offloading pallets weighing more
than 2,000 pounds.
NOTE: At their discretion, PICs may ERO any category of passenger. The number of
passengers and amount of baggage to be on-loaded or off-loaded should be taken into
consideration. The well being of the passengers should be considered at all times.
   17.5.1. General Procedures.
       17.5.1.1. PICs will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation.
       17.5.1.2. The parking brake will be set and at least one pilot in the seat will monitor
       brakes, interphone, and radio.
       17.5.1.3. Use wing leading edge and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the situation
       dictates.
       17.5.1.4. Station another crew member on interphone or public address (PA) in the cargo
       compartment as safety observer. Safety observers will remain forward of all cargo.
   17.5.2. Offload Preparation/Procedures. Aerial delivery support (ADS) arms may be
   disconnected during descent checklist. Prior to landing, the loadmaster will brief all
   personnel in the cargo compartment regarding their locations, duties, and responsibilities
   during the ERO.
       17.5.2.1. Brief drivers on the following items:
           17.5.2.1.1. Exact offload procedures and applicable signals to be followed.
           17.5.2.1.2. When cleared by the loadmaster, to assume their position. Actuate brake
           pedal sufficiently to ensure brakes are operational. Vehicles requiring a build-up of
           air pressure to provide brake pressure must delay pressure build-up until engine start.
           17.5.2.1.3. The loadmaster will direct vehicle engines to be started when the aircraft
           comes to a complete stop and the cargo ramp and door are open.
202                                        AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


         17.5.2.1.4. Vehicle parking brakes will not be released until all restraint is removed
         and cleared by the loadmaster.
         17.5.2.1.5. Vehicles will proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least 50 feet before
         turning and/or 300 feet before stopping.
      17.5.2.2. Brief troops on the following items:
         17.5.2.2.1. Secure baggage aboard vehicles, if applicable.
         17.5.2.2.2. Deplane when directed by the loadmaster.
         17.5.2.2.3. Proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least 50 feet before turning and/or
         300 feet before stopping.
  17.5.3. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all tiedowns
  except one forward and one aft restraint, open the aft cargo door, and lower the ramp to
  approximately 12 inches above horizontal. WARNING: If a combat offload of pallets is to
  be accomplished before offloading vehicles, do not remove any vehicle restraint until after
  the combat offload is complete.
  17.5.4. After clearance from the pilot, the loadmaster lowers the ramp, and clears off headset
  to direct on-load or off-load operations.
      17.5.4.1. The loadmaster will direct all on-load and off-load operations using pre-briefed
      signals. Other qualified loadmasters (CRG, CRG, aerial port) may perform these duties;
      however, the aircraft loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
  17.5.5. Personnel on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
      17.5.5.1. Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember or qualified CRG, CRG, aerial
      port, or airfield control (e.g. STT) personnel when enplaning or deplaning through the aft
      door and ramp.
      17.5.5.2. Auxiliary ground loading ramps should be used.
      17.5.5.3. Unless cargo size and location dictate otherwise, deplane passengers before
      cargo, and enplane after cargo.
  17.5.6. Personnel on-load and off-load through the crew entrance door:
      17.5.6.1. Station a crewmember (normally the loadmaster) on interphone with cord held
      taut at approximately 20-feet at an angle of 45-degrees from the aircraft axis.
      17.5.6.2. Brief deplaning personnel to secure loose articles and remain forward of the
      interphone cord.
      17.5.6.3. No enplaning personnel should approach the airplane until the loadmaster is in
      place. NOTE: If downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD365-4 is not required for the
      subsequent sortie.
  17.5.7. Upload Preparation/Procedures. Review the passenger and cargo manifests, crew
  lists, and complete DD365-4 for the subsequent sortie.
      17.5.7.1. Loadmasters may use the load plan total weight and load center of balance
      (CB) for entry on the DD365-4 provided these procedures are followed:
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         203


           17.5.7.1.1. The load plan data must be checked and validated by a qualified load plan
           validator i.e., aircraft loadmaster, aerial port specialist, or any individual who has
           completed the AMC Affiliation Program Airlift Planners Course.
           17.5.7.1.2. The load plan validator will legibly sign the signature block on the load
           plan with name, rank, and organization.
           17.5.7.1.3. The load must be placed on the aircraft exactly according to the load plan.
           17.5.7.1.4. Prior to flight, if there is any doubt by loadmasters on the accuracy of the
           load plan weight or CB, then the loadmaster must accomplish the DD365-4 by station
           loading each individual item.
   17.5.8. After completion of on-load or off-load, secure the ground loading ramp(s) in the
   installed position (if mission dictates), in the cargo compartment, or stow them in the aft
   cargo door.
   17.5.9. AE Engines Running On-loads. For AE missions requiring engine running on-
   loads/off-loads, see Chapter 20.
   17.5.10. Resume taxi after coordination with the loadmaster. CAUTION: Ramp should be
   raised to approximately 12-inches above the horizontal position prior to taxi.
17.6. Combat Off-load Procedures. The controlling C2 commander, MAJCOM A3/DO/XO or
the commander, or DIRMOBFOR may authorize combat offload when conditions warrant. The
method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based on the conditions at the
offload site. Unit OG/CC may approve unilateral combat offload training.
   17.6.1. Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be offloaded without
   damage to the aircraft with the cargo ramp in the horizontal position. Use the following
   methods for combat offload operations.
       17.6.1.1. Method ―A.‖ Use this method to offload single, multiple, ramp or married
       pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers. Pallets, platforms, or CDS may be
       offloaded in a train like fashion or one-by-one as the situation dictates. Fragile items that
       might be damaged by combat offload will not be offloaded using this method without
       user concurrence.
WARNING: Many explosive items have specific ―drop‖ criteria that, if exceeded, render the
item useless or dangerous to the user. With the exception of small arms ammunition (hazard
class and division 1.4), explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval
of MAJCOM/A3/DO.
EXCEPTION: Explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without
MAJCOM/DO approval.
CAUTION: A taxiway or ramp at least 500 feet long is required, however, 1,000 feet is desired
to provide a margin of safety. When pallets, platforms, or containers are offloaded one at a time,
use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded.
NOTE: Combat offload of fragile and sensitive cargo items (i.e., computers) that might be
damaged by standard method ―A‖ combat offload procedures will not be attempted without user
concurrence. If the nature of the mission dictates that cargo must be offloaded, aircrews may
lower the ramp to approximately 18 inches above the ground.
 204                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


          17.6.1.1.1. Double or triple married pallets may be offloaded, without ballast, using
          this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds, and the height of
          the pallets fall within cargo height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or
          section V of the cargo loading manual.
          17.6.1.1.2. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 feet in length may be offloaded,
          without ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000
          pounds. NOTE: Married pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 pounds
          may be offloaded using this method, provided ballast or cargo equal to the difference
          between 12,000 pounds and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be offloaded)
          remains in C through F compartments during offload. Example: A 17,000 pound
          married pallet or airdrop platform requires 5,000 pounds of ballast or cargo to remain
          in C through F compartments during the offload.
          17.6.1.1.3. CDS bundles may be combat offloaded using this method. The static line
          retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the
          retriever is inoperative. With the Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR), offload must
          be accomplished one side at a time if the total bundle weight exceeds 12,000 pounds.
          Non-CVR double stick bundles will be offloaded in groups of even numbers, each
          group less than 12,000 pounds total weight. Non-CVR single stick may be offloaded
          if the total weight is less than 12,000 pounds. Without the CVR, if the total weight of
          the bundles exceeds 12,000 pounds bundles should be restrained in groups of four or
          less and offloaded one group at a time. For the unplanned combat offload of non-
          CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described above. Perform an initial offload via
          the static line retriever, and on sequential offload remove aft restraint before clearing
          the pilot to taxi. Consider the slope of the offload site which may cause bundles to
          roll aft upon removal of restraint. CAUTION: When using method ―A‖ on
          excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle-damaged surfaces, damage to the
          aircraft ramp may occur. Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will reduce
          aircraft oscillation. The PIC must determine if the offload area will permit the
          offload operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft or equipment.
       17.6.1.2. Method ―B.‖ Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the
       category for method ―A‖ or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing
       between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds. Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each
       pallet to be offloaded. The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type of
       offload must be available at the offload site or must accompany the load when conditions
       at the offload site are unknown.
WARNING: The maximum weight for pallets to be off-loaded across the ramp at any one time
when using method ―B‖ is 15,000 pounds for C-130E, and H aircraft.
WARNING: Do not use method ―B‖ for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the
platform under the vertical restraint rails.
   17.6.2. Aircrew Procedures:
       17.6.2.1. Prior to commencing combat offload operations, the pilot will brief each
       crewmember on the method to be used. Specific procedures are in the expanded
       checklist. The pilot will coordinate tasks.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        205


       17.6.2.2. All crewmembers participating in the offload will refer to the checklist. Report
       any problem to the pilot immediately.
       17.6.2.3. If other individuals must be aboard to assist the crew in an unusual
       circumstance, give them a thorough safety and procedures briefing for the entire offload
       sequence.
       17.6.2.4. A safety observer will take position at the bottom of the flight deck steps on
       interphone and PA and transmit warnings through all speakers of the PA system to help
       the loadmaster enforce all safety precautions.
       17.6.2.5. The loadmaster will maintain constant interphone contact with the PIC and is
       the only crewmember authorized to operate the dual rail locks during combat offload
       operations.
WARNING: During the entire offload operation, no one is permitted behind or beside the load
unless the loadmaster checks that all rail locks are locked and engaged in the pallet detents or
secures‘ each pallet to aircraft tiedown rings to ensure positive aft restraint.
WARNING: Always maintain forward restraint with the right-hand locks.
17.7. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. The following procedures will apply to ensure a safe,
efficient loading method for the emergency airlift of personnel from areas faced with enemy
siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian reasons, or when directed by the C2 agency having
operational control. See Chapter 20 for emergency airlift of litter patients.
   17.7.1. Emergency airlift normally will be accomplished without the use of individual seats
   or safety belts. The number of personnel seated on the cargo compartment floor will vary
   depending on individual size. Personnel may be loaded in groups of 12 to 16 (depending on
   size) to control loading operations. Ambulatory combat floor loading will not be performed
   on non-combat missions.
   17.7.2. General Procedures:
       17.7.2.1. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for
       seating.
       17.7.2.2. When available, a pallet subfloor may be installed.
       17.7.2.3. When a pallet subfloor is installed, or when the intermediate rollers are
       removed from the aircraft, use the rail rings for attaching the tiedown strap used for
       forward restraint and body stability.
       17.7.2.4. When a pallet subfloor is not used, consider removing the intermediate rollers
       from the aircraft, mission conditions permitting.
       17.7.2.5. When the intermediate rollers are not removed from the aircraft, secure them
       on the outboard rails.
       17.7.2.6. Seat troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients facing forward.
       17.7.2.7. Attach a tiedown strap for each row of personnel to provide forward restraint
       and body stability.
 206                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       17.7.2.8. When the intermediate rails are stacked on top of the outboard rails, use floor
       rings for attaching the straps. In this situation, the available seating space is decreased,
       and the number of passengers must be decreased.
       17.7.2.9. Secure baggage on the cargo ramp/floor. Excess baggage and cargo secured on
       the cargo ramp/floor will decrease the number of troops, passengers, and patients
       proportionately.
   17.7.3. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL250.
17.8. NVG Airland. NOTE: ALZ lighting patterns will be IAW AFI 13-217. AMP 4 (blacked
out runways) are not authorized. The PIC must ensure TOLD data reflects the possibility for a
landing at the end of the zone (subtract landing/safety zone distances from runway available to
ensure adequate runway exists for rollout).
   17.8.1. NVG Approaches and Landings. The navigator will program a backup ARA
   approach in SCNS and configure the radar to monitor the approach course to assist the pilot
   in LZ acquisition, approach, and landing.
   17.8.1.1. Checklist Procedures. Normal T. O. checklists will be used.
       17.8.1.2. NVG Max Effort Operations. NVG max effort operations are approved for
       crews trained and certified.
       17.8.1.3. NVG Formation Departures/Arrivals.            All crewmembers (minus the
       loadmasters) must be NVG airland certified or under the direct supervision of an
       instructor before performing NVG formation departures/arrivals.            The mission
       commander will thoroughly brief NVG formation departures/arrivals to include
       emergency procedures, abort calls, light discipline, runway markings, etc.
       17.8.1.4. Crew Coordination. Coordinated actions during the final segment of an NVG
       approach and landing are critical.
          17.8.1.4.1. Navigator Duties. In addition to backing up the pilots with the radar,
          while on final the navigator should call altitude alerts every 100' (or as requested by
          the pilot) and is required to call when descending through 100', 50', 25', and 10'. On
          departure the navigator will call out passing 50', 100', 200', 300' and 400' AGL, and
          will ensure terrain clearance with the radar.
          17.8.1.4.2. Copilot Duties. Beginning at 300' AGL, copilots will verbalize airspeed
          and rate of descent (―107, down 6‖ indicates 107 KIAS and a minus 600 VVI).
          Copilots should also call out when passing 60 KIAS on landing roll.
          17.8.1.4.3. Engineer Duties. The engineer‘s primary job is to monitor engine
          instruments and ensure checklist completion. The pilot should brief the engineer of
          any additional crew coordination requirements.
       17.8.1.5. Tactical VFR Approaches. While VFR approaches afford flexibility in axis of
       approach, they demand thorough preflight planning and coordinated aircrew actions. The
       PIC will consider all mission aspects, including individual crewmember
       proficiency/qualifications when selecting an appropriate tactical VFR approach. For
       tactical VFR approaches, bank angle will not exceed 45 degrees and the aircraft will not
       descend below 500' AGL until intercepting a normal glide path approaching the final
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     207


     approach course and in a safe position to land. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone
     should state ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ‖. The next pilot to acquire the zone should
     announce ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at (state clock position)‖.
     17.8.1.6. IMC Approaches. IMC approaches may be flown by either pilot. The pilot
     flying may execute the instrument approach with NVGs down but shall not use NVGs
     during the instrument portion (pilot flying will have to ―look under‖ the NVGs for
     instrument crosscheck). The transfer of aircraft control for the landing will be no lower
     than 300' AGL. Altitude advisories shall be in accordance with earlier chapters of this
     regulation. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone should state ―Pilot/Copilot has the
     LZ‖. The next pilot to acquire the zone should announce ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at
     (state clock position)‖.
  17.8.2. Ground Operations.
     17.8.2.1. ERO. It is recommended that LMs use NVGs to maintain situational
     awareness. Blacked out operations are prohibited.
     17.8.2.2. Taxi/backing. Pilots may taxi using NVGs on airfields without lights (blacked
     out) or equipped with overt or covert lights. If taxiing or accomplishing ground ops on
     blacked out taxiways/runways/ramps, the PIC will ensure aircraft or environmental
     lighting provides for clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edge. Comply with all taxi
     restrictions in Chapter 5 and the GDSS/GDSS2(when available)/ASRR. The LM may
     provide the pilot with directions to taxi the aircraft while using NVGs. WARNING: If
     ever in doubt as to obstruction clearance, stop the aircraft, obtain additional wing
     walkers/marshallers and/or deplane crewmembers to act as wing walkers.
     17.8.2.3. Combat Offloads. Crews may accomplish Combat Offloads on NVGs
     provided aircraft or airfield lighting permit clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp
     edges.

                                           Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. The standard formation building block is a two-ship element. Techniques to fly
C-130 formation are outlined in AFTTP 3-3.25. Formation procedures will be conducted in
accordance with this chapter and the airdrop technical order. Consider safety, aircrew capability,
proficiency, survivability and user needs when planning any formation tactic.
18.2. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and mission
times based on ATO, fragmentation order, and staff input, fuel requirements,
parachutist/passenger comfort, taxi distances, briefing requirements, etc.
18.3. Weather Minimums.
   18.3.1. Formation takeoff and landing minimums are the minimums for the airport
   navigation aid used, but not lower than 200 feet and one-mile visibility (RVR 50). During
   IFR formation operations, adhere to both ceiling and visibility minimums. If departure
   ceiling or visibility is below published landing minimums, but above 200 feet and one-mile
   visibility (RVR 50), the formation may take off if the requirements for a departure alternate
   as prescribed in Chapter 6, are met. If the runway has dual RVR readouts (approach and
   departure end of the runway) both ends must be at least RVR 50.
       18.3.1.1. Weather minimums for NVG formation departures are 300/1 or approach
       minimums (whichever is higher).
18.4. Ground Operations.
   18.4.1. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length with four engines operating and two
   aircraft lengths with two engines operating. Formation lead may increase taxi intervals if
   circumstances dictate.
18.5. Takeoff.
   18.5.1. The minimum takeoff interval between aircraft is 15-seconds.
   18.5.2. For aborts during takeoff, the navigator immediately transmits an abort call (three
   times using formation position number) on interplane and the copilot on primary frequency.
   Clear the runway as quickly as safety allows. Succeeding aircraft not on takeoff roll will
   hold until the runway is clear.
NOTE: For aircraft without ―hot mike‖ capability on primary radio, the navigator transmits the
abort call on primary, and the copilot (or navigator if the copilot is occupied with emergency
procedures) transmits on interplane.
NOTE: Consider not using Have Quick or secure radio for interplane during takeoff.
   18.5.3. Do not advance power above flight idle until takeoff roll is started.
18.6. Altimeter Setting. Formation leaders will ensure all aircraft use the same altimeter
setting.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       209


18.7. Formations.
   18.7.1. Formations will normally consist of 2-ship elements. During mission planning,
   mission commanders will choose a formation geometry appropriate to the mission and
   tactical situation. At no time will aircraft be operated within 500 feet of another aircraft.
   18.7.2. Airspeed Changes. Lead will announce airspeed changes of 15-knots or greater at
   night.
   18.7.3. Inadvertent weather penetration procedures will be briefed to the formation. At a
   minimum, formation lead will direct the formation to a safe altitude, heading, airspeed, and
   aircraft spacing. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.25 for inadvertent weather penetration procedures.
18.8. Visual Geometries.
   18.8.1. Basic visual spacing will be 2000-6000 feet between aircraft in an element and 8000
   feet between element leads. SKE must be operational for night, unaided visual formations or
   the formation is restricted to 2000 feet in-trail. The optimal formation composition and
   geometry will depend on mission requirement, theater restrictions, terrain, and the tactical
   situation.
      18.8.1.1. Flight leads will brief visual formation contracts.
   18.8.2. Visual Geometries that may be flown are:
      18.8.2.1. In-Trail.
      18.8.2.2. Wedge.
      18.8.2.3. Fluid Trail.
      18.8.2.4. Line Abreast.
      18.8.2.5. Modified ―V‖.
   18.8.3. Night Geometries. Crews may fly visual in trail, fluid trail, and tactical formation
   maneuvering (TFM) during night NVG formation tactical missions. To fly night TFM, use
   the following guidance:
      18.8.3.1. NVGs will be used.
      18.8.3.2. Formation contracts and verbal signals will be pre-briefed.
      18.8.3.3. SKE must be operational.
      18.8.3.4. Due to aircraft limitations, use line abreast NVG formation only when required
      by the tactical situation.
      18.8.3.5. Shackles, cross turns, and half cross turns should be limited to times when
      necessary for formation maneuvering. Verbal signals must be used. Normally, shackle,
      cross turn, and half cross turn training should be conducted during day VMC.
      WARNING: When flying at night, rapid changes in airspeed, altitude, bank angles, ―G‖
      loads and aircraft position necessitated by the performance of these maneuvers increase
      the potential for spatial disorientation.
      18.8.3.6. The MC will brief lighting procedures (if the wingman calls ―blind‖, etc.).
      18.8.3.7. Fly 2-ship elements.
 210                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       18.8.3.8. Wingmen should avoid flying the line right/left positions for extended periods
       of time.
       18.8.3.9. Fluid trail spacing will be no closer than 2000' between aircraft.
   18.8.4. NVG Threat Reactions for Training. NVGs are required for night threat reactions.
   Crews must exercise vigilance to ensure the aircraft remains within the NVG en-route
   altitude corridor or climb to MSA while conducting threat reactions. NOTE: Any
   crewmember will call ―Terminate‖ if they observe the aircraft being flown outside the above
   parameters.
18.9. Visual Rejoins.
   18.9.1. Rejoining aircraft will maintain 500 feet above or below the formation until the
   formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.
   18.9.2. Rejoining aircraft must be in position at formation altitude by ―green light‖ to
   accomplish the drop.
18.10. Tactical Formation Maneuver Restrictions.
   18.10.1. Day VMC: No restriction.
   18.10.2. Night VMC: Must be accomplished on NVGs.
18.11. Visual Slowdown Procedures.
   18.11.1. Unless tactically unsound, night slowdowns will include an aural or visual signal.
18.12. Visual Airdrop Procedures.
   18.12.1. Minimum spacing for CDS airdrops is 6,000 feet between aircraft. WARNING:
   Attempting to regain position by only reducing power or airspeed places the aircraft in a nose
   high, low-power situation and may lead to a stall.
18.13. Visual Recovery. Lead determines the type of visual recovery based upon formation
geometry, threat scenario, traffic pattern, traffic flow, etc. Attain traffic pattern altitude and
airspeed before arriving at the recovery field.
   18.13.1. Downwind Recovery.
       18.13.1.1. Roll out on final at no less than 300 feet AGL. Aircraft will not descend
       below preceding aircraft during the recovery.
   18.13.2. Overhead Recovery.
       18.13.2.1. Roll out on final at no less than 300 feet AGL. Aircraft will not descend
       below preceding aircraft during the recovery.
18.14. Landing. The desired landing interval is 20 seconds, minimum 15 seconds.
WARNING: Do not perform touch-and-go landings during formation recoveries.
18.15. SKE Procedures.
   18.15.1. Use the pressure altimeter and GSI to monitor altitude during climb or descent The
   formation lead announces the altitude passing each 2,000 feet (including departure and
   recovery). All aircraft report reaching assigned altitude in sequence to the formation leader.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       211


   Formation lead will not report the formation level to ATC until all aircraft have reported
   level at the assigned altitude.
   18.15.2. Priority of FCI signals are: altitude, heading and airspeed.
   18.15.3. Unless otherwise briefed, spacing between aircraft will be 4000 feet and spacing
   between element leads will be 8000 feet. Minimum SKE spacing is 4000 feet between
   aircraft.
   18.15.4. Lead will signal turns of 10 degrees or more and airspeed changes of 10 KIAS or
   more.
   18.15.5. Element leads will not exceed 20 degrees of bank.
18.16. Loss of SKE-Individual Aircraft. Notify lead in all cases.
   18.16.1. VMC.
       18.16.1.1. If only the DVST/PPI is inoperative aircraft may elect to maintain position
       with lead‘s concurrence. The route, drop, and recovery may be flown. NOTE: Consider
       using air-to-air TACAN or radar to maintain spacing.
   18.16.2. IMC.
       18.16.2.1. Loss of all SKE indications will require a breakout.        Use the following
       procedure if an alternate plan was not briefed:
       18.16.2.2. If the formation is in straight and level flight climb 500 feet, turn 30 degrees
       in the safest direction from the base heading for 30 seconds, and then return to base
       heading. If the formation is in a turn roll out and climb 500 feet. Lead will contact (or
       direct contact to) ATC for a separate clearance. CAUTION: Performing the above
       maneuvers in a radar pattern may place an aircraft outside of protected airspace.
18.17. SKE Rejoins.
   18.17.1. Set leader number as required to the formation according to lead‘s direction and
   enable all formation slot numbers.
   18.17.2. Set ―range‖ X 1,000 feet‖ switch at maximum range.
   18.17.3. Approach the formation from 1,000 feet above or below the formation.
   18.17.4. Establish radio contact with the formation.           Confirm SKE frequency and
   appropriate leader‘s slot number.
   18.17.5. When the formation appears on the plan position indicator (PPI)/Direct View
   Storage Tube (DVST), check that the master lost indications have been extinguished.
   18.17.6. The rejoining aircraft will identify the appropriate element leader. Upon positive
   identification, lead completes an FCI check prior to the rejoin.
   18.17.7. Join in position while maintaining 1,000 feet altitude separation. When stabilized
   in position and the last formation aircraft is positively identified, request rejoin clearance
   from lead and climb or descend to formation altitude.
   18.17.8. The rejoining aircraft must be stabilized in position at formation altitude by the IP
   (IMC) or by one-minute prior to the TOT (VMC) to accomplish the drop.
 212                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


18.18. SKE Airdrop Procedures.
   18.18.1. All aircraft will use formation lead‘s drift to determine SKE crosstrack. Formation
   aircraft must ensure they use the same ballistic wind for identical SCNS programming. After
   level at drop altitude, formation lead will pass back revised drift and ballistic winds if
   different. NOTE: Flight leaders will maintain position with reference to formation lead until
   reaching drop altitude at which time they fly an independent approach through the escape.
   18.18.2. Slowdown. The entire formation will slowdown simultaneously. Lead signals 30
   seconds prior to slowdown with the SKE ―SD‖ button. Lead transmits a 5-second ―-‖ prep.
   Lead initiates slowdown with the FCI ―E‖ and a radio call (tactical situation permitting).
   After slowdown, element leads will not exceed 10 degrees of bank.
       18.18.2.1. Descending Slowdown. Upon reaching 140 KIAS, the formation may
       descend to drop altitude. Start descent using 140 KIAS and 1,000 feet per minute until
       reaching drop altitude. Do not initiate descent until the following conditions are met:
           18.18.2.1.1. Lead position is positively identified.
           18.18.2.1.2. The entire formation is within 3 NMs of DZ run-in course centerline.
           18.18.2.1.3. The last aircraft in the formation is at or past the DZ entry point (or the
           last aircraft in the flight or element if using the waterfall descent procedures.).
   18.18.3. Each element stacks 50-feet above the preceding element‘s drop altitude. Wingmen
   maintain the same drop altitude as their element leaders by reference to the pressure
   altimeter. For large formations, i.e. 8 or more aircraft, flights will stack 50-feet above the
   preceeding flight‘s drop altitude.
WARNING: Analyze pre-drop gross weight to determine if obstructions can be cleared with one
engine inoperative. If obstruction clearance cannot be met adjust the number of aircraft, reduce
aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape course, or increase drop altitude.
NOTE: Do not attempt AWADS/SKE airdrops in areas of thunderstorm activity, heavy
precipitation, or during icing conditions.
   18.18.4. Non-AWADS element leads must validate aircraft SCNS accuracy via either visual
   ground references or SKE crosstrack not earlier than the one minute advisory and not later
   than the 5 second advisory.
18.19. SKE Formation Landing.
   18.19.1. The interval between aircraft for landing is 6,000 feet desired, 5,000 feet minimum.

                                           Chapter 19

                                           AIRDROP

19.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for C-130 airdrop operations.          It provides
parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.25.
   19.1.1. Airdrop above 3000 feet AGL. Equipment and CDS drops performed above 3000
   AGL will be made using one of the following methods: AWADS, Ground Radar Aerial
   Delivery System (GRADS), or a radar beacon airdrop. A SKE wingman may execute a SKE
   timing drop provided the leader navigates to the release point by AWADS, GRADS, or a
   radar beacon.
19.2. Identification of Airdrop Items. It may be necessary to identify items that are not
dropped or land off the DZ in unsecured areas.
   19.2.1. Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering system:
      19.2.1.1. Class I - Subsistence.
      19.2.1.2. Class II - Individual equipment.
      19.2.1.3. Class III - POL.
      19.2.1.4. Class IV - Construction materials.
      19.2.1.5. Class V - Ammunition (include the type):
          19.2.1.5.1. Type ―A‖ - Small arms.
          19.2.1.5.2. Type ―B‖ - Mortars.
          19.2.1.5.3. Type ―C‖ - Artillery.
      19.2.1.6. Class VI - Personal demand items.
      19.2.1.7. Class VII - Major end items (vehicles, howitzers, etc.).
      19.2.1.8. Class VIII - Medical supplies.
      19.2.1.9. Class IX - Repair parts.
      19.2.1.10. Class X - Non-military programs (i.e. agricultural supplies).
   19.2.2. Airdrop loads may also be identified by the following internationally recognized
   color coding system for combined operations:
      19.2.2.1. Red - Ammunition and weapons.
      19.2.2.2. Blue - Fuel and lubricants.
      19.2.2.3. Green - Rations and water.
      19.2.2.4. Yellow - Communications equipment.
      19.2.2.5. White (or Red Cross on white background) - Medical supplies.
      19.2.2.6. Black and white stripes - Mail.
 214                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


19.3. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will carry enough equipment in the airdrop kit to satisfy
load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of airdrop kits will include cloth-backed
pressure sensitive tape, masking tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80 pound
cotton webbing, one carabiner (NSN 4240-01295-4305 or equivalent carabiner with a locking
mechanism), and two small G-14 clevises.
19.4. Joint Air Drop Inspection.
     19.4.1. The loadmaster will complete the applicable DD Form 1748, Joint Air Drop
     Inspection Records, before takeoff (see AFJI 13-210 for specifics) and verify the accuracy
     of cargo and troop documentation. NOTE: Reject loads with inaccurate or unavailable
     weights, or loads hazardous to flight. Equipment not rigged per 13C-series technical orders
     or Joint Special Operations Command 350 series manuals, requires a waiver from the
     appropriate MAJCOM tactics agency/division.
     19.4.2. If loads to be airdropped (and loads to be airlanded) are carried at the same time, see
     the restrictions listed in Table 19.1. These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads
     from interfering with airdrop rigging equipment.

NOTES:
1. Personnel airdrops may be performed with only one troop door configured for airdrop with
user concurrence.
2. Will not exceed 80 ―within 12‖ either side of retriever cable. Height of cargo outside of the
12" left and right (total 24") may exceed the 80" height limitation, but will not interfere with
overhead rigging equipment.
3. CDS and heavy equipment configuration. A maximum of three rows of canvas seats may be
used. The remaining vacant row serves as a safety aisle. All sidewall seats will be raised or
stowed in the wheel-well area when airland pallets and vehicles are located within this area and
exceed 96" width.
19.5. Verification of Load Information. The navigator will verify the actual number and type
of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of loads in the aircraft agree
with planned CARP data. If an individual load has a different type or number of parachutes from
other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will land on the DZ. Base drop
altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude.
19.6. Marking Airdrop Loads. For training missions (e.g. unilateral, exercise, or JA/ATT) the
navigator will mark all equipment and standard airdrop training bundles with the aircraft call
sign and date. If more than one load is dropped on the same pass, mark loads with order of exit
from aircraft. Markings will be placed on the extracted end of the load, and also between the
extraction parachute and attachment to the floor. EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS bundle is
dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container out.
19.7. DZ Markings. Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217.
19.8. Safety Equipment.
     19.8.1. Personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during low-level phases
     will wear protective headgear from the combat entry point to the combat exit point if an
     actual threat is briefed. EXCEPTION: Personnel performing water jumps. All other
     personnel will be seated with the seat belt fastened. Check helmet boom mike during
     preflight. Loadmasters will lower their helmet visor (except when NVGs are used) before
     opening any doors and keep them lowered until doors are closed. As a minimum, the helmet
 216                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   will be worn from the start of the pre-slowdown checklist until the completion of the drop
   checklist. Loadmasters will be on interphone from completion of pre-slowdown checks until
   completion of the drop checklist. EXCEPTION: For heavy equipment airdrop, both
   loadmasters will be on interphone prior to retracting the left rail locks in case of a loose
   platform.
   19.8.2. During airdrops, loadmasters will wear either a restraint harness, or a parachute, from
   the pre-slowdown checklist until doors are closed and locked.
WARNING: During the aircrew briefing, the PIC will brief the loadmaster(s) when the mission
profile requires flight below 800 feet AGL with the door(s) open.
NOTE: Loadmasters must wear a restraint harness when performing duties near an open exit
above 14,000 feet MSL or below 800 feet AGL.
   19.8.3. When used, fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline before flight as follows:
       19.8.3.1. Troop door personnel drops. Connect the hook to tiedown ring 26D and adjust
       the lifeline to allow mobility only to the troop door for installation of the paratroop
       retrieval strap/bar and to accomplish other emergency procedures. When dropping with
       CVR sections 2 and 3 installed, connect the hook to the CVR tiedown ring located near
       tiedown ring 25D.
       19.8.3.2. Troop door SATB drops. Connect the lifeline as described in paragraph
       19.8.3.1 or to a floor/dual rail tiedown ring at FS 657 and adjust to allow mobility only to
       the troop door being used.
       19.8.3.3. Ramp and door operations. Connect the hook to a floor/dual rail tiedown ring
       at FS 677 and adjust the life-line to allow mobility to FS 835. WARNING: Except for an
       actual contingency, towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the survivability of the
       aircraft and crew, the restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point
       that would allow the loadmaster to fall outside the aircraft.
   19.8.4. Loadmasters will wear a life preserver unit (LPU) for operations over bodies of water
   when doors are open and a parachute is worn instead of a restraint harness.
   19.8.5. During an airdrop, occupants in the cargo compartment will either have a seat belt
   fastened, wear a restraint harness, or wear a parachute before doors are opened.
   EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempt from wearing a parachute or restraint
   harness while conducting flight evaluations provided they do not go aft of FS 677. For static
   line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before doors are opened. EXCEPTION:
   Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes (racetracks) may stand and hook up with doors open if
   they are forward of the aft edge of the wheel wells (FS 617.) NOTE: Do not use flight deck
   restraint harness for airdrops.
   19.8.6. Two additional parachutes, not including those required for aircrew, will be aboard
   the aircraft for training missions performing personnel airdrops. These parachutes will be
   available for Army safety personnel use. User safety personnel will provide their own
   parachutes for contingency missions.
19.9. Secure En Route Communications Package (SECOMP). Use of SECOMP will cease
at the discretion of the PIC if it interferes with either aircraft equipment or an aircraft emergency
condition.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       217


19.10. Airdrop Weather Minimums and Wind Restrictions. Comply with published AFI 11-
202V3 and FLIP VFR weather minimums for visual airdrops. For non-CONUS VFR airdrops,
comply with host nation VFR criteria if more restrictive than AFI 11-202V3. Comply with AFI
13-217 for minimum DZ weather/wind restrictions.
19.11. Tactical Checklists. Tactical checklists found in the applicable T.O. 1C-130xx-1 will be
used.
   19.11.1. During the PIC‘s crew briefing, the pilot, navigator, and loadmaster will coordinate
   appropriate times or geographical location for execution of all tactical checklists. The time
   required by the loadmaster will determine when checklists must be accomplished en route.
   Complete all items of the preceding checklist before beginning the next checklist. The
   combat entry checklist will be accomplished prior to entering the tactical or threat
   environment or when deemed necessary by the PIC. NOTE: Avoid use of the word ―green‖
   or ―light‖ from the slowdown checklist until arriving at the release point. ―Green light‖ must
   be seen and heard by the loadmaster for all drops prior to releasing the load.
   19.11.2. The ―twenty minute‖, ―ten minute‖, ―one minute‖, and ―five second‖ advisories are
   required for all personnel airdrops. Only the ―one minute‖ and ―five second‖ advisories are
   required for equipment and CDS airdrops.
   19.11.3. The navigator will give accurate time advisories regardless of the tactical checklist
   in progress. Advisories are based on planned TOT up to slowdown. After this point, all
   advisories are based on green light time from the DZ.
NOTE: During personnel airdrops, the aircraft must be at or above drop altitude and stable not
later than one minute out (two minutes out for jumpmaster directed drops) to allow the
jumpmaster access to the paratroop door.
NOTE: The loadmaster will notify the PIC when an emergency condition exists in the cargo
compartment, complete the required emergency checklist and report completion of the
malfunction checklist or status. Normal tactical checklists are resumed if possible. If not
possible, proceed with the completion of drop checklist.
19.12. Airdrop Altitudes and Airspeeds. See AFI 11-231 for specific airdrop altitudes and
airspeeds. The aircraft must be level at drop altitude and on drop airspeed by green light time.
Slowdown during personnel drops should be planned to allow jumpmaster access to paratroop
doors NLT 1-minute before TOT (2-minutes for jumpmaster directed drops).
19.13. No Drop Decisions. WARNING: Should the crew believe the drop will occur outside of
safe parameters, they will call ―no drop‖ and ensure the red light is illuminated.
   19.13.1. Before the ―one minute advisory‖ call, any crew member observing a condition that
   could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the PIC. After the one minute advisory any crew
   member observing a condition that could jeopardize a safe drop will transmit a ―no drop‖ call
   on interphone. The PM and loadmaster will acknowledge the no-drop call.
   19.13.2. In IMC, a ―no drop‖ will be signaled via the FCI and over interplane, if tactically
   sound. NOTE: Checklist may still be in progress after the ―one minute advisory‖. A no-drop
   will be called if the slowdown checklist is not complete prior to the ―five-second‖ call.
19.14. Drop Zone Communications. See AFI 13-217 and AFTTP 3-3.25 for DZ
communication procedures.

19.15. Methods of Aerial Delivery. The following are approved methods of aerial delivery:
   19.15.1. Visual Airdrops.
   19.15.2. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). NOTE: The user assumes responsibility
   for airdrop accuracy during GMRS drops.
   19.15.3. Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS).         NOTE: The ground party accepts
   responsibility for drop accuracy.
   19.15.4. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Personnel Release Procedures.
       19.15.4.1. Jumpmaster directed drops are limited to single ship airdrop operations only.
       These drops may be performed by qualified AF or sister service jumpmasters (or trainees
       under supervision of qualified personnel). This procedure is restricted to STT personnel,
       Navy SEALS, certain EOD units, and Army Special Forces. JMD procedures are
       authorized only during military free fall (MFF) operations and HQ approved static line
       operations. Units will receive approval notice through the mission tasking directive from
       AMC TACC/XOOMJ for AMC-directed missions or from the appropriate theater
       command and control agency, annotated on JA/ATT Form 612R, tasking order, etc. The
       following conditions apply:
          19.15.4.1.1. AF approved static line JMD drops for STT is limited to jumpmaster
          training, personnel/RAMZ (boat) deployments, and pararescue operations/training.
          19.15.4.1.2. Army Special Forces require their headquarters approval for special high
          altitude static line jumps or for static line training in preparation for a mobile training
          team.
          19.15.4.1.3. The jumpmaster‘s parent service/user accepts all responsibility for the
          accuracy of the drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment.
          19.15.4.1.4. Specific in-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone
          procedures between the jumpmaster, loadmaster, and PIC will be coordinated during
          the pilot, loadmaster and jumpmaster briefing.
          19.15.4.1.5. Navigators will still accomplish CARP or high altitude release point
          (HARP) calculations to back up the computations and in-flight directions given by the
          jumpmaster.
          19.15.4.1.6. Navigators will update the jumpmaster in-flight on actual wind
          information and any changes to the crew‘s preflight computed CARP location.
          19.15.4.1.7. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method,
          i.e., GMRS, VIRS, or standard CARP drops. If JMD drop procedures are called for,
          the crew will follow the jumpmaster‘s instructions, while adhering to normal safety
          concerns. Should the crew believe the drop will occur outside of safe parameters,
          they will call ―no drop‖ and ensure the red light is illuminated.
   19.15.5. AWADS Airdrops. AWADS-equipped units are authorized to make airdrops using
   AWADS equipment in VMC or IMC.
   19.15.6. Radar Beacon Airdrops. Radar beacon drops in IMC during peacetime must be
   approved by MAJCOM/DO for active duty units and either HQ AFRC/DO or ANG/XO for
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     219


   AFRC/ANG units. The AOC/ALCC may approve IMC radar beacon airdrops for exercises
   or for contingency and combat operations.
19.16. High Altitude Airdrop Oxygen Requirements.
   19.16.1. A continuous supply of 100 percent oxygen will be used by all personnel during
   unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL. Crewmembers will follow established
   MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements.
      19.16.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
         19.16.1.1.1. Students of the Military Free Fall School, Parachutist Course (MFFPC)
         and Military Free Fall Jumpmaster Course (MFFJM), may perform unpressurized
         operations between the altitudes of 10,000 feet MSL and 13,000 feet MSL without
         supplemental oxygen, for a period not to exceed 2 hours, with the following safety
         measures in place:
         19.16.1.1.2. For MFF-PC Students: A suitably qualified USAF Physiology
         Technician (PT) will be onboard and positioned in the aft portion of the cargo
         compartment when aircraft is between 10,000-13,000 feet MSL for longer than 30
         minutes. Unpressurized flights between these altitudes will not exceed 2 hours. The
         USAF PT will remain on 100% oxygen (or an appropriate air mix) throughout the
         unpressurized portion of the flight above 10,000 feet MSL. Under circumstances
         where a USAF PT is unavailable, a US Army 18 Delta Medic or USAF Pararescue
         trained and certified by HQ ACC/SGOP may be used. The role of the PT will be to
         monitor parachutists for signs of impairment resulting from hypoxia. If hypoxic
         impairment is suspected, the parachutist will be returned to the forward portion of the
         cargo compartment and administered 100% oxygen. Once symptoms and signs of
         hypoxia have been resolved, the parachutist may continue training. Instructors and
         jumpmasters will have 100% oxygen available (provided by the user) and will breathe
         from this supply whenever practicable.
         19.16.1.1.3. For MFF-JM Students: There is no requirement for a USAF PT to be
         onboard for unpressurized operations between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL.
         However, the parachutists will breathe 100% oxygen for a period of at least 3
         minutes, immediately prior to jumping if their time between 10,000 and 13,000 feet
         MSL exceeds 30 minutes. Supplemental oxygen will be supplied by an oxygen
         console provided by the Military Free Fall School.
      19.16.1.2. All other parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during
      unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL
      does not exceed 30 minutes each sortie. Jumpmasters may operate without supplemental
      oxygen for an additional 60 minutes within the 10,000-13,000 foot MSL envelope
      provided their duties do not include jumping. For unpressurized flight above 13,000 feet
      MSL, or exceeding the 30-minute envelope between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL, the
      use of an individual mask and regulator is required for all jumpers. The user is
      responsible for all supplemental oxygen requirements. Aircraft equipment will not be
      used by the parachutists.
   19.16.2. When dropping from 18,000 feet MSL or higher, use pre-breathing procedures.
   When the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all
 220                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   personnel, approved portable oxygen console(s) will be pre-flighted and installed in the
   aircraft. The console(s) will provide enough oxygen regulators for all parachutists and
   crewmembers not accommodated by the normal aircraft system.
   19.16.3. All airdrops above 25,000 feet MSL require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3 for
   unpressurized flight, from HQ AFFSA/XO, 1535 Command Drive, Suite D305, Andrews
   AFB MD, 20331-7002 through MAJCOM/Stan/Eval. MA-1 portable oxygen units (with
   serviceable web carrying straps) equipped with A-21 regulators will be provided for each
   person aboard the aircraft except parachutists. WARNING: No personnel will be exposed to
   unpressurized flight at or above 30,000 feet MSL more than three times each 7 days; in
   addition, they must have a minimum of 24 hours between exposures.
   19.16.4. Pre-breathing requirements. All personnel will pre-breathe 100 percent oxygen
   below 10,000 feet pressure altitude or cabin altitude on any mission scheduled for a drop at
   or above 18,000 feet MSL for times shown in Table 19.2 Pre-breathing will be completed
   before cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL. All personnel will remain on 100
   percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet. A break in pre-breathing requires
   the pre-breathing period to be restarted, or the airdrop will be restricted to below 10,000 feet
   MSL. When pre-breathing on the ground is required, a launch crew may assist the primary
   crew as needed to assure pre-breathing requirements are met. Pre-breathing will be
   conducted with a personally fitted oxygen mask attached to a helmet or approved adjustable
   head harness. Portable oxygen bottles may not be used for pre-breathing. NOTE: Quick don
   masks are emergency equipment and are not approved for pre-breathing or high-altitude
   operations (at or above 18,000 feet MSL).

NOTE: Maximum Exposure Time Per Sortie is considered to be any time cabin altitude exceeds
10,000 feet MSL. Personnel will conduct no more than two oxygen jumps per 24-hour period
that do not require pre-breathing (between 13,000 feet and 18,000 feet MSL) one of which, in the
same 24 hour period, that requires pre-breathing (18,000 feet MSL or above). (Example:
Scenario 1: 2x 17,500 feet MSL or Scenario 2: 1 x 24,999 feet MSL and 1 x 17,500 feet MSL).
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     221


   19.16.5. The jumpmaster may dictate the use of supplemental oxygen by any or all jumpers
   at altitudes less than those listed. Parachutists transfer from the aircraft oxygen system or
   portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately one minute before
   green light.
   19.16.6. Pressurization Scheduling. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet until
   the pre-slowdown checklist (time for check may have to be adjusted) and until pre-breathing
   is complete. Depressurization will not exceed 3,000 feet per minute. Slower rates are
   recommended if time allows. Ensure zero pressure differential before opening doors.
19.17. High Altitude Airdrop Loadmaster Requirements. Loadmaster requirements will be
based on the following criteria:
   19.17.1. Two loadmasters will be used on actual drops utilizing the ramp and door.
   19.17.2. Two loadmasters will be used on all HALO personnel drops (13,000 feet MSL and
   above).
   19.17.3. One loadmaster may be used on HALO personnel drops (up to 13,000 feet MSL)
   when utilizing the ramp and door or, only one paratroop door is opened.
19.18. High Altitude Airdrop PT Requirements. PTs will support high altitude airdrop
missions when requested by the mission frag order, the aircrew, or the user. At least 1 USAF PT
is required per 16 jumpers, up to a maximum of 3 PTs, for all airdrops conducted at or above
18,000 feet MSL. Additional PTs will be required when PTs need training or a waiver is granted
to exceed exposure limitations. NOTE: The ACC Command Physiologist for Aerospace
Physiology, 1 AMDS/SGPT, 45 Pine Street, Langley AFB VA, 23665-2080 may authorize
variations to the PT-to-personnel ratio.
19.19. High Altitude Airdrop PT Duties.
   19.19.1. PTs will fly as crewmembers as stated on aeronautical orders. When missions
   require a PT, the PT will be on interphone at all times. PT flight duty stations will be as
   required to monitor crewmembers, jumpers, and oxygen equipment. PTs will:
       19.19.1.1. Preflight aircraft supplemental oxygen equipment.
       19.19.1.2. Advise and aid loadmasters in positioning and securing oxygen equipment.
       19.19.1.3. Brief crew and jumpers prior to the first mission on physiological problems
       that may be encountered, the importance of proper pre-breathing, and any special
       requirements.
       19.19.1.4. Advise the PIC, crew, jumpers, and other personnel on use of oxygen
       equipment and on the depressurization schedule.
       19.19.1.5. Monitor personnel, aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment, and life
       support equipment.
   19.19.2. The aircrew or the mission PT will notify HQ USAF/SGPA (DSN 858-4654), and
   HQ AMC/SGPA (DSN 576-2303) and appropriate Command Coordinator for Aerospace
   Physiology, of any physiological incident by the most expedient manner.

19.20. High Altitude Airdrop Conduct of Operations.
   19.20.1. For communications and signals, interphone and hand signals are the primary
   methods of communications. Written messages may be necessary in some instances to
   communicate with individuals not connected to the aircraft interphone. Loadmasters will
   carry a suitable writing utensil and medium to write out messages that cannot be dealt with
   by using hand signals. When dropping parachutists, the jumpmaster may monitor
   interphone. The loadmaster will coordinate all hand signals with the jumpmaster.
   19.20.2. Crewmembers will wear parachutes or restraining harnesses in the cargo
   compartment any time the doors are open during high altitude airdrop operations. Safety
   harnesses are worn on airdrops conducted above 14,000 feet MSL. (EXCEPTION: PTs may
   wear a parachute on drops above 14,000 feet MSL but will not position themselves near an
   open exit.) LPUs must be worn with parachutes for operations over bodies of water with the
   doors open.
   19.20.3. If an oxygen console is used, the loadmaster will be stationed aft of it to perform in-
   flight duties. The other loadmaster and physiology technician will be on interphone and
   normally forward of the oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight duties. This
   arrangement will provide a buddy system to check everyone on oxygen.
   19.20.4. Maintain interphone contact between the cockpit and the cargo compartment. Both
   loadmasters must be on interphone from completion of pre-slowdown checks until execution
   of the completion of drop checklist and the cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet. The
   jumpmaster may also monitor interphone during high altitude personnel airdrops.
19.21. High Altitude Personnel Airdrop Procedures. CAUTION: Ensure any paratroopers
remaining on-board de-arm their parachutes before cabin altitude descends below set parachute
activation altitude.
   19.21.1. Air deflectors must be operational if paratroop doors are used. If an air deflector
   does not extend, do not open the affected troop door.
NOTE: Jump platforms may be used.
WARNING: The aircraft ramp and door and paratroop door(s) will not be open at the same time.
   19.21.2. When parachutists exit from the ramp, all parachutists, with the exception of the
   jumpmaster, will stand forward of the ramp hinge until the five-second advisory. One or
   both paratroop doors may be used in lieu of the cargo ramp. The ramp and door or paratroop
   door may remain open during racetracks if required, provided racetrack altitude is at or above
   a safe drop altitude and paratroopers are rigged for high altitude airdrops.
   19.21.3. For jumpmaster-directed HALO drops, the green light may be turned on one minute
   prior to the release point. The navigator will provide a standard ―green light‖ call at the
   jointly agreed upon release point. User assumes responsibility for drop accuracy.
   19.21.4. Normally, the jumpers will exit the aircraft at their own discretion; however, their
   exit must occur during the green light time.
19.22. High Altitude CDS. Drop high altitude CDS using AWADS, GRADS, or radar beacon.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        223


19.23. Personnel Airdrops.
   19.23.1. In the event user personnel plan to jump with mixed parachute types, aircrews will
   always fly to and drop off the CARP for the main mass of paratroopers. The user assumes
   responsibility for the drop accuracy of individuals who choose to jump along with the main
   body of troopers while using a different type parachute. Aircrews will inform user
   jumpmasters if significant differences exist between CARPs.
   19.23.2. Troop seats must have a serviceable retaining strap or be fitted with a pre-measured
   length of type III nylon cord to secure the seat in a raised position prior to slowdown. Ensure
   that parachutists have secured their seats, as required, and that no part of the seat protrudes
   into the aisle.
   19.23.3. The loadmaster allows the jumpmaster access to the paratroop doors not later than
   the one minute advisory. (EXCEPTION: The jumpmaster needs a minimum of two minutes
   in the door for jumpmaster directed drops.) The loadmaster then takes a position on the
   cargo ramp to provide maximum maneuverability for jumpmasters and safety personnel to
   perform their duties.
WARNING: During personnel airdrops, the loadmasters will not position themselves directly
under the center anchor cable supports (A-Frame, FS 737) in case of anchor cable or support
mounting failure.
NOTE: At no time will both paratroop doors be opened for paratroop drops if only one
loadmaster is on board.
   19.23.4. Upon seeing the red jump lights illuminate, the primary loadmaster will notify the
   jumpmaster or safety personnel of the red light condition. The loadmaster will count, if
   possible, any parachutists that exit while the red light is illuminated. WARNING: Do not
   attempt to physically stop or hinder jumpers from exiting the aircraft if jumpers continue to
   exit after ―red light‖.
   19.23.4.1. Control of the paratroop doors reverts back to the loadmaster after all parachutists
   have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the jumpmaster or safety
   personnel and cleared from the paratroop door area. For racetracks, the loadmaster will
   retain control of the doors until completing the next slowdown checks.
       19.23.4.1.1. Racetrack speeds and flap settings are flown as briefed. The paratroop
       door(s) may be left open with jump platform(s) extended during racetracks if all
       paratroopers aft of the aft edge of the wheel-well (FS 617) are hooked up to the anchor
       cables. Jumpers may stand and hook up to the anchor cable with paratroop doors open
       provided they are forward of FS 617. Other occupants of the cargo compartment must
       either be seated with a seat belt fastened, wear a restraint harness, or wear a parachute.
          19.23.4.1.2. Avoid flying over water or built up areas while doors are open.
   19.23.5. Static line retrieval:
       19.23.5.1. The primary method of retrieval is using the static line retriever. The static
       line retriever will always be rigged and used for emergency retrieval of a towed
       parachutist. Manual static-line retrieval may be used to retrieve no more than ten static
       lines per door, per pass with one loadmaster, or 20 static lines per door, per pass with two
       people (combination of loadmasters, jumpmasters or safety personnel).
 224                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


NOTE: Jump platform(s) may be left extended during manual retrieval of static lines. However,
if the retriever winch is used, the jump platform must be retracted.
NOTE: When using the Towed Parachutist Retrieval System (TPRS), paratroop door static lines
are normally retrieved using the retrieval sling assembly (choker). The retriever assist strap
(RAS) is not required for normal retrieval of static lines. Although not required, the RAS may
be used for proficiency or instructional purposes during normal static line retrieval.
   19.23.6. During combat, cut static lines that cannot be retrieved. On other than combat
   missions, if the static line retriever fails during retrieval and more than 10/20 static lines are
   to be retrieved from a paratroop door, manually retrieve the static lines by using a 5,000
   pound tiedown strap as follows:
       19.23.6.1. Secure the hook end to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to
       permit static lines to enter completely in to the aircraft.
       19.23.6.2. Insert the other end of the strap under the static line from the bottom up,
       making a ―U‖ around the static lines.
       19.23.6.3. Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft. Loadmasters
       may require assistance to pull the strap forward.
   19.23.7. If the static line retriever fails following a combination or tailgate drop, use the
   following procedure using the Prusik knot. See AFTTP 3-3.25 for Prusik knot techniques.
       19.23.7.1. Take a 30-inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop.
       Loop the cord around the static line retriever winch cable. Use a minimum of three
       wraps around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.
       19.23.7.2. Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping.
       Attach a carabiner into the 1/2-inch tubular nylon loop. Attach the hook end of a 5,000-
       pound strap into the carabiner and pull in the static lines. The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord
       will remain locked in place under tension.
       19.23.7.3. More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable
       using the Prusik knot to facilitate static-line retrieval. The Prusik knot may be adjusted
       up or down the cable as required. The knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly
       with a minimum of three turns (more wraps equal more friction) and tension is applied.
19.24. Tailgate Airdrop Procedures.
   19.24.1. Tailgate drops are those drops during which parachutists exit from the aircraft ramp.
   The maximum rigged weight of the parachutist is 325 pounds. Tailgate drops are approved
   for STT, PJ, Air Force Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Specialists, Army
   Special Forces, Navy SEALS, paratroopers equipped for arctic airdrop, other US and allied
   special operations personnel, US Army Quartermaster Center and School, Yuma Proving
   Ground Airborne Test Force, and units for which a combination drop is their normal method
   of deployment.
   19.24.2. Rig both anchor cables and static line retrievers before takeoff to provide maximum
   mission flexibility. Mission commanders may approve rigging only one cable and static line
   retriever winch if circumstances dictate.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         225


   19.24.3. Use one anchor cable for each pass and limit each pass to a maximum of 20
   parachutists. If more than one pass is required, alternate anchor cables, retrieving static lines
   and deployment bags prior to each additional pass to prevent entanglement. Static lines are
   retrieved using aft controls. NOTE: To ensure full utilization of the aircraft during training,
   over-the-ramp personnel airdrops may be made with center-aisle seats installed to
   approximately flight station 650 (aft of escape ladder). When more than 20 static line
   parachutists are to be dropped on a single pass, the paratroop doors will be used.
19.25. Combination Airdrops.
   19.25.1. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit from the aircraft ramp
   after equipment extraction or gravity release (CDS, Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC),
   Container Ramp Bundle etc.). NOTE: The M551 armored reconnaissance and airborne
   assault vehicle (ARAAV) and its crew may be airdropped as a combination drop provided
   the M551 is rigged on a type V airdrop platform. The M551 crew will hook their static lines
   to the right anchor cable.
   19.25.2. Combination drops are restricted to single-ship or the last aircraft of an equipment
   formation. When tailgating parachutists, the drop altitude is determined by the item
   requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-231. If an additional pass is required to drop
   all the personnel after a combination CDS drop, close the ramp and door and re-rig the static-
   line retriever cable as depicted in T.O. 1C-130A-9.
   19.25.3. The navigator will compute a CDS or platform CARP and a personnel CARP (for
   ten seconds after the equipment release point) using the same indicated airspeed (IAS) and
   altitude used for the equipment. Inform the jumpmaster if the PI falls within 150 yards of the
   DZ boundary; the jumpmaster is the final approving authority in this situation.
19.26. Door Bundle Airdrops.
   19.26.1. General A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds (excluding the weight
   of the parachutes) are referred to as ―door bundles‖ and are dropped from the aircraft through
   the paratroop door or ramp and door using the personnel airdrop checklist. Door bundles
   may be dropped independently or with personnel and are limited to one bundle per exit used.
   When dropped with personnel, the bundle is the first object to exit the aircraft. Remove
   restraints and position the bundle in the paratroop door or on the ramp prior to completion of
   the slowdown checklist. (EXCEPTION: If the jumpmaster needs the paratroop door for
   spotting, place the door bundle as close as possible to the paratroop door.) If jumpers are to
   follow the door bundle, the user is responsible for ejecting the bundle out the troop door or
   off the ramp. For door bundles exiting over the ramp, secure the forward end of the bundle
   to a suitable floor tiedown ring with one-half inch tubular nylon. This tie is to prevent
   premature release of the bundle and will be cut by the loadmaster at the release point.
      19.26.1.1. Door bundles dropped from the paratroop doors will be rigged with non-
      breakaway static lines. Their dimensions, including the parachute, must not exceed 48
      inches by 30 inches by 66 inches unless authorized in a specific T.O. When the container
      is placed in the door for airdrop, place the largest dimension in the vertical or upright
      position.
      19.26.1.2. Door bundles dropped from the ramp and door will be rigged with a T-10
      parachute (converted for cargo) or parachute equipped with breakaway static lines (per
 226                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       TO 13C7-1-11). Also, bundles rigged for a ramp exit are equipped with a skid board
       compatible with the center roller conveyors. NOTE: If no parachutists are to be dropped
       after the door bundles, non-breakaway static lines will be used. Anchor cable stops will
       be positioned as depicted in TO 1C-130A-9 for CDS airdrops.
   19.26.2. During unilateral single-ship airdrop training, door bundles will not exit aircraft
   after a paratrooper has jumped. NOTE: During joint training, combat or contingency
   operations, the user determines door bundle requirements and order of exit from any or all
   personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation.
   19.26.3. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP for the first
   paratrooper exiting after the bundle and compute an additional CARP for the door bundle to
   ensure that it will impact on the DZ. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP, followed by
   the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is the only object dropped, base
   the CARP on the bundle.
19.27. Equipment Airdrops. Only equipment rigged in accordance with 13-C series T.O.s or
JSOC 350 series may be airdropped. The maximum airdrop load to be extracted over the ramp is
42,000 pounds for C-130E/H airplanes 61-2358, 62-1784 and up and 25,000 pounds for other C-
130 aircraft. The aerial delivery unit supporting the load movement ensures current publications
are available for loadmaster reference during joint inspections.
19.28. Heavy Equipment airdrops with the Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS).
   19.28.1. Loadmasters must receive EPJS ground training before using the system during
   airdrop missions.
19.29. CDS Airdrops.
   19.29.1. Reset flaps according to the appropriate CDS flap setting chart and maintain level
   flight. It is not recommended to drop CDS at gross weights less than 104,000 pounds. If
   drop must be made, use zero flaps and expect longer than normal exit time.
CAUTION: The aircraft will tend to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft. This pitch must be
controlled to allow no more than two or three degrees additional pitch. Do not over control to
the point that negative ―G‖ forces are encountered while the load is exiting the aircraft as this
increases exit time or may stop load movement.
CAUTION: Dropping high altitude CDS bundles at 17,000 feet or above requires proper yoke
compensation for shift in center of gravity as the load exits. Premature yoke inputs, over
compensation, or no yoke inputs all may result in aircraft tail impacts by exiting bundles.
   19.29.2. When the loadmaster calls ―load clear‖, the flaps should be set to 50 percent.
   19.29.3. When authorized by the OG/CC or DIRMOBFOR, a manual gate cut may be
   performed if the static-line retriever fails to cut the gate at ―Green Light.‖ This also applies
   to training missions, if expressly allowed in the unit supplement of this AFI. Manual gate
   cuts are accomplished by the loadmaster pulling sharply on a tiedown strap looped over the
   static line retriever winch cable.
19.30. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Airdrops.
19.30.1. Use the standard CDS checklist. Either two CRRC platforms and up to 18 static-line
parachutists or one CRRC platform and up to 19 parachutists may be airdropped on one pass.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      227


Checklist and emergency procedures are the same as for CDS airdrops. Wind and sea state
limitations are at the discretion of the supported unit. NOTE: When airdropping two CRRC
platforms, the forward release gate must be cut manually by the loadmaster. When dropping one
CRRC, either use the static line retriever or manually cut the release strap.
19.31. Free-Fall Airdrops. Use the normal CDS airdrop checklist and emergency procedures.
Single containers not exceeding weight or dimension restrictions for door bundles may be
dropped from either troop door using the personnel airdrop checklist.
19.32. High Velocity CDS Airdrops. High velocity CDS must be rigged with breakaway static
lines. Use normal CDS aircrew checklist procedures.
   19.32.1. The following guidance is provided for unilateral training CDS airdrops:
       19.32.1.1. Non-Breakaway: All high-velocity unilateral training CDS loads dropped at
       9,999 feet MSL or below will be rigged and airdropped with non-breakaway static lines.
       19.32.1.2. Breakaway: All high velocity unilateral training CDS loads dropped at 10,000
       feet MSL and above will be rigged and airdropped with breakaway static lines.
       EXCEPTION: A drop altitude of 5,000 feet AGL must be maintained. If the drop
       altitude is not 5,000 feet AGL, the loads must be rigged with a non-breakaway static line.
       19.32.1.3. Units must establish a marking system to readily identify which 26-foot
       parachutes are packed for breakaway and non-breakaway static lines. The aircrew must
       ensure the CDS loads and the high-velocity parachutes are rigged and packed (marked)
       properly for the planned airdrop altitude (MSL), and drop zone to aircraft altitude
       separation (AGL). Aircrew procedures must be consistent with parachute packing.
19.33. Container Ramp Bundles. The CDS Airdrop Checklist will be used with the exception
of arming the CDS switch. CDS flap setting must be computed and used to ensure a positive
deck angle for the drop.
   19.33.1. Current items considered ramp bundles are: Zodiac Boat in A-22 Cargo Bag
   (RAMZ) rigged IAW FM 10-542/TO 13C7-51-21, Small Inflatable Boat (IBS) rigged IAW
   FM 10-542/TO 13C7-51-21, and One or Two Motorcycles on a Combat Expandable
   Platform rigged IAW FM 10-577/TO 13C7-55-1. Ramp bundles will BE loaded and rigged
   in the aircraft IAW Section 7C of the aircraft TO 1C-130-9.
       19.33.1.1. RAMZ containers are jumpmaster-directed ramp bundle drops regardless of
       the type parachute used by the STT team. The jumpmaster may use streamers and
       request additional passes to position the aircraft over the containers and STT release
       point. Containers are individually secured to the ramp with Type VIII nylon, which is
       manually cut by the loadmaster on the jumpmaster‘s command. The STT may exit
       immediately after container release or on a subsequent pass.
       19.33.1.2. For jumpmaster-directed RAMZ airdrops, a navigator‘s CARP/HARP is not
       required when using streamers/spotter chutes.
       19.33.1.3. For single-pass RAMZ airdrops, compute the CARP/HARP for the RAMZ by
       dividing the packages weight in two and applying this result to the ballistic data for a
       single, personnel T-10A/B parachute. If STT personnel jump on the same pass with the
       RAMZ, combination drop procedures apply.
 228                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   19.33.2. Alternate Navigator Directed RAMZ Deployment.
       19.33.2.1. Accomplish the slowdown using normal procedures.
       19.33.2.2. Release point. The navigator determines the release point and assumes the
       responsibility to call ―five seconds‖ and ―green light.‖ At green light, the loadmaster will
       manually cut the RAMZ bundle loose, which will signal the jumpers are clear to follow
       the gravity ejected load.
   19.33.3. RAMZ Preflight. Prior to flight, the loadmaster will ensure the following items are
   accomplished:
       19.33.3.1. Ensure that no fuel is leaking from the RAMZ bundle. A leaking bundle will
       not be loaded aboard the aircraft or will be downloaded if already aboard. Close both
       paratroop doors onto the extended jump platforms and secure them with tie down straps.
WARNING: If flammable fumes are present, unnecessary electrical equipment/switches will not
be turned on or off until the fumes are eliminated. Use 100 percent oxygen and accomplish the
Smoke and Fume Elimination checklist as appropriate.
WARNING: Only 15-foot static line will be used on the RAMZ cargo parachutes. A 12-foot
static line extended to 15-feet will not be used. If personnel (rigged for static line airdrop) are to
follow immediately after the RAMZ, their static lines will also be 15-feet.
NOTE: When loaded aboard the aircraft, the vertical restraint tiedown strap on the RAMZ will
be secured in such a manner that it is not placed over any fuel bladder, and just tight enough to
take the slack out of the strap.
   19.33.4. RAMZ Deployment:
       19.33.4.1. During the pre-slowdown checklist, vertical, aft and forward restraint straps
       will be removed from the RAMZ package. Gradually release the forward restraint to
       allow the package to slowly shift forward against the Type VIII nylon release strap.
       WARNING: Personnel must stand clear of the RAMZ package when removing the
       forward restraint.
       19.33.4.2. At the ―one minute‖ call, the jumpmaster will normally be on the left side of
       the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft end. Additional jumpers will be forward
       of the RAMZ. The loadmaster will be positioned to retrieve the RAMZ parachute static
       line D-bag(s) (for HALO airdrops) and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times.
       At the ―one minute‖ call, the jumpmaster will be alerted and the Type VIII nylon release
       strap is rechecked. WARNING: If a ―no drop‖ is called and the RAMZ is held in place
       by only the release strap, all personnel will move forward of the ramp hinge, except the
       loadmaster and the jumpmaster who will monitor the RAMZ for possible shifting and
       secure as necessary.
       19.33.4.3. If the deployment is jumpmaster directed, the jumpmaster will determine the
       exit point and deploy prior to receiving a ―no drop‖ notification or seeing the red light
       come on. The loadmaster will relay to the pilot all visual corrections given by the
       jumpmaster. The jumpmaster will signal for the loadmaster to cut the Type VIII nylon
       release strap.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                         229


       19.33.4.4. If the deployment is PIC or navigator directed, the loadmaster will relay
       pertinent information to the jumpmaster. At the command ―green light‖, the loadmaster
       will cut the Type VIII nylon release gate and deploy the RAMZ. If jumpers are
       tailgating, this will signal the jumpers that they are cleared to follow the load. If jumpers
       are freefall parachuting, they will exit after the loadmaster has retrieved the RAMZ
       parachute D-bags.
WARNING: If the RAMZ exits the aircraft, but fails to properly deploy, the static lines will be
cut immediately.
CAUTION: The Type VIII nylon release strap must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon
strap to pull free through floor tie down rings.
   19.33.5. The RAMZ package will normally be delivered aligned into the wind (+/- 30
   degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised when this
   cannot be complied with.
   19.33.6. The minimum deployment altitude will be 3500 feet AGL when the STT exits using
   freefall parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for training. For operational missions,
   minimum altitude with the freefall parachutes is 2500 feet AGL. If low ceilings prohibit the
   use of freefall parachutes, the STT will deploy using static line parachutes immediately
   following the RAMZ package. The RAMZ and STT will be deployed from the same
   altitude. The minimum deployment altitude for both RAMZ and STT will be 800 feet AGL.
   19.33.7. For training, one or more safety recovery boats will be in position to recover
   equipment and personnel as required.
19.34. SATBs. A 15-pound training bundle may be dropped to simulate personnel, equipment,
or CDS airdrops. Use the applicable tactical airdrop checklist for the type airdrop being
simulated. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster will use the equipment checklist for simulated CDS
airdrops. SATBs may be dropped on the actual heavy equipment or CDS CARP for sight angle
airdrop training provided the bundle will land on the DZ. Adjust the drop score for the
difference between the SATB CARP and the actual CARP.
19.35. NVG Airdrop Procedures. Qualified NVG airdrop pilots are authorized to perform
normal night operations (including low level flying and formation) at night VMC altitudes IAW
the tactical chapters of this regulation and AFTTP 3-3.25. Airdrops may be accomplished on
drop zones marked IAW AFI 13-217 lighting patterns (covert and overt) while wearing NVGs.
NVG airdrops on unmarked DZ are prohibited unless permitted by contingency SPINs or
coordinated through contingency ATO.
   19.35.1. Loadmasters will use NVGs during airdrops if the mission dictates. Loadmasters
   are authorized to perform airdrops with minimum lighting. Use NVGs as necessary to assist
   with operations and keep cargo area lighting to a minimum.
   19.35.2. Cargo Compartment Lighting. After the Combat Entry Checklist, all cargo
   compartment lighting will be minimized. Blacked out (no-light) operations in the cargo
   compartment are not authorized. Loadmasters will carefully consider cargo compartment
   lighting intensity prior to opening ramp and door to minimize interference with formation
   wingmen‘s NVG vision.
 230                                           AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


19.36. Emergency Procedures. Loadmasters will complete a detailed emergency procedure
coordinated task briefing. All crewmembers should review the applicable emergency procedures
for the airdrop to be performed before takeoff. If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop, the
loadmaster immediately notifies the PIC and takes appropriate action. After all appropriate
emergency actions are complete, run the completion of drop checklist. NOTE: In the event of a
malfunction, incident, or off-DZ drop, do not de-rig, handle or move items unless required for
safety of flight. Any follow-on investigation will benefit from seeing the items in the position or
state they were in at the time of the event.
19.37. Emergency Parachutist Bail Out Procedures.
   19.37.1. Under satisfactory conditions (static-line exit), the minimum acceptable emergency
   bailout altitude is 400 feet above the terrain. When an aircraft emergency occurs during
   static-line airdrops, the PIC maintains an acceptable attitude and altitude for the parachutists
   to evacuate the aircraft. If the jump must be made at an airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS,
   advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude. Order evacuation by turning on the green
   light and giving the briefed alarm bell signals.
   19.37.2. Minimum emergency bail-out altitude for free-fall parachutists is 2,000 feet AGL.
   19.37.3. If conditions are unsuitable for aircraft evacuation, turn the red light on until exit
   doors are closed. The PIC advises the jumpmaster through the loadmaster to have the
   parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten seatbelts.
19.38. Towed Parachutist.
   19.38.1. The jumpmaster will stop the remaining parachutists; the loadmaster will notify the
   PIC; and the PM will turn on the red light. The PF will maintain drop airspeed, at least the
   minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute being used, and avoid flying over or up
   wind of water or built up areas.
       19.38.1.1. Crews should suspect they have a towed parachutist if static lines are not fully
       tucked into the upper corner of the paratroop door or if a D-bag appears to be stuck
       outside the door. It is unlikely for a D-bag to become caught on the outside of the aircraft
       and is a probable indicator a parachutist is being towed. In any case, crews should follow
       emergency procedures until they have confirmed no parachutist is being towed. Crews
       should take special effort to confirm towed jumper status at night with limited rearward
       visibility. They should consider using an additional source of illumination to view the
       rear of the aircraft.
   19.38.2. The jumpmaster or safety observer is responsible for identifying how the
   parachutist is towed. If being towed by anything other than the static line, the jumpmaster or
   safety will attempt to free the parachutist. If being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster
   or safety will make a recommendation to the PIC, through the loadmaster, whether to retrieve
   the parachutist or cut him or her free. If all parachutists have exited and there is no safety
   person onboard, this responsibility rests with the loadmaster.
   19.38.3. The PIC will make the final decision whether or not to cut the towed parachutist
   free. If the decision is to cut the parachutist free, the loadmaster will cut the static line on the
   PIC‘s command. NOTE: Towed parachutists indicate consciousness and that reserve
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        231


  parachute is ready by maintaining a tight-body position with both hands on reserve
  parachute. This indicates the jumper is prepared to be cut away.
  19.38.4. If the parachutist is towed after exit from a paratroop door, the pilot should lower
  the landing gear and set flaps to 100 percent to reduce parachute buffeting. (See warning
  below.) If possible, avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the towed parachutist as this
  often causes parachutist to swing violently and increases the possibility of injury. All turns
  should be shallow and coordinated to reduce the severity of parachutist oscillation. During
  training, the first priority is to retrieve the parachutist whether he or she is conscious or
  unconscious. However, if the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness,
  cut the parachutist free. WARNING: Although 100 percent flaps selection provides an
  improved airflow for a towed parachutist, under certain conditions the landing gear down,
  100 percent flap configuration may reduce aircraft performance. The PIC should consider
  density altitude, aircraft weight, position in formation, or other factors deemed important in
  determining what flap setting between 50 and 100 percent should be used.
  19.38.5. For a parachutist towed after exit from the cargo ramp and door, the first priority is
  to cut the parachutist free if consciousness is indicated. Retrieve if the parachutist is
  unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or if a condition exists that prevents
  cutting the static line. NOTE: If the parachutist is towed following a ramp exit, it will be
  necessary to partially rewind the static-line retriever to reach the static line for cutting.
  19.38.6. There are two methods for the retrieval of towed parachutists from the paratroop
  doors. The primary method of retrieval is use of the Towed Parachutist Retrieval System
  (TPRS). The secondary method of retrieval is to rig a 5,000-pound tiedown strap/paratroop
  retriever bar in the paratroop door prior to retrieval of the towed parachutist. When the
  secondary method must be used, the maximum rigged weight of the parachutist is limited to
  250 pounds (including equipment, parachute, etc.) WARNING: The 5,000-pound tiedown
  strap/paratroop retriever bar shall not be used with the TPRS.
  19.38.7. Parachutist Retrieval Through Paratroop Door Using TPRS.
     19.38.7.1. Install the retrieval sling assembly (choker) around all static lines immediately
     below the static line snap hooks.
     19.38.7.2. Install Retriever Assist Strap (RAS) around all static lines.
     19.38.7.3. Fold in jump platform.
     19.38.7.4. Using the static line retriever winch, retrieve the static lines through the RAS.
         19.38.7.4.1. If the static line retriever winch has been modified with the slip clutch
         assembly, engage static line retriever winch until it slips. If the retriever clutch slips
         prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove
         the cause of the overload, slightly unwind the static line retriever winch to reset the
         slip clutch, and continue retrieval operation. WARNING: During retrieval attempts,
         take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time. This
         does not preclude unwinding the retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.
         19.38.7.4.2. Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begin to
         pass through the RAS.
 232                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


       19.38.7.5. If in the paratroop door area, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand. If
       the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, i.e. positioned in the lower aft corner of the
       paratroop door, it is necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS. Primary
       loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip. Secondary loadmaster
       and safety observer or jumpmaster (if safety observer or jumpmaster are onboard the
       aircraft) routes the D-bags through the RAS. Once the D-bags have been brought into the
       aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so they will not interfere with the
       remaining retrieval. The primary loadmaster will continue retrieval. When pulled up to
       the door, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand.
WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and the line of travel of the
static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved to the door area.
NOTE: When the parachutist is in the door area and is under the control of the loadmaster or
safety observer, or jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the
line so the parachutist can be brought into the aircraft.
       19.38.7.6. After retrieving the parachutist, the pilot will reset flaps to 50 percent, raise
       the landing gear (if required), and call for completion of drop checklist.
   19.38.8. Parachutist Retrieval Through Paratroop Door Using 5,000-Pound Strap/Paratroop
   Retriever Bar.
       19.38.8.1. Install a 5,000-pound tiedown strap across the paratroop door by threading the
       hook end of the strap behind the one inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door
       under all static lines, and behind the one inch tubular brace at FS 700. Secure the hook
       end of the tiedown strap to a floor/rail tiedown ring forward of FS 700 and the ratchet end
       to any convenient tiedown ring aft of FS 737. Remove as much slack as possible.
WARNING: Use extreme caution when routing 5,000-pound strap over the oxygen regulators
located at FS 740 left and right side.
NOTE: The strap may be routed prior to the drop at FS 740 provided it is secured and does not
interfere with the paratroop door operation or jumpers.
       19.38.8.2. Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional
       slack in the tiedown strap. Fold the jump platform in.
       19.38.8.3. If the airplane is equipped with a paratrooper retriever bar, install the bar as
       follows: The bar is inserted beneath all of the static lines extending out of the door, and
       one end is then raised and inserted in the retaining bracket in the aft portion of the door
       frame. The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and inserted in the forward
       portion of the door frame. The bar provides a smooth surface for the static lines to ride
       over as the paratrooper is retrieved back into the airplane.
       19.38.8.4. Fold the jump platform in and initiate retrieval using the static-line retriever
       winch.
           19.38.8.4.1. If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the
           static-line retriever winch, engage static-line retriever until it slips. If the retriever
           clutch slips prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine
           and remove the cause of the overload. Then, slightly unwind the retriever to reset the
           retriever‘s slip clutch, and continue retriever operation.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                           233


           19.38.8.4.2. On aircraft not modified with slip clutch assemblies, stop retrieval when
           the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass over the 5,000-pound
           strap/paratroop retriever bar. WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible
           action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time. This does not preclude
           unwinding the retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.
       19.38.8.5. When the parachutist is in the paratroop door area, bring the parachutist into
       the aircraft by hand. If it is difficult to get the parachutist into the area of the paratroop
       door, i.e. positioned in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door, it will be necessary to
       pull the D-bags manually through the opening between the 5,000-pound strap/paratroop
       retriever bar and the paratroop door.
           19.38.8.5.1. The loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip.
           The other loadmaster, safety observer or jumpmaster will route D-bags through the
           opening. Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far
           enough forward so they will not interfere with the remaining retrieval.
           19.38.8.5.2. The loadmaster will continue retrieval. When pulled up to the door,
           bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand.
WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the
static-line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved to the door area.
NOTE: When the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster, safety
observer or jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static-line retriever to relieve tension on the line so
the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. The jump platform may be extended once the
parachutist is in the door area.
       19.38.8.6. After retrieving the parachutist, the PM will reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the
       landing gear (if required) and call for the completion of drop checklist.
   19.38.9. Parachutist Retrieval Through Ramp and Door. WARNING: The TPRS shall not
   be used during parachutist retrieval through ramp and door.
       19.38.9.1. Thread the hook end of the 5,000-pound tiedown strap, front to rear, around
       the right/left vertical support member at FS 840 approximately 5-1/2 feet above the ramp
       in the ADS position. Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut. Run the ratchet
       end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the opposite vertical
       support member at FS 840. Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to
       any convenient tiedown ring forward of FS 840. Ratchet the strap until taut. NOTE: For
       aircraft with tiedown rings installed at FS 847 (waterline 208), the 5,000-pound tiedown
       strap may be installed by attaching the hook end of the strap to the sidewall ring at FS
       847 on the same side as the towed parachutist with the hook facing forward. Hook the
       ratchet end of the strap to the opposite sidewall ring at FS 847, remove all the slack from
       the strap, and ratchet the strap until taut. The strap will be pre-measured prior to pre-
       slowdown and excess strap taped.
       19.38.9.2. Using the static-line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the
       parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand
       underneath the strap.

WARNING: The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the towed parachutist. An oscillating
parachutist usually strikes the aircraft head first. If the parachutist is oscillating violently, stop
the retrieval momentarily to allow stabilization, then continue with retrieval. Repeat these steps
as required.
NOTE: After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster,
safety observer or loadmaster, slightly unwind the static-line retriever to relieve tension on the
line so the parachutist can be brought into the aircraft.
       19.38.9.3. After retrieving the parachutist, run the completion of drop checklist.
       WARNING: There is no effective, dependable, or consistently reliable means to
       manually retrieve a towed parachutist from the paratroop door or ramp and door.
       Manually retrieving a parachutist is a last resort. Manual retrieval techniques vary,
       depending on the scenario, and should be used with extreme caution.
19.39. Equipment Emergency Procedures.
   19.39.1. When notified of a malfunction, the PF will maintain drop airspeed and AGL
   altitude (if possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water or built up areas to the
   maximum extent possible. The loadmaster will accomplish the malfunction checklist and
   notify the PIC when complete. The crew will then run the completion of drop checklist.
WARNING: Do not proceed aft of any platform or load until it is properly restrained.
Preposition emergency aft restraint chains. Attach restraint to the items to which the extraction
force is applied and remove all slack. Required restraint is per TO 1C-130A-9.
NOTE: Upon landing, ensure the load and airdrop system is not tampered with until after the
malfunction is investigated by tactics/standardization and evaluation personnel.
   19.39.2. Loose platform prior to green light.          The loadmaster will take the following
   corrective actions:
       19.39.2.1. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction, loose platform‖.
       19.39.2.2. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.39.2.3. Apply emergency restraint chains on all platforms to be dropped, moving
       from front to rear.
       19.39.2.4. Raise the aft anchor cable supports, if required.
       19.39.2.5. Clear the ramp and door to close.
       19.39.2.6. Relock the platforms.
       19.39.2.7. Secure the platform(s) with aircraft tiedown equipment if unable to engage the
       locks.
       19.39.2.8. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist. NOTE: Make no further attempt to airdrop the platform.
   19.39.3. Extraction parachute fails to release mechanically/falls on the ramp. The loadmaster
   will:
       19.39.3.1. Extraction Parachute Jettison System – Activated (if installed).
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          235


       19.39.3.2. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.39.3.3. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.39.3.4. Apply emergency aft restraint chains on all platforms moving from front to
       rear.
       19.39.3.5. Raise aft anchor cable supports, if required.
       19.39.3.6. Clear the ramp and door to close.
       19.39.3.7. Relock the platforms.
       19.39.3.8. Secure the platform(s) with aircraft tiedown equipment if unable to engage the
       locks.
       19.39.3.9. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist. NOTE: Make no further attempt to airdrop the platform.
   19.39.4. Load fails to extract with a single extraction parachute outside the aircraft. The
   loadmaster will:
       19.39.4.1. Extraction Parachute Jettison System – Activated (if installed).
       19.39.4.2. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction,‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.39.4.3. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.39.4.4. Apply emergency restraint chains to all platforms moving from front to rear.
       19.39.4.5. Cut the extraction line (if EPJS is not installed or it fails to release extraction
       line). WARNING: Exercise extreme caution when manually cutting the extraction line.
       Platforms could dislodge from restraint chains, or a malfunctioning EPJS could suddenly
       initiate the squib and release the extraction line. In all cases, the extraction line will
       rapidly recoil after the cut.
       19.39.4.6. Raise the aft anchor cable supports, if required.
       19.39.4.7. Clear the ramp and door to close.
       19.39.4.8. Relock the platforms.
       19.39.4.9. Secure platform(s) with aircraft tiedown equipment if unable to engage the
       locks.
       19.39.4.10. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of
       airdrop checklist.
NOTE: Make no further attempt to airdrop the platform.
WARNING: Ensure the lifeline is attached and locked to a tiedown ring no further aft than FS
677 prior to proceeding aft to cut the extraction line.
WARNING: Exercise caution when cutting the extraction line because of possible line recoil.
WARNING: The combined effects of aircraft gross weight, drop altitude, and temperature may
prevent level flight at drop speed when towing deployed extraction parachutes as small as 22

feet. Total drag on the aircraft may be more than the thrust available to overcome it. The
situation could require an immediate forced landing near the DZ.
   19.39.5. Multiple 28 foot extraction parachutes fail to release mechanically/fall on the ramp.
   The loadmaster will:
       19.39.5.1. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction,‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.39.5.2. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.39.5.3. Raise aft anchor cable supports, if required.
       19.39.5.4. Clear the ramp and door to close.
       19.39.5.5. Relock the platforms.
       19.39.5.6. Secure the platform(s) with aircraft tiedown equipment if unable to engage the
       locks.
       19.39.5.7. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist. NOTE: Make no further attempt to airdrop the platform.
   19.39.6. Load fails to extract with multiple 28-foot extraction parachutes outside the aircraft.
   The loadmaster will:
       19.39.6.1. Ensure the right rail control handle is in the emergency position.
       19.39.6.2. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction, load failed to extract‖ (if the load
       still fails to extract).
       19.39.6.3. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.39.6.4. Pull the simul open control handle full forward. WARNING: The loadmaster
       must apply a sustained steady pull (10-20 seconds) on the simul open control handle to
       compensate for lock loading and binding caused by the towed parachutes.
       19.39.6.5. Report the condition to the PIC if the load still fails to extract.
   19.39.7. If the load cannot be jettisoned and flight conditions permit, proceed to a suitable
   airfield, avoid flying over built up areas and land in a flat attitude with ramp and door open.
   WARNING: With multiple 28-foot extraction parachutes deployed outside the aircraft,
   maximum thrust will be needed to stay aloft or to control the descent. The drag produced by
   the extraction parachutes should decrease if airspeed is allowed to bleed off. This reduction
   in drag could permit level flight or reduce the rate of descent should level flight not be
   possible. Do not reduce power to achieve this air speed change and do not slow below max
   effort takeoff speed. Max effort takeoff speed is 1.2 X power on stall speed and provides an
   acceptable airspeed margin for zero bank angle. If the aircraft must be turned to get to a
   suitable landing area, this airspeed may not be sufficient to prevent a stall while in banked
   flight. If a turn is required, pilots should be sensitive to the first indication of a stall and
   reduce bank and or lower nose to decrease angle of attack and eliminate the stall indication.
   Any power reduction will increase the stall speed. The tradeoff in selecting a landing site,
   straight ahead or one requiring a turn is a function of the rate of descent the required airspeed
   will produce. The higher the airspeed, the faster the aircraft will likely descend. A forced
   landing straight ahead will produce the lowest allowable airspeed, least rate of descent and
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                        237


   most desirable impact forces. Any turn will decrease the time before impact. However, the
   risks associated with turning may be mitigated by the terrain the aircraft will impact such as
   forest or built up areas.
19.40. CDS Emergency Procedures.
   19.40.1. Gate fails to cut/load fails to exit.
   19.40.2. The loadmaster will take the following corrective actions:
       19.40.2.1. De-arm the CDS switch (if installed).
       19.40.2.2. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction,‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.40.2.3. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
       19.40.2.4. Raise the aft anchor cable supports (if required).
       19.40.2.5. Clear the ramp and door to close.
WARNING: When notified of a malfunction, extend additional flaps and lower the nose to
maintain a slight nose down attitude until the ramp and door are closed and the load is secured.
Maintain drop airspeed and AGL altitude (if possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water
or built up areas.
WARNING: When dropping double stick using the CVR and one gate fails to cut, the
loadmaster will delay notifying the PIC of a malfunction until the containers of the released stick
have exited the aircraft. If the containers of both sticks fail to exit, notify the PIC immediately
and continue with emergency procedures.
WARNING: When the cargo ramp and door cannot be closed from the cockpit, the loadmaster
secures the load for aft movement. Ensure the lifeline is locked to a tiedown ring no further aft
than FS 677 prior to proceeding aft to operate the cargo ramp and door controls.
CAUTION: If the load is jammed in the ramp area, notify the engineer to stop closing action
when the cargo door releases from the uplock. If this is necessary, the loadmaster will secure the
load and close the ramp using the aft controls.
       19.40.2.6. Secure the load for landing and install high altitude CDS safety pins (if
       required).
       19.40.2.7. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist. NOTE: If the malfunction was due to a failure of the static-line retriever or
       CDS remote timer system, the mission may be continued using the opposite static line
       retriever and manually activating the retriever switch at FS 245, provided the 80 lbs tie on
       the knife did not break, and the knife did not nick the gate. If the tie is broken or a nick
       in the gate has occurred, this constitutes a malfunction that requires an inspection as soon
       as possible.
19.41. CRRC Emergency Procedures. Follow either CDS or towed parachutist emergency
procedures as required.
19.42. Container Ramp Bundle Emergency Procedures. Follow either CDS or towed
parachutist emergency procedures as required.

19.43. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle Emergency Procedures.
   19.43.1. SATB fails to release mechanically/falls on the ramp. The loadmaster will:
       19.43.1.1. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction,‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.43.1.2. Clear the ramp and door to close.
       19.43.1.3. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist. NOTE: Make no attempt to remove the bundle from the ramp prior to closing
       the ramp and door. Do not attempt further SATB airdrops utilizing the bomb rack.
   19.43.2. SATB outside the aircraft and fails to separate. The loadmaster will:
       19.43.2.1. Notify the PIC by stating, ―Malfunction,‖ with a brief description of the
       problem.
       19.43.2.2. Cut the static line on the PIC‘s command over the DZ. WARNING: When
       simulating an airdrop using the cargo ramp and door, a hung bundle could become
       wedged in the aircraft elevator during turns. Do not attempt to retrieve the SATB. If
       possible, cut the static line prior to making a turn.
       19.43.2.3. Notify the PIC the bundle has been cut away.
       19.43.2.4. After completing the malfunction checklist, perform the completion of airdrop
       checklist.
19.44. High Altitude Emergency Procedures. If a physiological incident occurs, the PIC will:
   19.44.1. Abort the mission.
   19.44.2. Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and
   degree of sickness or pain).
   19.44.3. Ensure the affected person remains on 100 percent oxygen until a medical doctor
   determines the type of treatment required.
   19.44.4. Proceed to the nearest base with qualified medical assistance available.
   19.44.5. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the
   aircraft.
   19.44.6. Advise attending physician to call Brooks AFB Hyperbaric Medicine DSN 240-

                                         Chapter 20

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-130 Aircrews, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrews
   and all management levels concerned with operations of the C-130 aircraft. All operators
   involved in Aeromedical Evacuation missions on C-130 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-130 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DOD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-XXX and 41-XXX series, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for Aeromedical Evacuation. HQ AMC Directorate of
   Operations (AMC/A3) is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of Aeromedical Evacuation missions is the same as other
   airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final (see AFI 11-2MDS-specific V3 for a
   more detailed list of PIC responsibilities). In matters of patient care, decisions of the MCD
   are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to Aeromedical
   Evacuation missions. He/she advises the PIC on patients‘ conditions and the use of medical
   equipment that may affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety
   and medical well being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning
   procedures with the AEOO and supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions
   of the MCD are final.
   20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical
   standards and procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
   20.2.6. The Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), if available, is a Medical
   Services Corps officer or a Medical Administration Specialist/Technician who acts as a
   liaison between the AE crew and ground support facilities. When available, the AEOO is
   responsible for coordinating the launch and recovery of the AE mission.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD. The
   MCD will alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the PIC, local AMC C2 agency and
   MCD before mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
 240                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide AC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew throughout mission including en route transportation, dining,
   billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, egress considerations.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Loadmaster Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, i.e., doors, ramps, emergency exits, etc.
   20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients
   by AECMs.

   20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-
   loading.
   20.6.2. Assist Loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. Assist the Loadmaster with observation and care of passengers when it does not
   interfere with primary duties.
   20.6.5. The MCD or designated AECM should be on aircraft inter-phone (headset) for all
   phases of flight, and will be on aircraft inter-phone during critical phases of flight to include
   take-off and landing.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients. Exception:
   ERO procedures as outlined in 20.23.
20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station‘s patients. The PIC and CSS shall ensure aircrew members and
   servicing personnel accomplish CS per AFI 32-2001 and TO 00-25-172.
   20.8.2. Concurrent servicing may be accomplished with patients onboard provided:
      20.8.2.1. The CSS coordinates with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent
      operations.
      20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers,
      and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
      20.8.2.3. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
      overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
      20.8.2.4. The aircraft is thoroughly ventilated.
      20.8.2.5. At least two AECMs (one must be a FN) remain onboard to observe and assist
      patients in the event of an egress.
   20.8.3. If cabin lights, lavatories, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft
   inter-phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing
   operations. Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to operate equipment
   to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
   20.8.4. Patients and passengers will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing.
   Crewmembers may enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated
   with the concurrent servicing operation.
   20.8.5. Patients (at the discretion of the MCD) may board/exit during servicing.
   20.8.6. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling process.
   On-load/off-load patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.

   20.8.7. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
   20.8.8. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft
   operations and shall inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger
   evacuation/safety.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight per T.O. 1C-130A-9.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
       20.9.2.1. Roller conveyers will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets.
       Rollers on the ramp will be stowed during patient on-loading or off-loading operations.
       20.9.2.2. Litter patients will be enplaned feet first and deplaned head first due to minimal
       degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to turn litter patients around on the
       cargo ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier.
       20.9.2.3. A five (5) high configuration using the center seat and litter stanchions is
       approved for all AE missions.
       20.9.2.4. The seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed for all AE missions when
       cargo requirements permit.
       20.9.2.5. Litter support straps will be secured to the aircraft floor prior to take-off. If
       litters are not in the tier, loose litter support straps will be secured in a top and bottom
       litter support bracket on the center seat and litter stanchion. This will remove a free-
       swinging strap hazard.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin‘s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. Therapeutic Oxygen. Therapeutic oxygen is not an integral system on the C-130
   aircraft. Use the PTLOX system.
   20.9.5. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the
   event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the Passenger Oxygen Kit (POK) or
   Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS).
   20.9.6. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle, or equivalent. EPOS or EEBDs can be used as an alternate oxygen
   source if the preplanned flight level is below FL350. NOTE: If a pressure demand regulator
   is used, the oxygen supply will be turned ―off‖ when the personal oxygen equipment is
   removed.
   20.9.7. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.8. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft utilization
for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      243


identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the number
seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Conflicts
   will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for a decision. Litter patients
   will be positioned forward of cargo pallets. Exception: If cargo is in place, and the PIC and
   MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD and Loadmaster will
   ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. For patient comfort and to permit in-flight rest for patients use the following for
   missions over 4 hours in duration:
       20.10.5.1. Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
       20.10.5.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
   20.10.6. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
   20.10.7. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and depositioning of operational/contingency support AE Missions.
   20.10.8. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously
   without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping
   more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will prevent
   potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is free
   from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.9. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
   20.10.10. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. Potentially contaminated
   patients must be decontaminated before entering the AE system. However, in extreme
   circumstances, the AMC/CC is the policy waiver authority for movement of
   contaminated/contagious casualties/personnel. If a waiver is approved, AMC will provide
   the capability to move a small number of contaminated/contagious casualties (a combination
   of approximately 50, with a maximum of 20 contagious personnel). AMC will equip AE
   crew operating in designated high-threat areas with the required equipment/supplies to carry
   out this mission. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
   below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid decompression.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-172.
   Stand-by CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations however, a CFR vehicle
   will be available upon request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
 244                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
   20.12.1. AIREVAC Priority. The PIC may request ―AIREVAC priority‖ for preferential
   ATC handling if a delay will affect a patient‘s well being. PICs will request priority
   handling if AE missions are experiencing long delays during takeoff or landing phases, that
   will affect a patient‘s condition.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Mission Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 with
   the ―30 minutes out call‖.
20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI 11-2AE Volume 3. ERO procedures for
   loading patients are authorized for contingency operations or when AE mission requirements
   dictate minimum ground time. ERO procedures can be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint
   training operations, exercises, etc. EROs will not be used in a noncontingency environment
   unless mission essential.
   20.14.2. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on
   headset during actual on-load procedures.
   20.14.3. When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak
   vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat and litter
   stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear.                 If situation
   requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated
   area.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs),
   joint training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all
   rollers stowed (cargo permitting)
       20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
       seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat ambulatory
       patients so they face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row
       of patients, in a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability. See T.O.
       1C-130A-9 for proper use of the tie down device.
       20.15.1.2. Litter Patients. Two crewmembers are required to work simultaneously in
       securing the opposite sides of the litters to the floor (applies when securing two or three
       litters together). Position litters side-by-side and longitudinally on the cargo area floor,
       with the patient‘s head toward the aft of the aircraft. A maximum of 15 litters, comprised
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                      245


     of five rows of three litters, can be floor loaded. Medical equipment can be secured on a
     litter(s) in the ―I‖ or ―L‖ sidewall litter tier or on the ramp. Secure the litters to the
     aircraft floor using the following procedures. (See Figure 3.1)
        20.15.1.2.1. One litter: Center litter over ―D‖ column. Use one tie-down device at
        each end of the litter. Connect clamp end of device to a tie-down ring in the ―C‖
        column, and run strap webbing over the litter handles, wrapping once around each
        handle. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of the tie-down device to the tie-down
        ring in the ―E‖ column on the other side of the litter. Remove slack from strap
        webbing, and ratchet the tightening device (see T. O. 1C-130A-9 for proper use of the
        tie-down device). Repeat process at other end of litter. Ensure ratchets have 1½
        turns.
        20.15.1.2.2. Two litters: Place litters side-by-side, and align inboard litter handles
        over ―D‖ column. Use two tie-down devices at each end of the litters. Connect clamp
        end of tie-down devices to tie-down ring in ―D‖ column, and run strap webbing over
        both inboard handles, then over respective outboard handle. Do not wrap strap
        webbing around any handles. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of the tie-down
        devices to the tie-down ring in ―C‖ or ―E‖ column (as applicable). Remove slack
        from strap webbing, and ratchet the tightening device (see T.O.1C-130A-9 for proper
        use of the tie-down device). Repeat process at other end of litter. Ensure ratchets
        have 1½ turns.
        20.15.1.2.3. Three litters: Place litters side-by-side and center inboard litter over ―D‖
        column. Use two tie-down devices at each end of the litters. Connect clamp end of
        tie-down devices to tie-down ring in ―D‖ column, and wrap strap webbing once
        around applicable paired litter handles, then over respective outboard handle. Do not
        wrap strap webbing around outboard handles. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of
        the tie-down devices to the tie-down ring in ―B‖ or ―F‖ column (as applicable).
        Remove slack from strap webbing, and ratchet the tightening device (see T.O. 1C-
        130A-9 for proper use of the tie-down device). Repeat process at other end of litter.
        Ensure ratchets have 1½ turns. NOTE: Due to forward pallet stop bumper locations,
        litter handles may have to be secured forward of the litter stanchions mounted at the
        forward bulkhead.

                                          Chapter 21

                       EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT (ENAF)

21.1. General. The objective is to move nuclear weapons safely. You may be tasked at any
time to airlift nuclear weapons. The amount of preparation time and degree of assistance you
receive will depend on the length of time the MAJCOM has to move the weapons.
21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews should be briefed and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this instruction and the
requirements in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and
common sense in what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Pay particular attention to the
following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons must be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high
   explosive that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Keep loading
   operations controlled and orderly at all times. Load or handle only one item or pallet at a
   time. Crews may ask shipper or receiver personnel to help, but the overall aircraft loading
   responsibility still belongs to the aircrew. Time permitting, you may refer to T.O. 1C-130E-
   16-1 or 16-2 for specific instructions that could help you during on-load or off-load. Step-
   by-step use of the TO 1C-130E-16 is not necessary.
   21.3.2. Use standard TO 1C-130-9 loading procedures. The TO 1C-130E-16 is basically an
   amplification of the TO 1C-130-9. You may use any or all of the portions of the TO 1C-
   130E-16 and be in compliance with TO 1C-130-9.
       21.3.2.1. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how
       many weapons can be properly restrained using TO 1C-130-9 criteria. Do not allow
       weapons to rub or touch each other when tied down.
   21.3.3. The TO 1C-130E-16-1 is an excellent guide to use when planning the maximum load
   of one type of weapon. The tiedown patterns will aid crews in floor planning a maximum
   tested load. It is allowable for these tiedown patterns to exceed TO 1C-130-9 restraint
   criteria when loaded and secured in the cargo compartment exactly as depicted in the TO 1C-
   130E-16-1. The TO 1C-130E-16-1 is also a useful guide for positioning approach, rolling,
   parking, and step-up shoring. Step-by-step use of the TO 1C-130E-16-1 is not necessary.
   21.3.4. The route of flight must not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air
   Force Special Weapons Over-flight Guide (SWOG). Over-flight of a foreign country with
   nuclear weapons is an extremely sensitive issue. Comply with SWOG instructions at all
   times. Crews without access to the SWOG, will request a route of flight that complies with
   the SWOG through command and control center (C2 agency) channels. The C2 agency must
   ensure the route of flight is provided to the aircrew by the most expeditious means available.
   If no route of flight is provided, fly normal ATC routings to the destination. Do not divulge
   the nature of cargo to any en route ATC facility or country to obtain a specific clearance.
   21.3.5. United States military custody of nuclear weapons is required. Normally, the copilot
   is the courier who has custody of the nuclear cargo for the flight. Under certain conditions,
 248                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   the shipper may furnish United States military couriers who will retain custody of the
   weapons in flight.
21.4. Aircrew Selection. All active duty aircrews (except 374 AW and 517 AS crews) may be
used for ENAF. Time permitting, AMC will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or
more of the following:
   21.4.1. Assign PNAF loadmasters and pilots so as to have one or the other on each aircraft.
   21.4.2. Place PNAF pilot and LM teams at the on-load bases to assist with the loads and
   flight plans.
   21.4.3. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
   21.4.4. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no
   advance preparation or assistance.
21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
   21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
   not specified, use a normal crew complement.
   21.5.2. The crew will be armed (courier and two additional crewmembers).
   21.5.3. Crewmembers tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than their
   personnel security clearance will be authorized emergency access to enough information to
   complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or
   wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
   21.6.1. Crews should be briefed on the following:
       21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
       21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
       21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material
       as required by IFR supplement and alternate airfields.
       21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 line numbers should be included. Obtain line numbers
       from the fire department prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 is a classified technical order
       that assigns an unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
       21.6.1.5. ―No lone zone,‖ two-person concept, and security requirements.
       21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
       21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
       21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions.
       21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
       21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
       21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                           249


       21.6.1.12. The PIC will ensure emergency procedures in paragraph 21.10 below are
       briefed
       21.6.1.13. ORM risks/levels/mitigating factors for the mission.
21.7. En Route Procedures. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating
procedures in the rest of this regulation.
   21.7.1. Flight Plans. Enter ―hazardous cargo‖ and the mission number in the ―other
   information‖ section of the flight plan. Crews carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items
   that could be mistaken for real weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency will
   enter ―inert devices.‖
   21.7.2. Radio Calls:
       21.7.2.1. Departure (on-load) base. Before starting the on-load, tell the tower to notify
       the fire department the ―on-load is commencing.‖ Prior to engine start, give the
       controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start
       time and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is
       standing by the aircraft for engine start.
       21.7.2.2. En route or offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of
       the following: command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission number
       and verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base
       does not have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately
       to the crash or fire protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
           21.7.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
           21.7.2.2.2. ETA.
           21.7.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
           (normally 1.1).
           21.7.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
           21.7.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 if requested. Obtain line numbers
           from the base fire department prior to starting the load at the on-load location.
           21.7.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
21.8. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. The courier must be a commissioned officer. A copilot or
navigator is the preferred option. The courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody, security,
safety, and delivery of nuclear weapons to authorized receivers.
   21.8.1. Prior to accepting and loading nuclear weapons, the shipper briefs the crew (at least
   the PIC, courier officer, and primary LM) on the nature and hazards of the cargo. PICs will
   brief crewmembers who didn‘t receive the shipper‘s briefing prior to flight. Ask the shipper
   to point out any specifics crews may need to handle the weapon, i.e. tiedown points, forklift
   stirrups, CDS procedures, etc.
   21.8.2. Time permitting, the courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody.
   The courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapons case and replace any
   broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept
 250                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   a damaged weapon without documentation. Document damage or broken seals on the DD
   1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
       21.8.2.1. Loadmasters will inspect weapons to ensure they are secured to carriers,
       conditions of tiedown rings, and condition of wheel casters etc.
   21.8.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD 1911 provided by the
   shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
   21.8.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   21.8.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the TACC Command Center to
   TACC/XOOMS, DSN 576-2597 for resolution.
21.9. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final
authority on security matters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the
host security force as much as possible. If the situation is serious and crews must load and
depart quickly, use judgment and dispense with the formalities. Prior to takeoff, the PIC will
ensure security support at all stations being transited that day through the TACC Command
Center.
   21.9.1. Home Station. Conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unauthorized
   explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not
   delay the mission to ―sanitize‖ the aircraft.
   21.9.2. On-load Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and
   stanchions, around the aircraft.
       21.9.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the
       area. The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy
       of the flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the
       aircrew courier before allowing anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons
       convoy to enter the restricted area without delay.
       21.9.2.2. ―No lone zone.‖ Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or
       aircraft when nuclear weapons are present (inside either the area or the aircraft). The
       purpose of a ―no lone zone‖ is to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear
       weapon. The easiest way to enforce a ―no lone zone‖ is to always be in pairs inside the
       restricted area (for example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member
       and one shipper). Maintain the two-person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow
       anyone to be alone in the cargo compartment.
   21.9.3. Arrival or En Route Base. As soon as the engines are shut down, deploy sufficient
   armed crewmembers around the aircraft to control access to the aircraft until the host base
   security force is established. The only personnel authorized near the aircraft are aircrew
   members and those support personnel necessary to install landing gear pins, ground power,
   and wheel chocks. Monitor these people at all times. Keep doors closed and be prepared for
   an immediate departure until the host base establishes security.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          251


21.10. Emergency Procedures.
   21.10.1. Security Emergencies. Crews may use deadly force to protect nuclear cargo and
   will resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on
   an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the
   nuclear weapons. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to
   thwart recovery of a nuclear weapon; the welfare and safety of the hostages should be
   considered in determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not
   deter the taking of decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes the use of deadly force
   to recover a nuclear weapon and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of a nuclear
   weapon. If crews are attacked, take the following actions:
      21.10.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
      21.10.1.2. If the attack occurs during on-loading or off-loading, load the weapons as fast
      as possible, even if improper procedures must be used. Ensure effective cargo restraint
      and take off immediately.
      21.10.1.3. Some weapons are equipped with a CDS that internally destroys the capability
      of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture
      of a weapon is imminent.
      21.10.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons.
      Emergency destruction (ED) of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval
      and will be accomplished by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive,
      authenticate, and carry out ED orders. When two properly identified shipper or receiver
      personnel concurrently request custody of the cargo for ED purposes, release the cargo
      using appropriate custody transfer procedures.
   21.10.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is jettisonable IAW
   the dash-1. The PIC bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or crash-land where the least
   amount of damage will result. Use the CDS, if applicable, prior to jettisoning or crash-
   landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the jettison restrictions in
   the SWOG.
   21.10.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If
   confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of US military
   aircraft in the FCG which states: US military aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities. US
   military aircraft cleared to overfly or land in a foreign territory are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities customarily accorded to warships. These privileges and immunities include,
   in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity
   from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspection); or other
   exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on
   board. Air Force PICs will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of
   jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the
   American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically, but firmly, refuse any requests
   to board or inspect, and get help through any available United States channel. Flash priority
   is authorized.

21.11. Maintenance on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   21.11.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons must not violate safety
   rules normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. As much as possible,
   have maintenance and servicing completed before loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft.
   Do not allow maintenance, such as the following, that could increase the possibility of a fire:
       21.11.1.1. Using flame or uncontrolled heat-producing items.
       21.11.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where
       significant fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components,
       etc.
   21.11.2. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear for
   minor maintenance (tire change, brake change, etc.) is not considered jacking.
   21.11.3. Do not refuel, defuel, or service oxygen while loading or offloading nuclear
   weapons. Have a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxygen
   servicing.
   21.11.4. The flight engineer or crew chief will monitor all maintenance on the aircraft while
   nuclear cargo is on board.
21.12. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations Guide. This guide describes recommended
actions for courier and crew during emergency nuclear airlift operations. It is designed for those
missions diverted en route to an on-load site where the crew does not have the opportunity to
receive a formal CRG, home station, or command post briefing. However, even if a formal
briefing is given, this guide may be used as a refresher. Security, time, and ground support may
not be sufficient to allow using this guide during emergency operations. In such cases, the
courier and crew must discuss all factors and use their judgment on the best course of action to
accomplish the mission. Safety and security is paramount in all decisions affecting
transportation of nuclear cargo.
21.13. Prior to On-load. Accomplish the following, either at home station or en route to the
on-load site:
   21.13.1. Review crew responsibilities and the procedures to be used during on-load (loading
   method, security setup, cargo receipt, two-person concept). Do not discuss classified
   information over inter-phone.
   21.13.2. If time permits, review the applicable section of the TO 1C-130E-16. Use of the
   TO 1C-130E-16 is not mandatory, but it may provide useful loading information for the
   cargo, such as parking and rolling shoring requirements and tiedown patterns.
   21.13.3. En route and 30 minutes prior to landing, contact the on-load site and notify them of
   ETA. Make support requirements known (fuel, materials handling equipment (MHE),
   transportation, security, etc.) at this time.
21.14. Arrival and On-load.
   21.14.1. Contact the senior security official and comply with the following: If crews have
   nuclear cargo on board, establish a restricted area and keep everyone off the aircraft. Provide
   armed security until the host security forces assume responsibility.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                     253


     21.14.1.1. A restricted area will be established around the aircraft. Ropes and stanchions
     are normally used to denote the restricted area. However, depending on the situation,
     crews may see additional guards, security vehicles, etc., rather than ropes. Be flexible.
     The key is whether the host base is furnishing enough security to protect the nuclear
     cargo.
     21.14.1.2. A single entry control point will be established.
  21.14.2. The entry controller must allow only those individuals into the restricted area who
  have been cleared by the courier. Tell the entry controller which individuals are authorized
  into the area and, time permitting, use crew orders as an EAL and prepared shipper lists.
  21.14.3. After security is established, verify shipper identification and accomplish the
  following with the shipper: (NOTE: Accomplish the shipper briefing and cargo inspection if
  time and the security environment permit.)
     21.14.3.1. Shipper briefing to include the following:
         21.14.3.1.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of nuclear weapons cargo,
         including line numbers from TO 11N-20-11, DOD class explosive hazard class or
         division, and net explosive weight (NEW).
         21.14.3.1.2. Courier escort requirements.
         21.14.3.1.3. Items requiring the two-person concept.
         21.14.3.1.4. Items that are CDS equipped and if the CDS has been activated (weapon
         not operational).
         21.14.3.1.5. Items exposed to an abnormal environment or not operational.
         21.14.3.1.6. Special handling or unique requirements particular to the cargo.
         21.14.3.1.7. Individuals required to assist during on-load or off-load. Pass the
         information to the entry controller.
         21.14.3.1.8. Authorized recipients at offload station. Get this information in writing.
         NOTE: If the primary LM and the PIC were not present for the shipper briefing, the
         courier must brief them on the applicable items.
     21.14.3.2. Cargo inspection:
         21.14.3.2.1. The primary LM, courier, and shipper will inspect the cargo for broken
         seals, exterior damage, security to carrier, wheel and casters, tiedown points, etc.
         Have the shipper annotate any discovered damage or discrepancies on the DD 1911.
         NOTE: Ensure the aircraft is ready for on-load prior to accepting custody of nuclear
         cargo.
         21.14.3.2.2. After the inspection, accept custody of the cargo by signing the DD
         1911.
  21.14.4. During on-load or off-load monitor the operation, assist as necessary, and ensure
  personnel comply with the two-person concept.
  21.14.5. After cargo on-load is complete and the crew is ready for engine start, the armed
  courier will deplane and tell the host base security to break down security and maintain
 254                                          AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   surveillance until aircraft departure. The courier and other armed crewmember will monitor
   access to the aircraft and crew entrance door during engine start.
21.15. En Route to Offload.
   21.15.1. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.15.2. Notify the TACC Command Center of departure time and ETA at the offload
   station. Be prepared to encode this information.
   21.15.3. If time permits, review the security and handling procedures to be used at the
   offload station. Do not discuss classified information over the interphone.
   21.15.4. Contact the agency specified in flight information publications (command post,
   base operations, or tower) 30 minutes prior to landing; ask if they have hazardous cargo
   information. If they don‘t, pass the following information:
       21.15.4.1. Call sign, type aircraft, and mission number.
       21.15.4.2. ETA.
       21.15.4.3. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 and DD 1911.
       21.15.4.4. If line numbers were not provided, pass on the following information:
          21.15.4.4.1. DOD explosive hazard class or division (normally 1.1).
          21.15.4.4.2. NEW.
       21.15.4.5. A request for isolated parking and for their security forces to meet the aircraft.
       21.15.4.6. Inert devices, if applicable.
21.16. Off-load.
   21.16.1. Upon arrival, deploy the armed courier (minimum) and team (if required) to provide
   security until the host security forces assume responsibility and establish the restricted area.
   Keep all doors closed and all ground personnel off the aircraft until security is established.
   21.16.2. Maintain the two-person concept.

                                            Chapter 22

                          SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES

22.1. General. Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to
complete the search as rapidly and efficiently as possible. A thorough scan of the search area and
accurate navigation significantly increase the probability of detection. Reactions to sightings
must be timely and accurate. This section outlines operational procedures for conducting
effective searches in the C-130 aircraft. Refer to the National SAR Manual Vol I/II for
additional information.
22.2. Communications with a Distressed Aircraft:
   22.2.1. Establish direct communications with the distressed aircraft as soon as possible.
   Accomplish this on the distressed aircraft‘s HF en route frequency, emergency VHF or UHF
   frequency, or any other frequency used by the distressed aircraft to alert air or ground
   facilities. The primary method of communications will be VHF or UHF when positive
   contact is made, see Table 22.1.
   22.2.2. Communications procedures should instill confidence in the distressed crew so they
   will know professional assistance is at hand. The crew will achieve this goal by employing
   the following:
       22.2.2.1. Coordinate immediate action items first and supplemental items as the mission
       progresses. Communications may be lost or the distressed crew may be forced to bail
       out, crash land, or ditch.
       22.2.2.2. Avoid long transmissions and provide pertinent data at periodic intervals to
       assure the distressed crew that contact is being maintained.
       22.2.2.3. Make all messages clear and concise. Know what to say and use a tone of
       confidence.
       22.2.2.4. If direct communications are delayed or fail completely, relay pertinent data
       and instructions through any air or ground station in contact with both aircraft.
       22.2.2.5. If all efforts to contact the distressed aircraft fail, transmit pertinent information
       and instructions in the blind, assuming the distressed aircraft is receiving but unable to
       acknowledge.
   22.2.3. Use the following frequencies and procedures during an intercept:
       22.2.3.1. Primary Frequency. The HF, VHF, or UHF en route frequency used by the
       distressed aircraft to alert air or ground stations and to request intercept.
       22.2.3.2. Secondary Frequency. Designate a secondary HF frequency shortly after initial
       contact. Instruct the distressed aircraft to change to this frequency if contact on the
       primary frequency is lost for a 10-minute period. When VHF or UHF contact is
       established, designate a secondary frequency. Prior to changing VHF or UHF
       frequencies, instruct the distressed aircraft to return to primary if contact cannot be
       established within 30 seconds.
   22.2.4. Initial Communications Procedures:
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       257


      22.2.4.1. Attempt initial contact with distressed aircraft before takeoff or as soon as
      practical on HF, VHF, or UHF. If initial contact is on HF, designate a VHF or UHF
      frequency to monitor. If initial contact is on VHF or UHF, instruct distressed aircraft to
      monitor en route HF frequency.
      22.2.4.2. Identify yourself and advise that you are en route to intercept.
      22.2.4.3. Instruct the distressed crew to use the present frequency as primary and not to
      break contact. Designate a secondary frequency.

      22.2.4.4. Instruct the distressed crew to transmit ―emergency‖ on the IFF.
      22.2.4.5. Obtain and evaluate the latest position, time, magnetic heading, IAS, GS,
      altitude, fuel remaining, personnel on board, and flight conditions of the distressed
      aircraft.
      22.2.4.6. Verify the nature of emergency and intentions of the distressed aircraft.
      22.2.4.7. If required, instruct the distressed aircraft to home on the signal transmitted by
      the rescue aircraft.
      22.2.4.8. Transmit supplemental data as appropriate to the situation such as altimeter
      setting, weather, estimated time to intercept (ETI), minimum safe altitude, etc.

22.3. Lost Aircraft Procedures. Fixing, intercepting, and escorting a lost aircraft is an
extremely difficult problem. Establish communications with the lost aircraft in order to initiate
orientation procedures. Use all possible aids to locate the approximate position of the lost
aircraft. In many cases, radar or direction finding stations will establish a bearing from the
station to the lost aircraft and indicate the general direction to fly to accomplish an intercept.
   22.3.1. Attempt contact with the lost aircraft as soon as possible. Climb to the highest
   practical altitude to increase communications range.
   22.3.2. If the lost aircraft is in contact with an air or ground station within reasonable range
   from the base, the rescue aircraft should orbit at altitude over the appropriate station until
   some clue is received which indicates the general direction or position of the lost aircraft.
   22.3.3. If all communication attempts prove unsuccessful, it is advisable to proceed in the
   most logical direction toward the lost aircraft.
   22.3.4. Instruct the distressed aircraft to maintain radio contact at all costs and orbit at its
   present position to keep within communications range, maintaining the highest practical
   altitude to improve communications.
   22.3.5. Ascertain amount of fuel remaining and the number of personnel aboard.
   22.3.6. Maintain communications with air or ground stations capable of providing bearings,
   fixes, or other assistance.
   22.3.7. Use every possible intercept method and electronic aid to ensure a successful
   mission.
       22.3.7.1. Employ the electronic aid that can provide the quickest and most reliable
       bearing or fix on the lost aircraft.
       22.3.7.2. Obtain a reliable bearing or fix and instruct the lost aircraft to leave orbit and
       head toward the rescue aircraft or the nearest suitable landing area.
       22.3.7.3. If in voice contact with the lost aircraft and unable to establish a bearing or fix,
       determine its approximate position from any surface objects, landmarks, or peculiar cloud
       formation. Landing lights and pyrotechnic flares improve detection capabilities at night.
   22.3.8. Lost Plane Fixing Procedures. (Figure 22.1). If the situation demands the lost
   airplane to land as soon as possible, determine its position and vector it to the nearest airfield
   as follows:
       22.3.8.1. Request the lost aircraft to orbit (360-degree turns) at its present position. Take
       HF, VHF, or UHF radio bearing from the distressed aircraft and plot it.
       22.3.8.2. Fly perpendicular to the bearing obtained for 5 minutes. Take and plot a
       second bearing. NOTE: Expect the lost aircraft to drift considerably if there are high
       winds in the orbit area.
       22.3.8.3. The point where the two bearings cross is the approximate position of the lost
       aircraft. Compute the distance to the lost aircraft by:
                                      TAS X Minutes Flown
                                         Bearing Change
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          259


      22.3.8.4. The fixing procedure will work in reverse; i.e., the rescue aircraft may orbit and
      take bearings on the lost aircraft while it flies a constant heading. Use this reverse
      procedure only as a last resort.
      22.3.8.5. Prior to vectoring a distressed aircraft in any direction, it is imperative to obtain
      a reasonably accurate position and ensure that the lost aircraft‘s altitude clears all terrain
      by a safe margin. Then relay the bearing, distance, and ETA to the closest airfield. Use
      an appropriate intercept course and monitor the progress of the lost aircraft.

Figure 22.1. Lost Airplane Fixing Procedures




22.4. Aircrew Search Briefings:
   22.4.1. Prior to dispatch on a search mission, the entire crew will receive formal and
   complete briefings in accordance with this volume. EXCEPTION: When the urgency of the
   situation compels the crew to scramble, the duty controller will brief the PIC and navigator
   while the rest of the crew completes necessary aircraft inspections.
   22.4.2. The PIC will brief and discuss with the crew the procedures and crew duties for the
   mission. The discussion will include:
      22.4.2.1. Objective of the search.
      22.4.2.2. Planning the search.
      22.4.2.3. Position reporting.
      22.4.2.4. Preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery.
      22.4.2.5. Preparation of flares and smoke signals.
      22.4.2.6. Sighting procedures.
      22.4.2.7. Feasibility of using NVGs.
      22.4.2.8. Use of IDS/FLIR (some airplanes) during search.
   22.4.3. Prior to beginning any low level search, complete the Search and Rescue Checklist.

22.5. Planning the Search. The pilot, in close coordination with the navigator, will evaluate
the situation for search coverage required, appropriate method of search, type of search pattern
required, altitude, airspeed, and track spacing.
   22.5.1. Consider many factors when determining appropriate search procedures for a
   specific mission. Several are:
       22.5.1.1. Weather conditions.
       22.5.1.2. Terrain characteristics if over land.
       22.5.1.3. Sea conditions if over water.
       22.5.1.4. Time of search, i.e. daylight or darkness.
       22.5.1.5. Survivor‘s signaling aids.
       22.5.1.6. Objective size, shape, color contrast with surroundings, and amount of
       freeboard.
       22.5.1.7. Status of objective; overdue, lost, crashed, or ditched.
       22.5.1.8. Estimated location of objective. When accurate position information is not
       available, you will most likely find the objective along the intended track from the last
       known position (LKP) to the intended destination, and within a reasonable distance on
       either side of this track.
       22.5.1.9. Endurance of search aircraft.
   22.5.2. Methods of Search. The three basic methods of aerial search are visual, radar, and
   electronic.
       22.5.2.1. Visual search is the primary method for day or night missions. Crews will use
       procedures outlined in this section for the most effective results.
       22.5.2.2. Radar search is the primary method of search when visibility prevents an
       effective visual search and the objective will provide a recognizable radar target.
       22.5.2.3. Use an electronic search when searching for survivors or aircraft with
       transceivers and radio beacons. Electronic search consists of monitoring distressed or
       preplanned beacon frequencies and searching for IFF transponder signals. Aircrew
       members will monitor applicable distress frequencies at all times while on search
       missions, except when making required transmissions.
   22.5.3. Intensity of Coverage. Determine the intensity of search coverage by the size of the
   area to be searched, number of aircraft available for search, and probability of finding the
   objective. Provide search coverage as follows:
       22.5.3.1. Use preliminary search coverage during the initial phases of a mission and
       during all night or electronic searches. This type coverage permits rapid and reasonably
       thorough coverage of the primary area. During this phase, assume you will easily sight
       or contact the search objective. Fly route, parallel, or creeping line search patterns at
       higher altitudes, faster airspeeds, and greater track spacing.
       22.5.3.2. Use concentrated search coverage during the maximum effort phase of a
       mission, or when attempting to locate a sighting or objective whose location is fairly well
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       261


     known. This type coverage ensures an area is thoroughly searched. Fly expanding
     square, parallel, creeping line, or sector search patterns at lower altitudes, slower
     airspeeds, and with smaller track spacing.
  22.5.4. Selection of Search Area and Search Pattern. The crew will select the search area
  and employ search patterns most likely to succeed in locating the objective. Location and
  size of the search area and the employment of search patterns is dependent upon the most
  probable position of the incident or survivors, taking into account previously mentioned
  factors. Determine the most probable position of a distress incident by a fix, position report
  at the time of an incident, or dead reckoning estimated from the LKP. Consider the
  movement of the object (parachute drift, raft drift, etc.) when establishing the search pattern.
  22.5.5. Select an Appropriate Search Pattern. Refer to National SAR Manual Volume I/II
  for additional patterns. (Figure 22.2 through Figure 22.7).
     22.5.5.1. Route Search. Employ the route search when the only available lead is a LKP
     or dead reckoning position and the intended track of the search objective. This usually is
     the first search employed. Assume the objective is on or adjacent to its intended track,
     and that the search objective will be easily discernible or possesses electronic detection
     aids.
     22.5.5.2. Parallel Search. Use a parallel search to cover large rectangular areas where
     the objective is expected to be between two points and possibly off track due to
     navigation error. Employ this simultaneously with or immediately after completion of a
     route search. Also, use a parallel search during concentrated searches since navigational
     accuracy is increased when long search legs are used.
     22.5.5.3. Creeping Line Search. When several aircraft are available, use a creeping line
     version of the parallel search in conjunction with or immediately after a route search. In
     addition, substitute the creeping line search for an expanding square search during
     concentrated coverage when time is not an urgent factor. It is more accurate and provides
     the same coverage as a square pattern.
     22.5.5.4. Expanding Square Search. Use the expanding square search for concentrated
     search of a small area where a sighting or search objective has been reported.
     22.5.5.5. Sector Search. Use the sector search when the position of distress is known
     within close limits and the search area is not extensive. It provides greater navigational
     accuracy, increased scanning opportunity, and is more flexible than the expanding square.
     22.5.5.6. Contour Search. Use the contour search in mountains or hilly terrain.
  22.5.6. Track Spacing. Carefully establish track spacing; it should never be greater than
  twice the visual detection range. By decreasing track spacing, the probability of detection is
  increased at the expense of time required to search a given area. The limit to which you can
  reduce track spacing is proportional to the limits of accuracy of navigation by search units.
  Optimum track spacing permits maximum expectation of target detection consistent with
  economic employment of search units. Generally, track spacing is greater during preliminary
  search than during concentrated search. Use sweep width for average conditions (Table 22.2
  through Table 22.5) as a basis to establish track spacing. Individuals in life jackets are
  almost impossible to detect unless they have signaling devices; use a detection range of 1/2
 262                                      AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


   nautical mile under these circumstances. A rule of thumb for determining track spacing is:
   expected visual detection range times two equals track spacing.

   22.5.7. Search Altitude. Select an optimum search altitude based upon the object of search,
   weather in the search area, electronic or visual location aids used, and any other known factor
   which would affect the search altitude. Generally, the lower the search altitude, the better the
   chance of seeing an object, provided the altitude is not so low that the aircraft speed becomes
   detrimental. During preliminary searches, the altitude will be higher to detect possible
   signals at greater distances. Recommend altitudes in Table 22.6 when other known factors
   permit their use.

   22.5.8. Search Speed. During preliminary searches, fly the aircraft at a speed that permits
   rapid coverage of the search area yet allows scanners an opportunity to detect large objects,
   signals, or wreckage. An optimum airspeed under these circumstances is 200 knots IAS.
   During concentrated search, fly the aircraft at airspeeds based on aircraft gross weight as
   depicted in the Aircraft Performance Manual. Conduct electronic searches at cruising speed
   unless otherwise directed.
22.6. Search Procedures:
   22.6.1. Rescue missions often involve commitment based upon calculated risks. Give full
   consideration to all safety factors. Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the
   safety of personnel or equipment. Do not jeopardize safety by inadequate preparation or
   short cuts to expedite takeoff, or arrival at search areas. For search missions use the Pre-

         searched.
         22.6.2.7.8. When other aircraft are involved, with the assistance of the ACS, track
         and assign search areas for other aircraft.
      22.6.2.8. The ACS will maintain radio communications with other search aircraft and the
      controlling agency as directed by the PIC.
      22.6.2.9. The loadmaster will assume supervision of the scanners and will schedule
      rotation and rest periods.
      22.6.2.10. All crewmembers will assist with the scanning duties when possible.
      22.6.2.11. When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area
      again. Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45 degrees to the previous
      search legs. This procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing.
  22.6.3. In the search area:
      22.6.3.1. Descend to search altitude (Table 22.6).
      22.6.3.2. Have navigator obtain the wind at search altitude. To visually cover the area
      thoroughly, slow the airspeed during search patterns (refer to the Aircraft Performance
      Manual).
      22.6.3.3. Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance.

     22.6.3.4. Vector other aircraft to the scene.
     22.6.3.5. Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors).
     22.6.3.6. Assume on-scene command until relieved by another duly appointed SAR
     aircraft. As other aircraft arrive, do the following:
        22.6.3.6.1. Establish contact on channels other than Guard.
        22.6.3.6.2. Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability.
        22.6.3.6.3. Assign altimeter setting, frequencies, search areas, patterns, and altitude
        separation.
     22.6.3.7. If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-
     scene commander.
  22.6.4. Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search by SCNS, INS,
  Doppler, or wind plottage. To determine wind direction and velocity by plottage, the
  following apply:
     22.6.4.1. Crestlines of waves on the surface of the water are perpendicular to the
     direction of the wind. Ripples and bow waves break away from the wind (downwind).
     The foam of whitecaps formed by breaking waves always appear to slide into the wind
     (upwind).
     22.6.4.2. There may be streaks in the water parallel to the wind direction. These streaks
     are called wind lanes.
     22.6.4.3. Turn aircraft so its longitudinal axis is aligned with the direction of movement
     of ripples, whitecaps, waves, or wind streaks.
     22.6.4.4. Read compass to determine magnetic direction of wind or its reciprocal
     (convert to true values, if necessary).
     22.6.4.5. Determine the direction in which ripples, waves, or whitecaps are moving to
     obtain actual direction of wind.
     22.6.4.6. Determine wind velocity by observing the appearance of the surface (Table
     22.7).

      22.6.5. When flying search patterns, turns must be accurate and uniform as possible. The
      following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns:
         22.6.5.1. Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible.
         22.6.5.2. Prior to starting the pattern, the navigator will brief the crew on the direction
         and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                       271


     22.6.5.3. Normally, all turns are standard rate (3 degrees per second) unless track
     spacing is less in distance than the diameter of a standard turn at a given speed. In this
     situation, continue turn to 180 degrees and adjust turn rate as required to remain within
     the pattern.
     22.6.5.4. On any search pattern employing a succession of 90-degree standard rate turns
     separated by cross legs, use the following procedure for computing time to begin each
     turn:
        22.6.5.4.1. Compute time required to fly entire first leg using ground speed for that
        leg.
        22.6.5.4.2. Subtract 19 seconds from the time computed in paragraph 22.6.5.4.1.
        22.6.5.4.3. Add the difference obtained in paragraph 22.6.5.4.2 to start search time.
        Resultant will be the time to begin the first 90-degree turn.
        22.6.5.4.4. Compute time required to fly the entire second leg using ground speed for
        that leg.
        22.6.5.4.5. Subtract 8 seconds from time computed in paragraph 22.6.5.4.4.
        22.6.5.4.6. Add the difference obtained in paragraph 22.6.5.4.5 to start search time.
        Resultant will be the time to begin the first 90-degree turn.
        22.6.5.4.7. To compute ensuing turn times, continue to subtract 8 seconds from
        successive full leg time and add the resultant to previous turn time.
     22.6.5.5. Search Pattern Execution:
        22.6.5.5.1. Route Search. Route search consists of one search leg along a given
        track. Normally, start the search leg at a point nearest the search aircraft‘s departure
        and search along the route of flight between the LKP and the intended destination. If
        the LKP is a position report, search between the LKP and the report where the next
        report was due. Extend the track approximately 25 NM to allow for navigational
        error on the part of the missing aircraft.
        22.6.5.5.2. Parallel Search. (Figure 22.2 and Figure 22.3). Use the parallel search
        to cover an area on each side of the search objectives intended track or an assigned
        rectangular area beginning on the corners. This pattern is a series of parallel legs
        (tracks) advancing from one side of an area to the other. The longer search legs will
        parallel the search objective‘s intended track or the long side of a rectangular search
        area. The short legs (cross legs) of a parallel search will be equal to track spacing.
        22.6.5.5.3. Creeping Line Search. (Figure 22.4 and Figure 22.6):
            22.6.5.5.3.1. The creeping line search is a series of parallel tracks advancing
            along a given track. The longer legs are perpendicular to the given track and are
            sufficient in length to allow for navigational error or drift of the search objective.
            The cross legs of a creeping line search will be equal to track spacing.
            22.6.5.5.3.2. Use the creeping line search pattern to cover an area on both sides
            of the search objective‘s intended track during and after route searches. Begin the
            pattern at one end of the intended track or at an assigned point along the track.
272                                    AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


         22.6.5.5.3.3. During concentrated search coverage, begin at the nearest corner
         and use the creeping line search to cover an assigned rectangular pattern.
      22.6.5.5.4. Expanding Square Search. (Figure 22.7):
         22.6.5.5.4.1. The expanding square search is a series of search legs which expand
         outward forming a square pattern. The first and second legs are equal in length to
         track spacing and each two succeeding legs are increased in length by a distance
         equal to track spacing. Legs are flown at right angles and all turns are made to the
         right.
         22.6.5.5.4.2. Begin the search at the center point of the area of highest
         probability. Normally, this pattern will not cover an area over 20 NM square. To
         minimize navigational error, plan for upwind-downwind and crosswind legs. Use
         cardinal headings if the wind is negligible or time does not permit adequate
         planning.
      22.6.5.5.5. Sector Search. (Figure 22.5):
         22.6.5.5.5.1. The sector search is a series of legs which originates from a datum
         point. The resulting close track spacing increases probability of detection near the
         datum point (center) and larger track spacing at the extremities. Each long leg is
         equal to the diameter of the area where the objective is most likely to be found
         and the cross legs are equal to computed track spacing.
         22.6.5.5.5.2. Begin at the datum point. Drop a smoke or other suitable reference
         marker over the datum point to facilitate precise search legs. Drop additional
         markers as required throughout the pattern. When planning the search, align the
         first leg with the search objective‘s direction of movement, drift, or with the most
         expeditious heading and make all turns to the right.
         22.6.5.5.5.3. Determine the heading of the succeeding leg using the information
         shown in Table 22.8. Each successive leg is determined by adding 90 degrees,
         plus the angle change (0) to the previous leg.
      22.6.5.5.6. Contour Search. (Figure 22.8 and Figure 22.9):
         22.6.5.5.6.1. Use the contour search to search mountainous or hilly terrain. Fly
         search legs around a peak or back and forth along the side of the mountain,
         depending upon the size and accessibility of the search area. As one contour
         circuit or leg is completed, normally decrease the altitude 500 feet and commence
         a new leg. Make turns away from the mountain during descent at the end of each
         leg when searching the side of the mountain.

              22.6.5.5.6.3. Start searching above the highest peak or ridge. Use extreme care
              during the search. Do not search when terrain conditions, high winds, turbulence,
              visibility. Or weather conditions create a hazard to safe flight.
              22.6.5.5.6.4. The pilot flying the aircraft will devote full attention to evaluating
              forward terrain for clearance and hazards to flight.
              22.6.5.5.6.5. All crewmembers will be especially watchful for power lines,
              cables, etc.
              22.6.5.5.6.6. Evaluate the area for turbulence and down drafts before descending
              to search altitude and flying close to a mountain side, as severe down drafts (2000
              feet per minute and greater) may occur. Do not fly where winds exceed 25 knots.
              22.6.5.5.6.7. Search from top to bottom, never from bottom to top. Search 500
              feet above and away from the terrain at all times, never closer.
              22.6.5.5.6.8. Exercise extreme caution when searching in canyons and valleys.
              Ensure adequate clearance before entering the area. Always maintain an ―out.‖
              Plan ahead of the aircraft and know which way to turn in an emergency.
              22.6.5.5.6.9. The PIC will ensure all loose equipment is securely fastened or tied
              down during mountain searches. Crewmembers will be strapped in if duties
              permit.
22.7. Sighting Procedures:
   22.7.1. When a sighting is made, the appropriate crewmember will notify the rest of the crew
   over interphone and indicate the position of the sighting by using the clock system; e.g.,
   ―Pilot, right scanner, target sighted at 4 o‘clock, 500 yards.‖
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                          275


  22.7.2. Immediately upon making a sighting, drop a smoke signal or sea dye marker to mark
  the approximate location of the sighting. During search missions, have marking devices
  readily available to jettison. The crewmember who launches the smoke will announce
  ―SMOKE AWAY‖ over the interphone. NOTE: During the presearch briefing, the PIC
  should designate who will launch smokes to mark a sighting. This will ensure a smoke is
  launched and preclude inadvertent multiple launches.
  22.7.3. Following the launching of a smoke signal and other marker, make a procedure turn
  to bring the aircraft back over the target, or if the observer can keep the target in sight, the PF
  should immediately turn in the direction of the target. The observer will continue to call out
  the target position and distance to orient the pilot. As the turn progresses, the pilot or copilot
  should be able to acquire the target.
  22.7.4. The following procedures are for confirmed sightings:
     22.7.4.1. Keep the target in sight at all times. Mark with dye marker or smoke floats.
     22.7.4.2. Turn on IFF.
     22.7.4.3. Report the sighting to the rescue center, OSC, air or ground station, or
     operating agency, as appropriate. This report should include:
         22.7.4.3.1. Position.
         22.7.4.3.2. Number of survivors.
         22.7.4.3.3. Condition of survivors.
         22.7.4.3.4. Type of emergency equipment used or needed by survivors.
         22.7.4.3.5. Action already taken or assistance needed.
         22.7.4.3.6. Condition of weather and sea.
         22.7.4.3.7. Fuel remaining in hours.
     22.7.4.4. Orbit the scene. When two planes are available, one should climb to an altitude
     that ensures radar detection by other craft or land bases, and the other should remain low,
     keeping the target in sight. Both aircraft should remain on station until relieved by other
     aircraft, rescue or recovery has been effected, or forced to return to base because of low
     fuel. In the latter event, mark the position with the best means available before departing
     the search area.
     22.7.4.5. Drop available emergency equipment and/or personnel, if required. If
     survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life
     rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices. For rescue equipment drops use
     the appropriate airdrop procedure contained in Chapter 19.
     22.7.4.6. Direct potential rescue or recovery vessels and other aircraft to the scene by
     radio or visual signals. Radio and visual signals you may use to direct a vessel to the
     scene to include:
         22.7.4.6.1. Radio message to the vessel. (If unsure of frequency guarded by the
         vessel, use 2182 KHz voice or 156.8 MHz VHF or FM.)
         22.7.4.6.2. ADF to take bearings on a vessel‘s LF or MF transmissions.
276                                         AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010


         22.7.4.6.3. VHF or UHF direction finder to take bearings of VHF or UHF
         transmissions.
         22.7.4.6.4. Radar and IFF.
         22.7.4.6.5. Signal light.
         22.7.4.6.6. Dropping message containers.
         22.7.4.6.7. Pyrotechnic flares.
         22.7.4.6.8. When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification,
         then indicate location of the target by:
             22.7.4.6.8.1. Circling the vessel at least once at low altitude.
             22.7.4.6.8.2. Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings
             at the same time.
             22.7.4.6.8.3. Sending a message by signal light or dropping a message, if
             possible.
             22.7.4.6.8.4. Heading in the direction of the target. Repeat this procedure until
             the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to
             comply by hoisting the International Flag, November (the International Flag,
             November, is a blue and white checkerboard). Crossing the wake of the vessel
             close astern at a low altitude means that the service of the vessel to which the
             signal is directed is no longer required.
      22.7.4.7. In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been
      sighted:
         22.7.4.7.1. Fly low over survivors with landing lights on.
         22.7.4.7.2. Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors.
         22.7.4.7.3. Drop two smoke signals a few seconds apart.
      22.7.4.8. Aircrews sighting survivors at night should:
         22.7.4.8.1. Mark the position by dropping smoke floats or float lights.
         22.7.4.8.2. Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships.
             22.7.4.8.2.1. If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving
             the target position in relation to the float light. Drop parachute flares to assist the
             rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target.
             22.7.4.8.2.2. If the objective has not been located, but its position is fairly well
             established, drop two float lights to outline the limits of the search area, the most
             probable position of target being halfway between the lights. Start the search
             from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for illumination.
             22.7.4.8.2.3. If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have
             one aircraft fly over the area at 3,000 feet dropping flares at 2- or 3-mile intervals.
             Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind
             at 500 feet to search.
AFI11-2C-130V3_908AWSUP_I 28 APRIL 2010                                                   277


22.8. Scanning Techniques. Precise scanning is one of the most important aspects of a search.
During a search, all crewmembers will make a cursory examination of the area. For maximum
effectiveness; however, assign personnel primary duties as scanners. If available, assign
personnel other than the basic crew to these duties. Thoroughly brief scanners on techniques
prior to beginning a search.
22.9. Departing Search Area:
   22.9.1. Notify ATC and the appropriate SAR agency on-scene SAR aircraft, Rescue
   Coordination Center, etc.
   22.9.2. If other search aircraft have not arrived, reconfirm position, and advise survivors
   when further assistance will arrive, if known.

awareness, predictive analysis, collaborative decision making, and dynamic retasking of
operational sorties when changes in combatant commander requirements or the environment
occur. It anticipates obstacles to sortie success and removes or mitigates them so that mission
legs are planned and flown at optimum level. The core of IFM is the Flight Manager. Flight
managers work with the Aircrews, Air Traffic Services, and appropriate C2 agencies through a
synchronized process to perform preflight planning of the sortie and assess its progress
throughout the prelaunch and airborne segments. If obstacles to sortie success arise on the
ground or in the air, Flight Managers proactively take action to avoid them or lessen their impact.

Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or bellow the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated
and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization,, or unit training. Also
called OPCON.

termed ―CLOSE WATCH‖ include CORONET missions and priority 1, 2, and 3 missions tasked
by the TACC. Other operational missions such as deployment, re-deployment, reconnaissance
operations, operational readiness inspections (ORI), AMC-directed channel or SAAM, and
JA/ATT missions may be designated ―CLOSE WATCH‖ as necessary.
Opportune Airlift—Transportation of personnel, cargo, or both aboard aircraft with no
expenditure of additional flying hours to support the airlift.
Originating Station—Base from which an aircraft starts on an assigned mission. May or may
not be the home station of the aircraft.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)—A logic-based, common sense approach to making
calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air
Force operations. It enables commanders, functional managers and supervisors to maximize

operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic process
appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Overwater Flight—Any flight that exceeds power off gliding distance from land.
Patient Movement Categories—
Urgent—Patients who must be moved immediately to save life, limb, or eyesight, or to prevent
complication of a serious illness.
Priority—Patients requiring prompt medical care that must be moved within 24 hours.
(Added-908AW) PRO—Aircrew vernacular for a proficiency flight
Routine—Patients who should be picked up within 72 hours and moved on routine/scheduled
flights.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. PICs are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs
inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be imposed
on the PIC for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)
Point Of No Return—A point along an aircraft track beyond which its endurance will not
permit return to its own or some other associated base on its own fuel supply.
Point of Safe Return—Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.
Positioning and De-Positioning Missions—Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.
Quick Stop—Set of procedures designed to expedite the movement of selected missions by
reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations.
Ramp Coordinator—Designated representative of the C2 whose primary duty is the
coordination of ground handling activities on the ramp during large scale operations.
Scheduled Return Date (SRD)—Scheduling tool used by air mobility units to predict when
crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and
provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMCgained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to
aborts or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.
Section—Subdivision of a formation. A section normally consists of 6 aircraft (2 elements).
Serial—Normally consists of 12 aircraft (2 sections or 4 elements).
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET

advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo, or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Tactics Team (STT)—A task-organized element of special tactics that may include
combat control, pararescue, and combat weather personnel. Functions include austere airfield
and assault zone reconnaissance, surveillance, establishment, and terminal control; terminal
attack control; combat search and rescue; combat casualty care and evacuation staging; and
tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Stabilization Point—Point on the DZ run-in course at which the lead aircraft should plan to be
stabilized at drop altitude and airspeed. This point will be planned to be at least 6 NMs prior to
the point of impact.
Station Time—In air transport operations, the time at which crews, passengers, and cargo are to
be on board and ready for the flight.
Suitable Airfield—Normally, suitable airfields are those which meet C-130 weather, fuel, and
runway requirements (Chapter 6) and are within 50 NM of flight plan course centerline.
Supplemental Training Mission (STM)—Opportune airlift of cargo and mission personnel
may be accomplished as a by-product of crew training missions. STMs may be authorized when
minor adjustments can be made to a scheduled training mission or when a productive aircrew
training mission can be generated for the airlift. The training mission will not be degraded in any
manner to accomplish the STM. Use of STMs for logistical support will be authorized only
when normal military or commercial transportation modes are unable to provide required
support. STMs may be approved by the operations group commander. On STMs PICs will
release maximum number of space available seats commensurate with mission requirements and
safety.
(Added-908AW) TAC—Aircrew vernacular for a tactical flight
Tactical Event—Airdrop, low level, formation, assault landing zone landings/takeoffs, and
threat avoidance/tactical approaches/departures.
Tanker Airlift Control Center (18 AF TACC)—The 18th Air Force direct reporting unit
responsible for tasking and controlling operational missions for all activities involving forces
supporting US Transportation Command‘s global air mobility mission. The 18 AF TACC
contains the following functions: Command and Control, Current Operations, Mission Support,
Logistics Operations Center, Aerial Port Control Center, Flight Planning, Diplomatic Clearance,
Weather, and Mission Support Planning Office. Also called 18 AF TACC.
Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF)—The fuel flow rate expected during the last hour at cruise altitude.
It is the difference between the fuel required for en route time plus one hour and fuel required for
en route time. TFF may also be computed using the TO 1C-130X-1-1 fuel flow table and the
estimated aircraft weight at destination. Estimated gross weight is determined by subtracting
fuel burn off from takeoff gross weight.

Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC)—Responsible for the
coordination and requirements for patient movement from communication zone to CONUS.
Time Out—Common assertive statement used to voice crewmember concern when safety may
be jeopardized.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Formerly known as Defense Business
Operations Fund-Transportation (DBOF-T). TWCF is part of the Air Force Working Capital
Fund (AFWCF). Normally, TWCF funds are used for costs that can be recovered from an air
mobility customer. Examples include: TDY costs, site surveys of CRG or airlift unit
deployment beddown locations, airlift unit level mission planning expenses, and support or
contract costs for deployed TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—Operations confined to a single service.
Unit Move—A mission airlifting military passengers or troops who originate from the same unit
and on-load point, are under the control of a designated troop commander and off-load at the
same destination.
Zero Fuel Weight—Weight, expressed in pounds, of a loaded aircraft not including wing and
body tank fuel. All weight in excess of the maximum zero fuel weight will consist of usable
fuel.
