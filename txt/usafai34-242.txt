1. Who is Eligible to be Interred in the USAF Academy Cemetery. Subparagraphs 1.1.
through 1.13. list those people eligible; however, certain general conditions apply. First, all
authorized military personnel must have discharges under honorable conditions (this also applies
to graduates). Second, Academy authorities will not normally approve requests to inter
individuals not authorized below.        However, the 10th Air Base Wing Commander,

approve such an exception.
     1.1. USAF Academy cadets.
     1.2. Air Force military personnel assigned to the USAF Academy or to tenant units at the

USAFAI34-242 2 MAY 2012                                                                          3

           death or inability of the parent or parents to provide such support.
2. Conditions for Interment in the USAFA Cemetery: The Air Force Academy promotes and
upholds the highest standards of integrity and conduct. When determining whether to inter an
otherwise eligible person in the USAF Academy Cemetery, the Superintendent will consider
current regulatory and statutory rules that apply to national or state cemeteries before making the
decision.
3. Reserving Gravesites:
   3.1. The Person Authorized to Direct Disposition (PADD) or Primary Next of Kin (PNOK)
   may not reserve a gravesite in advance. Once the need arises, the PADD or PNOK may
   apply in writing or in person to 10 FSS/FSOM, 5136 Eagle Drive, Suite 115 USAF Academy
   CO 80840 or by calling (719) 333-3323.
   3.2. The Academy cemetery uses only one gravesite to inter all people and their relatives
   authorized by paragraphs 1.1. through 1.13. However, when the cemetery inters an infant in
   the children's section, the sponsor is still entitled to a site in the adult section.
4. Deciding Which Cemetery Use:
   4.1. The PADD/PNOK may choose to inter a youth either in the children's section or in a
   family plot in the adult section. However, if the PADD/PNOK chooses the children's
   section, the casket must fit a gravesite and vault in this section.
   4.2. The PADD/PNOK may place memorial markers in the memorial section only if the
   deceased meets the requirements in paragraphs 1.1. through 1.13. and whose remains are
   nonrecoverable, not identified, cremated and scattered, buried at sea, or donated to medical
   science.
5. When the Academy Cemetery Holds Funerals. The cemetery normally schedules funerals
Monday through Friday, between 0900 and 1400. It does not normally hold funerals on legal
holidays or weekends.
   5.1. The Memorial Pavilion is available for use for funeral services during the same hours as
   the cemetery. Services may be held either in the Pavilion or at the graveside based on family
   preference.
 4                                                                 USAFAI34-242 2 MAY 2012


6. Conducting Interment Services. Normally, chaplains assigned to the USAF Academy
conduct interment services according to the ecclesiastical disciplines of their churches. If the
PADD/PNOK asks, or the USAF Academy staff chaplain invites them, civilian clergy may assist
in the services.
7. Conducting Flyovers. Follow 306th Flying Training Group directives when conducting
flyovers. Normally, flyover aircraft use a south-to-north flight path.
8. Permitting Disinterments. The cemetery permits disinterments only when the
PADD/PNOK furnishes valid reasons, in writing, or when a court order directs the disinterment.
The cemetery does not permit disinterments from one cemetery section for interment to another
section. Anyone wishing a disinterment must apply, in writing or in person, to 10 FSS/FSOM,
5136 Eagle Drive, Suite 115, USAF Academy CO 80840. The PADD/PNOK or estate must pay
any expenses related to disinterment.
9. Furnishing Grave Markers and Memorial Markers:
     9.1. The Academy cemetery furnishes and installs a flat bronze marker without cost to the
     family for each interment (this is the only authorized grave marker or monument). The
     cemetery installs temporary and permanent markers level with the ground. The Mortuary
     Affairs Office procures grave markers through the Veterans Administration and observes the
     standard in Attachment 2.
     9.2. The cemetery will not install grave markers that memorialize military events or groups
     of people. Arrangements for such ceremonies can be made through Gifts and Memorials
     (HQ USAFA/CMA).
10. Installing Vaults. The Academy cemetery installs concrete vaults for each interment. The
government procures these vaults at its own expense.
11. Placing Remains and Cremated Remains:
     11.1. Other than interment, the Academy cemetery has no means for viewing and storing
     remains. Therefore, the PADD/PNOK who wish to display or store remains must select a
     funeral home to receive them. Cremated remains may be sent to the Mortuary Officer for
     storage once a funeral has been scheduled.
     11.2. The PADD/PNOK who wants to inter or scatter cremated remains on USAF Academy
     grounds should send written requests to the Mortuary Affairs Office, which makes the
     arrangements. The PADD/PNOK may only inter or scatter the cremated remains of those
     people meeting the criteria in paragraphs 1.1. through 1.13. anywhere on the Air Force
     Academy with the approval of 10 ABW/CC.
     11.3. The PADD/PNOK may request burial for anyone authorized interment under
     paragraphs 1.1. through 1.13. even if the sponsor's remains are cremated and scattered at the
     Academy.
     11.4. The columbarium located on the East side of the Memorial Pavilion is available for
     placement of cremated remains.
        11.4.1. Each niche on the first seven rows measures 9-1/2" wide x 7-5/8" high x 12-1/2"
        deep. Each niche on the bottom row measures 9-1/2" wide x 7-3/8" high x 12-1/2"deep.
        11.4.2. Each niche is designed to hold two urns.
USAFAI34-242 2 MAY 2012                                                                         5


      11.4.3. A single 5x7 nameplate will be provided at no cost per niche.
12. Who May Not Enter the Cemetery. Minor children may not enter the Academy cemetery
unless accompanied by an adult.
13. Decorating or Placing Memorials in the Cemetery:
   13.1. Visitors may place cut flowers, wreaths, and artificial floral arrangements on graves
   and memorial plots. However, except for new burials, visitors must use flower vases
   provided by the Air Force Academy. Cemetery maintenance people will remove floral
   arrangements not in these vases and all arrangements when they become unsightly. Visitors
   may not plant flowers, place potted plants, or use vases, cans, jars, or other ornaments in the
   cemetery. Christmas wreaths, grave blankets, and other seasonal adornments may be placed
   on graves from December 1 through January 20. They may not be secured to markers.
   Grave floral blankets may not be larger in size than 2x3 feet. Each class may place
   decorative flags for each graduate and/or spouse buried in the cemetery but they must be
   removed upon completion of the event.
   13.2. Except for Memorial Day commemorations and dedications of memorial wall plaques,
   no one may place small flags on graves and memorial plots. The cemetery staff places small
   grave-decorating flags on the graves of military personnel on the Monday before the USAF
   Academy graduation and removes them the Wednesday following Memorial Day. When
   dedicating memorial wall plaques, the cemetery custodian will place small flags only in the
   memorial plot section and only for the minimum time necessary for the ceremony. For more
   information on dedications of memorial wall plaques, contact HQ USAFA/CMA (see
   USAFAI 32-1004).
14. Administering Cemetery Operations:
   14.1. The USAF Academy Mortuary Affairs Office (10 FSS/FSOM):

      military honors if the PADD/PNOK request them.

      date and time for the service.
      14.1.3. Furnishes the names and addresses of local funeral directors to the PADD/PNOK

      14.1.4. Advises the Development and Alumni Programs Division in the event of the
