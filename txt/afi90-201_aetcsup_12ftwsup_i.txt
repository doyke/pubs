                  AIR FORCE INSPECTION PROGRAM GUIDELINES

2.1. General Guidelines. MAJCOMs will establish inspection programs consistent with
mission requirements and inspection program guidelines outlined in this instruction.
MAJCOM/IGs conduct independent inspections to assess unit efficiency, effectiveness, combat
readiness, and nuclear surety, and report results of such inspections. HAF and MAJCOM
functional and directorate staffs, working closely with their IG counterparts, will develop
applicable guidelines, procedures, criteria, checklists, and resolution requirements for conducting
these inspections.
2.1. (AETC)General Guidelines. AETC organizations and activities are subject to inspection
at any time as directed by the AETC/CC.
   2.1.1. Inspection Notification. For active duty (AD) units, notification for regularly
   scheduled inspections will be determined by MAJCOM/IG for each inspection type. ARC
   unit notification for regularly scheduled inspections will be forwarded to the appropriate
   ARC Gatekeeper with a minimum one year notice.
       2.1.1.1. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice Inspections. No-notice and minimal-notice
       inspections are conducted to assess the day-to-day compliance, operational readiness, and
       nuclear surety of units. No-notice and minimal-notice can be used for either full-scale or
       limited-scale inspections.
       2.1.1.1. (AETC) The no-notice/minimal-notice inspection program will concentrate
       efforts in two areas: (1) inspections for cause and (2) random sampling. Inspections for
       cause will focus on unit areas that did not fully meet standards (marginal or
       unsatisfactory) during a prior inspection. Random sampling will be used to verify
       compliance across the command. All active duty units are equally susceptible to this
       inspection program component. HQ AETC/IG is the approval authority for all no-
       notice/minimal-notice inspections.
           2.1.1.1.1. For all units, no-notice is defined as 72 hours or less; minimal-notice is less
           than 45 calendar days. Gatekeepers will be included in the planning of these
           inspections and will be treated as trusted agents.
           2.1.1.1.2. ARC units will participate in MAJCOM/IG no-notice and minimal-notice
           inspection programs (NSI and NORI). AFRC/CC may direct no-notice or minimal-
           notice AFRC unit CIs. MAJCOM/IGs must recognize there may be limited
           availability of ARC unit personnel in some functional areas.
           2.1.1.1.2. (AETC) AETC-gained Air Reserve Component (ARC) units are exempt
           from the no-notice/minimal-notice inspection program pending further coordination.
           2.1.1.1.3. MAJCOM/IGs with OCONUS units will make every effort to minimize
           notification to units when inspecting outside regularly scheduled inspections based on
           the host nation and NATO limitations.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                13


  2.1.2. Inspection Footprint. Minimize the inspection footprint to the maximum extent
  practical. When deemed appropriate, MAJCOM/IGs may give credit for unit activity in
  conjunction with exercises and contingencies, real world operations, self-inspections,
  combined inspections, other inspections/evaluations, sampling techniques, and other
  measures of sustained performance to minimize footprints. These measures can be used to
  adjust the breadth, duration, and incidence of inspection activities. When practical, IG teams
  may deploy to forward locations and headquarters during exercises and contingency
  operations to evaluate processes and performance. Inspectors may observe, but will not
  interfere with, real world activities unless observed actions are in direct violation of AFIs,
  technical data, or injury to personnel and/or damage to equipment could occur.
     2.1.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs will determine which of their ARC units are gained by another
     MAJCOM. When scheduling inspections for units gained by multiple MAJCOMs,
     MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate the inspection schedule in order to conduct concurrent
     MAJCOM inspections, to the maximum extent possible.
  2.1.3. Inspection Alignment with Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) battle rhythm.
  Make every attempt to de-conflict inspections with Air and Space Expeditionary Force
  (AEF) battle rhythm, enabler unit deployments, and out of cycle expeditionary support
  deployments. If possible, avoid inspecting units within 60 days before or after a major AEF
  deployment (more than 20 percent of a unit‘s assigned personnel deployed). Final
  determination with be with MAJCOM/IG.
  2.1.4. Inspection Frequency Deviations. MAJCOM/CC approval is required to exceed any
  inspection frequency directed in this publication. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG when a
  unit will exceed the required inspection frequency and will provide the anticipated inspection
  date(s). Reference applicable chapter in this publication for specific inspection frequencies.
  2.1.5. HAF Checklists.
     2.1.5.1. HAF checklists standardize assessment criteria and facilitate AF, MAJCOM, and
     Numbered Air Force (NAF) inspection, evaluation, and unit self-inspection programs.
     FAMs must obtain AFIA approval of all checklists. These checklists and templates will
     be available on the AF Checklist site (https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/afia/).
     2.1.5.2. Functional checklists are a tool available for use by Higher Headquarters (HHQ)
     and unit personnel when conducting assessments of their programs or activities. The
     checklists do not constitute the order or limit the scope of any HHQ or unit self-
     inspection. The checklists do not limit the requirement to comply with any published
     DOD or AF policies, directives, or instructions. The scope of Nuclear Surety Inspections
     is limited to requirements listed in TO 11N-25-1 and this instruction.
     2.1.5.2. (AETC) Until Headquarters Air Force (HAF) checklists are established on the
     Air Force checklist site, AETC organizations may use functional checklists published on
     the HQ AETC/IG portal and other published guidance to help prepare for inspections.
     The HQ AETC/IG team will always inspect per the most current AFIs, Department of
     Defense (DoD) policy, applicable law, or other appropriate formal policy.
     2.1.5.3. Once an applicable HAF checklist is published, Lead MAJCOMs will
     supplement HAF checklists (with MAJCOM references), as required for command-
     specific responsibilities. MAJCOMs will not supplement HAF checklists with any
14                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


     guidance authored above the MAJCOM level.            Checklists will be coordinated with
     applicable HAF functionals, AFRC, and NGB.
     2.1.5.4. Checklist Currency. Checklists must be updated within 90 days of guidance
     changes being posted on the AF e-Publishing website. All checklists will be reviewed
     annually by the HAF/MAJCOM functional staffs; HAF checklist review/update
     conducted NLT 31 Jan with MAJCOM supplement review/update NLT 31 Mar. All
     updates will be approved by AFIA (for HAF checklist) or MAJCOM/IG (for MAJCOM
     checklist updates).
     2.1.5.4. (AETC) Within 90 calendar days of an AFI, AETCI, or official guidance
     (technical orders [TO], etc.) published change, the HQ AETC staff functional will update
     all inspection checklists affected by the change. If no checklist change is necessary, the
     HQ AETC staff functional will change the checklist date to confirm review. HQ AETC
     staff functionals will complete an annual review by 31 March of all inspection checklists
     for currency, accuracy of information, and conformance to the standard Air Force
     checklist template. All necessary updates and/or date changes to confirm the annual
     reviews will be coordinated with the IG functional inspector for posting on the HQ
     AETC/IG portal. All HQ AETC checklists will be coordinated by the HQ AETC staff
     functional through the NGB-IGD or AFRC/IG for applicability prior to posting on the
     HQ AETC/IG portal.
  2.1.6. Selection for Performance-based Evaluations. Inspection teams will randomly select
  individuals/teams for executing performance-based evaluations in lieu of the inspected unit
  self-identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate).
  2.1.7. Rating System. Inspection criteria serve as a guideline and are not a substitute for
  sound inspector judgment. For Total Force Integration initiative units, the association will be
  given an overall comprehensive rating to reflect how the integrated unit would have
  performed had the integrated units been presented to a combatant commander for
  employment. Refer to T.O. 11N-25-1 and paragraph 5.7 of this instruction for NSI rating.
     2.1.7.1. (Added-AETC) To ensure objectivity and consistency, inspectors use
     governing directives, their functional expertise, and an extensive validation process to
     determine ratings. Ratings are not determined by comparing one unit with another.
     2.1.7.2. (Added-AETC) Based on the small footprint of no-notice/minimal-notice
     inspections and their focused nature, individual area ratings will normally be three tiers:
     unsatisfactory, marginal, or satisfactory. Normally, an overall rating will not be assigned.
  2.1.8. Validation. MAJCOMs will establish a validation process that provides the inspected
  unit the opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential deficiencies
  identified during the inspection as well as coordinate with the appropriate MAJCOM FAM(s)
  on all critical and significant deficiencies identified during the inspection. Inspectors will
  validate all potential deficiencies at the lowest appropriate unit and MAJCOM FAM level
  and resolve any policy interpretation differences with the appropriate FAM/OPR. All
  validated deficiencies will be documented in the report. This process applies to deficiencies
  levied against other MAJCOM units or HHQ organizations.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 15


  2.1.8. (AETC) As the inspection progresses, IG team chiefs and team members will provide
  status updates to the unit functional leads and commanders. These validation sessions
  typically cover inspected areas, general observations, positive areas noted, and potential
  problem areas, but will not cover ratings. This provides the inspected units an opportunity to
  clarify issues noted. If a significant disagreement on policy/procedures occurs during
  validation sessions, the IG team member will coordinate with the higher headquarters (HHQ)
  functional for clarification. The HHQ functional will provide a written response to the IG
  inspector (E-mail is valid) by the last duty day of the inspection to confirm clarification. By
  the end of the inspection, commanders should have a complete understanding of all the facts.
  IG leaders will offer daily updates to senior leaders covering the same areas.
  2.1.9. Use of Contractors. Contractors are prohibited from acting in the capacity of an IG
  inspector; however, contractors may be consulted for their functional expertise. Use of
  contractors must be in compliance with DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining
  Workforce Mix.
  2.1.10. Contracted Functions. Assess and rate contracted functions against Performance
  Work Statements (PWS). Assess adequacy of PWS to meet mission requirements.
  Functional checklists will be tailored to address differences between AF checklists and PWS
  requirements. The contracting officer and/or quality assurance (QA) personnel should
  accompany the IG during inspections. Develop and implement safeguards to prevent
  contractor claims related to inspections activities.
  2.1.10. (AETC) Inspect contracted functions according to guidance in Attachment 6
  (Added).
     2.1.10.1. Rating and Report. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
     contractors will not. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through QA
     personnel. Contractors may be provided with applicable portions of the report in-
     accordance-with (IAW) DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DOD Freedom
     of Information Act Program.
     2.1.10.2. Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the
     contracting officer and appropriate unit personnel. Deficiencies will be tracked IAW
     paragraph 2.6 Note: Only the Contracting Officer can take formal action against the
     contractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified
     during inspections.
     2.1.10.3. Inspector Training. Inspectors and augmentees will complete Phase I QA
     personnel training or similar on-line training listed below prior to inspecting contracted
     functions. MAJCOMs will document in their supplement to this AFI if additional
     contract-specific training is required. Phase I QA personnel training provides general
     knowledge of QA personnel responsibilities and procedures. On-line training shall
     consist of at least two of the following three courses:
         2.1.10.3.1. ―Seven Steps to Performance-Based Acquisition‖ training available on-
         line at: http://www.arnet.gov/comp/seven_steps/index.html.

          AQ&CourseID=15"
   2.1.11. Installation Exercise Program Office (IEPO).
   2.1.11. (AETC) Inspectors will not be available for internal or external media interviews
   during an inspection. Remarks attributed to an IG team member for publication in a base
   newspaper or other media must be coordinated through HQ AETC/PA. The HQ AETC/IG or
   designated representative is the final approval authority.
       2.1.11.1. Organization. The wing/installation commander determines whether the
       exercise program resides under the vice commander (CV), plans and programs office
       (XP), IG, or other equivalent staff-level office, unless otherwise directed by MAJCOM.
       2.1.11.2. Staffing. Staffing levels vary among units based on mission complexity, but
       adequate manning is essential to mission readiness. Successful IEPOs typically have
       three or more personnel assigned. Recommended staffing includes, as a minimum, one
       officer (field grade or civilian equivalent) and one enlisted (senior non-commissioned
       officer (SNCO) or civilian equivalent). IEPO offices typically include a blend of AF
       specialty codes (AFSC) and experience that complement the mission requirements.
       2.1.11.3. Training. Prior to evaluating wing/installation activities, exercise evaluation
       team (EET) members will complete the core training outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
       Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. Additional training
       may be directed by the EET chief to enable EET members to meet specialized team,
       functional area, host-nation, or local requirements or standards. EET members may
       attend the USAF Inspectors Course as outlined in paragraph 2.8 IEPO personnel and
       wing-designated EET members should serve as MAJCOM inspection team augmentees.
   2.1.12. Exercise Safety. During exercises where immediate distinction between non-
   participants (i.e., inspectors, evaluators, and observers) and participants (i.e., unit personnel,
   exercise players, and opposition forces (OPFOR)) is important to exercise safety, security,
   and/or success, non-participants will be clearly identified through the wear of
   safety/reflective vests or other clearly identifiable markings. Safety procedures and markings
   will be included in all exercise plans/scenarios and must be disseminated prior to the start of
   evaluations or exercises.
   2.1.13. (Added-AETC) Observer Program. See Attachment 7 (Added) for guidance on
   the AETC observer program.
2.2. Limited Inspections. Limited inspections are smaller, targeted inspections that assess
selected elements of operational readiness and/or compliance of inspected units. Limited
inspections have a smaller footprint than a full-scale inspection. Limited inspections will be
rated on the same scale as the associated full scale inspection.
2.3. Additional Inspections.
   2.3.1. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). The gaining MAJCOM will conduct a FRI of a
   state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition or when asked to do so by
   the NGB. Conduct the FRI according to ANGI 90-201, The Inspection System/Inspector
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 17


  General Activities. As soon as an acceptable FRI is complete on a unit, the gaining
  command assumes the responsibility assigned in AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of the Air
  Reserve Component (ARC) Forces.
  2.3.2. Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Inspections. Air Force Materiel
  Command (AFMC) IG will conduct BSAT inspections in accordance with governing
  directives. The inspection is designed to evaluate a unit's compliance with applicable
  policies for laboratory operations within Biological Safety Level II/III (BSL) facilities which
  store and use BSAT.
     2.3.2.1. Responsibilities. AFMC/IG will conduct inspections for all units that are
     registered by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to handle BSAT in accordance with
     the governing directive DODI 5210.89_AFI 10-3901, Minimum Security Standards for
     Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxins.
     2.3.2.2. Frequency. The maximum inspection interval for BSAT inspections is 18
     months. Inspections by the CDC or other HHQ inspections may be used to satisfy this
     requirement.
     2.3.2.3. Rating. BSAT inspections will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: In Compliance, In
     Compliance with Comments, Not In Compliance.
     2.3.2.4. Scope. Inspections will assess compliance with guidance and policy in
     applicable program and personnel management functional areas. At a minimum, the
     following areas will be assessed:
         2.3.2.4.1. Management. Ensure facilities and laboratories are properly maintained
         and registered to store BSAT.
         2.3.2.4.2. Inventory/Accountability.     Review and validate documentation and

         2.3.2.4.11. Waivers & Exceptions. Confirm all waivers or exceptions to policy were
         vetted through HQ AFMC and HQ AF. Ensure proper waiver authority was used for
         all waiver requests.
     2.3.2.5. Reporting. BSAT inspection reporting will follow procedures and requirements
     outlined in this instruction for compliance inspections.
  2.3.3. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Inspections.                         Participating
  MAJCOM/IGs will conduct NWRM inspections IAW applicable guidance. This inspection
  is designed to evaluate a unit‘s capability to manage NWRM assets and will focus on the
  management and positive inventory control (PIC) of NWRM. Due to the critical nature of
  NWRM, NWRM inspections may be conducted in conjunction with other inspections (NSI,
  ORI, CI), but will be a separate, distinct, inspection providing a separate inspection report.
     2.3.3.1. Ratings. NWRM inspections will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: In Compliance, In
     Compliance with Comments, Not In Compliance.
     2.3.3.2. Applicability. NWRM inspections apply to all units that ship, handle, or store
     any item listed on the DOD or AF list of NWRM. Units that have handled NWRM in the
     past but have no indication of future NWRM involvement may not be subject to NWRM
     inspections.
         2.3.3.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs will determine units to be inspected based on the official
         Air Force and DOD list of NWRM NSNs.
         2.3.3.2.1. (AETC) Wings or groups with nuclear weapons related materiel (NWRM)
         will be incorporated into the HQ AETC/IG inspection cycle during the annual
         scheduling conference. To the maximum extent possible, NWRM inspections will be
         aligned with the wing and group compliance inspections (CIs). However, because of
         the 24-month NWRM inspection cycle versus the 36-month CI inspection cycle, units
         should be prepared for multiple inspections.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                              19

         established close-out date, AF/A1S will provide the list of individuals meeting the
         criteria for inspection to SAF/IGI. In addition, at the conclusion of each round of
         inspections, AF/A1S will post the individual inspection results and final report on the
         AF Wounded Warrior (AFW2) public website.
         2.3.4.3.3. SAF/IGI. Oversees AF inspection requirements and coordinates with
         applicable MAJCOM/IGs for schedule and execution of inspections. Assists SAF/IG
         in distribution of WII Report and associated letters to SECAF, ASD(HA) and
         congressional committees.
         2.3.4.3.4. AFIA/SG. Builds consolidated AF report from all MAJCOM WII
         inspections for each reporting period. NLT 30 days prior to OSD-established close-
         out date, staffs AF WII Facility Inspections report, congressional letters and

AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  21


   2.3.6. (Added-AETC) Followup Inspections. Followup inspections evaluate actions taken
   by unit commanders to correct deficiencies identified during the CI.
       2.3.6.1. (Added-AETC) Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Followup inspections are
       normally scheduled within 180 calendar days of an inspection. They are normally
       conducted for marginal or unsatisfactory ratings at the squadron (or equivalent) level and
       above.
       2.3.6.2. (Added-AETC) GSUs. Followup inspections are normally scheduled within
       180 calendar days of an inspection. They are normally conducted for marginal or
       unsatisfactory ratings at the detachment (or equivalent) level and above.
   2.3.7. (Added-AETC) Air Traffic System Evaluation Program (ATSEP), Aircrew
   Standardization and Evaluation Visit (ASEV), and Standardization and Evaluation
   Program for Weather Operations (SEPWO) evaluations. These evaluations will typically
   be integrated and conducted concurrently with AETC CIs. Formal reports will be attached to
   and summarized in the CI report.
2.4. Self-Inspection. MAJCOMs will establish self-inspection programs for subordinate units.
Self-inspection provides commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health and
complements external assessments. Units will use HAF inspection checklists, once established,
and deficiency codes listed in Table 2.1 to conduct self-inspections. Unit, NAF, or MAJCOM
supplemental checklists may be developed, as appropriate. Basic responsibility for problem
solving and the corrective action process resides at the lowest appropriate command level.
Problem solving should be applied through the AF eight-step problem solving model as outlined
in the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Playbook (or SAF/SO
approved publication) leading to identification of root causes and solutions to deficiencies.
2.4. (AETC)Self-Inspection. All AETC organizations, to include HQ AETC-gained units,
directorates, and numbered Air Forces (NAFs), will develop, document, and manage a self-
inspection program (SIP).
   2.4.1. (Added-AETC) A primary and alternate point of contact (POC) will be appointed to
   manage the comprehensive program.
   2.4.2. (Added-AETC) Organizations, down to the squadron level, will publish their SIP
   procedures according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. At minimum,
   policies will direct units to conduct a thorough annual self-inspection covering all functional
   areas according to established AFI timelines.
       2.4.2.1. (Added-AETC) The policy will require commander or director (squadron,
       group, wing, directorate, etc.) level review until all issues are resolved.
       2.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Individual organizations will determine how, and to what
       detail, the review will occur.
       2.4.2.3. (Added-AETC) At minimum, the policy will direct quarterly group commander
       reviews, and annual wing commander (or equivalent director level) reviews.
   2.4.3. (Added-AETC) Units will develop processes to ensure self-inspection checklists are
   current/applicable; individuals conducting self-inspections are properly trained (as defined by
   the unit); and deficiencies are accurately tracked, resolved, and reported to the appropriate
   levels. It is highly recommended the deficiency process incorporate staff assistance visit

   (SAV), CI, health services inspection, and other inspection results to facilitate a
   comprehensive trend analysis of noncompliant issues.
   2.4.3. (12FTW) 12 FTW groups, divisions, and subordinate units measure compliance with
   applicable regulatory requirements, including but not limited to, applicable laws, regulations,
   instructions, and technical orders; self-inspection checklists; common core compliance area
   application items; other HHQ inspection requirements; and deficiencies from other
   evaluations. Minimum baselines for self-inspection checklists are the applicable AETC/IG
   inspection checklists. Commanders and division chiefs may expand checklists to accurately
   assess organizational compliance and performance. The program will be managed IAW
   Attachment 12.
   2.4.4. (Added-AETC) Contractor deficiencies will be tracked/reviewed separately by
   appropriate personnel, according to DoDR 5400.7, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
   Program, and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, standards, to ensure proper handling of
   proprietary information.
   2.4.4. (12FTW) The wing‘s SII program is a tool to manage the local application of Air
   Force and AETC SIIs. SIIs focus management attention, gather data, and/or assess the status
   of specific programs and conditions in the field. SIIs may also be used to determine the
   degree of compliance with directives, policies, and procedures, gather data on known or
   suspected problems, identify specific deficiencies, or to confirm a problem is resolved. 12
   FTW commanders and division chiefs are responsible for implementing SIIs into their
   overall inspection program. The program will be managed IAW Attachment 13.
2.5. Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS).
   2.5.1. Description. An unclassified web-based software program serving as an inspection
   tool comprised of planning, executing, reporting, and corrective action management. In
   addition, IGEMS provides MAJCOM/IG teams with the capability to gather trend data on a
   multitude of inspection variables. If the need arises for classified reporting, MAJCOM/IGs
   will use classified reporting channels.
   2.5.2. Phased Implementation. IGEMS will be phased for implementation by MAJCOM/IG
   teams on a schedule to be determined in coordination with SAF/IGI and MAJCOM/IGs.
   2.5.3. Access management. Access to IGEMS will be administered by SAF/IGI and
   MAJCOM/IG Administrators.
   2.5.3. (AETC) HQ AETC/IGIX administers the Inspector General Evaluation Management
   System IGEMS for HQ AETC.
   2.5.4. Trend Reports. SAF/IG will use IGEMS to extract trend data of MAJCOM/IG results.
2.6. Inspection Write-ups. For CIs, ORIs, NORIs, HSIs, and additional inspections, inspection
reports will only include write-ups categorized as Strengths, Deficiencies, and Recommended
Improvement Areas (RIA). RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-
compliance; they are only used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action. For
INSIs, LNSIs, and NSIs see Chapter 5.
   2.6.1. Deficiency write-ups will:
       2.6.1.1. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 23


     2.6.1.2. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary to
     clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone should be
     adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
     2.6.1.3. Be assigned a deficiency severity of Critical, Significant, or Minor.
     2.6.1.4. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order, policy letter, or other
     source documentation.
     2.6.1.5. Address impact of continued deviation or non-compliance for critical
     deficiencies.
     2.6.1.6. Identify MAJCOM functional OPR (MAJCOM functional office responsible for
     coordinating on unit‘s corrective action plan).
     2.6.1.7. Identify Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable.
     2.6.1.8. Deficiencies that involve hosts/tenants outside the inspected unit‘s chain-of-
     command, higher headquarters (HHQ), other MAJCOMs, or non-AF entities will be
     categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.
  2.6.2. Deficiencies External to Inspected Unit. When a MAJCOM/IG team assigns a
  deficiency to an organization outside their MAJCOM, the inspecting IG team will notify the
  owning MAJCOM/IG of the deficiency (or SAF/IGI for HAF or non-AF deficiencies) and
  courtesy copy both the tenant and host base units. Once notified, the owning IG will be
  responsible for tracking status and notifying the inspecting MAJCOM/IG when closed (See
  paragraph 5.12.2 for reporting, tracking, and closure reporting of DTRA-identified NSI
  deficiencies). In instances where the inspection involves associate units, coordination
  between the associated and associating MAJCOM/IGs on how deficiencies are assigned,
  assessed, and resolved will be essential to ensuring timely resolution.
  2.6.3. Deficiency Corrective Actions.
     2.6.3.1. The MAJCOM/IG will track all deficiencies and provide the inspected unit with
     reply instructions as part of the final report. Corrective action plans will be provided to
     MAJCOM/IGs NLT 60 days after final inspection report is published.
     2.6.3.2. The MAJCOM/IG, after review and coordination by the responsible MAJCOM
     FAM(s), will close all critical and significant unit-level and MAJCOM-level deficiencies.
     These deficiencies will be inspected during the unit‘s next scheduled inspection.
     2.6.3.3. Minor deficiencies assessed to the inspected unit may be closed at the wing
     level, as determined by MAJCOM/IG, and will be inspected during the unit‘s next
     scheduled inspection. Minor deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM-level will be closed
     by the MAJCOM/IG.
     2.6.3.4. MAJCOM/IGs will forward all HAF-level actionable deficiencies to SAF/IGI
     for processing. SAF/IGI, after review and coordination by the responsible HAF
     functional(s), will close HAF-level deficiencies in collaboration with the inspecting
     MAJCOM/IG.
     2.6.3.5. MAJCOM/IGs will ensure the deficiency corrective action process is included in
     the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
 24                                 AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


       2.6.3.6. All deficiencies will be assigned a deficiency code(s) from Table 2.1, by the
       corrective action OPR (at wing, NAF, MAJCOM, HAF), as part of the deficiency
       corrective action process.
       2.6.3.7. Basic responsibility for problem solving and the corrective action process resides
       at the lowest appropriate command level. Problem solving should be applied through the
       AF eight-step problem solving model as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook (or SAF/SO
       approved publication) to assist in identifying root causes and solutions to deficiencies.
       2.6.3.8. MAJCOM FAMs and IGs should review units‘ corrective action plans for
       critical and significant deficiencies for appropriateness prior to closure. MAJCOM/IGs
       may require organizations provide problem solving documentation for those deficiencies.
       2.6.3.9. In instances where corrective action responsibility is assigned to both the host
       and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), MAJCOM/IGs will assign an OPR
       and an OCR to correct the identified deficiencies.
       2.6.3.10. The deficiency codes listed in Table 2.1 apply to all inspections listed in this
       AFI.
       2.6.3.11. (Added-AETC) See Attachment 9 (Added) for procedures on preparing
       inspection replies for deficiency corrective actions.

             OT1 Explain in Clear Text
2.7. AF Special Interest Item (SII) Program.
   2.7.1. Purpose. SIIs provide a means to focus management attention and/or gather data to
   evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader
   attention. SIIs are used by HAF functional staffs to make policy adjustments and enhance
   decision-making. Active SIIs should not exceed more than five at any given time.
   2.7.2. Responsibilities.
        2.7.2.1. SAF/IGI. Manage the AF SII program by coordinating AF SII topic proposals,
        obtaining SAF/IG approval, distribute approved AF SII to MAJCOM/IGs, compile and
        forward SII data to the sponsoring agency.
        2.7.2.2. SII Sponsors. Only HAF functionals may sponsor SIIs. Proposed SII topics
        may be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the appropriate HAF functional to
        SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit SII topic proposals in the format
        provided on the SAF/IGI Community of Practice (CoP).
        2.7.2.3. MAJCOM/IGs.
           2.7.2.3.1. SII Inspections.      Inspect all applicable active SIIs during formal
           inspections. Units need only be inspected and reported once during the SII‘s active
           period. Gaining MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with owning IGs prior to conducting
           SII inspections on gained units. Document the results of SII inspections as a separate
           section of the final inspection report.
           2.7.2.3.2. SII Reports (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0008). Consolidate SII inspection results
           and report quarterly to SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Provide a
           summary of units inspected, locations, dates of inspection, and electronic extract of
           the SII portion of the final inspection report. MAJCOMs will include unit SII self-
           inspection results NLT the third quarter report. IG remarks are important to the SII
           process and should be annotated IAW specific instructions attached to each SII.
        2.7.2.4. Wing/Unit. Obtain SII information via MAJCOM/IG or SAF/IGI CoP.
        Wings/units not inspected during the active period of an SII will conduct a one-time self-
        inspection and report results to their MAJCOM/IG.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  29


       2.7.2.4. (AETC) HQ AETC/IG will notify units of Air Force special interest item (SII)
       changes. Wings/units that are not inspected during the active SII period will be notified
       by HQ AETC/IGIX and instructed to conduct a self-inspection of the subject SII
       (information will be provided regarding required format and suspense). Notification will
       be sent to the wing IG for staffing action. Results will be consolidated and returned to
       HQ AETC/IGIX through the wing IG office.
   2.7.3. Rating. If rating is required as part of the SII, the scale will be specified in the SII
   instructions.
   2.7.4. MAJCOM Command Interest Items (CII). Ensure that MAJCOM CIIs do not conflict
   with AF SIIs.
   2.7.4. (AETC) HQ AETC/IG will notify units of changes in AETC command interest items
   (CII). See Attachment 10 (Added) for the CII process.
2.8. AF IG Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification.
   2.8.1. Eligibility. Officer inspectors should be senior captains (captains with more than 7
   years commissioned service) or above. Enlisted inspectors must be 7-level or above.
   2.8.2. Mandatory Training. All IG team members will complete the USAF Inspectors
   Course within 90 days of assignment to an IG team. While designed and required for newly
   assigned MAJCOM/IG team members, other MAJCOM-level inspectors and unit-level
   Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) members may attend on a space-available basis.
   Additional information regarding the Inspectors Course may be obtained at the SAF/IGI
   CoP.
   2.8.2. (AETC) The USAF Basic Inspector Course for AETC is conducted in coordination
   with SAF/IGI. Wing, group, and tenant personnel will submit course requests to HQ
   AETC/IGIX as needed using the course request template on the HQ AETC/IG portal. Course
   requests will be consolidated and forwarded to SAF/IGI for scheduling.
       2.8.2.1. MAJCOM/IGIs will submit course requests for the upcoming fiscal year to
       SAF/IGI NLT 01 September using the course request template on the SAF/IGI CoP.
       2.8.2.2. MAJCOM/IG-Specific Training. MAJCOM/IGs will develop and provide all
       required specialized team, functional area, host-nation, or MAJCOM-specific training.
       2.8.2.2. (AETC) AETC-specific initial and refresher inspector training for core IG team
       members will be conducted in conjunction with the USAF Basic Inspector Course, or, at
       minimum, annually. Training is open to all command personnel. Contact HQ
       AETC/IGIX for scheduling information.
       2.8.2.3. For required inspector training prior to assessing contractor functions, see
       paragraph 2.1.10.3
   2.8.3. Recurring Training. All AF Inspectors will re-accomplish mandatory training NLT 48
   months after certification.
   2.8.4. Certification. MAJCOM/IGs, at a minimum, will certify all inspectors. Inspector
   certification to conduct inspections requires completion of mandatory and MAJCOM-
   specific training, as well as a field observation. Field observation requirement is a minimum
   of one over-the-shoulder inspection by a certified inspector.

2.9. Inspection Report Handling.
   2.9.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management.
   2.9.2. Report Marking. At a minimum, mark unclassified inspection reports "For Official
   Use Only (FOUO)" IAW DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement. For nuclear
   inspection reports, see paragraphs 5.16 and 6.7
   2.9.3. Releasability. AF inspection reports, related materials and drafts are official
   government documents and the AF controls their distribution. DOD members, DOD
   contractors, consultants, and grantees are permitted access to inspection reports IAW DOD
   Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement. Non-DOD parties requesting inspection reports
   should be referred to the appropriate Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office.
   2.9.3. (AETC) CI, contracted support activity inspection (CSAI), and other coincident
   inspection draft reports are normally presented at wing/group level and tenant unit inspection
   outbriefs. Draft reports are subject to AFI 90-201 releasability requirements. HQ
   AETC/IGIX will post all CI reports on the HQ AETC/IG portal, when final. Reports are
   password protected. CI reports can be released to DoD contractors. However, CSAI reports
   are not releasable to contractors. Contact your wing/IG office or HQ AETC/IGIX at DSN
   487-2529 or 5344 for additional information on passwords and report access.
      2.9.3.1. Release Determination Authority. Before release outside DOD, FOIA offices
      will receive a final release determination from SAF/IGI for NSI, INSI, LNSI, NORI,
      CI,ORI and any additional inspection reports. AFIA/CC is the release determination
      authority for Eagle Look and HSI reports.
      2.9.3.2. Release Within DOD. MAJCOM/IGs are authorized to release inspection
      reports, in whole or in part, within DOD. Courtesy copy SAF/IGI on any release outside
      the AF.
      2.9.3.3. Release of Inspection Summary to Media. An inspection summary may be
      released for inclusion in response to media queries or for internal information. The
      summary will be limited to the overall rating, inspection process/definition and, if
      desired, personal comments by the commander (e.g. general laudatory comments,
      perception of inspection process). The published summary will not contain detailed
      information (e.g. sub-area ratings, a list of individuals recognized by the IG, specific
      deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria).
      2.9.3.4. Releasability Statement. The following statement must appear on the cover and
      each page of the report as well as in any transmission, presentation, or document
      containing protected IG material: ―For Official Use Only. This report may be protected
      from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Do not release or publish, in
      whole or in part, outside official DOD channels without express approval of the Director,
      SAF/IGI.‖ Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with
      inspection teams from other DOD agencies.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 31


      2.9.3.5. Inspection Outbrief. Unit outbriefs are considered a version of the inspection
      report and consequently fall within releasability restrictions. DOD members, DOD
      contractors, consultants, and grantees are permitted to attend inspection outbriefs at the
      discretion of the installation/wing commander. Community leaders and general public
      are not authorized access to inspection results, to include outbriefs, except as permitted
      by IAW DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (see paragraph 2.9.3)
      2.9.3.6. See paragraph 5.16 and 6.7 for additional guidance concerning NSI and NORI
      reports.
      2.9.3.7. See paragraph 7.8 for additional guidance concerning AFIA reports.
   2.9.4. Distribution.    MAJCOM/IGs will    send an UNCLAS     e-mail  to
   safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or a CLASSIFIED (up to SECRET) e-mail to
   safigi@af.pentagon.smil.mil:
      2.9.4.1. For nuclear inspection reports, see paragraphs 5.16.2 and 6.7.2
      2.9.4.2. NLT 15 days of IG team departing inspected unit, send an executive summary of
      the inspection to include overall rating, MGA ratings, and all Critical deficiencies..
      2.9.4.3. NLT 30 days of IG team departing inspected unit, send an electronic version of
      the final IG inspection report. If inspection report is produced in IGEMS, sending an
      electronic version is not required. Availability of reports on MAJCOM-specific internet
      sites does not satisfy this requirement.
      2.9.4.4. (Added-AETC) Wing, group, and tenant unit CI and CSAI reports are
      considered final and will be distributed to appropriate organizations and appropriate staff
      OPRs/offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) upon completion of the outbrief to the
      AETC/CC.
      2.9.4.5. (Added-AETC) Reports on GSUs inspected by an HQ AETC/IG team are
      completed at HQ AETC/IG home station. With the exception of squadron level GSU
      reports, which will be included in the CI report of the owning organization, reports are
      considered final with the HQ AETC/IG signature. Final reports will be distributed to the
      inspected units, owning organizations, and appropriate staff OPRs/OCRs approximately
      30 calendar days after the inspection.
      2.9.4.6. (Added-AETC) Reports from no-notice/minimal-notice inspections will
      primarily focus on recommended improvement areas and deficiencies. Identifying
      strengths is a secondary consideration with limited representation in the report. Normally,
      the draft inspection report will be forwarded to the inspected unit within 14 calendar days
      of inspection completion. Reports are considered final with the HQ AETC/IG signature
      and will be distributed to the inspected units, owning organizations (if applicable), and
      appropriate staff OPRs/OCRs, once final.
2.10. Gatekeeper Functions.
   2.10.1. AF Gatekeeper. AFIA Gatekeeper, in coordination with SAF/IGI, serves as the AF
   focal point for notification of HAF and non-AF assessments and relays visit notifications.
   AFIA Gatekeeper assists MAJCOM Gatekeepers in de-conflicting schedules as required.
32                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


  2.10.2. MAJCOM Gatekeepers.
     2.10.2.1. Establish Gatekeeper programs to de-conflict inspections, evaluations, and
     audits to minimize impact to units. Gaining MAJCOM Gatekeepers will de-conflict
     inspection, evaluation, and audit activity with owning MAJCOM Gatekeeper.
     2.10.2.2. MAJCOM Gatekeepers do not have authority to deny access to
     inspectors/auditors from agencies outside their MAJCOM. If required, AFIA Gatekeeper
     will assist with resolving conflicts.
     2.10.2.3. Submit an annual inspection schedule update to AFIA Gatekeeper NLT the last
     day of each quarter. Quarterly, AFIA Gatekeeper forwards the consolidated inspection
     schedule to MAJCOM/IGs, SAF/IGI, and AFSC/SEW. Distribute inspection schedules
     on a need-to-know basis.
  2.10.3. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC Gatekeeper Program:
     2.10.3.1. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC, along with other USAF, DoD, and non-DoD
     agencies, conducts inspections, evaluation visits, SAVs, and other types of visits to field
     units. HQ AETC/IGIX is the HQ AETC gatekeeper, and will monitor, control, and
     regulate inspection/evaluation activities for AETC host installations and GSUs, according
     to the Air Force Gatekeeper Program. HQ AETC/IGIX, may be contacted at DSN 487-
     2529 or 5344; or by E-mail at aetc.gatekeeper@randolph.af.mil. Only SAVs and visits
     that are of an inspection nature are monitored, controlled, and regulated under the
     gatekeeper program. Examples include visits from the Air Force Audit Agency; Air
     Force Inspection Agency (AFIA); AETC Facility Infrastructure Examination Team;
     Environmental, Safety, Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and Management
     Program (ESOHCAMP) Team; and NAF and HQ SAVs.
     2.10.3.2. (Added-AETC) Wing commanders (or equivalent) and group commanders of
     major units (i.e., Air Force Institute of Technology [AFIT], 58th Special Operations
     Wing, 336th Training Group [TRG], 381 TRG, etc.) will appoint a gatekeeper POC to
     work with HQ AETC/IGIX and monitor and/or regulate inspection type visits. Submit
     name, rank, office symbol, phone number, and E-mail address to HQ AETC/IGIX via
     aetc.gatekeeper@randolph.af.mil.
     2.10.3.2. (12FTW) The wing Gatekeeper POC monitors and reports on all external
     evaluation, observation, or assistance visits, including by civil certification agencies, to
     any 12 FTW unit, regardless of organizational level. All 12 FTW staff division chiefs
     and group/squadron commanders will keep the 12 FTW/CC, IG and their Inspection
     Managers and Monitors informed of all evaluation visits within their organizations.
     2.10.3.3. (Added-AETC) Report unscheduled inspection visit notifications from outside
     agencies to the HQ AETC gatekeeper. Gatekeeper POCs will work to resolve inspection
     conflicts. However, contact the HQ AETC gatekeeper to assist in the resolution. HQ
     AETC/IGIX will assist to resolve conflicts between AETC host installation and visiting
     staff agencies, and will research rescheduling visits that conflict with other scheduled
     inspection visits.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 33


     2.10.3.4. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/IGIX will request scheduling information from all
     units the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. However, as available, forward scheduling
     information to the HQ AETC gatekeeper on significant unit activities that could conflict
     with inspections, such as changes of command, major operational deployments, base air
     shows, A-76 conversions, conferences, or major community events that would be
     disrupted by an inspection.
     2.10.3.5. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC staff agencies planning inspection/evaluation-type
     visits to AETC host installations will send the HQ AETC Gatekeeper a copy of the
     proposed inspection visit schedule for the upcoming calendar year NLT 15 September.
     This schedule will include the following information: the organization conducting the
     visit to include the POC‘s name and phone number, the AETC unit being visited, visit
     dates, purpose and frequency, and number of personnel traveling to the unit.
     2.10.3.6. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC and NAF staff agencies should make every effort
     to target their SAVs at the midpoint between unit IG inspections. HQ AETC directorates
     and NAFs will not schedule or conduct SAVs within 1 year before a scheduled IG
     inspection unless requested by the unit, through their wing commander, to the HQ AETC
     or NAF functional. SAVs are not intended to be CI preparation; however, this does not
     preclude units from asking for a SAV if there is a need, no matter the period relative to an
     IG inspection. The HQ AETC or NAF functional will coordinate with HQ AETC/IGIX
     for waiver approval by the HQ AETC/IG for all SAVs conducted within the 1 year
     timeline.
     2.10.3.7. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC directorates, special staffs, and NAFs who are
     planning inspection visits to an ARC or an AETC tenant unit located on another
     MAJCOM‘s installation will coordinate with the NGB, AFRC, or that MAJCOM‘s
     gatekeeper.
     2.10.3.8. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC directorates, special staffs, and NAFs will provide
     the AETC gatekeeper quarterly schedule updates, which are due 15 December, 15 March,
     15 June, and 15 September for the subsequent quarter. Note: To minimize impact and
     decrease visits, HQ AETC/IGIX will evaluate inspection visit notifications, requests, and
     requirements to determine if visits are duplications. If so, consider
     consolidation/combination of inspection visits with similar goals, recommend alternatives
     if appropriate, and/or identify the existence of a similar inspection visit that meets the
     requested visit‘s intent.
     2.10.3.9. (Added-AETC) The HQ AETC/IG inspection schedule is posted for planning
     purposes on the HQ AETC/IG portal. Note: Schedule changes to accommodate major
     base events (such as air shows and wing change of command ceremonies) will be
     considered case-by-case. Accommodations are considered only when changes do not
     cause a major disruption to the rest of the IG inspection schedule.
     2.10.3.10. (Added-AETC) The CI schedule is updated annually and posted to the HQ
     AETC/IG portal. HQ AETC/IGI will provide 6 months notification, via memo to active
     duty units, of scheduled CIs. HQ AETC/IGI will formally notify AETC-gained ARC
     units by memo, providing 1 year notice.
 34                              AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


       2.10.3.11. (Added-AETC) No-notice/minimal-notice inspection notification will be
       made to the unit leadership via E-mail or telephone, depending on when the inspection
       team will arrive. HQ AETC/IG is the notification authority. All leadership levels in the
       associated chain of command (wing, NAF, HQ AETC, etc.), as well as similar units
       command-wide, will be included in the notification to ensure visibility.
       2.10.3.12. (Added-AETC) The GSU rolling 6 month inspection schedule is posted to
       the HQ AETC/IG portal. HQ AETC/IGI or HQ 2 AF will send a formal memo to notify
       GSUs, through their owning group, at least 60 calendar days prior to the inspection. A
       followup letter outlining deliverable requirements will be sent to the detachment
       commander 45 days prior to the inspection.
2.11. Best Practices. Air Force Best Practices guidance is contained within AFH 38-210, Air
Force Best Practices Clearinghouse, and managed by the Air Force Manpower Agency.
Although inspection team leads may validate Best Practices, the expectation is that units will
have previously submitted Best Practice candidates IAW AFH 38-210.
2.11. (AETC)Best Practices. Best practices (BP) generally come in three forms: BPs that have
been previously approved by Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA); those submitted but
pending approval from AFMA; and those that are presented to IG inspectors during CI week as
the first step toward approval.
   2.11.1. (Added-AETC) BPs approved since the last CI may be identified in the report as
   strengths, and the last sub-bullet of the writeup will be: "This was previously approved as an
   Air Force Best Practice."
   2.11.2. (Added-AETC) BPs submitted to AFMA more than 45 calendar days prior to the
   CI, but not yet approved, may be captured in the report as strengths.
   2.11.3. (Added-AETC) If a BP candidate is identified during the CI, the inspected unit
   should submit using local BP submission procedures. HQ AETC/IG may consider a BP
   candidate for inclusion as a strength in the report.
2.12. (Added-AETC) Professional Performer Recognition. Recognition exists to identify
personnel and teams that displayed exemplary performance during the CI. Normally, individual
recognition will not exceed 5 percent of assigned military and civilian personnel, and team
recognition will not exceed five total teams. The professional performer and team list is included
as an attachment to the published report. Coincident inspection (ATSEP, SEPWO, ASEV, etc.)
teams may conduct their own recognition programs in addition to the CI recognition programs. If
conducted, recognition results will appear in the respective reports.

                                             Chapter 3

                               COMPLIANCE INSPECTION (CI)

3.1. Execution. CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as mission areas that
are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations. Unit failure to comply
with the established directives in these areas could result in legal liabilities, penalties, or mission
impact. At a minimum, CIs will be conducted on all wing/wing equivalent units at an interval of
no more than 60 months. MAJCOM/CC approval is required to exceed the 60-month inspection
interval. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and
will provide anticipated inspection date(s).
   3.1.1. (Added-AETC) All subordinate AETC units and activities are subject to inspection.
   For inspection purposes, AETC will normally conduct a CI. HQ AETC CIs are conducted to
   evaluate how effectively, efficiently, and safely units perform their missions according to the
   applicable laws, instructions, regulations, TOs, syllabi, course charts, and plans of
   instruction. CIs will also identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as obstacles to
   mission accomplishment, morale, and readiness. Finally, CIs provide meaningful information
   to other units for use in improving operations.
   3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Wings, groups, tenant units, AU, AFIT, NAFs, HQ AETC, and
   comparable units will be inspected approximately every 36 months. A typical active duty
   wing level/tenant CI lasts 5 calendar days (Monday through Friday). Executive and theater
   outbriefs are normally held the following Tuesday. Contingency and/or functional exercises
   may be incorporated at any time during the designated inspection days.
   3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Technical training GSUs and 336 TRG detachments will be
   inspected approximately every 36 months. GSU squadron inspections will normally be
   conducted within the 4 months prior to the owning unit‘s inspection. Inspection results will
   be included in the owning unit‘s report. GSU inspections last 2 or 3 calendar days, depending
   on the size of the GSU. Most inspections will take place during normal duty hours.
   3.1.4. (Added-AETC) AETC-gained ARC units will be inspected approximately every 48
   months. ARC CIs normally run Wednesday through Sunday and are scheduled in
   conjunction with unit training assembly weekend. Contingency and functional exercises may
   be incorporated at any time during the designated inspection days.
   3.1.5. (Added-AETC) Most inspections will take place during normal duty hours.
   However, base activities that operate at night or on weekends and holidays (command post,
   law enforcement desk, aircraft maintenance, flying training, technical training classes,
   services activities, chaplain, etc.) may be inspected at any time. Inspectors will minimize
   interference with the mission of the inspected unit and attempt to avoid the need for civilian
   overtime.
3.2. CI Rating. Three-tier rating (e.g., IN COMPLIANCE / IN COMPLIANCE WITH
COMMENTS / NOT IN COMPLIANCE) should be sufficient to assess each compliance area. It
is not the intent of this inspection to specifically rate organizations; the intent is to rate
programmatic compliance.
 36                              AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


3.2. (AETC)CI Rating. HQ AETC/IG will use the five-tier grading system of outstanding,
excellent, satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory. The performance standard is satisfactory.
3.3. AF Compliance MGAs and Sub-areas. Air Force Compliance MGAs represent key
processes, procedures, and requirements based on public law, executive orders, DOD, AF,
MAJCOM, and ARC directives and instructions. MAJCOMs may supplement the requirements
of AF MGAs and add MAJCOM-specific MGAs. MGAs are organized according to the
functional policy origin for each MGA. It is not the intent of this instruction to inspect units
according to the numbered Air Staff construct but rather to better align inspection requirements
with functional responsibilities and guidance. MGAs are delineated with a bold font title in this
chapter.
3.3. (AETC)AF Compliance MGAs and Sub-areas. HQ AETC/IGI determines the units and
functional areas rated during each inspection to reflect CI elements. The CI report is arranged by
organizational element and function. Parent AFI paragraphs and this supplement highlight the
focus areas. Additional items may be inspected based on unique mission aspects or installation
structure.
   3.3.1. A1 (Manpower, Personnel, and Services).
       3.3.1.1. Equal Opportunity (EO) Program.

        3.3.1.2.15. (Added-AETC) For units that retained a personnel function (3S0) within
        a commander‘s support staff (CSS), the CSS will be evaluated on CSS duties listed in
        AFPC‘s mission support squadron (MSS)/force support squadron (FSS) military
        personnel checklist. As established in Program Action Directive 07-11, A1
        Transformation (for a copy, contact AFA1.workflow.pentagon.af.mil), and base-level
        service delivery model concept of operations (CONOPS), organizations and units that
        retain 3S0 CSS authorizations for the purpose of performing CSS personnel work will
        continue to perform those duties and be vulnerable to AETC inspection of those
        duties unless an agreement is established with the servicing military personnel section
        (MPS)/FSS to service that population in a particular program.
     3.3.1.3. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR). Ref DODI 6495.02,

        review the SIMs posted on the HQ AETC/IG portal. Consolidate and route SIM
        requests through the exercise evaluation team (EET) chief to the inspection project
        officer. E-mail them in a Microsoft Word ® format to the HQ AETC/IG project
        officer for approval at least 21 calendar days before the CI. Use the SIM request
        format in Attachment 11 (Added). Create a separate request for each SIM. HQ
        AETC/IGI will return the SIM package to the inspection project officer at least 5
        calendar days prior to team arrival. Once the CI begins, only HQ AETC/IGI or IGIC
        can approve additional SIMs.

                   OPERATIONAL READINESS INSPECTION (ORI)

4.1. Execution. ORIs evaluate and measure the ability of units to perform their wartime,
contingency, or force sustainment missions. For maximum effectiveness in assessing operational
readiness, all readiness MGAs should be assessed during the same visit. However, if required to
divide the inspection into separate visits, the inspection will consist of two phases. Phase I
evaluates the unit‘s transition from peacetime readiness and the unit's ability to maintain and
sustain essential home station missions during and after the deployment of forces and includes
the MGA of Positioning the Force.            Phase II evaluates the unit‘s ability to meet
wartime/contingency taskings through the MGAs of Employing the Force, Sustaining the Force,
and Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO). Within the parameters set by MAJCOM/IGs, wing
commanders may request appropriate unit activity be observed by MAJCOM/IGs to receive
credit for Phase I or Phase II requirements. United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) may
substitute a unit‘s North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Tactical Evaluation (TACEVAL)
for ORI credit. At a minimum, ORIs will be conducted on all wing/wing equivalent units with a
wartime, contingency, or force sustainment mission at an interval of no more than 60 months.
MAJCOM/CC approval is required to exceed the 60-month inspection interval. MAJCOM/IGs
will notify SAF/IG when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and will provide anticipated
inspection date (s).
   4.1.1. Scenarios. IG teams will attempt to create a realistic environment for evaluation while
   ensuring safety is not compromised.          ORI scenarios evaluate garrison operations,
   contingency response (from both garrison and continuity of operations (COOP) location),
   and sustained performance. When possible, combine ORI scenarios with existing exercises,
   contingency events, or other MAJCOM scenarios.
   4.1.2. Performance. IG teams will focus on mission performance. Academic testing will not
   be used as a primary measure of readiness unless it serves a specific inspection objective or
   hands-on performance cannot be observed.
4.2. ORI Rating. Overall inspection performance, readiness MGAs, and sub-areas will be rated
using the five-tier scale Outstanding, Excellent, satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.
4.3. AF Readiness MGAs and Sub-areas. Units with a wartime or contingency mission will
be rated in four MGAs: Positioning the Force, Employing the Force, Sustaining the Force, and
ATSO in a hostile environment and/or contaminated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear (CBRN) environment. Conduct Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAF) ORIs using
applicable guidance in Attachment 2.
4.4. Positioning the Force. Positioning the force is defined as the deployment, reception, and
beddown of tailored and prioritized forces.
   4.4.1. Command and Control (C2). Evaluate the effectiveness of the initial response
   actions performed by the Installation Control Center (ICC) and other wing C2
   agencies/elements.

           AIR FORCE NUCLEAR SURETY INSPECTION (NSI) PROGRAM

5.1. NSI Program Guidance. Nuclear weapon systems require special consideration because
of their political and military importance, their destructive power, and the potential consequences
of an accident or unauthorized act. NSIs are performance and compliance-based inspections and
are conducted to evaluate a unit's ability to manage nuclear resources while complying with all
nuclear surety standards (reference DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapons System Safety
Program Manual). T.O. 11N-25-1 is the governing instruction for the conduct of NSIs. In
instances where T.O. 11N-25-1 specifies responsibilities for ―Service‖, MAJCOMs fill that role.
AF inspection teams will conduct NSIs in accordance with T.O. 11N-25-1 and reference this AFI
for additional AF-specific inspection requirements. If there is conflict between T.O. 11N-25-1
and this instruction, T.O. 11N-25-1 will take precedence. Refer to Chapter 6 for guidance on
NORIs.
5.2. NSI Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification.
   5.2.1. Eligibility. NSI inspectors must have nuclear experience or experience applicable to
   current systems in their respective MAJCOM prior to assignment. Officer inspectors should
   be senior captains (captains with more than 7 years commissioned service) or above.
   Enlisted inspectors must be 7-level or above.
   5.2.2. Training.
       5.2.2.1. Prerequisites. Prior to attending the AF NSI Inspectors Course, inspectors
       should attend the USAF Inspectors Course.
       5.2.2.2. Mandatory Training. All AF NSI Inspectors will attend the AF NSI Inspectors
       Training Course.
       5.2.2.3. Recurring Training. All AF NSI Inspectors will re-accomplish mandatory
       training NLT 48 months after certification.
       5.2.2.4. Optional Training. NSI Inspectors are highly encouraged to attend other nuclear
       and/or inspection courses to add breadth and depth to their nuclear experience.
   5.2.3. Certification. MAJCOM/IGs, at a minimum, will certify all NSI inspectors. Inspector
   certification to conduct NSIs requires completion of prerequisite and mandatory training, as
   well as field observation. Field observation requirement is a minimum of one over-the-
   shoulder NSI by a certified NSI inspector. MAJCOMs may add any MAJCOM-specific
   training requirements.
5.3. Unit Nuclear Certification/Decertification.
   5.3.1. Unit Nuclear Certification. MAJCOM/CCs are the certification authority for nuclear-
   capable units. In this case a unit is defined as any nuclear capable AF Bomb Wing, Missile
   Wing, Fighter Wing, Air Base Wing, and NATO fighter bomber Wing/USAFE Munitions
   Support Squadrons. A nuclear-capable unit is defined as any wing, squadron or any other
   designated organization or base that has a mission to receive, store, handle, test, maintain,
   transport, load and unload, mate and demate, stand alert or perform strike missions with
   nuclear bombs or warheads. The unit need not possess nuclear weapons. Successful
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                    63


   completion of an INSI/NSI validates nuclear surety and is one of the activities per AFI 63-
   125, Nuclear Certification Program, necessary in gaining (INSI) and sustaining (NSI)
   nuclear certification.
   5.3.2. Unit Nuclear Decertification. The MAJCOM/CC may withdraw unit nuclear
   certification for any of the following reasons:
       5.3.2.1. The safety, security, or reliability of nuclear assets is uncertain.
       5.3.2.2. The unit is unable to perform its nuclear operational mission.
       5.3.2.3. A unit is rated less than SATISFACTORY during a NSI, LNSI, or NORI.
   5.3.3. When decertifying, the MAJCOM/CC may permit the unit to retain a limited nuclear
   operational capability in mission areas where nuclear surety is assured.
       5.3.3.1. If decertifying any portion, MAJCOM/CC will provide a memo to include the
       areas decertified and an expected get-well date. Distribute to Table 5.1, Group 1.
       5.3.3.2. Upon recertification, MAJCOM/CC will provide a memo certifying the unit to
       resume the full range of nuclear operations. Distribute to Table 5.1, Group 1.
5.4. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). The MAJCOM, in coordination with HQ
AFSC/SEW and SAF/IGI, will determine a unit‘s need for an INSI. The MAJCOM/CC will
document the decision on whether or not an INSI is required. This memo will be forwarded to
the unit(s) affected, the MAJCOM/IG, and appropriate staff functionals. For decisions to
proceed with an INSI, the memo will list the specific areas subject to evaluation. Applicable
functional staff will develop READY/NOT READY inspection criteria to be used by the IG
during the INSI. Refer to Attachment 3, Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection Requirements for
Major Nuclear Mission Changes, to assist in determining INSI requirements. Nuclear enterprise
agencies will receive inspection notification (initiation and conclusion) through the
MAJCOM/IG‘s use of Attachment 4, Nuclear Inspection Messages and Summaries.
   5.4.1. An INSI will be used to evaluate and certify:
       5.4.1.1. A unit's ability to assume its assigned nuclear mission.
       5.4.1.2. A unit‘s ability to resume its nuclear mission following unit decertification.
       5.4.1.3. That portion of a unit‘s mission that has been decertified.
   5.4.2. In the following areas, the MAJCOM and headquarters (HQ) AFSC/SEW will jointly
   determine a unit‘s need for an INSI and document the decision as described in paragraph 5.4
   In instances where the lead MAJCOM and HQ AFSC/SEW disagree with the need for an
   INSI, one will be conducted. An INSI will also be used to evaluate and certify:
       5.4.2.1. New or significantly-modified maintenance and/or storage facilities, to include
       new/modified support equipment and physical security systems (both lethal and non-
       lethal), integral to the operations and security of these facilities. It is the unit's
       responsibility to identify such changes to their MAJCOM Weapons Safety Division
       (SEW).
       5.4.2.2. A unit‘s ability to perform its assigned nuclear mission following significant
       changes to weapons systems or portions thereof.

   5.4.5. INSIs conducted on EOD teams, nuclear airlift units and certification of new or
   modified facilities, do not require a 180 calendar-day follow-up NSI.
   5.4.6. INSIs as described in paragraph 5.4.2 may be conducted in phases. If phased INSIs
   are conducted, the responsible MAJCOM will prepare an inspection plan identifying all
   required areas to be inspected by phase and forward the plan to HQ AFSC/SEW for review
   and approval. A READY rating must be achieved and maintained for the phase of the INSI
   under evaluation before evaluating the next phase. All phases must be rated READY prior to
   assuming nuclear operations. Phased READY ratings expire 18 months from issuance.
   Conduct a NSI, on all portions of the unit‘s nuclear mission, to include the addition of all
   phases, within 180 calendar-days of final INSI completion.
5.5. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). The NSI is designed to certify a unit's continued
capability to perform its assigned nuclear mission. It inspects a unit's capability to manage
nuclear resources while complying with applicable nuclear surety rules governing their nuclear
mission. Additionally, a NSI inspects a unit‘s capability to safely and reliably receive, store,
transport, secure, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock, test, and render safe nuclear weapons.
Missile launch crews, aircrews, command post controllers and release teams must demonstrate
their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures, nuclear weapon system safety rules, and
nuclear weapon control order handling and authentication procedures.
   5.5.1. Frequency of NSIs.
       5.5.1.1. Inspection Frequency. Conduct NSIs of each nuclear-capable unit IAW T.O.
       11N-25-1.
           5.5.1.1.1. Waiver to Inspection Frequency. Waivers should be the last resort after all
           other avenues have been exhausted. MAJCOM/CC approval is required to exceed the
           inspection frequency. The MAJCOM/CC will notify agencies required by T.O. 11N-
           25-1 and provide informational copies to the CSAF and recipients listed in Table 5.1,
           Group 1. Waiver notification will include the rescheduled inspection date.
           5.5.1.1.2. Exceeding Inspection Frequency. Exceeding the inspection frequency
           without MAJCOM/CC waiver results in unit decertification. Recertify IAW
           paragraph 5.4
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  65


       5.5.1.2. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice NSIs. While not every full-scale NSI needs to
       be no-notice or minimal-notice, the inspection program should implement a measure of
       randomness to scheduled inspections. For each certified nuclear-capable unit, one out of
       every three full-scale NSIs should be no-notice or minimal notice. Refer to paragraph
       2.1.1.1
       5.5.1.3. Inspection notification procedures. In order to meet oversight and core team
       responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the AFIA/CC at least 30 calendar days prior to
       inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 5.13.2.2 and 7.2.2) Other nuclear enterprise
       agencies will receive inspection notification (initiation and conclusion) through the
       MAJCOM/IG‘s use of Attachment 4.
   5.5.2. Sequencing with other inspections. MAJCOMs may conduct NSIs in sequence with
   other inspections. Where two MAJCOMs share nuclear surety responsibilities at a single
   installation, multi-MAJCOM NSIs (MMNSI) are encouraged to ensure host and tenant
   responsibilities are fully assessed and properly integrated. Where practical, a single group of
   inspectors from both MAJCOM/IG teams should be formed to evaluate host-base support
   functions and common host-tenant unit functions (i.e., PRP). When a MMNSI is impractical,
   either the host or tenant MAJCOM may perform these inspections with the concurrence of,
   and augmentation from, the other MAJCOM.
5.6. Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection (LNSI). The LNSI is limited in scope and does not
evaluate all NSI areas applicable to the unit. They are designed to assess sustained performance
of nuclear surety while minimizing the inspection footprint on a unit‘s operations. While LNSIs
may be scheduled, no-notice, or minimal-notice inspections, each nuclear-capable unit will
receive at least one no-notice or minimal-notice LNSI every 18 months. MAJCOM/IGs may
conduct no-notice or minimal-notice LNSIs for a variety of reasons; however the LNSI does not
establish a new or alter the existing DoD-directed NSI inspection frequency. The MAJCOM/IG
will notify the unit to be inspected, and affected staff functionals via memo. This memo will list
the specific areas subject to evaluation during the LNSI. Nuclear enterprise agencies will receive
inspection notification (initiation and conclusion) through the MAJCOM/IG‘s use of
Attachment 4. MAJCOMs may conduct LNSIs to:
   5.6.1. Inspect one or more areas designated by the MAJCOM/CC or IG.
   5.6.2. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified unit that contributed to an overall
   UNSATISFACTORY or SUPPORT UNSATISFACTORY rating during a Defense Nuclear
   Surety Inspection (DNSI), NSI, or LNSI.
   5.6.3. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified unit that contributed to an adjectival
   MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating during a DNSI, NSI, or LNSI.
   5.6.4. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice LNSIs. (Refer to paragraph 2.1.1.1) Each MAJCOM
   will conduct no-notice and/or minimal-notice LNSIs and determine appropriately-sized
   teams to target specific areas of concern or interest (e.g. a planned technical operation,
   logistics movement, security exercise, etc).
5.7. Nuclear Inspection Rating System.
   5.7.1. For INSIs, assign a Ready or Not Ready rating.
 66                              AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


   5.7.2. For all LNSIs and NSIs, assign overall unit ratings as specified for NSIs in T.O. 11N-
   25-1.
   5.7.3. For all LNSIs and NSIs, assign unit sub-area ratings as specified for NSIs in T.O.
   11N-25-1 with the following exception:
       5.7.3.1. Rate unit weapons denial and recapture/recovery emergency exercise as
       ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating).
5.8. Reporting Criteria. For NSIs, LNSIs, and INSIs, reports will only identify Strengths,
Deficiencies, and RIAs. RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-
compliance; they should be used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
   5.8.1. Nuclear Surety Deficiencies and Corrective Actions. For reporting purposes, each
   NSI, LNSI, or INSI deficiency, as defined in T.O. 11N-25-1, will:
       5.8.1.1. Be categorized as Critical, Significant, or Minor as defined in T.O. 11N-25-1.
       5.8.1.2. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
       5.8.1.3. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order, policy letter, or other
       source documentation.
       5.8.1.4. Address impact of continued deviation or noncompliance, if required.
       5.8.1.5. Identify the OPR for correcting the deficiency.
       5.8.1.6. Include the OCR, if applicable.
       5.8.1.7. Provide additional comments required to explain deficiency, if applicable.
   5.8.2. Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.6.3
       5.8.2.1. Host and Tenant Findings. In instances where the deficiencies assess corrective
       actions responsibilities to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit),
       MAJCOM/IGs will communicate to ensure primary (OPR) and collateral (OCR)
       responsibility actions for deficiency resolution have properly occurred.
       5.8.2.2. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit‘s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
       inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
       as described in paragraph 5.11.2 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM‘s
       control, the supporting MAJCOM's staff and IG CARS monitor will coordinate replies
       through inspecting MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. AFIA will monitor and request updates
       from the responsible agency.
       5.8.2.3. For deficiencies from DTRA Inspections, see paragraph 5.12.2 and T.O. 11N-
       25-1 added instructions..
5.9. DOD NSI MGAs. This instruction does not replicate the information contained T.O. 11N-
25-1. The criterion below adds AF-specific inspection specifications and requirements to
existing DOD criterion:
   5.9.1. Management and Administration.
       5.9.1.1. Management. Evaluate leadership, guidance, communication, and attitude of
       unit commander and key supervisors. When assessing management, consider whether
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                               67


     deficiencies are the result of individual error or reflect management or supervisory
     training/experience gaps.
     5.9.1.2. Administration.
         5.9.1.2.1. Evaluate loading and management to include loading standardization,
         certification, training programs and schedules, and for certain non-US delivery
         aircraft, status, certification procedures and records.
         5.9.1.2.2. Reentry system mating management to include standardization, training
         and certification programs, and maintenance plans as required.
         5.9.1.2.3. Status of approved waivers, exemptions, deviations and exceptions.
         5.9.1.2.4. Munitions Control.     Evaluate Munitions Control in the planning,
         coordinating, directing and controlling munitions/weapons activities IAW AFI 21-
         204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures.
         5.9.1.2.5. Munitions/Maintenance Plans and Scheduling (P&S). Evaluate IAW AFI
         21-204.
  5.9.2. Technical Operations.
     5.9.2.1. Evaluate each type of assigned weapon or weapon systems that units are tasked
     to support to assess safety, security, reliability and technical performance. These
     evaluations will be limited to those operations on which personnel are required to
     maintain certification. All record actions and reporting normally associated with the
     operation will be evaluated.
     5.9.2.2. For all technical operations and/or task evaluations, the MAJCOM/IG team will
     select all unit task-certified/qualified teams (e.g., load crews, weapons crews, aircrews,
     missile crews, command post controller teams, etc) to perform the various NSI-required
     technical operations/task evaluations. Units may be required to submit team assignment
     documents, duty rosters, unit committed munitions lists, maintenance capability letters,
     etc, to the MAJCOM/IG before team arrival to expedite team selection. Evaluate
     individual Career Field Education Training Plans (CFETP), Load Training and
     Certification Document (AF IMT Forms 2435), PRP status, and work shifts when making
     team selections (maintain team integrity to the maximum extent possible).
         5.9.2.2.1. Unit assessors, QA, and weapons standardization evaluators are also
         subject to evaluation. To demonstrate their knowledge and proficiency, they will
         normally be tasked to perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance operation
         within their area of responsibility.
         5.9.2.2.2. Shop Supervisors involved in technical operations are subject to
         evaluation.
     5.9.2.3. If a combined NSI/ORI inspection is conducted, technical operations shall be
     clearly divided between those conducted under peacetime (NSI) conditions and those
     conducted under wartime (ORI/NORI scenario), and shall be organized so there will be
     no confusion on the part of the inspected unit when transitioning from one phase to the
     other occurs.
68                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


     5.9.2.4. Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations. Evaluate applicable technical
     operations designated in T.O. 11N-25-1, Table 2-3, for which the unit is tasked in their
     Maintenance Capability Letters (MCL) and Unit Committed Munitions Lists (UCML).
     Certain operations listed individually in Table 2-3 may be combined for the purpose of
     inspection. Inspectors will approve the starting and stopping configuration before the
     operation. During weapons maintenance technical operations evaluate adherence to
     technical data, documentation, overall safety, security and overall reliability of observed
     operations, to include final assembly testing.
     5.9.2.5. Loading and Mating.
         5.9.2.5.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct a
         complete weapons upload, from initial weapons break-out through aircrew acceptance
         and applicable post-load procedures. Loading operation must encompass each type
         and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system applicable. Evaluate
         unit ability to conduct a single weapon download/upload. Loading standardization
         crew/weapons standardization load crews /squadron load crews may be evaluated.
         Note: For custodial units supporting non-US delivery organizations, include the US
         technical load monitor activity.
  5.9.3. Tools, Test, Tiedown and Handling Equipment.
     5.9.3.1. Nuclear-Certified Vehicle Operations and Maintenance. Evaluate unit vehicle
     and equipment management, control, accountability, and maintenance practices for
     ensuring unit-assigned vehicles are maintained in a safe and serviceable condition.
     Evaluate applicable guidance, unit operator training and certification programs and unit
     vehicles for a safe and serviceable status
  5.9.4. Condition of the Stockpile.
     5.9.4.1. Sample Size. Examine at least 50% of the active/inactive assets in igloo storage
     and at least 25% of active/inactive assets in long term storage facility and weapon storage
     vaults.
     5.9.4.2. Spot Inspections. Conduct spot inspections of weapons coded for retirement to
     ensure they are stored in a safe condition.
  5.9.5. Storage and Maintenance Facilities.
     5.9.5.1. Evaluate roads in storage areas, between storage and loading or missile launch
     areas.
     5.9.5.2. Nuclear certified hoists. Critical deficiencies include using hoists which are
     unserviceable, unauthorized, or have not received mandatory load testing or safety related
     inspections.
  5.9.6. Security.
     5.9.6.1. Evaluate unit compliance with DOD S-5210.41M_ AFMAN 31-108, and other
     required security standards for protecting WR weapons and weapon systems. Security
     inspection sub-areas and inspection methodology are depicted in Attachment 5.
     Performance-based criteria, where designated, will be the primary means of the
     inspection. Compliance with existing requirements will be assessed through random
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                               69


     sampling, and where practical, in conjunction with exercise events and/or task
     evaluations. Compliance with established requirements will be considered when
     determining the overall security area rating.
     5.9.6.2. MAJCOMs will supplement this section to ensure their specific operating
     environments and elements of the published Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear
     Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA) (2005-2015) are addressed while
     ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives.
     5.9.6.3. Weapon Denial and Recapture Exercise Planning:
        5.9.6.3.1. MAJCOM/IGs working with their staff functional counterparts will
        develop realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine a unit‘s
        ability to meet the NWSS. The MAJCOM/IG team will determine the exercise
        scenario and coordinate scenario with DTRA during DNSI planning.
        5.9.6.3.2. ORM and safety procedures will be used in planning and execution of
        security exercises at all levels of command. When exercises are collocated within
        operational areas, care will be exercised to avoid scenarios that could be interpreted
        as an actual hostile situation that might cause accidental injury to personnel or
        jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.
        5.9.6.3.3. At IG discretion, exercise scenarios resulting in the opposing force
        (OPFOR) gaining access to nuclear weapons may automatically trigger the recapture
        or recovery exercise, as applicable. Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR and
        exercise controllers know the ―adversary intentions‖ for the planned attack (e.g.
        sabotage weapon, destruction, theft, etc.).
        5.9.6.3.4. All participants will apply appropriate INFOSEC and OPSEC measures to
        safeguard exercise information, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Likewise,
        the results of NSIs security exercises, or other like inspections under the auspices of
        the IG, will be appropriately classified, rated, critiqued, and reported for cross-tell
        purposes within the nuclear community.
     5.9.6.4. OPFOR Planning. Exercise scenarios will portray an OPFOR that replicates
     adversaries identified in the published DIA NSTCA. Likewise, OPFOR capabilities will
     be matched as best as possible IAW this document to evaluate the unit‘s integrated effort
     to meet the NWSS. For those inspections where a force-on-force (FoF) exercise is
     planned, MAJCOMs are responsible for sourcing sufficient OPFOR members and
     exercise controllers to conduct the exercise. Use of a simulated engagement system (e.g.
     Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES)), while highly desired during the
     FoF, is optional. Ensure distinct separation of exercise play area from real world mission
     areas using visual identification tools (safety vest/belts, exercise controllers), safety
     briefings for trusted agents and normal exercise C2 communication announcements. All
     OPFOR, exercise controllers, and IG trusted agents will be under the operational
     direction of the inspecting IG.
     5.9.6.5. Security Deviations. The IG will review the number and types of MAJCOM
     approved security deviations as well as assess the adequacy of and compliance with,
     associated compensatory measures.
70                            AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


     5.9.6.6. Performance-based Assessment Methodology. When measuring performance to
     determine whether a unit meets the NWSS, inspectors shall apply the following
     methodology during their observation:
        5.9.6.6.1. Observe and evaluate the integrated execution of security actions and
        responses (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable.
        Provide performance-based (Acceptable/Unacceptable) rates for exercises by
        factoring:
           5.9.6.6.1.1. The timeliness/quality/strength of security/support force responses.
           For example, did the unit meet the tenets of the NWSS (i.e. Deny access or regain
           custody)?
           5.9.6.6.1.2. Execution of applicable plans and TTPs. For example, did the unit
           make sufficient effort to immediately deny access or regain custody?
           5.9.6.6.1.3. Effect of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and
           other technology. For example, did the unit use available options to prevent the
           loss of/deny access to nuclear weapons to the adversary to include destruction of
           the weapon?
           5.9.6.6.1.4. Unit application of integrated base defense activities in the overall
           effort to meet the NWSS. For example, did the unit bring available resources to
           bear on the event (e.g., technology, TTPs, EOD, etc.)?
        5.9.6.6.2. Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and response
        (performance), in conjunction with the impact of unit compliance with technical
        criteria and contribution of supporting security systems, as applicable, (see
        Attachment 5) to determine if the NWSS was met. For example:
           5.9.6.6.2.1. Did the unit effectively execute applicable plans and employ
           sufficient forces in their effort to meet the NWSS?
           5.9.6.6.2.2. Was unit C2 effective?
           5.9.6.6.2.3. Did the unit up-channel information in sufficient detail and on time to
           appropriate HHQ agencies?
           5.9.6.6.2.4. Were unit TTPs and applied security technology effective in meeting
           the objective?
           5.9.6.6.2.5. Was unauthorized access denied or weapons custody regained?
        5.9.6.6.3. Exercise Rating Criteria. Rate the weapons denial/recapture portion of this
        area using the ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE (pass/fail) criteria (see paragraph
        5.7.3.1). An ACCEPTABLE grade will be based on either successful denial or
        effective and timely recapture/recovery of affected nuclear weapon(s). When initial
        denial fails and the unit is not capable of regaining custody in a timely manner, the
        overall unit rate will be UNACCEPTABLE. Failure of a unit to initially deny
        unauthorized access or subsequent loss of custody of nuclear weapons does not
        automatically result in a failing grade for exercises. In these cases, IGs must consider
        specific nuclear weapon type, site-specific physical delay/denial mechanisms, site
        topography, climate, location, and adversary objective, as well as the effort of the
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                71


         security/support force to disrupt/delay an adversary‘s task and cause duress to the
         adversary as the exercise scenario plays out.
         5.9.6.6.4. Modeling and Simulation. As available and applicable, the inspector may
         use computer modeling and simulation tools as enablers in determining security
         effectiveness and as a viable measuring tool for developing and refining response
         force scenarios based on the published DIA NSTCA.
  5.9.7. Safety.
     5.9.7.1. Compliance with explosive safety standards, explosives and active material
     limits, and Weapons System Safety Rules.
     5.9.7.2. Nuclear Surety Program. Evaluate compliance, programs, implementation and
     management thereof per AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
     5.9.7.3. Assess FES flight using the FESAP, NFPA 1201 checklist.
     5.9.7.4. Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program. Although this program is
     fully addressed in paragraph 3.3.26.1.5, conduct a limited; spot-check inspection of the
     Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program to ensure programs are in place.
  5.9.8. Supply Support. The supply management of nuclear ordnance, and WR major
  assemblies for positive accounting, custodial control, and status reporting.
  5.9.9. Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). Evaluate PRP IAW DOD
  5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902. In addition to the areas listed in T.O. 11N-25-1, the training
  program for all personnel who are part of the PRP shall be examined.
     5.9.9.1. PRP inspection teams should contain an experienced or current certifying
     official as the lead PRP inspector, a PRP monitor, and will contain an experienced
     competent medical authority.       To minimize the inspector footprint, a single group of
     inspectors from both MAJCOM/IG teams should be formed to evaluate host-base support
     functions and common host-tenant unit functions (i.e., PRP). When a MMNSI is
     impractical, either the host or tenant MAJCOM may perform these inspections with the
     concurrence of, and augmentation from, the other MAJCOM.
     5.9.9.2. Inspectors will assess the administrative qualification, certification, continuing
     evaluation, removal from PRP duties, return to duty, training and management processes,
     using record reviews to substantiate above processes, employed by the unit. PRP
     processes, not records reviews, will be the primary focus.
  5.9.10. Logistics Movement. Evaluate all units supporting or having responsibility for
  logistics movement of nuclear weapons by observing loading, transporting, unloading, and
  custody transfer procedures of representative types of weapons. The team should conduct the
  inspection (other than an INSI) during missions involving WR weapons when available.
  Evaluate:
     5.9.10.1. Convoy operations. Includes operational movements to or from launch
     facilities and weapon movement activities to include security support. For ICBM units,
     the capability to transfer/transport, load/unload, tiedown and transfer custody of weapons
     for payload transfer missions may be evaluated as a logistics movement.
 72                              AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


      5.9.10.2. Explosives and active material limits. Observe compatibility of items during
      transportation.
      5.9.10.3. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) Support. Evaluate PNAF support plans,
      security support, and logistics movement (see AF Joint Instruction (AFJI) 11-204,
      Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, AFI 11-299,
      Nuclear Airlift Operations (FOUO)) for PNAF certified units and installations supporting
      nuclear airlift missions. Logistics airlift units must demonstrate ability to safely and
      properly load, transport, unload, and transfer custody of weapons. Note: For PNAF
      Units, security support will be evaluated for aircrew security actions during the PNAF
      movement as required by AFI 11-299.
5.10. AF NSI MGAs. In addition to the MGAs outlined in T.O. 11N-25-1, the following
MGAs (in bold print) will also be inspected, as applicable:
   5.10.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Evaluate (1) classroom and practical
   training program, (2) condition of facilities and vehicles, (3) availability, serviceability, and
   demonstrated use of nuclear support equipment, (4) maintenance of technical orders,
   operating instructions, Team Chief Guides, AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
   Record, AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and other related publications, (5) initial
   and annual certification and decertification documentation, if required, (6) knowledge of
   hazardous and classified weapons components, and (7) render safe procedures (RSP) and
   continuation of RSP.
   5.10.2. Nuclear Control Order Procedures. Evaluate CP, aircrew, Permissive Action
   Link/Code Management System lock/unlock teams, and missile crew responses to nuclear
   control orders as well as effectiveness of applicable C2 functions IAW HHQ directives.
   5.10.3. Emergency Exercises.
      5.10.3.1. Emergency Evacuation. (USAFE Units only). Evaluate unit plans and
      procedures to evacuate assets IAW command directives. The unit, as tasked by HHQ,
      must demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report emergency
      evacuation operations in accordance with HHQ directives.
      5.10.3.2. Command Disablement. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
      pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the unit‘s plans and procedures to meet the primary
      objective to render weapons tactically useless and for the removal, storage, and
      destruction of specified WR components according to HHQ directives. The unit must
      demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report, in accordance with
      HHQ directives, command disablement actions whether tasked by HHQ or to prevent the
      unauthorized use of WR weapons should hostile forces threaten to seize them.
      5.10.3.3. Emergency Response. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
      pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the wing/installation's response to a peacetime overt
      attack to determine how effectively base resources are used to defend against overt
      attacks on areas where WR weapons or weapon systems may be located (e.g., in storage,
      in maintenance, in convoy). Use realistic scenarios that are based on the NWSS per
      paragraph 5.9.6 Note: WR weapons will not be used in exercises.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                               73

5.11. Re-inspection of NSI/LNSI Deficient Areas.
   5.11.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one
   of the following methods:
      5.11.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an immediate re-
      inspection. If the immediate re-inspection indicates that the deficiency is sufficiently
      corrected to permit operations, a follow-up inspection is not required. Do not re-inspect
      prior to termination if:
          5.11.1.1.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of proficiency
          within the unit.
          5.11.1.1.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of nuclear
          safety, security, or reliability.
      5.11.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate or re-inspected area(s) are not sufficiently corrected, the
      MAJCOM/IG will schedule a re-inspection NLT 90 days from termination of inspection.
   5.11.2. When a supporting unit receives a SUPPORT UNSATISFACTORY rating, the
   supporting MAJCOM/IG will:
      5.11.2.1. Conduct the re-inspection of deficient area(s) NLT 90 days from termination of
      inspection.
      5.11.2.2. Provide re-inspection results to the supported MAJCOM/CC and MAJCOM/IG
      within 5 days of concluding the re-inspection.
   5.11.3. Re-inspection Rating. The rating for the re-inspected area(s) will not exceed
   SATISFACTORY. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the overall unit rating
   will be UNSATISFACTORY, RE-INSPECTED TO SATISFACTORY. Document re-
   inspection results via message format IAW Attachment 4 and forward to Table 5.1,
   Group 1 addressees.
5.12. Actions on Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Inspections.
   5.12.1. Throughout the conduct of DNSIs, the MAJCOM/IG team will meet with the DTRA
   team to discuss inspection activities and potential deficiencies.
   5.12.2. DNSI Reports. Units will coordinate replies to DTRA reports through their
   appropriate MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. Take corrective action based on the field report
   provided by the DTRA team at the time of the inspection.
      5.12.2.1. Critical and Significant deficiencies require a description of the unit‘s
      corrective action and a discussion of those measures or procedures initiated to preclude
      their recurrence. Units should provide problem solving analysis (to include AF eight step
      problem solving method documentation/results), when requested. Closure of minor
      deficiencies require a wing/installation CC memorandum detailing unit corrective actions
      taken and that all corrective actions are complete.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                   75


      5.12.2.2. The MAJCOM CARS monitor will coordinate the MAJCOM response(s) and
      forward to AFIA/IO with MAJCOM/IG concurrence. An initial response is required 90
      days after the date of the final report. If the corrective action report is not closed within
      180 days of the date of the final report, the MAJCOM CARS monitor will provide AFIA
      an update every 30 days on open deficiencies until the report is closed.
      5.12.2.3. AFIA will review and forward corrective action reports to DTRA
      recommending closure on deficiencies, as applicable.
      5.12.2.4. When all deficiencies are corrected, AFIA will request DTRA close the
      inspection report. AFIA will forward DTRA closure acceptance to MAJCOM/IG and
      CARS monitor.
      5.12.2.5. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit‘s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
      inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
      as described in paragraph 2.6.3. For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM‘s
      control, AFIA will monitor and request updates from the responsible agency and forward
      to DTRA with the MAJCOM/IG update.
   5.12.3. When DTRA assigns a unit rating of SATISFACTORY (Support Unsatisfactory),
   UNSATISFACTORY or UNSATISFACTORY (Support Unsatisfactory), the MAJCOM/CC
   must evaluate the results to determine if unit nuclear decertification is appropriate. The
   MAJCOM will notify DTRA of the certification/decertification decision within 24 hours of
   DTRA inspection termination.
   5.12.4. Surveillance Inspections (SI). MAJCOM/IGs will courtesy copy AFIA/IO of all
   responses to DTRA SIs.
5.13. AFIA NSI Core Team. (see paragraph 7.2.1)
   5.13.1. AFIA NSI Core Team Roles. A core team of certified NSI inspectors centralized at
   AFIA will augment the MAJCOM/IG team for all scheduled NSIs. The Core Team will
   combine with the MAJCOM/IG Team to form a single unit, under the direction of the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. AFIA will provide the Deputy Team Chief.
      5.13.1.1. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief retains the authority as the on-scene director
      and is responsible for determining the inspection grade and completing the inspection
      report to the MAJCOM/CC.
      5.13.1.2. The Core Team provides expertise across MGA assessed during NSIs. The
      Core Team will augment NSIs within an 18-month inspection cycle across the nuclear-
      capable MAJCOMs (ACC, AFMC, AFSPC, AMC, AFGSC, and USAFE). The Core
      Team will augment MAJCOM/IG Teams on all scheduled and no-notice NSIs used to
      operationally certify nuclear-capable units. The Core Team will also augment NSI re-
      inspections and select LNSIs and INSIs.
      5.13.1.3. Primary objectives of the Core Team are to improve standardization of NSIs,
      elevate the MAJCOM/IG Team‘s inspector experience and expertise and contribute to
      NSI lessons learned and trend analysis processes. Additionally, Core Team members will
      support the semi-annual NSI process review, the NSI inspector training and certification
      program, applicable conferences and meetings held throughout the nuclear enterprise,
      and/or duties assigned by AFIA/CC.
 76                              AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


   5.13.2. AFIA NSI Core Team and MAJCOM/IG Team Responsibilities. The AFIA NSI
   Core Team will augment the MAJCOM/IG Team in conducting and reporting inspection of
   the nuclear surety MGAs as outlined in Chapter 5.
       5.13.2.1. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief and the Deputy Team Chief from AFIA are
       responsible for developing full team complement consisting of permanent party, Core
       Team members, and required subject matter experts (SME) augmentees. Core Team
       inspector participation will be dependent on MAJCOM requirements and inspector
       availability.
       5.13.2.2. Scheduling. At least 30 calendar days prior to inspection execution, the
       MAJCOM/IG Team and Core Team will draft a Sequence of Events (SOE) review to
       include discussion of NSI objectives, determine task assignment (area of responsibility)
       of all inspectors, and any inspection-unique circumstances or requirements.
5.14. AFIA NSI Oversight Team. (see paragraph 7.2.2)
   5.14.1. AFIA NSI Oversight Team Roles and Responsibilities. The Oversight Team is a
   separate unit from the Core Team. The Oversight Team will provide a separate report for
   each inspection routed through the AFIA/CC and TIG to SECAF. The AFIA Oversight report
   to the SECAF will contain any matters deemed appropriate by the Oversight Team including
   the details of the adjudication effort, to include the dissenting opinion(s). An Oversight
   Team will conduct 100% oversight of all scheduled and no-notice NSIs used to operationally
   certify nuclear-capable units. The Oversight Team will also conduct oversight of NSI re-
   inspections and select Limited NSIs (LNSI) and Initial NSIs (INSI).
       5.14.1.1. Upon completion of oversight, the Oversight Team will provide a separate,
       non-collaborative report to the SECAF regarding the quality, standardization and conduct
       of the combined MAJCOM/IG/AFIA Core Team. This report will also include any
       significant inspection items resulting in non-concurrence with the MAJCOM overall
       rating that required adjudication. The oversight report will be provided to the
       MAJCOM/CC, upon request.
       5.14.1.2. The Oversight Team will not perform inspections but has the authority to
       intervene in an inspection for reasons of safety or critical non-compliance or whenever
       the AFIA Oversight Team Chief determines there has not been an appropriate degree of
       response from the MAJCOM/IG Team. Any intervention by the Oversight Team will
       stop that portion of the inspection until the issue is resolved.
       5.14.1.3. During DNSIs conducted by DTRA, the Oversight Team will additionally
       serve as a liaison between DTRA and the AFIA/MAJCOM/IG composite team.
       5.14.1.4. The Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) will provide augmentation to the AFIA
       Oversight Team IAW AFI 91-101.
5.15. Adjudication. Third party adjudication will occur for all types of nuclear surety
inspections when differences exist between inspecting teams and oversight teams when such
differences will affect the final overall rating of the unit. An adjudicated decision on the unit‘s
overall grade will be reached before out-briefing the unit. Adjudication efforts will consult, and
may solicit inputs/positions from, all applicable resources available, within the nuclear
enterprise. Adjudication decisions will be resolved at the lowest level possible. Either the
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 77


MAJCOM/IG Team Chief or the AFIA NSI Oversight Team Chief may enter an overall unit
inspection rating into Level 1 adjudication, if needed.
   5.15.1. Level 1 Adjudication. In the event the MAJCOM/IG Team and the AFIA NSI
   Oversight Team cannot agree on an overall inspection rating, the MAJCOM/IG and
   AFIA/CC will collectively adjudicate the overall rating decision and provide that decision to
   the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating stemming
   from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement between
   the teams. The MAJCOM/IG or the AFIA/CC may enter an overall unit inspection rating
   into Level 2 adjudication, if needed.
   5.15.2. Level 2 Adjudication. If a Level 1 adjudication decision cannot be reached by the
   MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC, TIG will adjudicate an overall rating decision and provide that
   decision to the SECAF and MAJCOM/CC. The MAJCOM/CC will communicate TIG‘s
   final overall rating to the MAJCOM/IG. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating
   stemming from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement.
   The AFIA Oversight report will include the details of the adjudication effort, to include the
   dissenting opinion(s).
   5.15.3. Based on TIG and A10 (NOB Secretariat) recommendation and SECAF/CSAF
   approval, adjudication insights may be included with other IG-related issues as agenda items
   at the NOB. All adjudication decisions decided below TIG will be included as agenda items
   at the next NSI process review.
   5.15.4. In all cases, the MAJCOM/CC will retain unit certification authority.
5.16. NSI Reports.
   5.16.1. Classification and Marking. Classify and mark all NSI, LNSI, and INSI reports IAW
   T.O. 11N-25-1, AFI 31-407, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Security Classification Policy, CG-
   W-5, the Joint Nuclear Weapons Classification Guide, and Executive Order 12958 as
   amended, Classified National Security Information.
   5.16.2. Formal Report (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0005). Document NSI results in a report and
   distribute to all recipients in Table 5.1, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection completion.
   Distribute the report to agencies in Table 5.1, Group 2 as necessary. MAJCOM/IGs will
   ensure agencies not included in Table 5.1 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions are
   included in the report distribution.
      5.16.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs will annotate in their final MAJCOM/IG inspection report any
      associated DTRA inspection or AFIA oversight role
   5.16.3. Executive Summary (RCS: SAF-IG(AR)0006). An executive summary will be
   accomplished and distributed prior to IG departure from inspected unit IAW Attachment 4.
   Ensure agencies identified as OPRs for corrective action, and not included in the standard
   summary distribution, are added to the distribution.

      AIR FORCE NUCLEAR OPERATIONAL READINESS INSPECTION (NORI)
                             PROGRAM

6.1. Execution. The NORI is a performance-based readiness evaluation of nuclear-tasked units
which support United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and Joint Chief of Staff
(JCS)-directed OPLANs. NORIs require units to demonstrate their operational capability of
nuclear and nuclear-support in a time-constrained environment. MAJCOMs will conduct NORIs
on units with nuclear delivery systems at intervals not to exceed 36 months. Nuclear support
units will receive a NORI at intervals not to exceed 60 months. MAJCOM/CC approval is
required to exceed the 36- or 60-month inspection interval. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG
when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and will provide the anticipated inspection
date(s). A NORI does not reset the 18-month frequency of a NSI.
6.2. NORI Rating. Wing/installation overall performance, MGAs, and sub-areas will be rated
using the five-tier rating system of Outstanding, Excellent, SATISFACTORY, Marginal, and
UNSATISFACTORY. USAFE may award NORI credit for successful completion of the NATO
Strike Evaluation (STRIKEVAL). To receive NORI credit from a STRIKEVAL, USAFE/IG
must ensure specific events are observed by inspector personnel either augmenting the NATO
team or specifically sent to observe the events.
6.3. AF NORI MGAs. The focus of the NORI is force generation, employment, and
reconstitution (as applicable). Safety should be addressed in all applicable MGAs. All NORI
MGAs and sub-areas will be rated.

ability to effectively regenerate the force for
future operations.

6.4. Planning. When possible for AD (and required for ARC no-notice or minimal-notice),
inspections should coincide with unit participation in USSTRATCOM annual Field Training
Exercise (FTX) exercises. The MAJCOM/IG will coordinate with applicable MAJCOM and/or
NAF Exercise Programs, NAF-staff, USSTRATCOM exercise planners, and unit trusted agents
in developing a realistic exercise scenario that fulfills inspection requirements. NORIs will
execute to the DOC statement. Written waivers to deviate from DOC statement will be
submitted to the MAJCOM/IG.
    6.4.1. For units with both a nuclear and conventional mission, the NORI will normally be
    conducted as a separate inspection but may be scheduled in conjunction or in sequence with
    an ORI or NSI.
    6.4.2. If sequential inspections are conducted to assess nuclear surety, conventional
    readiness, and/or nuclear readiness, inspection objectives and criteria must be clearly
    delineated.
    6.4.3. If conducted sequentially, each inspection type will have an independent report.
6.5. Re-inspection of NORI Deficient Areas.
    6.5.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas that
    caused or contributed to the UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one of
    the following methods [See paragraph 5.3 for guidance concerning unit deficiencies and
    continued nuclear certification status, if applicable]:
        6.5.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an immediate re-
        inspection. If the immediate re-inspection indicates that the deficiency is sufficiently
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                83


       corrected to permit operations, a follow-up inspection is not required. Do not re-inspect
       prior to termination if:
          6.5.1.1.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of proficiency
          within the unit.
          6.5.1.1.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of nuclear
          safety, security, or reliability.  If necessary, reference paragraph 5.3.2 for
          decertification procedures.
       6.5.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
       termination is not appropriate or re-inspected area(s) are not sufficiently corrected,
       MAJCOM/CCs will establish re-inspection timelines to ensure deficiencies are resolved
       and unit readiness to support National war plans is verified as soon as practical but NLT
       90 days from termination of the inspection.
   6.5.2. Re-inspection Rating. The rating for the re-inspected area(s) will not exceed
   SATISFACTORY. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the overall unit rating
   will be UNSATISFACTORY, RE-INSPECTED TO SATISFACTORY.
6.6. Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.6.3
6.7. NORI Reports. Carefully consider the classification of reports using AFI 31-407, CG-W-
5, and Executive Order 12958 as amended. (Reference paragraph 2.9).
   6.7.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW AFI 31-407, CG-W-5, and Executive Order 12958 as amended.
   6.7.2. Formal Report. Document NORI results in a formal report and distribute to all
   recipients in Table 5.1, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection completion. Distribute the
   formal report to agencies in Table 5.1, Group 2 as necessary. Ensure agencies not included
   in Table 5.1 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions are included in the report
   distribution. [Exception: All requests for USAFE reports must be routed through the
   appropriate NATO office.]
   6.7.3. Executive Summary. An executive summary will be accomplished and distributed
   prior to IG team departure from inspected unit IAW Attachment 4. Ensure agencies
   identified as OPRs for corrective action, and not included in the standard summary
   distribution, are added to the distribution.

   will augment the MAJCOM/IG team for all scheduled NSIs. The AFIA Core Team will
   combine with the MAJCOM/IG Team to form a single unit, under the direction of the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. AFIA will provide the Deputy Team Chief. See paragraph 5.13
   7.2.2. AFIA NSI Oversight Team. AFIA/IO provides oversight assessments to
   MAJCOM/CCs and TIG on the consistency of MAJCOM NSIs. Conducts in-depth trend
   analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective actions to inspection deficiencies and provides
   deficiency status and metrics to personnel in the AF nuclear surety arena. See paragraph
   5.14
       7.2.2.1. AF clearinghouse for MAJCOM responses to DTRA Nuclear Weapon Technical
       Inspection deficiencies. AFIA/IO reviews CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT nuclear surety
       deficiencies identified in DTRA inspection reports and requests clarification of
       deficiencies. AFIA/IO also reviews MAJCOM actions taken to correct these deficiencies
       and endorses them to DTRA. In cases where AFIA or DTRA non-concurs, AFIA/IO
       returns corrective action responses to MAJCOM for clarification. Seeks consultative
       assistance from AFSC/SEW as needed.
       7.2.2.2. Provides nuclear surety-related oversight of NSIs, LNSIs and INSIs by

       Agency/Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (DTRA/CSNI) inspects Air
       Force units under the auspices of T.O. 11N-25-1. AFIA will coordinate each NSI visit
       with the respective MAJCOM/IG Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system
       to protect the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection. In the course of directly
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                 85


      observing MAJCOM inspectors conducting their activities, AFIA/IO team members will
      not intervene in the inspection process unless the safety, security, or reliability of a
      weapon is in jeopardy, or injury to personnel, and the MAJCOM inspectors fail to take
      appropriate actions to correct the situation.
          7.2.2.2.1. Upon inspection conclusion, the AFIA Oversight Team Chief will provide
          a separate report, routed through AFIA/CC and TIG to SECAF, MAJCOM/CC and
          MAJCOM/IG. The report provides an assessment of the MAJCOM/IG team and
          their conduct of the inspection. Specific areas to be addressed in each report include:
             7.2.2.2.1.1. Concurrence or non-concurrence with the MAJCOM/IG assessment
             of nuclear surety.
             7.2.2.2.1.2. Contentious issues (include areas requiring SAF/IG adjudication).
             7.2.2.2.1.3. Composition of the qualification and training of MAJCOM
             inspection team.
             7.2.2.2.1.4. Use of current AF and MAJCOM checklists and inspection guides.
             7.2.2.2.1.5. Implementation and understanding of policy and guidance.
             7.2.2.2.1.6. Adequacy of MAJCOM/IG validation.
             7.2.2.2.1.7. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG report.
             7.2.2.2.1.8. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG team‘s deliberative process.
      7.2.2.3. Coordinates the proposed DTRA NSI inspection schedule for AF units.
      7.2.2.4. Provides observer(s) when DTRA inspects AF units under the auspices of T.O.
      11N-25-1.
7.3. DRU and FOA CIs. AFIA conducts CIs of AF-level DRUs and FOAs IAW Chapters 1,
2, and 3.
   7.3.1. Inspection Checklists. AFIA will use checklists generated by HAF functional staffs
   IAW paragraph 2.1.5 These inspections will focus on the applicable MGAs listed in
   Chapter 3 as a minimum, and any additional MGAs listed in paragraph 3.3 that are mutually
   agreed upon by AFIA and the DRU/FOA commander.
   7.3.2. Ratings. Each DRU and FOA receives an overall rating of Outstanding, Excellent,
   Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory.
   7.3.3. CI Re-inspection. Units receiving an overall rating of Marginal or Unsatisfactory
   during a CI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 24 months.
   7.3.4. Reports and Follow-up
      7.3.4.1. Official reports will be published on the final day of the inspection, directly
      following the commander‘s out-brief.
      7.3.4.2. Critical and Significant deficiencies are answerable to AFIA/IO in accordance
      with instructions in the official report.
 86                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


       7.3.4.3. AFIA conducts in-depth trend analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective
       actions to inspection deficiencies and provides deficiency status and metrics to SAF/IGI
       and DRU/FOA personnel.
7.4. Health Services Inspection (HSI). HSIs assess the functioning and execution of AF
Medical Service (AFMS) programs and processes at the local level in order to provide senior
leadership with accurate data upon which to base policy decisions. HSIs also assess the ability
of AF medical units to fulfill their health service support missions by providing required
capability, including provision of medical care, success in training and equipping deployable
personnel, and support of the host wing mission.
   7.4.1. Criteria and Inspection Guides. HQ AFIA/SG derives criteria from health care
   policies of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the office of
   the AF/SG, various civilian medical oversight agencies [such as the Joint Commission and
   the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC)], the NGB, and the
   AFRC. Air Force Inspection Agency, Medical Operations Directorate (AFIA/SG), based on
   changes in health care policies, regulatory guidance and coordination with MAJCOM SG
   staffs, annually updates the next year‘s inspection guide and posts to the AFIA Community
   of Practice. Inspectors assess sustained performance by reviewing substantiating documents
   created since the last inspection.
   7.4.2. Ratings. Each medical unit receives an overall rating of OUTSTANDING,
   EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL, or UNSATISFACTORY.
   7.4.3. HSI Frequency.
       7.4.3.1. AD medical treatment facilities are inspected, with an overall AFMS average of
       36 months. An HSI is normally conducted simultaneously with a survey by the Joint
       Commission for bedded medical units and AAAHC for non-bedded medical units. AD
       units are selected for inspection based upon criteria jointly agreed upon by AFIA,
       AAAHC and the Joint Commission.
          7.4.3.1.1. AD medical units update their AFIA held demographics whenever they
          become aware of an event that may affect the scheduling process. AD bedded
          medical units must update their electronic Joint Commission application upon
          notification from The Joint Commission, which occurs 15 months prior to their
          anniversary date. Significant changes should be reported to the Joint Commission
          within 30 days of change. The Joint Commission also requires an annual self-
          assessment Periodic Performance Review (PPR) via electronic submission.
          Notification for e-application and PPR submission requirements are provided per
          email to the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) CC 15 months prior to the
          accreditation anniversary date. AD non-bedded medical units must submit a new
          application with AAAHC which must be received no later than 90 days prior to their
          reaccreditation survey date. During the term of accreditation, AAAHC also requires
          written notification within 30 days of any significant organizational, operational or
          financial changes that can occur.
          7.4.3.1.2. AFIA contacts the MAJCOM/IG gatekeeper approximately 90 days prior
          to a scheduled HSI to ascertain any unannounced MAJCOM planned activities that
          may interfere with the HSI process.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                               87


        7.4.3.1.3. MTFs requesting postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled AD inspection
        must be forwarded to AFIA/SG for approval following Wing CC (or equivalent),
        MAJCOM SG coordination and AF/SG concurrence. MTFs should allow sufficient
        time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring AFIA/SG has
        appropriate information to make a decision to approve/disapprove the request. Refer
        to paragraph 7.4.3.3 for postponement/re-schedule criteria.
     7.4.3.2. ARC units are inspected on average every 48 months not to exceed 60-months
     from the date of the last HSI. AFIA/SG publishes a calendar year ARC HSI schedule in
     coordination with AFRC/IG/SG and NGB/IG/SG. In keeping with AF policy regarding
     inspection footprint, AFIA/SG will, to the greatest extent possible, schedule medical unit
     HSIs simultaneously with other scheduled wing inspections and assessments (e.g., CI,
     ASEV). Unit requests for postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled ARC or AES HSI
     must be forwarded to AFIA/SG following MAJCOM coordination and policies. Units
     should allow sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring
     AFIA/SG has the time and appropriate information to make a decision to
     approve/disapprove the request. Refer to paragraph 7.4.3.3 for postponement/re-schedule
     criteria. Note: For purposes of this instruction, NGB/SG is a MAJCOM equivalent.
     7.4.3.3. Certain events or circumstances may affect inspection scheduling for AD and
     ARC units. The following are criteria and guidelines units will use to determine if a
     request for postponement/re-schedule is justified. Any request to postpone an AD
     inspection exceeding 36 months and an ARC inspection exceeding 60 months requires a
     waiver from the AFIA/SG.
        7.4.3.3.1. A medical unit deploying 20% or more of its assigned medical personnel
        for greater than 90 days will not be inspected 30 days (AD) or 90 days (ARC)
        following an AEF deployment.
        7.4.3.3.2. An ARC unit undergoing a wing-level weapon system conversion
        (resulting in a significant impact of the medical unit) will be inspected within 6
        months after such a conversion.
        7.4.3.3.3. A unit change resulting in 50% or greater change in personnel
        authorizations.
        7.4.3.3.4. A real-world disaster or contingency operation resulting in the unit
        relocating or suspending operations.
        7.4.3.3.5. A unit participating in a MAJCOM-level inspection (e.g., ORI) involving
        40% or more of the unit‘s personnel occurring simultaneously with the scheduled
        HSI.
     7.4.3.4. Follow-up inspections.
        7.4.3.4.1. All units receiving an overall rating of ―Unsatisfactory‖ or ―Marginal‖
        during an HSI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 18 months.
            7.4.3.4.1.1. The MAJCOM SG or equivalent will conduct a staff assistance visit
            within six months to assess status. This report will be forwarded to AFIA/SG.
 88                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


          7.4.3.4.2. For ARC and ARC AE units, the next scheduled HSI will be conducted in
          conjunction with the next scheduled CI not to exceed 60 months from the date of the
          initial unsatisfactory/marginal HSI.
   7.4.4. Reports and Follow-up Responses. An electronic/paper copy HSI report is published
   and left with the unit and wing CC at the conclusion of the inspection. A final copy is
   distributed to AF/SG, MAJCOM SG and other interested staff agencies after review at AFIA.
       7.4.4.1. ―Critical‖ and ―Programmatic Failure‖ (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for all
       units require a response (close-out or interim update) within 3 months of the inspection.
       These assessments are expected to be completely resolved within 12 months. Units are
       required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated completion dates, every 90
       days until closure to their respective MAJCOM SGs (or equivalent) IAW instructions
       outlined in the HSI final report.
       7.4.4.2. ―Critical‖ and ―Programmatic Failure‖ (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for ARC
       units and AESs require a response (close-out or interim update) within 6 months of the
       inspection. Units are required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated
       completion dates, every 3 months until closure to their respective MAJCOM SGs IAW
       instructions outlined in the HSI final report. These assessments are expected to be
       completely resolved within 12 months.
   7.4.5. Special Emphasis Items (SEI). SEIs are limited studies performed during HSIs whose
   purpose is to gather information on specific issues. Topics to be researched are submitted by
   field or HQ personnel to AFIA/SG for approval/disapproval. SEIs are normally terminated
   within 6-12 months, and the results are briefed at the annual IG-SG Annual Review. There
   should be no more than 3 active SEIs at one time.
   7.4.6. Consultative Visits and Virtual Element Reviews. AFIA/SG provides Consultative
   Team Visits to MTFs as requested by USAFE/SG and PACAF/SG. Specifically, the
   following MTFs will be considered based on their short assignment tour length: Osan,
   Kunsan, Lajes and Incirlik. Other MTFs may request individual functional area consultant
   visits through the AFIA/SG Support and Consultation Division. AFIA/SG‘s ability to honor
   these requests is based on inspection schedule and resource availability. AFIA/SG publishes
   an annual schedule of Virtual Element Reviews. These Virtual Element Reviews are a
   functional area specific review and discussion of every criterion in our HSI Guide. Over the
   course of a CY, every criterion will be discussed. Dial-in numbers and passwords are
   distributed AFMS-wide prior to each review through MAJCOM/SGs and AFMOA.
7.5. Field Inspection. As applicable, these inspections provide SAF/IG credible, independent
assessments of AF operational readiness, efficiency, discipline, morale, economy, and
effectiveness, as well as assist in oversight of the AF inspection system.
   7.5.1. IG Team Augmentation. On request, AFIA inspectors may augment MAJCOM/IG
   teams during inspections of field units. AFIA augmentees do not write a separate report.
   Rated inspectors with current medical and physiological training prerequisites may fly as
   observers in unit aircraft when appropriate to their inspection role.
   7.5.2. Contingencies and Combat. AFIA inspectors may deploy to forward locations and
   field HQs during contingency and/or combat operations to observe processes and recommend
   solutions to readiness problems beyond the control of the local AF field commander. These
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                      89


   visits require approval by the appropriate unified command. This is not an inspection, but is
   an opportunity for an independent and impartial AF-level team to analyze systemic readiness
   problems that may need HAF or higher-level attention. Refer also to War Mobilization Plan,
   Volume 1, Annex O.
7.6. Inspector General Directed Investigation (IGDI). An IGDI is a high-priority
investigation directed by TIG. These investigations are usually time sensitive and deficiencies
and recommendations are of significant interest to the AF, members of Congress, or the general
public. TIG approves all requests for IGDIs.
7.7. TIG Brief Magazine. AFIA publishes TIG Brief (Air Force Recurring Publication [AFRP]
90-1) which provides authoritative guidance and information to CC, IGs, inspectors, and AF
supervisors and leaders at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to AFIA/PI.
Articles should relate anticipated or actual problems, recommendations to improve management,
safety, security, inspection or operational techniques, cross tell of lessons learned, best practices,
or contemporary issues of interest to the AF.
7.8. Report Handling.
   7.8.1. See Section 2.9, this document.
   7.8.2. CIs and HSIs are privileged documents and may be released in whole or in part only
   within DOD with the express approval of AFIA/CC while ensuring the privileged status of
   the reports is protected.
       7.8.2.1. CIs are routinely released to inspected DRU/FOAs and the Air Staff. AFIA/IO
       will maintain a record of the official request for CIs.
       7.8.2.2. HSIs are routinely released to the unit, their MAJCOM and the Air Staff.

1. An INSI may be conducted on one or more facilities that are typical of new construction at a base. If
no other similar structures or facilities are modified after the INSI of typical structures, an inspection of
other structures or facilities is not required. If new structures or facilities are located in a specific area
(alert area or weapons storage area) and all of the area is affected, inspect the entire area after
construction is completed.
2. An INSI of new security intrusion detection systems is required after satisfactory completion of the
Phase III testing. Significantly modified intrusion detection systems must be recertified by an INSI.
Significant modifications include added, removed, or modified sensors not part of the original certified
system, change to source code on computer based intrusion detection system, or installation of new
software (this does not include upgrades to existing software that have been properly certified). The
responsible MAJCOM/IG must certify the system for operational use.
3. An INSI is required if the unit is being certified for the first time for its contingency nuclear mission
or if the 18-month certification is expired. An LNSI may be conducted (in lieu of a NSI) if the unit had a
NSI within 18 months, but a subordinate unit requires certification. (EXAMPLE: A wing with two
combat delivery squadrons tasked for a contingency nuclear capability receives an INSI, but only one of
its two squadrons is certified. An LNSI may be accomplished if the second combat delivery squadron is
subsequently tasked to demonstrate capability and the required certification inspection occurs within 18
months of the wing's last inspection. Under these circumstances, the MAJCOM inspection team, in
coordination with HQ AFSC and concerned HHQ functionals, will decide whether to accomplish an
LNSI or NSI.)
4. An INSI is required if the unit has not had a NSI within the 18-month requirement unless a waiver to
inspection frequency was approved by the MAJCOM/CC (refer to paragraph 5.5.1.1.1.). The unit will be
decertified and cease all nuclear critical tasks until the INSI is complete. The MAJCOM/CC is
responsible for ensuring the safety and security of all nuclear assets during the interim period between
decertification and recertification.
5. Scope of required inspection will be determined by the responsible MAJCOM functional(s) in
coordination with HQ AFSC and documented IAW paragraph 5.4.

               AF NUCLEAR WEAPON SECURITY INSPECTION GUIDE

A5.1. Utilization. The inspection areas and items in this guide identify minimum-security
standards and capabilities outlined in DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. When assessing
whether a unit complies with applicable technical criteria, inspectors use this guide to identify
areas/items to conduct performance test(s), compliance validation, or security exercises.
Inspectors also use this guide during security exercises to assess how applicable areas/items
contribute to a unit‘s ability to meet the NWSS and provide effective response to emergencies.
Inspectors will use the published Integrated Base Defense Security System (IBDSS) Capability
Development Document (CDD) to inspect applicable technology listed in this guide.

                                 Attachment 6 (Added-AETC)
     CONTRACTED SUPPORT ACTIVITY INSPECTION (CSAI) PROCEDURES

A6.1. (Added-AETC) Contracts over $100,000. Any contracts over $100,000 in annual value
are subject to functional inspection for both contracted services and government oversight to
ensure contractor compliance with the SOW/PWS. Any contracts lower that $100,000 annually
are normally not inspected.
A6.2. (AETC) Functional Area Inspection. Each inspected contracted function is rated
individually in the functional area that is responsible for quality assurance (QA) and a
contractual reference is included with each deficiency.
A6.3. (AETC) Policy Coordination. HQ AETC/IG coordinates with HQ AETC/A7K and HQ
AETC/JA on contractual policies and other matters that affect AETC contracts inspections.
A6.4. (AETC) . Safeguards. Paragraphs A6.4.1 (Added) through A6.4.5.4 (Added) outline the
required safeguards used by the inspection team when inspecting contracted activities during
inspections to prevent claims and protests resulting from inspecting contracted functions. HQ
AETC/IG inspectors will:
   A6.4.1. (Added) (AETC) Request SOW/PWS and associated government documents from
   the inspected unit. Additional contract-related documents will be obtained from the
   contracting officer by the contracting inspector.
   A6.4.2. (Added) (AETC) Develop contract inspection areas in coordination with HQ AETC
   functional staff agencies.
   A6.4.3. (Added) (AETC) Inbrief the functional commander, write the inspection report
   inputs, and outbrief the functional commander.
   A6.4.4. (Added) (AETC) Consult the cognizant contracting officer when contract
   interpretation is necessary.
   A6.4.5. (Added) (AETC) Follow inspection report procedures. Include contracted activities
   in inspection reports as a tab in the functional area that is responsible for quality assurance of
   the contracted activities. Contracted activities inspections will include these evaluated areas:
       A6.4.5.1. (Added) (AETC) Government Oversight. This area will include all
       contractor surveillance responsibilities, including but not limited to, QA personnel and
       any associated processes and surveillance documents, functional commanders, and
       interface with contracting personnel.
       A6.4.5.2. (Added) (AETC) Mission Impact. Include a subjective assessment of the
       value added to the mission by the contracted activity.
       A6.4.5.3. (Added) (AETC) Contractor Performance/Compliance. This includes an
       assessment of contractor compliance with contract terms and conditions. Deficiencies in
       this area will reference the governing contract. Specific comments regarding contractor
       performance will be included under a separate contractor performance tab in the CSAI
       report. The unit (or responsible organization) contracting office is responsible for
       addressing performance issues with the contractor.
 142                            AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


A6.5. (Added-AETC) Deficiency Replies. Functional directors and commanders must reply to
answerable contractor performance/compliance tab deficiencies in inspection reports. The
respective contracting officer is the OCR and will coordinate on the reply before it is submitted
to HQ AETC/IGI. At minimum, replies will address formal government actions taken by the
contracting officer in response to contractor deficiencies. Only contracting officers are
authorized to direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during inspections.
A6.6. (AETC) Inspection Procedures:
   A6.6.1. (Added) (AETC) While inspecting, the contracting officer and/or QA personnel
   should accompany the IG during inspections. Inspectors will provide feedback to all parties
   on what was found during the inspection.
   A6.6.2. (Added) (AETC) When feasible, inspectors will provide a copy of their inspection
   schedule to the contractor‘s project manager to avoid unreasonable interruptions of
   contractor performance. The inspection schedule will also be provided to the QAE or QAR.
   A6.6.3. (Added) (AETC) Inspectors will not direct contractor performance, nor will they
   direct the contractor to correct deficiencies. If an inspector notes an imminent danger to
   personnel or equipment, he or she will take immediate action to mitigate the hazard.
   A6.6.4. (Added) (AETC) Contract compliance is validated with the QAE and/or the
   contracting officer/administrator.
A6.7. (Added-AETC) Outbrief Attendance. Contractor personnel are authorized to attend
theater outbriefs but may only attend executive briefings at the government‘s discretion. Details
of individual contractor performance will not be included in the theater outbriefs.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                143


                               Attachment 7 (Added-AETC)
                            HQ AETC OBSERVER PROGRAM

A7.1. (Added-AETC) Purpose. The observer program offers units an opportunity to see how
the HQ AETC/IG team operates and how other units respond to inspections.
A7.2. (AETC) Program. AETC CI observers are allowed on a noninterference basis. The
inspected unit and HQ AETC/IG staff have the authority to allow, disallow, accommodate, or
dismiss observers at any time. Large units will use these procedures:
   A7.2.1. (Added-AETC) Wings will submit a consolidated observer request through their
   unit IG to HQ AETC/IGIO at least 45 calendar days before the CI to be observed. Include
   observer name, grade, organization, duty phone, and E-mail address. Also, provide a list of
   the specific areas to observe. Areas should be tied to a tab from a previous report, such as
   PA, CP, MARE, OSS, or CE operations flight.
   A7.2.1. (12FTW) 12 FTW/IG collects, consolidates, processes and coordinates all observer
   requests. 12 FTW/CC approves all observer requests for submittal to AETC IG/IGIO.
   A7.2.2. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/IGIO will compile all observer requests, identify
   inspection areas where there are requests for more than one observer, and notify wings whose
   requests are denied because of conflict or duplication. Normally only one observer will be
   allowed per inspector. Units may submit as many requests as desired. However, HQ
   AETC/IG will normally approve a maximum of 25 observers per inspection. Wings slated for
   a CI within 4 to 6 months will have priority.
   A7.2.3. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/IGIO will send the de-conflicted list of proposed
   observers to the inspected unit project officer for review, staffing, and approval at least 14
   calendar days before the CI.
   A7.2.4. (Added-AETC) The inspected unit‘s project officer will provide HQ AETC/IGIO
   with the final approved observer list at least 10 calendar days before the CI. The inspected
   wing will have final approval authority for that list.
   A7.2.5. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/IGI will send the final approved list to each wing IG
   who requested observers at least 7 calendar days before the CI. The approved list will include
   an assigned inspector and contact number for each observer. Last minute changes to the
   approved observer list will be coordinated through HQ AETC/IGIO; will only be approved in
   extraordinary circumstances; and may result in restrictions to areas observed.
   A7.2.6. (Added-AETC) Once approved, observers will make their own lodging and
   transportation arrangements. Temporary duty funding will be the observer unit‘s
   responsibility. Observers will contact their assigned inspectors at HQ AETC at least 5
   calendar days before the CI to establish a meeting place and time at the inspected wing.
   A7.2.7. (Added-AETC) The individual observer is responsible for ensuring clearance into
   controlled access areas have been coordinated and approved by the inspected unit. HQ
   AETC/IG personnel will not take responsibility for escorting observers into controlled areas.
   Observers will be granted access at the discretion and by the authority of the inspected unit.
144                           AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


  A7.2.8. (Added-AETC) Assigned inspectors will issue appropriate identification (ID) to
  their observers at the first meeting and review observer rules of engagement (ROE) with
  them. Before each observer departs, the assigned inspectors will collect their ID badges.
  A7.2.9. (Added-AETC) For observing other than one-on-one interviews (MAREs,
  exercises, etc.), the HQ AETC/IG will set a maximum number of observers. The number will
  be situation dependent.
  A7.2.10. (Added-AETC) Observers must not interfere with the inspection process under
  any circumstance. Observers may ask inspectors questions if inspected unit personnel are not
  present.
  A7.2.11. (Added-AETC) Observers will not be allowed to attend validation sessions or
  enter the IG work center. However, observers may arrange to tour the work center on the first
  duty day of the inspection to observe set up, see requirements, and ask questions. Contact HQ
  AETC/IGIX at least 5 calendar days before the inspection to coordinate a tour.
  A7.2.12. (Added-AETC) AETC/CV has authorized the wear of utility uniforms for the
  entire inspection.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  145


                                 Attachment 8 (Added-AETC)
                           SUPPORT FOR AETC INSPECTIONS

A8.1. (Added-AETC) Project Officer. Each inspected unit designates a project officer when
notified of a HQ AETC/IG inspection. This officer will be the focal point who coordinates with
the HQ AETC/IG project officer to ensure all inspection team requirements (transportation,
lodging, work areas, admin, communication support, etc.) are satisfied. The project officer
should identify any limited team support capabilities (such as restricted operating hours of dining
facilities, etc.). All requirements will be coordinated between the unit project officer and HQ
AETC/IG project officer.
A8.1. (12FTW)Advanced Echelon (ADVON). The Higher Headquarters Inspection Support
Program (HHQ-ISP) facilitates the reception, bed-down, and in-place assistance of a HHQ
inspection team from notification through the inspection team out-brief. This program tracks all
answerable deficiencies (or equivalent items) from the evaluation reports to ensure corrective
actions are valid, timely, and address the root cause of the observations.
A8.2. (AETC) Advanced Echelon (ADVON). For large inspections, HQ AETC/IGI will
coordinate with the inspected unit for an ADVON visit approximately 45 calendar days before
the inspection to assist with requirements. ADVON requirements are identified in the functional
area requirements as stated in paragraph A8.3 (Added).
A8.2. (12FTW)Functional Area Requirements. The UCI reception team prepares the unit to
receive the HHQ inspection team. The UCI reception team will be composed of the wing UCI
project officer, other 12 FTW/IG representatives as directed by the 12 FTW/CC. The reception
team will be supplemented with squadron and wing staff inspection monitors and functional area
experts as needed. Preparations will be IAW AFI90-201_AETCSUP, Attachment 8 (Added-
AETC).
A8.3. (AETC) Functional Area Requirements. Requirements                 are   tailored for each
inspection. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory.
   A8.3.1. (Added-AETC) Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. A list of requirements will be
   made available on the HQ AETC/IG portal 75 calendar days for active duty units and 90
   calendar days for ARC units before the inspection. It is the responsibility of the inspected
   unit project officer to ensure all functionals are aware of the requirements.
   A8.3.2. (Added-AETC) GSUs Inspected by the HQ AETC/IG Team. HQ AETC/IGIO
   will E-mail all requirements to GSUs 45 calendar days before an inspection.
   A8.3.3. (Added-AETC) No-Notice/Minimal-Notice Inspections. The notification process
   will include identification of an HQ AETC/IG project officer for the inspection. A unit
   project officer will also be requested. Required documentation, logistical support and any
   associated deliverables will be coordinated between these two entities.
A8.4. (Added-AETC) Access to Restricted Areas, Material, and Entry Authorization Lists
(EAL):
   A8.4.1. (Added-AETC) The inspected unit will accept restricted area badges issued by the
   inspection team members' home base; otherwise, normal escort procedures will apply.
 146                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


   A8.4.2. (Added-AETC) Inspectors are authorized access to any material related to the
   inspection commensurate with their security clearances and special access authorization. This
   includes reports of audit, SAVs, stan/eval inspections, quality control results, and PA and
   FOIA records or information. Contract quality assurance evaluators (QAE) or quality
   assurance representatives (QAR) will provide copies of all statements of work (SOW),
   performance work statements (PWS), quality assurance surveillance plans, process assurance
   measurement programs, and product requirements documents, with all current changes.
   Inspectors are also authorized to review inspection reports on, and agreements with, associate
   units to ensure that identified deficiencies and existing support problems receive adequate
   command attention. Upon notice of inspection, provide the HQ AETC/IG project officer with
   requirements for access to the highest level of classified material used.
   A8.4.3. (Added-AETC) The HQ AETC/IGISI inspector will upon team arrival provide the
   inspected unit security forces (SF) chief with an EAL for authentication and distribution. The
   EAL will contain the inspectors‘ names, ranks, last six of SSNs, organizations, restricted area
   badge numbers, security clearances, and dates of visit and expiration dates.
   A8.4.4. (Added-AETC) The installation command post and law enforcement desk will
   maintain a copy of the EAL during the inspection. Installation SF will be responsible for
   EAL distribution.
   A8.4.5. (Added-AETC) Follow AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), entry procedures
   for restricted areas and sensitive compartmented information facilities.
   A8.4.6. (Added-AETC) The inspected unit will determine team vehicle ID procedures,
   including rentals and privately owned vehicles. Vehicle access to flight line areas or any
   other area where government owned vehicles (GOV) are normally authorized must be

   A9.1.4. (Added-AETC) AFI Standard. Prepare replies consistent with AFI 90-201,
   paragraph 2.6.3. Describe actions and procedures that prevent recurrence and provide
   sufficient detail so the HQ staff can determine if the corrective actions are adequate. State the
   means by which the corrective action has been validated to preclude the deficiency from
   recurrence. If the cited deficiency is beyond base capabilities to resolve without action by the
   HQ staff, identify the responsible MAJCOM or staff agencies and describe the actions
   required. Following the final sentence of the reply, indicate the date corrective actions were
   completed or an estimated completion date. Always indicate the rank, name, office symbol,
   and telephone number of the person responsible for monitoring corrective actions. Include a
   recommendation to either close the deficiency or keep it open.
   A9.1.5. (Added-AETC) Deficiencies. Deficiencies must be closed as soon as possible, but
   no later than 12 months after the last day of the inspection for AETC wings and training
   units. AETC-gained ARC unit deficiencies must be closed no later than 24 months after the
   last day of the inspection. Waivers allowing exception to these timelines may be requested
   from the HQ AETC/IG for circumstances that preclude issues from being resolved within the
   required timeframes.

        COMMAND INTEREST ITEM (CII) DEVELOPEMENT AND FORMAT

A10.1. (Added-AETC) SII and CII Compliance. HQ AETC/IGI inspects for compliance
with Air Force SIIs and AETC, AFRC, and NGB CIIs, as applicable. The HQ AETC/CC, HQ
AFRC/CC, and ANG/CC designate and approve CIIs for areas or functions requiring particular
inspection interest and compliance. Functional authorities analyze feedback from CIIs to
facilitate decisionmaking and policy adjustments. AF SIIs and AETC, AFRC, and NGB CIIs are
identified by number and have prescribed expiration dates. A separate tab in the inspection report
summarizes the status of current CIIs. If an area covered by a CII receives a deficiency, the CII
area tab will normally include a cross-reference to the appropriate functional area tab.
A10.2. (AETC) Current SII and CII Listing. HQ AETC/IGIX posts a current listing of Air
Force SIIs, AETC, AFRC and NGB CIIs on the HQ AETC/IG portal.
A10.3. (AETC) HQ AETC CII Development. The HQ AETC functional OPR is responsible
for the development and staffing of a CII. The functional OPR will submit an ESSS with draft
CII to HQ AETC/IG workflow Inbox for review to ensure the CII does not conflict with AF SIIs.
Prepare ESSS package according to current HQ AETC format requirements and figures in this
attachment (see Figure A10.1 (Added) for CII format). Upon approval from HQ AETC/IGIX, the
functional will staff the package to applicable directorates, HQ AETC/IG, HQ AETC/DS,
AFRC/IG, and NGB-IGD and then to the AETC/CC for approval. Once approved, the functional
will forward the approved package to HQ AETC/IGIX who will advise AETC and ARC units
that a new HQ AETC CII (and any additional guidance required) is available for implementation
and posted on the HQ AETC/IG portal.
A10.4. (AETC) Published CIIs. NGB-IGD and HQ AFRC/IG will forward a link of any
published NGB/AFRC CIIs to HQ AETC/IGIX to be posted on the HQ AETC/IG portal.
A10.5. (AETC) Self-Inspection of CIIs. HQ AETC/IGIX will notify wings or units that are
not inspected during the active CII period, instruct them to conduct a self-inspection of the
subject CII, and provide the required format and suspense. Notification will be sent to the wing
IG for staffing action. Results will be consolidated and returned to HQ AETC/IGIX through the
wing IG office. HQ AETC/IGIX will forward the results to the command functional OPR.

HQ AETC COMMAND INTEREST ITEM (CII) XX-X
TITLE OF CII
INTRODUCTION
This CII applies to all AETC wings, groups, and tenant units. HQ AETC/IG may conduct this
CII during any inspection venue. Inspectors will assign a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory or
Complies/Does Not Comply response to each checklist item. To help the wing determine root
causes for program weaknesses, inspectors will include brief comments explaining why each
response was assigned. Based on their experience and judgment, inspectors are also encouraged
to include any commendable or correctional comments that may be of value to the wing.
(Additional verbiage may be added for clarification by the functional OPR responsible for the
CII).
Include a comprehensive inspection guide for units to apply in self-inspections and HQ
AETC/IG to inspect the CII topic. This guide should include specific questions and procedures
for evaluating the topic. Ensure that compliance-oriented questions are solidly grounded in
specific regulatory guidance (e.g., DoDI, AFI, etc.) and include the applicable reference with
each question.

                                Attachment 12 (Added-12FTW)
                  SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM (SIP) MANAGEMENT

A12.1. (Added-12FTW) SIP Execution Model. The SIP consists of four parent organizations
for execution. The SIP execution model is not to be understood as a chain-of-command
organization but rather an organizational protocol for assignment of inspection criteria to specific
offices grouped under a SIP parent organization. Self Inspection Monitors establish the detailed
sub-organizational structure individual units use to administer the program. The SIP parent
organizations and their sub-organizations are as below.
   A12.1.1. (Added-12FTW) 12 Operations Group. 12 OG SIP organization consists of the
   FTW Staff, OG staff, 12 OSS, 99 FTS, 435 FTS, 558 FTS, 559 FTS and 560 FTS sub-
   organizations.
   A12.1.2. (Added-12FTW) 479 Flying Training Group. 479 FTG SIP organizations consist
   of the FTW-P Staff, 479 FTG Staff, 451 FTS, 455 FTS and 479 OSS.
   A12.1.3. (Added-12FTW) 12 Maintenance Directorate. 12 MX SIP organizations include
   only those functions/offices that normally operate at Randolph AFB.
   A12.1.4. (Added-12FTW) 12 Maintenance Directorate-Pensacola. 12 MX-P organizations
   include only those functions/offices that normally operate at NAS Pensacola.
A12.2. (Added-12FTW) Duties and Responsibilities. SIP relies upon specific duties to
ensure the right people are performing appropriate actions to ensure compliance and mission
accomplishment. These duties are split into for specific SIP functional players: SIP POCs, SIP
Mangers, SIP Monitors and SIP Inspectors.
   A12.2.1. (Added-12FTW) SIP POCs. Each commander, director in A12.1 thru A12.4
   above will appoint, at a minimum, a primary and alternate Group/Division SIP POC in
   accordance with AFI90-201, AETCSUP, paragraph 2.4.1. 12 OG POCs fulfill POC duties
   for the 12 FTW Staff. Provide the appointment letter to 12 FTW/IG. SIP POCs will:
       A12.2.1.1. (12FTW) (Added) Collect, collate and report SIP results to their respective
       commander/director and 12 FTW/IG or 12 FTW/IG-P, as applicable. 12 OG SIP POCs
       provide 12 FTW staff SIP results to 12 FTW/DS and 12 FTW/IG.
       A12.2.1.2. (Added-12FTW) Provide the 12 FTW/IG with a Group/Directorate Self
       Inspection Report in accordance with reporting requirements in A12.6.2.
       A12.2.1.3. (Added-12FTW) Be trained in accordance with training defined by 12
       FTW/IG.
       A12.2.1.4. (Added-12FTW) Provide training and tracking to SIP Monitors.
       A12.2.1.5. (Added-12FTW) Ensure checklists are uploaded to WebSIP commensurate
       with the SIP Battle Rhythm.
       A12.2.1.6. (Added-12FTW) Ensure SII criteria is part of the SIP, when directed by 12
       FTW/IG or the SII OPR. (See Attachment 13 below.)
 160                            AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


   A12.2.2. (Added) (12FTW)            SIP Managers. SIP Managers are local (Randolph
   AFB/Pensacola NAS) Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), normally assigned within the 12
   FTW, who assign functional checklist items to the various offices deemed responsible to
   inspect those items. SIP Managers‘ role is to confirm functional area criteria, their currency
   and applicability to the various organizations and sub-organizations. SIP Managers will:
       A12.2.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Review and compare AFIA web site with the 12 FTW/IGI
       master listing and advise POCs on the currency of the master listing.
       A12.2.2.2. (Added-12FTW) Provide initial assignment of master checklist items to the
       various SIP organizations and sub-organizations.
       A12.2.2.3. (Added-12FTW) Be identified by 12 FTW/IG, for Randolph-assigned units
       and 12 FTW/IG-P for Pensacola assigned units. SIP Manager assignments are
       made/viewed on the Checklist Management page.
   A12.2.3. (Added-12FTW) SIP Monitors. Are the unit-level points of contact for SIP. SIP
   Monitors are the key players in SIP execution. Each SIP Monitor should be thoroughly
   familiar with the unit mission, organization and how duties/responsibilities are parsed. SIP
   Monitors:
       A12.2.3.1. (Added-12FTW) Are appointed by the respective commander/director.
       Note: 12FTW/DS and 12 FTW/IG-P will perform as Inspector Monitors for their
       respective leadership staff functions.
       A12.2.3.2. (Added-12FTW) Ensure the SIP organization is properly modeled for their
       unit. (See links in A12.1.1 above.)
       A12.2.3.3. (Added-12FTW) Ensure proper assignment of functional checklist items.
       (This is a collateral responsibility, see SIP Managers above.)
       A12.2.3.4. (Added-12FTW) Ensure all checklists items located on the WebSIP are
       answered. (See A12.2.4.)
       A12.2.3.5. (Added-12FTW) Provide SIP POCs with Self-Inspection Report in
       accordance with A12.6.2
       A12.2.3.6. (Added-12FTW) Ensure appropriate and current deficiency annotations are
       made in the WebSIP.
       A12.2.3.7. (Added-12FTW) Report applicable SIIs and actions taken in accordance
       with 12 FTW/IG (or SII POC requests). (See Attachment 13.)
   A12.2.4. (Added-12FTW) SIP Inspectors. Are the unit-level points of contact for
   individual checklists. Inspectors are typically Flight commanders, office chiefs or program
   POCs identified by the unit commander. SIP Monitors coordinate with SIP Inspectors to
   ensure WebSIP items are completed.
A12.3. (Added-12FTW) SIP Program Phases. The following phases are the logical order of
functions necessary to administer the SIP. Deficiency tracking, reporting and resolution as well
as new checklist entries are an ongoing process.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                   161


   A12.3.1. (Added-12FTW) Criteria Acquisition Phase. HAF checklists and AETC/IG
   checklists for specific functional areas are the initial basis for identification of SIP criteria
   matched to unit mission. 12 FTW/IG (or IG-P for Pensacola-assigned units) is responsible to
   ensure currency of checklists as reflected in the Checklist Directory
   (https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12FTW/IG/IGI/Lists/SI%20Checklist%20Names/Staff
   DirectorateView.aspx). Because the body of checklists is updated continuously, this phase
   is in effect continuously as well. Nevertheless, criteria currency is checked and confirmed
   per cycle according to the Battle Rhythm. Where a functional area has a checklist that is not
   a HAF or AETC/IG checklist, or where specific criteria are locally developed,
   Group/Division Inspection Managers are responsible to ensure those criteria are applicable to
   current guidance. In such cases, they may make changes to the SIP Master Checklist or
   initiate changes to the associated checklist with a SIP POC or 12 FTW/IG (or IG-P for
   Pensacola-assigned units).
   A12.3.2. (Added-12FTW) Criteria Assignment Phase.            Group/Division Inspection
   Managers assign or review assigned criteria from functional checklists. They ensure unit
   sub-organization is properly identified and assigned items along with Unit Inspector
   Monitors. This is also a continuous process however criteria assignment is confirmed
   according to the Battle Rhythm.
   A12.3.3. (Added-12FTW) SIP Upload Phase: 12 FTW/IG (or 12 FTW/IG-P for Pensacola
   units) and/or Group/Division Inspection managers confirm current organizational checklists
   are uploaded to WebSIP. SIP upload occurs according to the Battle Rhythm.
A12.3.4. (Added-12FTW) SIP Inspection Execution Phase. Self inspections are performed.
   A12.3.5. (Added-12FTW) SIP Validation, Reporting, and Resolution Phase.             Unit
   Inspectors in concert with Group/Division Managers, Unit Inspection Monitors, and
   commanders will validate deficiencies within WebSIP. SIP reporting will be based upon the
   WebSIP deficiency report initiated (by 12 FTW/IG or IG-P) NLT 15 days after the close of
   the cycle. Deficiency reporting, tracking, and trending are addressed below.
A12.4. (Added-12FTW) SIP Criteria Content Management. SIP criteria are managed in
three parts. First, the SIP Master Checklist, and all supporting lists are maintained on the IGI
SharePoint web site. The purpose of this portion of the SIP is to gather, validate and assign
functional checklist items to the various inspection offices throughout the 12 FTW. Second, the
WebSIP is the actual tool used for SIP operations/execution. This includes compliance tracking,
deficiency identification, validation, trends, reporting and rudimentary tracking features.
Detailed tracking, especially for chronic deficiencies is not possible within WebSIP. These are
handled in an ad hoc manner according to A12.7 below.
   A12.4.1. (Added-12FTW) The 12 FTW SIP is structured to be executed organizationally
   rather than functionally. That is, because of the size and scope of most functional checklists
   (HAF or AETC, etc) and many organizations may have only a small portion of an entire
   functional checklist, requiring assessment of every item on every functional checklist by
   every organization effected by that functional checklist is an onerous and inefficient burden.
   Hence, 12 FTW established an organizational model, implemented via sub-organizational
   model that itself is managed by and for individual units (by SIP Monitors).
 162                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012


   A12.4.2. (Added-12FTW) Second, since each inspection office within a squadron typically
   has duties spanning multiple functional areas, an organizational orientation to SIP execution
   enables each inspection office to be confident that each of the office‘s functional
   responsibilities are answered by the SIP.
A12.5. (Added-12FTW) SIP Battle Rhythm. The SIP Battle Rhythm is published at:
https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12FTW/IG/Blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?List=e73462af%2D1
8ea%2D483c%2Db8c0%2D93e1be7d7b26&ID=1&Source=https%3A%2F%2Frandolph
%2Eeis%2Eaetc%2Eaf%2Emil%2F12FTW%2FIG%2FBlog%2Fdefault%2Easpx.
A12.6. (Added-12FTW) Documentation
   A12.6.1. (Added-12FTW) Basic requirements. All items will be answered in the WebSIP.
   Items not in compliance when the report is written, regardless of their validity will be
   included in the report. If a HHQ evaluation occurred during the semiannual period, the Wing
   Commander may decide to withhold a semiannual self-inspection requirement.
   A12.6.2. (Added-12FTW) Reporting is accomplished in two parts: End-of-Cycle and Mid-
   Cycle. These reporting cycles correspond to end of a SIP cycle and the end of the inspection
   phase of the SIP cycle, respectively (as defined in the Battle Rhythm). Reports are initiated
   by SIP Monitors, SIP POCs or IG/IG-P. Reports are signed by the unit commander, director
   or IG/IG-P (for FTW Staff offices).
   A12.6.3. (Added-12FTW) SIP Monitors send their report to their respective SIP POC. SIP
   POCs collate unit responses, work with units to ensure an accurate reflection of data is shown
   in the WebSIP, and review results with their respective commander/director prior to sending
   a response to 12 FTW/IG. IG/IG-P performs these duties for FTW Staff offices.
   A12.6.4. (Added-12FTW) Wing staff and division chiefs send their report directly to 12
   FTW/IG or IG-P (for Pensacola units).
   A12.6.5. (Added-12FTW) All required SIP Reports include all open discrepancies,
   discrepancies that cannot be addressed with resources available with the originating unit
   (those requiring higher headquarters assistance for resolution), repeat discrepancies,
   discrepancies identified as either AFSO21 events or candidate events and trends. Submit
   report results to 12 FTW/IG in accordance with the SIP Battle Rhythm, or as determined by
   12 FTW/CC.
A12.7. (Added-12FTW) Deficiency tracking Deficiency tracking is accomplished in two
parts. First, the WebSIP Deficiency Tracker report initiated after the close of the cycle identifies
items deemed by SIP inspectors to be non-compliant. Further WebSIP provides logging of
discrepancy resolution actions. 12 FTW/IG (or IG-P for Pensacola units) initiates the WebSIP
Deficiency Tracker report. Second, reports and AFSO21 events provide the balance of tracking
and resolution actions.
   A12.7.1. (Added-12FTW) SIP Monitors ensure discrepancies are properly tracked and
   resolution actions logged in the WebSIP Discrepancy Tracker. SIP POCs or IG/IG-P assist
   in this process when applicable.
   A12.7.2. (Added-12FTW) During the latter half of each SIP cycle, units, in concert with
   Unit Inspection Monitors, validate and initiate resolution to identified deficiencies.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                             163


  A12.7.3. (Added-12FTW) Deficiencies that are not resolved and not invalidated prior to
  the close of the cycle should be carried over as repeat or unresolved deficiencies with
  reference made in the previous cycle Deficiency Tracker according to the following protocol.
  A12.7.4. (Added-12FTW) The deficiency noted should be marked as ‗In Progress‘ in the
  previous WebSIP cycle and the final entry in the deficiency log should reference the current
  cycle item.
  A12.7.5. (Added-12FTW) The current cycle remarks should reflect the fact the item is a
  repeat deficiency along with its previous cycle deficiency identifier.
  A12.7.6. (Added-12FTW) Further information may be found in the discrepancy tracking
  blog entry on the IGI SharePoint site.
  A12.7.7. (Added-12FTW) Repeat deficiencies should be reported to the next higher chain
  of command in accordance with reporting requirements above.
  A12.7.8. (Added-12FTW) Deficiencies identified as either AFSO21 events or candidate
  events should be identified as such within WebSIP Deficiency Tracker.

                               Attachment 13 (Added-12FTW)
                       SPECIAL INTEREST ITEM (SII) PROGRAM

A13.1. (Added-12FTW) General. The SII program is a tool to manage the local application of
Air Force and AETC SIIs. SIIs focus management attention, gather data, and/or assess the status
of specific programs and conditions in the field. SIIs may also be used to determine the degree of
compliance with directives, policies, and procedures, gather data on known or suspected
problems, identify specific deficiencies, or to confirm a problem is resolved.
A13.2. (Added-12FTW)Implementing SIIs. 12 FTW group commanders, directors and
division chiefs are responsible for implementing SIIs into their overall inspection program. 12
FTW maintains applicable SIIs and CIIs at the following website: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c6925EC1897B20FB5
E044080020E329A9&channelPageId=s6925EC134C6F0FB5E044080020E329A9&program
Id=t6925EC2B1C650FB5E044080020E329A9.
   A13.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Implementation of a SII may include a tasking in the form of
   completion of "actions required" items for response to higher headquarters. If required, the
   12 FTW/IG may nominate an OPR for the SII to the 12 FTW/CC for tasking. The OPR then
   coordinates with appropriate wing agencies, as necessary, to complete the "actions required"
   listed in the SII, and prepares the reply IAW the tasking instructions. The reply is sent to 12
   FTW/IG, who coordinates the reply through the wing staff for 12 FTW/CC approval.
   A13.2.2. (Added-12FTW) OPRs for SIIs will review implementation compliance during
   the self-inspection cycle and determine if additional criteria for demonstration of SII
   compliance is warranted thru the SIP. If so, the SII OPR will serve in the role of SIP
   Manager and coordinate with SIP POCs to ensure the additional criteria is added to the SIP.
   When the SII expires, the OPR should coordinate with SIP POCs to determine if the criteria
   should remain. SIP Monitors will report on SII compliance as directed by 12 FTW/IG or the
   SII OPR.
   A13.2.3. (Added-12FTW) 12 FTW/IGI will identify/clarify requirements and ratings in the
   absence of these criteria from the SII functional originator. SII details and clarifications will
   be       posted       on       the       12      FTW/IGI         SharePoint         site      at:
   https://randolph.eis.aetc.af.mil/12FTW/IG/IGI/default.aspx.
