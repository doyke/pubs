1. Airfield Driving Program Concept and Responsibilities.
     1.1. Concept.
        1.1.1. 934 OSS/OSA, Airfield Management (AM) is the Office of Primary
        Responsibility for the Wing Airfield Driving Program. AM trains and certifies unit
        Airfield Driving Program Managers. Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM)
        will in turn, manage their unit programs and train unit personnel who have an operational
        requirement to drive on the airfield.
        1.1.2. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create a safe driving environment.
        The safe operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is absolutely essential to normal
        aircraft and maintenance operations. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger,
        to aircraft, aircrew, and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard for
        established safety standards are the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle collisions and/or
        incidents and personnel injury with motor vehicles on the airfield.
        1.1.3. All base-assigned (military, civilian, contractor, etc) personnel who operate a
        vehicle on the airfield must be trained on local airfield driving procedures, complete the
        Airfield Driving CBT, be licensed to operate the type of vehicle(s) required by the unit
        for mission accomplishment, and have an AF IMT 483 endorsed for airfield driving.
        Airfield experience (e.g. operating vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion
        of airfield driving training and testing requirements.
        1.1.4. Newly assigned base personnel must complete the entire airfield driving program
        regardless of previous assignments at other military installations. AF IMT 483’s received
        at previous installations are no longer valid once the individual arrives at Minneapolis Air
        Reserve Station. The Airfield Manager and the unit Airfield Driving Program Manager
934AWI13-213 27 JULY 2012                                                                    3


     have the authority to confiscate the old AF IMT 483 and prohibit airfield driving
     privileges until the individual completes all mandatory training and receives an AF IMT
     483, Certificate of Competency (Airfield Drivers License) for Minneapolis Air Reserve
     Station.

         OSS/OSA ATTN: Airfield Management.
             1.2.3.1.1. Unit APDM must be at least a SSgt/7-level or above, or civilian
             equivalent unless manning constraints absolutely prohibit; then use most qualified
             SSgt/5-level or civilian equivalent available. Note: The responsible Group
