This instruction provides policy and procedures for selection and quantitative computation of spare part
requirements for new weapon systems. It implements DoD 4140.1-R, as it applies to the provisioning and
item requirements determination processes. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or
US Air Force Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is a new instruction, developed from procedures formerly covered in AFMCR 57-27 and aligns
AFMC policy with Air Force Policy Directive 23-1. It includes the latest Air Force automated data pro-
cessing procedures and reflects the most recent Air Force organizational changes.

                                INITIAL REQUIREMENTS POLICY

1.1. Purpose. This instruction outlines Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) policy for determin-
ing initial stock levels of items that support new or modified weapon systems.

1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) personnel who
determine initial spare part requirements.

1.3. Terms and Abbreviations. Attachment 1 is a list of terms used in this instruction and their defini-
tions. Attachment 3 lists abbreviations.

1.4. Responsibility. HQ AFMC/LGI will implement the policies and procedures established in this
instruction. The inventory management specialist (IMS) will apply the procedures in this instruction to
determine quantitative requirements for new items. The Air Logistics Center financial management func-
tion (ALC/FM) will approve deviations from the policies in this instruction.

1.5. Program Data. Data used to compute new requirements must be in approved Air Force documents.
The D200F Requirements Data Bank (RDB) Applications, Programs, and Indentures (API) segment is the
approved source of program data. The IMS, using the procedures in this instruction, applies the basic item
data to the approved program to determine new item requirements.

1.6. Policy.
   1.6.1. General Policy.
       1.6.1.1. The D200H Requirements Data Bank (RDB) Initial Requirements Determination (IRD)
       subsystem is the approved automated tool for computing recoverable and consumable item
       requirements. The D200H is an interactive, on line system that builds and displays system and
       sub-system level programming checklists (PCL) and item worksheets.
       1.6.1.2. D200H is the preferred method for initial spares computation since it accommodates mul-
       tiple weapon systems and includes a simulation capability.
           1.6.1.2.1. If direct access to the RDB is not available the IMS may use the manual methodol-
           ogy on AFMC Form 27, Programming Checklist and either AFMC Form 614, Recoverable
           Item Initial Requirements Computation Worksheet, (recoverable items) or AFMC Form 997,
           EOQ Item Initial Requirements Worksheet (consumable items) for the item computations.
           These forms include instructions for calculating each data element. Attachment 1 provides the
           mathematical formulas that the IRD model employs.
       1.6.1.3. Use of mathematical models such as MOD-METRICÆ and the AMDAHL automated
       computation are encouraged. There are other models currently in use that are also appropriate for
       initial requirements determination. All mathematical models must follow the guidelines in this
       instruction. Mathematical models that recommend different wholesale-retail distribution (but not
       different quantities) of inventory than what this instruction directs may be used to compute
       requirements if the model conforms to the following criteria:
4                                                               AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

       1.6.1.3.1. The model computes funding constraints by computing the pipeline stock quantity
       for each item using the average month flying hour program. The resulting dollar value is the
       funding constraint.
       1.6.1.3.2. The model includes an optimization technique to minimize system down time or
       reduce backorders. This optimization technique would use the funding constraint as its budget
       goal when computing the optimal mix of items.
       1.6.1.3.3. DLM requirements are computed according to this instruction if not included in the
       model's methodology. The optimized results should include the additional stock and cost.
       1.6.1.3.4. No lower limits are placed on the model that will cause an item to be stocked as
       demand-based if the item would not have been stocked without the lower limit.
       1.6.1.3.5. Assumptions used in the computation are realistic and documented.
       1.6.1.3.6. Requirements quantities computed by the model are not adjusted outside of the
       model environment.
       1.6.1.3.7. The model computes requirements for all components of an end item. This is neces-
       sary to obtain consistency of support among all subsystems.
       1.6.1.3.8. If changes are made to factors for any items within a computational group, the
       entire group of items will recompute to obtain new quantities.
       1.6.1.3.9. The ALC Resources Management Division (ALC/FM) approves use of mathemati-
       cal models. The IMS forwards a request to use a mathematical model to the ALC/FM, who
       determines if the model is already in use. If so, the model’s assumptions (such as two levels of
       repair instead of three) are validated. If the model passes this review, no further action is
       required and the model can be implemented. If it is a new mathematical model, the ALC/FM
       determines that it meets the above criteria, and forwards the request and supporting documen-
       tation to HQ AFMC/LGI. The package includes a full description of the model, proposed strat-
       egy for its use, an example of the computation printout, and any other pertinent information.
    1.6.1.4. Initial spare parts include peculiar repairable and consumable components, assemblies,
    and subassemblies that must be available for issue at all levels of supply in time to support newly
    fielded end items during their entire production run. Whole spare engines will be classified as ini-
    tial spare parts through the life of the system. End items include major items of inventory such as
    aircraft, missiles, vehicles, and pieces of support equipment.
    1.6.1.5. The demand development period (DDP) starts on the end item’s preliminary operating
    capability (POC) date and ends when the accumulated demand or usage history is sufficient to pre-
    dict future demands. The DDP is not less than 12 months or more than 24 months long. POC is the
    date the first operational user receives the first end item. If an item only supports depot level
    repair, the DDP begins on the date the first end item is scheduled for overhaul.
    1.6.1.6. Program dataform the basis for requirements computations and budget estimates. There
    are two types of programs, operational and overhaul. Operational programs are normally
    expressed as operational (flying) hours or as the monthly average number of end items in the
    inventory (inventory months). Overhaul programs are expressed as the number of end items or
    higher assemblies in scheduled to undergo repair or overhaul. In either case monthly flying hour
    projections, the end item delivery schedule, the number of end items at each site, the overhaul
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                              5

     schedule, and the Program Forecast Period (PFP), determine how the IRD system time-phases
     program data.
     1.6.1.7. The PFP is peculiar to each item. It begins on the POC date and ends three months after
     the last day of acquisition lead time (AQLT ). The PFP is at least 12 months, even if the AQLT
     plus 3 months is less.
         1.6.1.7.1. Acquisition lead time includes two segments, administrative lead time (ALT) and
         production lead time (PLT).
         1.6.1.7.2. Administrative lead time begins when an item’s wholesale asset level is reduced to
         the reorder point, or the time at which a purchase request must be initiated to ensure that, at
         least in theory, the new stock arrives just as the assets on hand reach the safety level. ALT ends
         on the date the contractual instrument is executed. ALT includes the time required to identify
         a requirement and to buy; review, approve and document a purchase request; review technical
         data; and to process and execute the contractual instrument.
         1.6.1.7.3. Production lead time begins on the date that the contractual instrument is executed.
         PLT ends when a significant quantity (10% of the ordered quantity) of the materiel is received.
     1.6.1.8. The required item quantity relates to a demand forecast or to the item’s essentiality. The
     demand forecast is derived from predicted failures, projected programs, and maintenance factors.
     Acquisition quantities computed outside of the IRD process are permitted if quantity discounts or
     other acquisition techniques make them more economical. Any decision to buy a larger quantity
     must consider the risks of overstockage and obsolescence. The item manager must document the
     reasons for the different buy quantity.
     1.6.1.9. Acquisition programs must consider design stability, logistics costs and risks, and the
     system’s acquisition and delivery schedule.
     1.6.1.10. Generally, the initial requirements determination process does not apply to items
     already in the Air Force inventory, i. e. assigned a National Stock Number (NSN). The replenish-
     ment systems ( D041 for recoverable items, D062 for consumable items) compute requirements
     for these items.
         1.6.1.10.1. Some stock listed items may have experienced usage and developed demand rates
         with other system applications. When computing demand rates for initial requirements deter-
         mination, the equipment specialist considers these computed rates with the factors received
         from the provisioning documents and, if necessary, develops a weighted factor. Consumable
         item managers should enter an additive requirement in the D062 system to support new appli-
         cations.
     1.6.1.11. Program data should reflect a realistic production schedule and include only quantities
     of end articles that are reflected in approved DoD appropriations. Effective support planning for
     any new program includes anticipation of potential technical and production problems.
  1.6.2. Initial Requirements Policy.
     1.6.2.1. The RDB IRD produces a detailed computation for each new spare and repair part autho-
     rized for acquisition as an initial spare, using methods covered in this instruction. The IMS consid-
     ers all DoD assets before initiating a new acquisition.
6                                                                AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

    1.6.2.2. The IMS may compute other services’ requirements using the guidance in this instruc-
    tion, or through the Supply Support Request System (D169). Either a consumable supply support
    request (SSR) or a non-consumable materiel support request (NMSR) may identify new require-
    ments for non-Air Force managed items.
    1.6.2.3. The purpose of the initial requirements determination process is to provide spares sup-
    port just prior to or in conjunction with the delivery of the weapon system. Initial spares and repair
    parts requirements provide support for anticipated end article deliveries through a program fore-
    cast (PFP).
    1.6.2.4. The IMS may defer initial requirements computation if an item is under warranty or cov-
    ered by interim contract support (ICS). This deferral is valid until the warranty expires or when
    organic repair capability is available. Requirements for these items must be computed with IRD
    methodology if they are not stock-listed.
       1.6.2.4.1. When Interim Contractor Support (ICS) supports a newly fielded weapon system,
       contractual arrangements must ensure that the contractor collects spare and repair parts usage
       data and delivers them in a format compatible with AFMC systems. Where possible and prac-
       tical the contractor's usage data, rather than engineering estimates, should forecast spare and
       repair parts requirements. Under ICS, the contractor will repair an item until organic repair is
       established.
    1.6.2.5. Stockage criteria are determined during the provisioning process. This involves decisions
    whether or not each item will be stocked and, if stocked, how it is to be managed. All items that
    pass from D220 to the IRD are stocked items. The IRD edits the Source, Maintenance, and Recov-
    ery (SMR) code and the Total Organizational Maintenance Demand Rate (TOIMDR, see 1.9.3
    below) to determine if an item will be a demand-based or an insurance item. The D220 Provision-
    ing system passes both of these elements.
       1.6.2.5.1. Insurance items are not expected to fail through normal usage, but are considered
       critical for system operation. Therefore, wholesale stockage of minimal quantities is autho-
       rized in the event of losses through abnormal equipment failure, accidents, natural disasters, or
       other unforeseen events. An insurance item is catalogued as such during the provisioning pro-
       cess by assigning an Acquisition Advice Code (AAC) D; an insurance item can change to a
       demand based item only through a catalog change. The IRD system assigns item category
       code I to the following items:
           1.6.2.5.1.1. Items with both TOIMDR and Overhaul Replacement Percents of 0.
           1.6.2.5.1.2. Items with “PB” or “PG” in the first two positions of the SMR Code.
       1.6.2.5.2. Demand based items include failure rates and maintenance factors and compute
       requirements according to projected operational or inventory programs.
       1.6.2.5.3. The ALC may elect to manage some items as non-demand based numeric stockage
       objective (NSO) items. An NSO item is an essential, non-demand-based stocked item for
       which some failure is expected, but so infrequently or sporadically that it is not possible to pre-
       dict any meaningful demand rates. NSO items do not qualify for stockage on the basis of
       demand. But since the lack of a replacement item would hamper the operational capability of
       a weapon system, the item is stocked as an essential, non-demand-based item.
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                              7

       1.6.2.6. When first-year production quantities are less than ten percent of total production quanti-
       ties, a request for waiver for an additional two years of provisioning support may be submitted.
       The waiver, if granted, would apply to a particular program and may cover all or part of the new,
       peculiar items applicable to that program. The waiver request should include complete justifica-
       tion and a statement of the anticipated impact on funds. It should also include a statement about
       the type of procurement proposed e.g., competitive on a purchase request (PR), noncompetitive on
       a PR, or provisioning item order (PIO) and will be submitted for approval to the ALC/FM.
       1.6.2.7. Security Assistance (SA) Program. SA initial requirements are unprogrammed and there-
       fore not included in the Air Force initial requirements computation process. However, they may
       be included as an additive when computing a consolidated requirement. AFM 67-1, Vol 9, Secu-
       rity Assistance Program Procedures, provides guidance for SA requirements. If Provisioning Item
       Orders are used to procure the requirement, the SA requirement and the Air Force requirement
       cannot be consolidated on a single PIO because the fund cites are different and a PIO relates to a
       single contract line item.

1.7. Program Data.
   1.7.1. End item program data must be consistent with program data used for replenishment spares
   program.
   1.7.2. Programs must consider requirements for the depot and base and will be developed in 3-month
   increments, beginning with the month that includes POC as month 1.
       1.7.2.1. To support depot overhaul requirements the system develops an Adjusted Month Pro-
       gram (AMP) over the program time base (PTB). The PTB begins with a period of time equal to a
       review cycle and is measured with each review. The PTB expands until it equals the item’s Pro-
       gram Forecast Period (PFP). For example, an item with a review cycle of 6 would have PTBs of 6,
       12, 18, etc., until the PFP has been reached. See chapter 5 for details on AMP development.
       1.7.2.2. For base level requirements, the adjusted month program is developed according to the
       contracted end item delivery schedule to sites being activated during the PFP.
       1.7.2.3. After considering the total costs involved in ordering initial requirements, the develop-
       ment of item program data should be tailored to indicate the manner in which orders are to be pro-
       cessed. A decision to deviate from the incremental release of orders policy should be made on an
       item-by-item basis. The ALC/FM must grant approval.
       1.7.2.4. A programming checklist (PCL) contains segmented programs applicable to the weapon
       system or end article on a production or modification contract. Chapter 3 provides a complete
       description of the programming checklist. When the item's lead time, plus 3 months, is larger than
       the highest program time base shown on the provisioning checklist, the largest program time base
       on the provisioning checklist applies. If no program time base coincides with the required pro-
       gram period, the next higher program time base applies instead.
       1.7.2.5. The assigned provisioning office will notify the lateral support ALCs of changes to the
       PCL by issuing a revised checklist. The responsible provisioning office is usually the ALC/SPM
       or the ALC/EAIM.

1.8. Stockage and Retention. The ALC/FM (or an assigned counterpart) maintains a 3-year history of
part-numbered and stock-numbered non-stocked item requisitions received at the wholesale level. The
8                                                                   AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

purpose is to identify for procurement (and possibly stockage) items that later may meet the DoD inven-
tory control point (ICP) stockage criteria.
    1.8.1. Items with high reliability may receive little or no demand during the demand development
    period (DDP). To avoid disposal of an item that may be needed later, the item manager should contact
    the local disposal office to determine how soon after the preliminary operational capability an item
    can be a disposal candidate. HQ AFMC/LGI must approve any calculations prior to use. Retention
    levels shall then be set in accordance with DoD 4140.1-R, Chapter 4. When scheduled end item deliv-
    eries extend beyond the PFP, initial spares support is limited to the projected end item deliveries dur-
    ing the PFP.

1.9. Usage and Demand Rates.
    1.9.1. The D220 system provides all failure, maintenance, wear-out, replacement, and condemnation
    rates.
    1.9.2. The primary contractor furnishes rates and factors. The ES approves or changes these rates and
    then provides the factors to the IMS, who uses them to develop initial support requirements. Rates and
    factors should represent the latest information available (for example, test data, design change infor-
    mation, or experience with a similar item). The ES must notify the end article system manager of their
    intent to deviate significantly (plus or minus 10 percent) from contractor estimated failure rates on
    major systems or subsystems being provisioned. The ES should not change contractor furnished data
    if they were developed as part of a reliability and maintainability program, unless the mission or the
    maintenance concept changed after the data were developed. The ES retains supporting documenta-
    tion to justify file maintained factors for at least 3 years.
    1.9.3. The maintenance repair rates (MRRs derive from the total OIM demand rate (TOIMDR),
    which is an indication of the number of failures to occur for every unit of program (flying hours x 100
    or per installed unit). MRRs include base repair rates and depot demand rates as well as the TOIMDR.
    The base repair rate determines the number of failures that will be repaired at the base maintenance
    facility. The depot demand rate determines the number of units to be repaired at a depot repair facility.
    MRRs are expressed as a one-position whole number and a four-position decimal.
    1.9.4. Actual experience may determine the appropriate MRRs when at least 3 months of usage his-
    tory is available. For example, when 3 months of usage data are available, a new MRR should be
    developed. The actual data should be weighted 25 percent and the estimated MRR should be weighted
    75 percent. When 12 months of data are available, the new MRR should be developed by weighting
    the actual MRR at 50 percent and the estimated MRR at 50 percent. When 18 months of data are avail-
    able, the weighting for the actual MRR should be 75 percent and the estimated MRR 25 percent. After
    2 years of experience is available, the maintenance replacement rate is based entirely on actual data.
    In some cases, actual experience may not be indicative of future demands. The ES reviews these items
    and determines the appropriate MRRs. The ES may select 1 year of usage history to indicate future
    demands.
    1.9.5. Review Cycles (RC). The IRD system determines an item’s review cycle (RC) according to the
    dollar value of annual demands (DVAD). The DVAD is the unit repair cost multiplied by the number
    of base level failures and depot level replacements expected to occur over twelve months during the
    program forecast period.
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                                9

       1.9.5.1. The purpose of the review cycle is to provide a guide for initiating procurement actions
       and to determine which program to use for each procurement action. The number of months in the
       review cycle is the increment in which acquisition actions will be made. Each incremental quan-
       tity is the difference between the quantity in the current PTB and the quantity in the prior PTB.
       Different quantities are authorized if they are more economical. The ALC/FM approves these
       deviations. The value of buy quantities may not exceed available fiscal year initial spares funds
       without approval from HQ AFMC/FM and LG.
       1.9.5.2. Table 1.1 is an example of the review cycles and their associated dollar values. The val-
       ues in this table are those that were in effect on the implementation date of this instruction. The
       HQ AFMC OPR changes this table as required. All users with access to the on-line IRD system
       can view this table (see Chapter 3).
          1.9.5.2.1. The frequency of the SAIP “window” determines the review cycle for spares acqui-
          sition integrated with production (SAIP) items. If the SAIP window opens once a year, the
          review cycle is 12 months. If the SAIP review cycle is greater than the program forecast
          period, the SAIP quantity purchased with initial spares funds will be limited to the program
          forecast period. The remainder should be funded with replenishment funds. See 1.10.5 below
          for the definition of SAIP.

Table 1.1. Review Cycle Determination.
          Dollar Value of Annual Demands                 Review Cycle
                               $0 to 50,000      Program Forecast Period
                       $50,001 to 1,000,000      Quarterly
                    $1,000,001 to 2,500,000      Semiannually
                       $2,500,001 or greater     Annually

1.10. Special Item Categories.
   1.10.1. Insurance Items. Insurance item quantities consider item application, quantity per end item,
   expected distribution of the end item, and criticality of the item to the operation of the end item. Based
   on the item essentiality, wholesale stockage of insurance items is limited to: items that apply to high
   priority weapon system or end items, technically critical items necessary to insure weapon system
   availability, and items necessary for safety.
       1.10.1.1. An insurance level equal to one per wholesale storage activity should be sufficient for
       most programs. The IMS determines the quantity needed to maintain support. The ALC/FM ana-
       lyst approves larger insurance levels. The ES may provide the IMS with recommended quantities
       and their rationale.
       1.10.1.2. Insurance items are normally stocked only at the depot. An exception would be if the
       item supported an end item repair located at only one installation. The major command (MAJ-
       COM), IMS, and SPM make this determination.
       1.10.1.3. Procurement of insurance items with a very high cost (over $10,000 unit cost) are
       deferred until lead time prior to production phase-out of the end item. The insurance category
       must be revalidated prior to all contracting actions.
10                                                                  AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

        1.10.1.4. The item manager may initiate immediate acquisition action for an insurance item if a
        demand occurs, regardless of unit cost. At the same time, however, the equipment specialist
        should review the item to determine if the insurance code should be removed.
     1.10.2. Numeric Stockage Objective (NSO). Items are essential to program support because of a lack
     of the item prevents mission accomplishment or causes a safety hazard. The IMS determines the NSO
     level. The ES documents the rationale used to designate the item NSO. NSO items can be stocked at
     the base levels part of the retail stock level. Since NSO items have demand rates, justification for
     additional quantities can be based on end item distribution. Only recoverable items can be NSO items.
     1.10.3. Initial Spares Support List. An Initial Spares Support List (ISSL) supports new system activa-
     tions. The ISSL identify items that must be available to fill retail stock levels on the POC date.
        1.10.3.1. Retail stock levels support the base order and ship time (O & ST) requirement and the
        base repair cycle requirement. AFM 67-1, Volume I, Part One, Chapter 12, Section A, Basic Air
        Force Suppy Procedures and AFM 67-1, Volume II, Part Two, Chapter 19, Standard Base Supply
        System, provide policy and detailed procedures for ISSLs.
        1.10.3.2. The ES and MAJCOMs select the range of items for the ISSL. Since the D200H com-
        putes retail stock levels, no additional quantities are normally needed to support new activations.
        Instead, the ISSL identifies items that should be stocked at base level. Placement of these items
        involves determination of how to distribute stock rather than determination of an additional quan-
        tity. The system program manager, the IMS, and the major command users decide how retail stock
        should be distributed. The safety level computation in the recoverable item replenishment system
        (D041 Aircraft Availability Model) considers all new activation user SRANs with ISSL authoriza-
        tions to be users with computed demand levels. AFMCM 23-1 provides detailed procedures.
        Exceptions to this policy are items that apply to low density systems, normally Communication &
        Electronic networks. The IMS may input to the D200H an adjusted stock level equal to the num-
        ber of SRAN users if the item meets the following criteria:
            1.10.3.2.1. The item is not stock listed.
            1.10.3.2.2. The item applies to a low density system. A low density system is one that has four
            or fewer end items per SRAN.
            1.10.3.2.3. The item is critical to the system operation; lack of the item means that the system
            would not be available.
     1.10.4. Interim Contractor Support (ICS).
        1.10.4.1. The system program manager determines if a system should be supported through ICS
        until organic maintenance support is available. The contractor provides maintenance support over
        a specified time period, during which the system gradually migrates to organic support.
        1.10.4.2. During the provisioning conference the contractor assigns to each item a transition date
        for organic support. As this transition occurs, the contractor or vendor acquires assets in the
        required configuration to fill support requirements.
        1.10.4.3. The contractor provides recoverable item breakdowns (RIB) for items to be repaired
        under ICS. The item manager will not buy items in the RIB that do not have stable design until
        acquisition lead time before the transition date from ICS to organic support. The item’s POC date
        is the same as the transition date, and the item’s demand development period starts at this point.
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                              11

  1.10.5. Spares Acquisition Integrated With Production (SAIP). The SAIP concept gives price bene-
  fits by releasing spares orders concurrently with the release of the contractor's production orders to the
  vendors. Changes to spare parts requirements must coincide with changes to the end article. Order
  quantities are stable unless a major program change occurs.
  1.10.6. Training Equipment (Mobile Training Sets, Resident Training Equipment, and Support Sim-
  ulators). The IMS, SPM or EAIM should rely upon Aerospace Education and Training Command
  (AETC) guidance and apply factors derived from AETC’s command experience and peculiar usage of
  items used for training. Initial quantities of spares and repair parts that support training equipment are
  determined using programs and assigned factors as follows:
     1.10.6.1. Initial spare and repair parts of items that apply only to training equipment are deter-
     mined according to chapters 2 and 3 of this instruction.
     1.10.6.2. The IMS may develop an increased requirement to support items common to both the
     training equipment and the end item for which training is provided. This quantity supports the
     requirement for training equipment and is determined by considering the stock levels established
     for the end item. The IMS should also consider the training schedule. If the training effort starts
     before end item delivery, procurement should be initiated in time to support the training.
     1.10.6.3. ISSLs that support training equipment will include items peculiar to the training equip-
     ment, the end item for which training is being provided, and items common to other Air Force sys-
     tems. However, the IMS procures only items that may be acquired through initial provisioning.
  1.10.7. Life-of-Type (LOT Items.
     1.10.7.1. DoD 4140.1-R authorizes life-of-type buys when items will not be produced after pro-
     duction of the major end item is completed; therefore, the total issues anticipated during the life of
     the end item are forecasted and procured. In some cases a contractor may choose to phase out pro-
     duction of an end item and it may not be practical estblish capability to produce spare parts. Under
     these circumstances the system program manager may elect to request authority to initiate a life of
     type buy.
     1.10.7.2. LOT item buys are not normally authorized while the end item is in production.
     Approval to buy LOT spares requirements depends on an analysis and evaluation of support
     implications, costs, benefits, and alternatives.
     1.10.7.3. An economic analysis must validate the feasibility of this procedure. The analysis must
     consider the total cost to procure LOT requirements, including the cost of hardware, data and
     administration, and the total cost to retain production tooling and test equipment, production
     start-up costs, and spares costs.
     1.10.7.4. The item is not a candidate for a life-of-type buy under any of the following conditions:
         1.10.7.4.1. The item is subject to design change or technical obsolescence.
         1.10.7.4.2. The item can be acquired through competitive procurement.
         1.10.7.4.3. The item has shelf life restrictions.
         1.10.7.4.4. The item does not have a firm end item program life, including projected use by
         other services or FMS customers.
         1.10.7.4.5. Assets are available from reclamation.
12                                                                  AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

        1.10.7.5. The ALC/FM prepares (for ALC approval) a summary of the evaluation and recommen-
        dations and includes the total costs of each option. This summary becomes part of the item history
        file and serves as an audit trail.
            1.10.7.5.1. If the value of the LOT buy is $1 million or greater, the ALC/FM forwards the
            complete summary indicating ALC approval to HQ AFMC/LGI for evaluation and approval.
            1.10.7.5.2. Life of type buys valued at less than $1 million dollars can be approved in the Sys-
            tem Program Manager or Inventory Management division, with the ALC/FM concurrence at
            division level.
     1.10.8. SPRAM. Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized to Maintenance (SPRAM) items support
     base level maintenance activities. AFM 67-1, Volume I, Part one, Chapter 11, Section AG authorizes
     the use of SPRAM.
        1.10.8.1. The SPM and EAIM equipment specialist, in conjunction with the MAJCOM represen-
        tative, select logical SPRAM items and quantities during the provisioning process.
        1.10.8.2. The provisioning technical documentation (PTD) displays the SPRAM quantity. The
        IMS enters the quantity in the requirements computation as an additive quantity
     1.10.9. Weapons Training Detachments Operating Spares (WTDOS) Program.
        1.10.9.1. The WTDOS program provides spare parts support to units that participate in opera-
        tional training exercises away from their home bases. The system program manager selects items
        and identifies the requirement to the IMS.
        1.10.9.2. The IMS enters the quantity in the requirements computation as an additive quantity, if
        possible. See AFM 67-1, Volume 1, Part One, Chapter 11.
     1.10.10. War Reserve Materiel (WRM).
        1.10.10.1. The EAIM and equipment specialist, and the MAJCOM representative, select WRM
        items and quantities required to support the system or equipment. The IMS may acquire WRM
        assets at the same time peacetime assets are bought. WRM is procured using replenishment funds.
        For further information, refer to AFM 67-1, volume 1, part one, chapter 14.
     1.10.11. Requirements Computation.
        1.10.11.1. Stockage Requirements. Requirements for items that meet the DoD stockage criteria
        are computed according to guidelines provided in this instruction unless HQ AFMC/LGI approves
        an alternative procedure
        1.10.11.2. Rounding Computed Quantities. D200H computes requirements in several segments,
        which include operational, pipeline, and additive segments. It rounds the results of each segment
        to one decimal place, using normal rounding procedures, and adds the results to obtain a total
        requirement. If the total requirement results in a decimal quantity, the system rounds the quantity
        up to the next higher integer.
        1.10.11.3. Application of Asset and Usage Data. The contractor may provide data lists to AFMC
        that detail asset and usage data accumulated during pre-operational phase of system development.
        The equipment specialist determines if the usage data should be used to calculate maintenance
        rates to be used in the requirements computation. The IMS must apply to the computed quantities
        any pre-operational assets that the contractor offers.
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                            13

     1.10.11.4. Program Adjustments. If an item is to be installed in only a portion of the end item
     population, the equipment specialist adjusts the end item program accordingly. Design change
     notices (DCN) are instances when this can occur. The ES should prorate the published program
     based on the proportion of the number of end items which the item applies, to the number of end
     items that the item does not apply. This is the application percent. The on-line item worksheets
     include a free text area to document adjustments to the published program.
     1.10.11.5. Additive Requirements (AR). ARs support special projects or particular, non-recurring
     programs. Justification for ARs is required and should include identification of the program they
     support, including any applicable project codes and nicknames. Normally, ARs should not support
     recurring OIM or depot level maintenance demands. These requirements should be stated through
     demand and maintenance rates. WRM requirements may be identified and acquired as an additive
     requirement and positioned with an end item when the end item is assigned to a major military
     mission.
     1.10.11.6. Material Improvement Programs (MIP) and Engineering Change Proposals (ECP).
     When the service life of a spare or repair part is expected to increase through a component
     improvement program or changes in design or manufacture of the item, the requirements compu-
     tation must anticipate the projected increase in service life.
     1.10.11.7. Changes to Computed Requirements. One feature of the D200H system is the capabil-
     ity to file maintain data elements on line and instantly see the results. The purpose of this feature
     is to minimize manual adjustments to computed buy requirements. Normally, a computed buy
     quantity changes when a computational element, such as demand rate or a logistics pipeline seg-
     ment, has changed. When a change in buy quantity cannot be attributed to a change in a computa-
     tional element within the D200H system, the change must be documented on the requirements
     worksheet and approved by the appropriate level of management according to the value of the
     change.
     1.10.11.8. Interim release of items with long lead times. The contractor may release items with
     long lead times incrementally and concurrently with production of the end item. When the con-
     tractor has interim release authority, the IMS determines item quantities according to this instruc-
     tion using the average month and adjusted month program that corresponds to the six month
     program time base on the programming checklist. This is due to the restriction that limits interim
     release buys to six months. Upon receipt of provisioning documentation, items are recomputed in
     a normal fashion using the program in the PTB that corresponds to the item's review cycle.
     1.10.11.9. Contractor Recommended Quantities. Although the D220 input includes contractor
     recommended buy quantities, the IMS must compute item requirement according to the guidelines
     specified in this instruction. This ensures that the contractor has provided accurate estimates and
     that the necessary data are available to establish of items in the Air Force inventory. The quantity
     computed in the D200H is the quantity bought.

              D200H INITIAL REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION (IRD) SYSTEM

2.1. System Description. The D200H IRD is a subsystem of the AFMC Requirements Data Bank. It is
an automated version of a previously manual computation process. It provides on-line support for man-
agement data retrieval, factors update, and assessment of changes In factor and logistics data. Users may
view and change system data, and generate reports of applicable requirements data.

2.2. System Inputs. IRD receives input from other systems via electronic file transfer in batch mode.
The IRD receives data from the D220 Provisioning Data System, the K004 Past/Projected Programs Sys-
tem, and from user file maintenance.
     2.2.1. Chapter 3 includes a list of elements that each system provides to the IRD. The IRD receives
     file maintenance transactions daily from each of the ALCs. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 indicate which ele-
     ments can be file maintained and under what circumstances.

2.3. System Operation. The IRD system operates centrally at Wright Patterson AFB OH on the
AMDAHL mainframe computer. Users gain access to the system via local area network (LAN) terminals
and generate reports at applicable area printers. The system includes two functions, batch processing and
on-line processing. Batch functions are grouped by frequency and on-line functions are grouped by user
view.
     2.3.1. When IRD receives data it builds a programming check list (see Chapter 3) for the system or
     subsystem. Each or system or subsystem is identified by a Provisioning Contract Control Number
     (PCCN. Each PCL has a unique PCCN. Each item that is a component of the system or subsystem is
     identified with a Provisioning Line Item Sequence Number (PLISN). The system builds a require-
     ments worksheet for each PLISN.

2.4. System Users. Individuals who require on-line access to the D200H complete DISA Form 41 and
submit it to the HQ AFMC OPR. The HQ AFMC OPR approves the system access request and submits
it to the Requirements Data Bank data system administrator. There are eight categories of users in the IRD
system.
     2.4.1. HQ OPR. This is the HQ AFMC system OPR. This user can view all screens and file maintain
     the Standard Data Tables.

                                     PROGRAMMING CHECKLIST

3.1. General. The programming checklist (PCL) is a source document for the program, logistical, and
catalog data to be applied across a range of items. The purpose of the PCL is to support spare part compu-
tations with consistent, current , and accurate data. The Development contractor may use the PCL to sup-
port interim release of items with long lead times. The provisioning function may use the PCL as a guide
in Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability (SMR) coding and othe rrelated logistical functions.

3.2. Source of the PCL. The Requirements Data Bank D200H IRD subsystem is the preferred source of
the PCL. If the RDB is not available or its use is not feasible, the provisioning functiion may develop a
manual PCL on AFMC Form 27.

3.3. Data from Interfaces. The PCL derives data from interfaces with D220 Provisioning system and
K004 Past/Projected Programs system.
     3.3.1. The D220 system provides the following logistical and catalog data system.
        3.3.1.1. Provisioning list item sequence number (PLISN).
        3.3.1.2. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code (formerly FSCM).
        3.3.1.3. Manufacturer’s Part Number.

        3.3.1.6. Quantity Per End Item (QPEI).
        3.3.1.7. Source, Maintainability, Recoverability (SMR) code.
        3.3.1.8. National Stock Number (NSN), with separate fields for the Federal Supply Class (FSC),
        and the National Item Identification Number (NIIN).
        3.3.1.9. Use On code.
        3.3.1.10. Maintenance Factor. This is the Total Organizational Intermediate Demand Rate
        (TOIMDR).
        3.3.1.11. Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC).
        3.3.1.12. Item Management Code (IMC).
        3.3.1.13. Production Lead Time (PLT).
        3.3.1.14. Unit price.
        3.3.1.15. Quantity per Unit Pack (QUP).
        3.3.1.16. Shelf Life code.
        3.3.1.17. Type of Provisioning Technical Document.
        3.3.1.18. Production Lead Time (PLT).

AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                          17

       3.3.1.20. Quantity per Unit Pack (QUP).
       3.3.1.21. Shelf Life code.
       3.3.1.22. Type of Provisioning Technical Document.
       3.3.1.23. Prior Item PLISN.
       3.3.1.24. Next Higher Assembly (NHA) PLISN.
       3.3.1.25. Overhaul Replacement Percent.
       3.3.1.26. Base Condemnation Percent.
       3.3.1.27. Base Not Reparable This Station (NRTS) Percent.
       3.3.1.28. Depot Overhaul Condemnation Percent.
       3.3.1.29. Replaced or Superseded PLISN.
       3.3.1.30. Quantity of assets shipped.
       3.3.1.31. Quantity of assets procured.
   3.3.2. The K004 system passes the following elements on the last day of each calendar quarter on file
   D200.PA:
       3.3.2.1. Application Program Designator (APD).
       3.3.2.2. Program Type.
       3.3.2.3. Service Code.
       3.3.2.4. Projected program quantity by quarter (36 occurrences).
       3.3.2.5. Past program quantity by month (up to 36 occurrences).

3.4. Types of PCLs. The D200H displays active programming checklists in the on-line system and pro-
duces hard copy PCLs at the user’s request. D200H includes two types of PCLs, the standard PCL and
the Line Replaceable Unit/Shop Replacement Unit (LRU/SRU) PCL.
   3.4.1. Standard PCL. Develops application program data for aircraft, engines, airborne, electronics,
   armament, support and vehicular equipment, missiles, drones, and communications equipment.
   3.4.2. LRU/SRU PCL. Develops application program data for items that normally replaced as a sin-
   gle unit. These items have distinctive stock number for which spares are authorized to support
   replacements. As such, computed programs from the related applications are used to develop com-
   puted programs in the LRU/SRU PCL.
   3.4.3. Program Time Base (PTB). The IRD system projects accumulated program data and require-
   ments across sixteen program time bases. Each PTB is assigned a number from 3 to 48 divisible by
   three (i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12 . . . 48). Thus, each PTB represents a quarter of accumulated data.
   3.4.4. Program Development. For purpose of initial requirements determination, the IRD system
   applies an Adjusted Month Program (ADMP). The IRD system performs the following steps to com-
   pute the ADMP.
18                                                                  AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

        3.4.4.1. Compute the adjusted month schedule for each quarter. This is the quarterly program
        (operating, inventory, or overhaul) that passed from the D220 system divided by three. Any
        remainder is distributed in the first and second months.
        3.4.4.2. Compute the average month schedule. This is the average monthly inventory through the
        48 months (16 quarters) of the (PTB). In the first month it is the adjusted month schedule com-
        puted in the preceding paragraph divided by 2. In the 2nd through 48th months, it is the adjusted
        month schedule, plus the adjusted month schedule from the preceding month, divided by two.
        3.4.4.3. Average Month Program. The average month program is the average month schedule
        from the preceding paragraph accumulated through the program time base (PTB), divided by the
        number of months in the PTB.

3.5. PCL Elements. The following explains each PCL element in the sequence it appears on the five
on-line screen pages. The abbreviated element appears in parentheses as it is displayed on the screen. The
D200H User’s Manual indicates which elements may be file maintained by certain users.
     3.5.1. Page 1 Elements.

     “Y” in this field to update the system after changing other data on the screen.
  3.5.2. Page 2 Elements.
     3.5.2.1. Program (Program). This field includes separate columns for fiscal year (FY) and pro-
     gram units (QTY). Each column has five lines.
     3.5.2.2. Operational And Maintenance Locations. The following fields each include separate col-
     umns to indicate continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OS) locations.
         3.5.2.2.1. Number of Operational Bases (Number of Bases). The number of bases that will
         field the system.
         3.5.2.2.2. Number of Aerospace Educational and Training Command (AETC) Bases (Num-
         ber of ATC Bases). The number of AETC bases that will be users of the system for training
         purposes.
         3.5.2.2.3. Organic Depot Maintenance Facilities (SOR Facilities: Depot). The number of
         depot level overhaul facilities that will service the end item.
         3.5.2.2.4. Organizational and Industrial facilities (O&I). Because of Air Force maintenance
         practices, this field is normally blank.
         3.5.2.2.5. Contract Repair Facilities (CONTR). The number of contractor facilities that will
         overhaul the end item.
         3.5.2.2.6. Order and Ship Time (O&ST) Days For Consumable Items (EOQ O&ST Days).
         This is the calculated order and ship time value for consumable items. It is based on the data in
20                                                                 AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

            the NUMBER OF BASES field above and the O&ST value on the standard data table. The
            value in this field applies to the calculation of levels for consumable items (see Chapter 4).
        3.5.2.3. Reference Documents (Applicable Contractual Acquisition Documents). This section
        notes relevant program documents, and their amendments, that provided data to prepare the PCL.
     3.5.3. Page 3 Elements. Each element on this page appear as a projection through eighteen Program
     Time Bases (PTB).
        3.5.3.1. Operational Need Date. This is the OPERATIONAL NEED DATE on Page 1.
        3.5.3.2. Program Projections. Each of the following elements displays 16 values, one in each
        quarterly projection across two lines. Each value corresponds to the Program Time Base (PTB)
        displayed across the top of the page. The number assigned to each PTB is the number of months
        after the operational need date that the particular PTB ends. Each PTB number is divisible by
        three. Thus, PTB 3 ends three months after the operational need date and represents the first quar-
        ter’s data; PTB 6 ends six months after operational need date and represents the first and second
        quarters’ data, etc. The K004 system is the source of program data, but the user may file maintain
        any of the data. However, the IRD overrides any file maintained values with data from subsequent
        interfaces.
            3.5.3.2.1. Operating Program (Operating Program). This is normally the flying hour program
            for aircraft applications through each program time base. The values are expressed in hun-
            dreds. For example, an entry of 912 represents 91,200 flying hours.
            3.5.3.2.2. Inventory Installation Program (Inventory Program). This is the number of end
            items to be deployed through each program time base.
            3.5.3.2.3. Engine Overhaul/Programmed Depot Maintenance Program (EOH/PDM Program).
            This is the projection of scheduled engine or aircraft overhauls through each PTB.
     3.5.4. Page 4 Elements. Each of the following elements also displays separate values through sixteen
     program time base periods:
        3.5.4.1. Average Month Operating Program (Average Month Operating Program). This is the
        projected operating (flying hour) program within each month of the program time base.
        3.5.4.2. Adjusted Month Operating Program (Adjusted Month Operating Program). This is the
        adjusted monthly operating (flying hour) program within each month of the program time base.
        3.5.4.3. Average Month Inventory Program (Average Month Inventory Program). This is the pro-
        jected inventory program within each month of the program time base.
        3.5.4.4. Adjusted Month Inventory Program (Adjusted Month Inventory Program). This is the
        adjusted monthly inventory (flying hour) program within each month of the program time base.
        3.5.4.5. Average Month Engine Overhaul/Programmed Depot Maintenance Program (Average

3.6. Other PCL Screens. Each of the following screens allows users to view data included in the PCL
and for authorized users to change or add data:
   3.6.1. Develop Program Screen. Authorized SPM users may create or modify inventory or operating
   program data on the Develop Program Screen. Though the RDB transmits most program data during
   the quarterly processing cycle, the data occasionally may not be available. This screen allows the user
   to enter known PCL schedules, deliveries, command support schedules, projected end item attrition,
   utilization rates, and overhaul schedules. The system subtracts the command support and projected
   attrition from the delivery schedule to compute the inventory program, and multiplies the inventory
   program by the utilization rates to compute the operating program. The inventory program must be a
   positive value.
   3.6.2. PCL History Screen. This screen is available to all users and displays a history of actions that
   resulted from changes to the PCL. The system automatically generates data on this screen when it
   identifies changes that affect the PCL computation. This includes three types of data: modifications,
   deletions, and changes to originator data.
   3.6.3. Change PCL Originator Screen. This screen allows the SPM user to change the identification
   of the PCL originator.
   3.6.4. ISSL Assignment Screen. This screen allows authorized users (SPM, EAIM, or ALC OPR) to
   enter Initial Spares Support List (ISSL) authorizations. The screen identifies each base with a number,
   up to 112, based on the number of bases that appears on Page 1 of the PCL. The user enters the autho-
   rized ISSL quantity for each base. IRD uses the ISSL quantities to determine the item adjusted stock
   levels. Only the SPM, End Article Item Manager, and ALC OPR can file maintain this screen. All
   uses can view this screen.
   3.6.5. PCL/PCCN Cross Reference Screen. This screen allows authorized users (SPM, EAIM, Provi-
   sioning Specialist, ALC OPR) to change relationships between an application program designator
   (APD) and a PCCN. All users can view this screen and see the PCCNs that apply to an APD.
   3.6.6. PCL Modification Notice Screen. This screen displays all Program Checklists that have been
   modified and recomputed during the previous six months, and where the program manager recom-
   mended that associated items also be recomputed. All users can view this screen.
   3.6.7. PCCN/PLISN to IMS Assignment Screen. This screen allows authorized users (ALC OPR,
   IMS Supervisor, IMS, EAIM) to assign an item manager code to all PLISNs that apply to a PCCN. All
   users can view this screen.
   3.6.8. PCL/PCCN Summary Information Screen. This screen allows all users to view the buy value
   of all items within a PCL, given specific selection criteria. Users can select the data by choosing any
   of the following elements or combinations of elements:
       3.6.8.1. PCCN, PCCN/ERRC Code, PCCN/Item Management Code, or PCCN/ERRC Code/Item
       Management Code.
       3.6.8.2. IIN.
       3.6.8.3. PCL/APD.
   3.6.9. PCL Deletion Notice Screen. This screen allows authorized users (SPM, EAIM, ALC OPR) to
   delete or save from deletion any PCL that is eligible for deletion from the data base. All users can
   view this screen. A PCL is eligible for deletion under the following conditions:
22                                                               AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

                                               Chapter 4
 INITIAL REQUIREMENTS COMPUTATION FOR CONSUMABLE ITEMS (ERRC XF3 OR
                                XB3)

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides policy and instructions for computing Air Force initial requirements
for consumable (ERRC XF3 and XB3) items. These items are also known as “EOQ” or “expense” items.
It applies to all ALC IMSs who determine initial requirements.

4.2. Consumable Items. Consumable items are components that are not repaired or condemned higher
than the base level after removal from an end item.

4.3. Policy.
   4.3.1. The ES provides the necessary rates and factors for initial computation of all consumable items
   within a weapon system that have been identified as logical spares to support that system.
   4.3.2. Net requirements for new items not previously acquired include levels to support the wholesale
   stock objective (procurement cycle plus acquisition lead time) and the retail stock objective (base
   order and ship time plus base repair cycle).
       4.3.2.1. Chapter 1, paragraph 1.6.1.7 defines acquisition lead time.
       4.3.2.2. Base Order and Ship time is the time required for a retail (base level) customer to place
       an order for an asset and to receive that asset from the wholesale source (depot supply).
       4.3.2.3. Base Repair Cycle time is the time required to induct an unserviceable asset into a base
       repair facility and restore it to a serviceable condition. Only ERRC XF3 items are repaired at the
       base.
   4.3.3. The IMS and ES validate ISSL requirements for stock listed items and process them according
   to the current policy for replenishment consumable items.
   4.3.4. The IMS submits requirements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and other service-man-
   aged items on a supply support request (SSR) through the D169 system.
   4.3.5. System program managers (SPM) and IMSs use the D200H system to compute requirements
   for each item unless the D200H is not available or, in the SPM’s judgment, use of the IRD not feasible
   when only a small number of items are involved. If the SPM chooses not to use the D200H, an
   approved alternative automated computation or the manual methodology (AFMC Form 997) may be
   used. The HQ AFMC OPR approves any automated computation, which must provide a record of the
   computation. The manual worksheet or alternate computation record must be kept in the item folder
   for 3 years.
   4.3.6. The wholesale stock requirement supports the program forecast period (lead time plus 3
   months), which will be at least 12 months.

4.4. Computation Methodology. The following paragraphs explain each element that appears on the
RDB on-line screens andhow the D200H derives or computes each data element.
   4.4.1. Header Information. The following elements appear at the top of each of the 11 screens that
   make up the on-line requriements computation worksheet.
26                                                                  AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

        4.4.1.1. Date. The IRD screens include three dates. Date are not file maintainable.
            4.4.1.1.1. The date and time the user calls up the screen or requests the product appears in the
            upper right of the screen or product.
            4.4.1.1.2. The creation date is the date the programming checklist was established.
            4.4.1.1.3. The revision date is the date the programming check list was last revised.
     4.4.2. Provisioning Contract Control Number (PCCN). The D220 system passes this element, which
     identifies the specific system or sub-system.
     4.4.3. Provisioning List Item Sequence Number (PLISN). The item’s unique identifier within a
     PCCN.
     4.4.4. Item Data. The following elements include the information necessary to establish an item
     record in D200H. They appear in Section 1 on the D200H screens and products.
        4.4.4.1. Non-Catalogued National Stock Number (NC/NSN). Provided by the D220 system. This
        is a temporary NSN, identifiable with “NC” in the first two positions of the NIIN, that identifies
        the item until the Federal Logistics Information System assigns a permanent NSN.
        4.4.4.2. Part Number. The manufacturer's part number from the D220 system.
        4.4.4.3. Noun. The item name from the D220 system.
        4.4.4.4. Unit Price. The unit price recommended by the contractor or developed under current
        pricing policy. Provided by the D220 system.
        4.4.4.5. Unit of Issue. The unit of issue (“EA (each)” in the majority of cases) from the D220 sys-
        tem.
        4.4.4.6. QUP. The quantity unit pack (QUP) (1 in the majority of cases) from the D220 system.
        4.4.4.7. Base Data. The input data for the retail stock requirements computation. There is no entry
        in this segment for items coded for depot use only ("D" in the third position of the SMR code).
        This element includes the order and ship time and base repair cycle.
            4.4.4.7.1. Base Order and Ship Time (O & ST). See 4.3.2.2 above
            4.4.4.7.2. Base Repair. See 4.3.2.3 above.
        4.4.4.8. Type Provisioning Technical Documentation (TYPE PTD). The D220 system passes this
        single position code that identifies the type of PTD submitted by the contractor during the provi-
        sioning process. Valid values are I, R, C, F, T, P, G, B, D, X, L, E, and H. This element is not file
        maintainable.
        4.4.4.9. Type of Change Code (TYPE CHG CD). The D220 system passes this single position
        code that is present when the Type PTD code is D (design change notice or notice of change
        action). Valid values are D, L, A, Q, M and T. This element is not file maintainable.
        4.4.4.10. Program Calculation Type (PRGM CALC TYP). The D220 system passes this single
        position code that indicates the type of activity that form the basis for requirements computation.
        Valid values are I (inventory) or O (operating).
        4.4.4.11. ERRC. This is N for XB3 items (not repaired, removed or replaced at any level of main-
        tenance), or P for XF3 items (repaired and condemned at the base maintenance facility).
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                           27

     4.4.4.12. High Hold. This is an item with a high holding cost. The item manager enters “X” if the
     item is subject to obsolescence or requires special storage.
     4.4.4.13. ISSL. The item manager enters “X” if the item is on an approved Initial Spares Support
     List.
     4.4.4.14. Non-AF Item. The item manager enters “X” if another DoD component is the item’s pri-
     mary inventory control agency (PICA).
     4.4.4.15. Item Contingency. The D220 system passes this element. The only valid value is “I,”

                                                 Chapter 5
 INITIAL REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION FOR RECOVERABLE ITEMS (ERRC XD2
                              OR XD3)

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides policy and instructions for computing Air Force initial requirements
for recoverable (ERRC XD1 and XD2) items. These items are also known as “reparable” or “investment”
items. It applies to all ALC IMSs who determine initial requirements.

5.2. Recoverable Items. Recoverable items are components that are removed from and end item,
repaired, and returned to the supply system for re-issue. Base and depot maintenance facilities may per-
form repair, but condemnation authority is normally at the depot level.

5.3. Policy.
     5.3.1. Logical Spares. The ES provides the necessary rates and factors for initial computation of all
     consumable items within a weapon system that have been identified as logical spares to support that
     system.
     5.3.2. Net Requirements. Net requirements for new items not previously acquired include levels to
     support the wholesale stock objective (procurement cycle plus acquisition lead time) and the retail
     stock objective (base order and ship time plus base repair cycle).
        5.3.2.1. Lead Time. Chapter 1, paragraph 1.6.1.7 defines acquisition lead time.
        5.3.2.2. Base Order and Ship Time. Is the time required for a retail (base level) customer to place
        an order for an asset and to receive that asset from the wholesale source (depot supply). Base
        O&ST days enter the system via the standard data tables or through user file maintenance.
        5.3.2.3. Base Repair Cycle Time. Is the time required to induct an unserviceable asset into a base
        repair facility and restore it to a serviceable condition. Base repair cycle days enter the system via
        the standard data tables or through user file maintenance.
     5.3.3. Validation. The IMS and ES validate ISSL requirements for stock listed items and process
     them according to the current policy for replenishment consumable items.
     5.3.4. Submitting Requirements. The IMS submits requirements for Defense Logistics Agency
     (DLA) and other service-managed items on a supply support request (SSR) through the D169 system.
     5.3.5. SPM and IMSs. System program managers (SPM) and IMSs use the D200H system to com-
     pute requirements for each item unless the D200H is not available or, in the SPM’s judgment, use of
     the IRD is not feasible when only a small number of items are involved. If the SPM chooses not to use
     the D200H, an approved alternative automated computation or the manual methodology (AFMC
     Form 614) may be used. The HQ AFMC OPR approves any automated computation, which must pro-
     vide a record of the computation. The manual worksheet or alternate computation record must be kept
     in the item folder for 3 years.
     5.3.6. Stock Requirement. The wholesale stock requirement supports the program forecast period
     (lead time plus 3 months), which will be at least 12 months.

Terms
Acquisition Advice Codes—These codes indicate how (as distinguished from "where") and under what
restriction an item is acquired. For currently authorized codes see the Federal Manual for Supply,
Cataloging MI-7.
Common Item—An item that supports several systems, subsystems, or primary items.
Consumption Items—Items which are consumed in use or which lose their identity through
incorporation in, or attachment to, another assembly. These are also known as “secondary” items and are
further classified as consumable items or recoverable items.
Demand or Demands—Supply actions, including issues, repairable generations, retail requisitions, or
any other action that levies a requirement on the wholesale supply system to issue a serviceable asset to a
customer.
Demand Development Period (DDP)—The period of time extending from the preliminary operational
capability date to a point in time when requirements forecasts are entirely based on actual demands or
other empirical data that indicate the need for spare and repair parts.
End Article/Item—The end article or item to be delivered under the contract, including (but not limited
to) aircraft, missiles, or support equipment.
Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability, Category (ERRC) Code—Either a single digit or three
digit supply code used to classify Air Force items of supply into various categories for management
purposes. Initially assigned ERRC codes are derived directly from the maintenance repair level codes
authorized for use by source codes in TO-00-195.
Consumable Items—Expendable, non-recoverable repair parts with ERRC designator XB and
expendable repair parts that have minor reparability with ERRC designator XF. Also known as Expense
Items.
Floating Stock Level—The stock level required by the Directorate of Maintenance (D/MA) to support
the job routed overhaul repair or contractor to keep a production line moving. When the repair time of a
component exceeds the repair time of an end item, the D/MA is authorized to maintain a floating stock
level. This level must be of sufficient serviceable components to allow minimum repair flow time of the
primary end item as negotiated with the item manager. For contractor repair of another recoverable
assembly, the government must furnish a minimum quantity of serviceable assets to provide immediate
replacements while the removed item is being repaired.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC)—The first attainment of the capability to employ effectively a
weapon, item of equipment, or system of approved specific characteristics and that is manned or operated
by an adequately trained, equipped, and supported military unit or force.
Initial Provisioning—The process of determining the range of quantity of items required to support and
maintain an end item or article of materiel for an initial period of operation. The phases include
identifying item of supply, establishing data needed to prepare catalogs, technical manuals and tables of

allowances; and preparing instructions that ensure delivery of necessary support items with related end
articles.
Initial Spares Support List (ISSL)—A list of spares and repair parts and quantities required for
organizational and field maintenance initial support of an end item for a given period of time. Quantities
established for ISSLs must be equal to the initial base stockage objective.
Initial Support Period—The initial period of operation during which spare and repair parts are procured
for an end item.
Inventory Control Point (ICP)—An organizational unit or activity within a Department of Defense
supply system that is assigned the primary responsibility for the materiel management of a group of items
either for a particular Military Service or for the Department of Defense as a whole. Materiel inventory
management includes cataloging direction, requirements computation, procurement direction,
distribution management, disposal direction, and generally, rebuild direction.
Insurance Items—Items that are not subject to periodic replacement or wear-out. Replacements
resulting from accidents or other unpredictable occurrences, are required so infrequently that only limited
quantities are acquired and held at a central point.
Item Support Period—See program forecast period.
Mission Design & Series (MDS)-(Aircraft, Missile, or End Item)—S t a n d a r d            nomenclature
designations for aircraft, missiles, and end items to indicate the prime intended function, the sequence
number of each design and the series letter indicating significant changes to the logistic support.
Numeric Stockage Objective Item (NSO)—A non-demand based, stocked, essential item that has a
predicted failure rate, but the probability of demand is so low that it does not meet the stockage criteria,
and as a demand based item would not be stocked. Since the lack of a replacement item would seriously
hamper the operational capability of a weapon or weapon system, the item is stocked, but as a
non-demand based item.
Overhaul Stock Level—This stock level represents the amount of stock required to replace
condemnations of job-routed items projected to accrue during the planned overhaul program. The
number of support days required is based upon the time required to receive a serviceable replacement in
the technological repair center from the time requested. This will not exceed 14 days for XD2 items, or 5
days for XD1 items.
Peculiar Item—Items of supply that apply to only weapon system or end item.
Preliminary Operational Capability (POC)—The attainment of the capability for equipment or
systems to be used by operational units and to function in a manner that is preliminary to, but in support
of, the achievement of an initial operational capability (IOC).
Procurement Cycle (PC)—The length of time between procurement actions. In terms of quantities, the
requirement that represents the forecast demands between procurement actions.
Procurement Lead Time (PCLT)—The sum of administrative lead time (ALT) and production lead
time (PLT) as defined in DoD Instruction 4140.24.
Program Forecast Period (PFP)—Represents the number of months to be used in the development of
initial budget, apportionment, and item requirements for spare and repair parts. The PFP is equal to the
PCLT plus 3 months following the date of the preliminary operational capability.
50                                                                 AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

Program Time Base (PTB)—A selected portion of the operational program beginning with the date of
the preliminary operational capability and extending to the next procurement cycle or program forecast
period, as appropriate, developed for the purpose of computing all requirements program data.
Programming Checklist (PCL)—A document that contains all programming data necessary to compute
initial spares requirements. The programming checklist can be in hard copy form (AFMC Form 27) or
on-line in the D200H Initial Requirements Determination (IRD) subsystem of the Requirements Data
Bank.
Provisioning—The management process of determining and acquiring the range and quantity of support
items necessary to operate and maintain an end item of materiel for an initial period of service.
Provisioning Lists—Lists of data developed and used for provisioning purposes.
Additive Requirement—A requirement not normally expressed through historical demand rates or
program projections. Additive requirements support activity outside of normal peacetime operations.
Examples are support for special projects, modification programs, initial installations, and forward supply
levels. Also known as quantitative requirements.
Recoverable Items—Items of a durable nature that are normally subject to periodic replacement through
fair wear and tear, and when unserviceable, can be economically repaired by either a field or depot
maintenance activity. Also known as reparable items.
Repair Cycle—All the stages through which an unserviceable reparable type item passes from the time
of its removal from the end item until its restoration to a serviceable condition and return to the supply
system.
Repair Parts—Consumable “bits and pieces”; i.e., individual parts or consumable assemblies required to
repair components of major end items.
Replacement Items—Primary items that are not consumed in use and retain their original identity
during use. These items have an ERRC designation of ND2 or NF2. They are issued on the basis of
approved allowance documents, with the receiving using unit or activity maintaining accountability. Also
known as Equipment Items.
Retail Level—In the Air Force supply system, the level of supply that issues an item directly to the
customer.
Review Cycle (RC)—The time between the mandatory review of item requirements.
Safety Level—The quantity of materiel required to be on hand to permit continued operation in the event
of interruptions of normal replenishment or unpredictable fluctuation in issue demands.

Serialized Control & Reporting System (SCARS)—A technique applied to high unit cost recoverable
items that provides the item manager (IM) with responsive access to the precise location, condition and
installed item status of all assets.
Spare Parts—Repairable components or assemblies used for maintenance replacement purposes in
major end items or equipment.
SPM or EAIM ALC—An ALC that has system program management or item management
responsibility for the weapon system or end article procured on contract.

                                    REQUIREMENTS FORMULAS

A2.1. The D200H Initial Requirements Determination (IRD) system uses the following formulas to com-
pute each requirements segment for initial spares. These formulas are part of the approved methodology
for computing Air Force initial spares requirements and should be used when computing requirements
outside of the IRD. The ALC OPR may approve deviations from these formulas after reviewing justifying
documentation.

A2.2. Programming Checklist Elements.
     A2.2.1. Adjusted Month Schedule.
     A2.2.2. The adjusted month schedule is used to develop the average and adjusted month inventory,
     operating (flying hour), and overhaul program for the programming checklist (PCL) computations.
     Overhaul programs are depot level maintenance (DLM) programs, and include program depot main-
     tenance (PDM), engine overhaul (EOH), and Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) pro-
     grams.
        A2.2.2.1. For any quarter the adjusted month schedule is the quarterly program divided by three:
                  ADJ MO SCHED = QTLY PROG/3.
        A2.2.2.2. Any remainder is evenly distributed between the first and second months of the quarter.
        If the remainder is 2, one additional unit of program is added to the first and second months; if the
        remainder is 1, one additional unit of program is added to the first month only.
     A2.2.3. Average Month Schedule.
        A2.2.3.1. The average month schedule is the current adjusted monthly schedule plus the previous
        adjusted monthly schedule, divided by two.
            A2.2.3.1.1. For the first month:
                       AVG MO SCHED = ADJ MO SCHED/2.
            A2.2.3.1.2. For subsequent months:
        AVG MO SCHED = (ADJ MO SCHED (current month) + ADJ MO SCHED (previous month))/2.

A2.3. Item Requirements .
     A2.3.1. OIM Annual Demands.
        A2.3.1.1. This is the number of annual demands expected to be placed on organizational and
        intermediate maintenance (i.e., base level) maintenance activities. The first step is to determine
        the program time base (PTB) that contains the Adjusted Month Program (1a above) that will apply
        to the OIM demand projection. Each PTB is numbered in threes from 3 to 48 (3, 6, 9, . . . 48). To
        select the appropriate PFP, add the number of months in the administrative and production lead
        times, plus the number of months in the procurement cycle (3), plus 1 one month.
         PFP = ALT MO + PLT MO + PROC CYC MO (3) + 1.
AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997                                                                            53

     A2.3.1.2. If there is a remainder, the result is rounded up to a multiple of three. For example, if
     the result is 16, the selected PFP is 18. If the result is less than 12, or if the item is managed by
     another service, the PFP is 12.
     A2.3.1.3. The projected annual demands equals the total OIM demand rate, times the application
     percent, times the quantity per end item, times the accumulated operating program (flying hours or
     inventory) at the selected PFP.
    OIM ANN DEM = TOIMDR X APPL PCT X (OIM PROG at PFP).
  A2.3.2. OIM Pipeline Requirements.
     A2.3.2.1. OIM Procurement Cycle. The 3- month procurement cycle requirement within each
     program time base (PTB) is the number of months in the procurement cycle (3) times the average
     month program in the PTB , times the quantity per end item, times the item application percent,
     times the TOIMDR, times product of the base NRTS percent times the depot overhaul condemna-
     tion percent, plus the remainder of the 1 minus the base NRTS percent multiplied by the base con-
     demnation percent.
     OIM PROC CYC = 3 X AVG MO PROG (PTB n) X QPEI X ITM APPL PCT X TOIMDR X
     ((BASE NRTS PCT X DEP OVHL CONDMN PCT) + ((1 - BASE NRTS PCT) X BASE
     CONDMN PCT)).
     A2.3.2.2. OIM Lead Time. This requirement covers demands expected to occur during the item’s
     acquisition lead time and is computed within each program time base. It is the number of months
     in the administrative lead time and the production lead time, plus one additional month, times the
     average month program in the PTB , times the quantity per end item, times the item application
     percent, times the TOIMDR, times the product of the base NRTS percent times the depot overhaul
     condemnation percent, plus the remainder of the 1 minus the base NRTS percent multiplied by the
     base condemnation percent.
     OIM LT = (ALT MO + PLT MO + 1) X AVG MO PROG (PTB n) X QPEI X ITM APPL PCT X
     TOIMDR X ((BASE NRTS PCT X DEP OVHL CONDMN PCT) + ((1 - BASE NRTS PCT) X
     BASE CONDMN PCT)).
     A2.3.2.3. Base Order and Ship Time. This determines the number of assets required to support
     demands expected to occur during the base order and ship time (O & ST). It is the number of days
     in the O & ST divided by 30, times the adjusted month program at the item’s PFP, times the quan-
     tity per end item, times the item application percent, the total OIM demand rate, times the base
     NRTS percent plus the remainder of the 1 minus the base NRTS percent multiplied by the base
     condemnation percent.
     BASE O&ST = (BASE O&ST DA/30) X AVG MO PROG (PTB n) X QPEI X ITM APPL PCT
     X TOIMDR X (BASE NRTS PCT + (1 - BASE NRTS PCT) X BASE CONDMN PCT).
     A2.3.2.4. Base Repair Cycle. This determines the number of assets required to support demands
     expected to occur during the base repair cycle (BRC) time. It is the number of days in the BRC
     divided by 30, times the adjusted month program at the item’s PFP, times the quantity per end
     item, times the item application percent, times the total OIM demand rate, times the base NRTS
     percent plus the remainder of the 1 minus the base NRTS percent multiplied by the base condem-
     nation percent.
54                                                                AFMCI23-106 3 FEBRUARY 1997

        BRC = (BRC DA/30) X AVG MO PROG (PTB n) X QPEI X ITM APPL PCT X TOIMDR X
        (BASE NRTS PCT + (1 - BASE NRTS PCT) X BASE CONDMN PCT).
        A2.3.2.5. Depot Repair Cycle. This determines the number of assets required to support demands
        expected to occur during the depot repair cycle (DRC) time. It is the number of days in the DRC
        divided by 30, times the adjusted month program at the item’s PFP, times the quantity per end
        item, times the item application percent, times the total OIM demand rate, times the base NRTS
        percent.
        DRC = (DRC DA/30) X AVG MO PROG (PTB n) X QPEI X ITM APPL PCT X TOIMDR X
        BASE NRTS PCT.
        A2.3.2.6. Base Stock Level. The base stock level is the sum of the base order and ship time
        requirement and the base repair cycle requirement.
        BASE SL= BASE O&ST + BRC.
     A2.3.3. DLM Annual Demands.
        A2.3.3.1. The DLM annual demands are a projection of expected requirements to support depot
        level maintenance (DLM) programs that are associated with the overhaul of aircraft, engines,
        equipment, or recoverable secondary items. The programming checklist includes separate pro-
        grammed depot maintenance (PDM) programs for aircraft, engine overhaul (EOH) programs, and
        Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) programs for equipment and recoverable sec-
        ondary items. The demand projection includes separate forecasts for job routed and non-job routed
        requirements.
        A2.3.3.2. The DLM demand projection for items with job routed programs equals the total DLM
        program minus the item non-job routed program, times the job routed condemnation percent:
        JR ANN DMD = (TOT DLM PROG - NJR ITEM PROG) X JR CONDM PCT.
        A2.3.3.3. The DLM demand projection for items with non-job routed programs equals the total
        DLM program times the item non-job routed program percent, times the non-job routed replace-
        ment percent:
        NJR ANN DMD = (TOT DLM PROG X NJR PROG PCT) X NJR REPL PCT.
        A2.3.3.4. Each of the above formulas should be applied separately for each type of DLM program
        (PDM, EOH, or MISTR). The results are added to derive the total DLM annual demand projec-
        tion.
     A2.3.4. DLM Item Requirements.
        A2.3.4.1. MISTR Program.
           A2.3.4.1.1. The first step in computing depot level maintenance (DLM) item requirements is
           a determination of the average month Management Item of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR)
           program. This is the sum of projected DLM reparable generations and OIM reparable genera-
           tions within any PTB.
           A2.3.4.1.2. Within any PTB, the projected DLM reparable generations are the average month
           MISTR program for the next higher reparable assembly (NHRA) in the PTB, identified on the
           programming checklist provisioning list item sequence number (PLISN) for the NHRA, times
           the quantity per NHRA, times the MISTR non-job routed program percent, times the MISTR

        non-job routed replacement percent, times the item application percent in the PTB, plus the
        product of the average month PDM and EOH programs times the quantity per end item, times
        the EOH or PDM non-job routed program percent, time the EOH or PDM non-job routed
        replacement percent, times the item application percent in the PTB.

        X ITM APPL PCT (PTB n)).
        A2.3.4.1.3. The OIM reparable generations are the average month OIM (flying hours or
        inventory) program in the PTB, times the quantity per end item, times the total OIM demand
        rate, times the base not repairable at this station percent, times the item application percent in
        the PTB.

        steps. Step 1 is computation of the MISTR job routed and non-job routed procurement cycles
        in each PTB.
        A2.3.4.2.2. The MISTR job routed procurement cycle equals the job routed condemnations
        times the remainder of 1 minus the MISTR non-job routed program percent, times the average
