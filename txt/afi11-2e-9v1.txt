       1.2.2.5. Report end-of-cycle (01 Oct – 30 Sep) training deficiencies/shortfalls through
       channels to HQ ACC/A3TO. Review training programs annually.
       1.2.2.6. Monitor individual currencies and requirements for assigned and attached
       aircrew.
       1.2.2.7. Ensure aircrews only participate in sorties, events, and tasks for which they are
       adequately prepared, trained, and current.
   1.2.3. Aircrews. Individual aircrews will:
       1.2.3.1. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
       guidelines of this volume.
       1.2.3.2. Ensure they are neither scheduled for, nor participate in, flying activities for
       which they are not qualified and current.
1.3. Processing Changes:
   1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to HQ ACC/A3TV on AF Form
   847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
   1.3.2. HQ ACC/A3TO will process recommendation for change.
   1.3.3. Time sensitive changes will be addressed IAW AFI 33-360 guidance.
1.4. Phases of Training:
   1.4.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT provides the training necessary to initially
   qualify pilots in a basic position and flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon
 6                                                                 AFI11-2E-9V1 10 JULY 2012


     completion of IQT, the pilots attain Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. See Chapter
     2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.4.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT provides the training necessary to
     initially qualify or requalify pilots in a specific position and flying duties to perform the
     missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT.
     See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements.
     1.4.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of currency and proficiency. It provides the minimum recurring
     ground and flight training requirements. See Chapter 5 for CT program requirements.
     1.4.4. Specialized Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
     missions, but is not required of every crewmember. Examples of specialized training
     include, but are not limited to First Pilot Program, aircraft commander upgrade, instructor
     pilot upgrade (IPUG), and flight surgeon/non-rated aircrew. Individuals designated by the
     unit commander will accomplish squadron developed training programs to gain qualification
     or certification in specialized areas. See Chapter 6 for specialized training program
     requirements.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
     1.5.1. CT for the E-9 does not utilize the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) and will be
     conducted IAW Chapter 5 of this instruction. Training programs will be designed to
     achieve the highest degree of proficiency consistent with flight safety and resource
     availability. Training must consider aircrew capabilities and safety.
     1.5.2. Training missions will be designed to achieve proficiency in unit-tasked roles and
     enhance mission accomplishment and safety.
     1.5.3. Aircrew proficiency and competence varies and must be closely monitored at the unit
     level to ensure progression. Unit commanders must ensure that training programs consider
     local conditions and individual capabilities to maximize training continuity.
     1.5.4. For ACC units, the aircrew training cycle is 12 months (1 October through 30
     September). Units will complete training requirements during the training cycle except
     where specifically exempted.
1.6. Training Records and Reports:
     1.6.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW AFI
     11-401; and appropriate MAJCOM directives. Also, units will document and maintain
     aircrew certification/upgrade training in individual training folders IAW AFI 11-202V2,
     Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
     1.6.2. The following information will be tracked for all aircrews (as applicable):
        1.6.2.1. Ground training.
        1.6.2.2. Individual sortie requirements and accomplishments. Event requirements and
        accomplishments will be tracked by cumulative total completed and remaining for the
        training cycle.
        1.6.2.3. Currencies.
AFI11-2E-9V1 10 JULY 2012                                                                      7


1.7. Aircrew Utilization Policy:
   1.7.1. Commanders will ensure that aircrews (API-1/6s) fill authorized positions IAW unit
   manning documents and that crew status is properly designated. The overall objective is that
   aircrews perform flying related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrews to valid, short-term
   tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board member, etc.) but must continually weigh the factors
   involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.7.2. No additional duties will be assigned during IQT/MQT training.
1.8. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.8.1. Inexperienced aircrews will receive sortie allocation priority over experienced
   aircrews. Attached personnel for flying will receive minimum required sorties to maintain
   currency requirements.
   1.8.2. MAJCOMs will allocate sorties based upon the following requirements: Training to
   meet assigned projects, programs, and taskings; initial and mission qualification training;
   instructor upgrades; and basic mission capable (BMC) training that cannot be accomplished
   on primary missions.
1.9. Waiver Authority With MAJCOM/A3 approval, waiver authority for all requirements
of the RAP tasking memo is the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group Commander
(WEG/CC). Additional guidance may be provided in the memo. Unless specifically noted
otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval, the WEG/CC may
adjust individual requirements in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 on a case-by-
case basis, to accommodate variations in aircrew member experience and performance. For all
other provisions of this volume, and IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, the waiver authority is
MAJCOM/A3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the
supplement and approved through higher level coordination authority.
   1.9.1. Individual waivers to this volume will remain valid until end of the training cycle (30
   Sep) and will be reviewed annually for continued applicability.

                    AIRCRAFT COMMANDER FORMAL TRAINING

4.1. AC Upgrade General. This chapter outlines initial and mission qualification training
requirements for Aircraft Commanders (AC) of E-9A aircraft.
   4.1.1. The AC upgrade program will be conducted in accordance with this instruction and
   the E9A training syllabus. Tailor ground training to individual background and experience;
   however, use available phase manuals, texts, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as
   supporting material to the maximum extent possible. Exceptions to mission outline
   requirements, other than proficiency advancement, must be submitted for 53 WEG/CC
   waiver.
   4.1.2. Successful completion of AC upgrade program requires the upgrading crewmember to
   complete a combined aircraft instrument qualification and mission evaluation IAW
   AFI112E9V2, E-9—Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. If unable to perform a combined
   evaluation, the instrument qualification and mission evaluations may be flown separately. If
   separated, the AC may fly as an Aircraft Commander on sorties he/she is qualified for (i.e.
   Pilot Proficiency (PP) sortie if instrument qualified and MSN sortie if mission qualified).
4.2. Prerequisites. IAW E-9A syllabus, squadron commander approval and at least 100 hours
total time in E-9A or Dash 8.
4.3. Simulator Training.
   4.3.1. AC upgrade students should successfully accomplish a commercially available
   recurrent qualification course for a Dash 8 if availability permits.
   4.3.2. AC upgrade students will accomplish the Emergency Procedure portion of the AC
   IQT/MQT Evaluation in (in order of preference): (1) Simulator, or (2) E-9A Cockpit.
4.4. Ground Training. Students must satisfactorily complete the following unit-developed
blocks of instruction prior to AC-1:
   4.4.1. All students will spend at least two hours in the E-9A cockpit (on the ground with
   engines NOT running) with an instructor. This event is intended to familiarize the student
   with the E-9A cockpit layout, checklists, and crew coordination. If the commercially
   procured simulator is used to satisfy this requirement, an E-9A differences orientation will be
   conducted with an instructor (time as required based upon student proficiency).
   4.4.2. All students will spend at least one hour in the E-9A cockpit (on the ground with
   engines NOT running), with an instructor for an Emergency Procedures (EP) review.
4.5. AC Flying Training:
   4.5.1. Complete AC upgrade within 60 duty days of the first flying training event. Failure to
   complete within the specified time requires notification through channels to 53 WEG/CC
   with aircrew name and rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion
   date.
   4.5.2. AC upgrade students will only perform aircraft commander duties while under IP
   supervision until completion of the qualification check ride.

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines continuation training (CT) requirements for E-9A pilots.
Aircrews must have completed MQT, be qualified IAW AFI 11-2E-9V2 and have been certified
as BMC to be eligible to enter continuation training.
5.2. Ground Training. Ground training in Table 4.1 accomplished during IQT/MQT may be
credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
   5.2.1. Physiological Training (Altitude Chamber). Aircrew will maintain physiological
   training requirements current IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program,
   and MAJCOM supplement.
   5.2.2. Instrument Refresher Course. Aircrew will maintain instrument refresher training
   requirements current IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program; AFI 11-
   202V2; and MAJCOM supplement.
   5.2.3. Life Support Egress/Non-Ejection Training. Evaluates aircrew and passenger
   ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress procedures. Stress the
   importance of aircrew coordination, aircrew and passenger responsibilities and use of
   appropriate emergency egress equipment. Ensure aircrews are aware of their responsibilities
   for conducting safety and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   5.2.4. Life Support Equipment Training. An academic and equipment training event, in
   which aircrew members demonstrate their ability to locate, preflight, and use all aircrew and
   passenger Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE) carried aboard unit aircraft or issued to
   aircrew members. This training includes the limitations and safety issues related to ALSE.
   Additionally, include aircrew clothing items and information on hazards associated with
   improper wear and failure to use only authorized clothing and equipment items.
   5.2.5. Life Support Water Survival Training. Aircrew will demonstrate proficiency in
   TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) for survival and recovery from a water
   environment using weapons system specific survival equipment. This training should be
   conducted in natural waters (pond, lake, or ocean) or an environmental pool if logistically
   possible. Training in swimming pools is authorized if overall training objectives are not
   compromised. WST (water survival training) will utilize the demonstration and performance
   method of instruction.
   5.2.6. Flying Safety Training. Aircrew will attend quarterly flying safety meetings.
   5.2.7. Local Area Survival (LAS). This is a one-time training requirement prior to first
   flight.
   5.2.8. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). This training is not an
   evaluation but a review of abnormal/emergency procedures and aircraft systems
   operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One pilot should establish a situation and
   the other(s) discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical
   conclusion. All BOLDFACE procedures will be covered. Each pilot should share equal time
   responding to emergency situations. SEPTs will be accomplished each calendar month.
 16                                                             AFI11-2E-9V1 10 JULY 2012


   Failure to accomplish by the end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently
   completed.
   5.2.9. Crew Resource Management (CRM). CRM trains crewmembers to cope with
   potential problems in human behavior affecting crew performance. Each aircrew member is
   required to participate in one training session every 2 years. CRM will be taught by CRM
   qualified Facilitators/Instructors. This is a mandatory grounding item and the individual will
   not fly until the required training is accomplished.
   5.2.10. Ancillary Training. Ancillary training is required for all Air Force personnel.
   Frequency for this training will be IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
   Training does not affect BMC/flying status, and does not require PQI action.
   5.2.11. Emergency Procedures Simulator. E-9A pilots will accomplish one emergency
   procedures simulator (FAA Category C minimum) per year.

Notes:
1. Sortie can be a mission or pilot proficiency sortie to regain currency.
2. IP supervision required with direct access to controls to regain currency.
3. A landing in either seat updates currency for dual-seat qualified pilots.
   5.4.2. Proficiency Sortie. Allows pilots to practice instrument, transition, and emergency
   procedures. The following are the minimum required maneuvers to credit a Proficiency
   Sortie (comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2E9V3): review of boldface emergency
   procedures, one precision approach, one non-precision approach, one circling approach
   (traffic permitting), one simulated engine-out go-around or one simulated engine-out landing,
   (weather and passengers permitting), and one VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting).
   5.4.3. Mission Sortie. Allows pilots and crewmembers to perform the Sea Surveillance
   Radar (SSR) and/or Telemetry (TM) collection roles of the E-9A. The following are the
   minimum required maneuvers to credit a Mission sortie (comply with restrictions in AFI 11-
   2E9V3): SSR, UHF Relay, and/or TM collection.

   5.5.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
5.6. Requalification. Loss of landing currency beyond 90 days requires the following action:
(timing starts from date that aircrew member last accomplished a full stop landing)
   5.6.1. 91-135 Days. Pilot proficiency sortie, regain landing currency with IP.
   5.6.2. 136-210 Days. Same as 4.6.1., plus take "Spot" Evaluation/Qualification in Landings.
   5.6.3. 211 or More Days. Repeat IQT and MQT.
