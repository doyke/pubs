AFI 10-244, dated 12 September 2005, is supplemented as follows. This supplement provides
local procedures for those areas listed in AFI 10-244 that require MAJCOM direction. It
provides policy and guidance to report status to execute Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs)
taskings. It formalizes reporting policies for unit assigned AEF taskings for full spectrum
operations and provides guidance to headquarters agencies to certify the readiness of allocated
forces to accomplish their designated missions under the AEF construct. It applies to all Air
Combat Command (ACC) units and does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or the Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Ensure that all records maintained in accordance with Air
Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of them in accordance with the AF
Records Information Management (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims. Contact supporting records managers as
required for approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functionals chain of
command.

changes for assigned Unit Type Codes (UTC)s.
3.8.4. (Added) Local Procedures.

3.8.4.1.1. (Added) One day late: 2 BW ART POC will forward email to 2d Logistics Readiness
Squadron (2 LRS) Commander. 2 LRS Commander will contact the appropriate unit
commander to reinforce the 26-day reporting requirement and notify them that their unit is late.

using the squadron ART POC’s suggestions.
3.8.4.3. (Added) If no discrepancies exist between the printed report and the squadron

squadron ART POC the authority to save inputs to the ART database.

reviewed and signed by the commander.
3.8.4.4.1. (Added) Squadrons will keep the two most current signed reports on file. They will
