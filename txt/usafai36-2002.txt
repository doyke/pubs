1. Purpose. By design, the USAFA training program requires unique and rigorous academic,
athletic, military, and character graduation standards. In addition to the accession weight
standards and commissioning fitness assessment standards outlined in AFI 36-2905, USAFA
cadets are required to meet all USAFA weight, body fat, and athletic graduation standards.
USAFAI 36-2002 defines and differentiates between the USAFA cadet weight, body fat, and
athletic graduation standards and the USAF accession weight standards and commissioning
fitness assessment standards.
2. Responsibilities. The Superintendent (USAFA/CC) has overall responsibility for the
USAFA cadet weight, body fat, and fitness program. Other key commanders in this program are
the Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CW); Director of Athletics (USAFA/AD); Vice
Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CWV); and Commander, 10th Medical Group (10 MDG/CC).
Specific tasks for each of these commanders are as follows:
     2.1. The Superintendent is the approval authority for USAFA cadet graduation weight, body
     fat, or athletic waivers. The Superintendent is also the approval authority for cadet
     graduation date delays or administrative separations for deficiencies in meeting USAFA
     cadet graduation weight, body fat, or athletic standards.
        2.1.1. The Superintendent is the approval authority for USAFA cadet commissioning
        fitness assessment waivers (due to long-term medical restrictions). The Superintendent
        will forward all commissioning fitness assessment waivers to AF/A1DO for coordination
        (for their tracking and oversight). The Superintendent is also the approval authority for
        commissioning date delays or administrative separations for cadets with USAF
        commissioning fitness assessment deficiencies.
     2.2. The Commandant of Cadets is responsible for reviewing all cadets who:
        2.2.1. Require a waiver to USAF commissioning fitness standards due to long-term
        medical restrictions. After review, the Commandant will make waiver recommendations
        to the Superintendent.
USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012                                                                         3


     2.2.2. Fail to meet USAF commissioning fitness assessment standards (as defined in AFI
     36-2905). After reviewing the Military Review Committee (MRC) recommendation, the
     Commandant will make commissioning date delay or administrative separation
     recommendations to the Superintendent.
     2.2.3. Fail to make satisfactory progress in meeting cadet body fat (BF) standards (as
     defined in Paragraph 4.1.3.). The Commandant will review the MRC recommendation
     on cadets who fail to make satisfactory progress. The Commandant will make
     commissioning date delay or administrative separation recommendations to the
     Superintendent.
     2.2.4. Require a waiver to cadet BF standards due to a temporary athletic body fat
     adjustment during his or her first-class year (as allowed in Paragraph 4.2.6.).
  2.3. The Director of Athletics (USAFA/AD) is responsible for:
     2.3.1. Administering all aspects of the cadet physical education (PE) and fitness
     programs.
     2.3.2. Administering all aspects of the cadet physical fitness and aerobic fitness tests.
     2.3.3. Administering the abdominal circumference, push-up, crunch, and 1.5-mile events
     of the commissioning fitness assessment to first-class cadets.
     2.3.4. Tracking all cadets for proficiency in meeting USAFA cadet athletic graduation
     and AFI 36-2905 commissioning fitness assessment standards.
     2.3.5. Administering body composition assessments (as defined in DoDI 1308.3,
     Enclosure 3) in support of the temporary athletic body fat adjustment processes.
     2.3.6. Providing performance summaries and commissioning recommendations to
     USAFA/CWV for MRC action on cadets who are deficient in meeting AFI 36-2905
     commissioning fitness assessment standards.
     2.3.7. Providing performance summaries and waiver recommendations to USAFA/CW
     on cadets who require a waiver to commissioning fitness assessment standards due to
     long-term medical restrictions.
     2.3.8. Providing performance summaries and making commissioning date delay or
     administrative separation recommendations to USAFA/CC on cadets who are deficient in
     meeting USAFA cadet athletic graduation standards as determined by the Physical
     Education Review Committee (PERC).
     2.3.9. Providing performance summaries and making waiver recommendations to
     USAFA/CC on cadets who require a waiver to USAFA cadet athletic graduation
     standards due to long-term medical restrictions.
  2.4. The Vice Commandant of Cadets, through the Cadet Squadron Air Officer
  Commanding (AOC), is responsible for:
     2.4.1. Managing all aspects of the cadet Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Fat (BF)
     programs (as defined in Paragraph 4.) to include approving temporary body fat
     adjustments for athletic performance reasons (as defined in Paragraph 4.2.).
 4                                                                 USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012


        2.4.2. Tracking all cadets for compliance in maintaining USAFA cadet BMI and BF
        standards throughout the four-year cadet-training program.
        2.4.3. Providing BMI and BF histories, and retention recommendations to the
        Commandant of Cadets for cadets who fail to make satisfactory progress (as defined in
        paragraph 4.1.3.) while in a remedial weight management program.
        2.4.4. Accomplishing height and weight measurements on all first class cadets within 24-
        hours of scheduled USAF commissioning fitness assessments and entering USAF
        commissioning fitness assessment data into the AF Fitness Management System on the
        AF Portal.
     2.5. The Commander, 10th Medical Group is responsible for:
        2.5.1. Administering initial health assessments for cadets identified for a remedial weight
        management program.
        2.5.2. Determine commissionability of cadets that are below minimum BMI (as defined
        in paragraph A2.3.1.1.2.).
        2.5.3. Conducting medical evaluations for first-class cadets who earn an Unsatisfactory
        score on their official commissioning assessment to determine any possible medical
        indicators that prohibit program success.
3. USAFA Cadet Athletic Graduation Requirements. The USAFA cadet athletic graduation
requirements are to complete the required PE curriculum and earn a cumulative physical
education average (PEA) of at least a 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale). Cadet graduation standards are
approved by the Academy Board, and the Deputy Director of Athletics (USAFA/ADP) is the
OPR for administering and managing cadet athletic graduation standards.
     3.1. The required PE curriculum is approved by the USAFA Curriculum Review Committee
     (CRC). The CRC also approves the implementation plan for curriculum changes.
     3.2. PEA is a function of three performance scores – cadet physical fitness test (PFT), cadet
     aerobic fitness test (AFT), and PE classes. Like grade point average (GPA), PEA is
     measured on a 4.00 scale with 3.00 grades and higher being worthy of honors recognition
     and less than 2.00 grades being deficient (PFT, AFT, and PEA are explained in detail in
     ADOI 36-3504, Deputy Director of Athletics, PE Program).
        3.2.1. PFT and AFT performances are initially scored on 500-point scales and then
        converted to a traditional 4.00 letter grade (i.e., 250 points = 2.00 or C grade, etc.). Each
        semester’s PFT or AFT grade (on a 4.00 scale) then becomes a final and permanent score
        used in computing cumulative PEA.
        3.2.2. Cadets will normally take the PFT and AFT in each of their first seven semesters.
        After seven semesters, as long as a cadet has earned at least a 2.00 cumulative PEA, they
        are excused from the PFT and AFT in their eighth semester. If after seven semesters, a
        cadet has a deficient cumulative PEA (< 2.00) or they have not taken a PFT or AFT in the
        previous two semesters, their record will be reviewed by the Physical Education Review
        Committee (PERC).        The PERC may recommend administrative separation to
        USAFA/AD or direct eighth semester PFT and AFT tests.
USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012                                                                       5


           3.2.2.1. The PERC will review cadets in a nine-semester program at the end of their
           eighth semester (i.e., the process outlined in Paragraph 3.2.2. is delayed one
           semester).
       3.2.3. Cumulative PEA is computed as 50% cumulative PFT + 15% cumulative AFT +
       35% cumulative PE grades.
           3.2.3.1. Cumulative PFT and AFT scores are the averages of all the respective
           semester PFT and AFT grades.
           3.2.3.2. Cumulative PE score is the average of all PE course grades earned as a cadet.
   3.3. Cadets on temporary athletic body fat adjustments must meet all cadet athletic
   graduation requirements.
4. USAFA Cadet Body Mass Index and Body Fat Standards. Unless exempted for
temporary athletic body fat adjustments, cadets are expected to maintain USAFA cadet BMI or
BF standards over their entire cadet career. Cadets are responsible for monitoring caloric intake
and personal exercise programs to maintain the required BMI or BF standards. USAFA/CWV is
the OPR for administering and monitoring cadet compliance with these standards.
   4.1. As commanders, AOCs are responsible for:
       4.1.1. Administering and managing USAFA BMI and BF standards in their respective
       cadet squadrons. Height and weight measurements will be administered in accordance
       with Attachment 2. By lesson five of each academic year semester, all cadets will be
       measured for height and weight. Cadet height and weight data will be maintained in the
       individual’s Cadet Personnel Record (CPR II). The responsibility for administering
       squadron weigh-ins may be delegated to the squadron Academy Military Trainer (AMT),
       but not to cadets. Cadets will be weighed while wearing the USAFA issued Physical
       Conditioning (PC) uniform, without shoes. Two pounds will be deducted from the
       measured weight as compensation for the weight of the PC uniform. AOCs will forward
       names of any cadet who exceeds BF standards outlined herein up through command
       chain to USAFA/CWV after lesson five and with subsequent updates at mid/end-of
       semester, as a minimum.
       4.1.2. Administering body composition assessments (as defined in DoDI 1308.3,
       Enclosure 3) for any male cadet in their squadron who exceeds the maximum BMI
       screening weight of 27.5 kilograms of body weight per meter of standing height squared
       (kg/m2), any female cadet in their squadron who exceeds the maximum BMI screening
       weight of 25.0 kg/m2 (see Attachment 2 for BMI tables), or any cadet who presents an
       unprofessional image when in their uniform. This assessment will be done in conjunction
       with height and weight measurements.
           4.1.2.1. The BMI tables start at 58 inches in height and end at 80 inches in height.
           For any cadet less than 57.5 inches or greater than 80.5 inches in height, their BMI
           (rounded to the closest pound) will be calculated as 704.5 x [weight / (height
           squared)] where weight is measured in pounds and height in inches.
           4.1.2.2. If cadets exceed their semester BMI screen, but tape <20% body fat for
           males or <28% body fat for females, they are in good standing and will be treated as
           if they passed their initial BMI screen.
6                                                            USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012


       4.1.2.3. BMI is an initial screening tool used each semester. If a cadet exceeds their
       BMI, they are taped for BF. If a cadet tapes above their BF limit of 20% for males or
       28% for females, they are entered into a remedial weight management program
       (WMP). The Human Performance Laboratory (USAFA/ADPH) may be consulted to
       verify BF measurements and taping protocols. Once entered into a WMP, the cadet
       must meet cadet BF standards (20% for males or 28% for females) to complete the
       program (see Paragraph 4.1.5.). BMI standards are used for initial screenings, not for
       removal from the WMP.
    4.1.3. Within two duty days, placing cadets found deficient in their BF measurement into
    a remedial weight management program. Cadets are considered deficient, or over-fat, if
    they exceed a maximum body fat of 20% for males or 28% for females.
       4.1.3.1. Initial counseling will be documented in the CPR II and the remedial
       program individually tailored to best help the deficient cadet, but at a minimum the
       cadet must be scheduled through the 10th Aerospace Medicine Squadron Cadet Clinic
       (10 AMDS/SGP) for a medical evaluation and receive nutrition counseling with a
       cadet-wing dietician (10 FSS/FSLFN). These two mandatory appointments are to be
       scheduled within 10 duty days of entry into a remedial program.
           4.1.3.1.1. The AOC may direct a cadet to the Health and Wellness Center
           (HAWC) for exercise counseling/sessions and nutritional appointments. A cadet
           may self-refer to the HAWC at any time, whether in a WMP or not. To make an
           appointment, the AOC or cadet can call the HAWC at 333-3733.
           4.1.3.1.2. Upon entry into the WMP, cadets may be directed to attend athletic
           reconditioning (RECONDO) by their AOC in coordination with AD
           reconditioning staff (USAFA/ADPVT).
       4.1.3.2. Initial counseling must include a performance contract clearly describing
       expected satisfactory progress in meeting cadet BF standards. Satisfactory progress is
       three pounds for female cadets or five pounds for male cadets of weight loss or one
       percent reduction in body fat composition each month (for male or female cadets)
       until BF is within standards. Monthly weight and taping measurements will occur no
       sooner than every 28 calendar days, but no later than every 32 calendar days.
       4.1.3.3. Continued failure to show progress in meeting cadet body fat standards will
       result in administrative action, up to and including disenrollment (handled through the
       MRC process). After a third monthly failure (three total failures after entering the
       remedial program, not limited to sequential failures), AOCs will forward the cadet’s
       progress data and a recommendation for administrative action through USAFA/CWV
       for possible MRC action. If the cadet is not disenrolled after a third monthly failure,
       the AOC will continue to forward progress data and recommendations for
       administrative action after each additional monthly failure.
       4.1.3.4. AOCs will forward the names of any first-class cadet who exceeds BF
       standards during their last cadet semester up the command chain to USAFA/CWV.
       AOCs will also notify the deficient last-semester first-class cadet in a letter of
       counseling that they will be subject to late graduation or disenrollment if they do not
USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012                                                                        7


         meet cadet BF standards. Procedures for cadets on temporary athletic body fat
         adjustments are outlined in Paragraph 4.2.6.
     4.1.4. Arranging for and documenting required monthly satisfactory progress
     measurements over the summer.
     4.1.5. Continuing to monitor remedial WMP cadets for 3 months after they meet cadet
     BF standards. If during this 3-month monitoring period the cadet exceeds cadet BF
     standards, that failure will be considered a satisfactory progress failure as a part of their
     original remedial program and the cadet will stay in their original program until they
     meet BF standards and successfully complete a 3-month monitoring period.
         4.1.5.1. If a cadet completes the 3-month monitoring period without a failure, they
         are removed from their original remedial program. A subsequent failure after
         removal from a remedial program will be treated as a first time deficiency and the
         remedial process will begin anew.
  4.2. Cadets may be authorized a temporary adjustment to cadet BF standards for athletic
  performance reasons. Cadets request this temporary athletic body fat adjustment through the
  following process:
     4.2.1. The intercollegiate coach or competitive club officer-in-charge will validate the
     need for the temporary athletic body fat adjustment via an email to the Intercollegiate
     Liaison Branch (USAFA/ADPL) for review. After validating the temporary body fat
     adjustment requirement, USAFA/ADPL will notify the Human Performance Laboratory
     (USAFA/ADPH) to initiate an assessment.
     4.2.2. USAFA/ADPH will establish a healthy body fat adjustment for the cadet, initiate
     the body fat adjustment enrollment letter (see Attachment 3), and forward to the AOC.
     4.2.3. The AOC will concur or non-concur with the USAFA/ADPH recommendation
     and forward to the Vice Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CWV).
     4.2.4. USAFA/CWV is the approval authority for temporary athletic body fat
     adjustments. After rendering a judgment (approve or disapprove), USAFA/CWV will
     return the body fat adjustment enrollment letter to the AOC for filing in the cadet’s CPR
     II.
     4.2.5. Once a cadet is approved for a temporary athletic body fat adjustment, the AOC
     will have the cadet sign the adjustment letter acknowledging he or she is still required to
     meet all USAFA cadet athletic graduation standards and pass the USAF commissioning
     fitness assessment to receive a commission, and is fully aware of his or her responsibility
     to make satisfactory progress in meeting cadet BF standards as soon he or she is no
     longer competing in the activity that required the temporary body fat adjustment.
         4.2.5.1. While on an approved temporary athletic body fat adjustment, cadets will be
         proficient as long as their beginning of semester BF taping is no higher than the
         approved waiver limit. If a cadet tapes above their waiver limit, USAFA/ADPH will
         be contacted to reassess the waiver limit. If USAFA/ADPH does not initiate a new
         waiver limit, the cadet will be considered deficient and placed into a WMP based on
         exceeding the original waiver limit.
 8                                                                USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012


           4.2.5.2. Once a cadet no longer has a valid competitive requirement for a temporary
           body fat adjustment, the AOC will immediately provide initial counseling, place the
           cadet in a remedial weight management program, and arrange the mandatory
           appointments with the Cadet Clinic (10 AMDS/SGP) and 10 FSS/FSLFN (Cadet
           Dietician) (i.e., initiate the process beginning in Paragraph 4.1.2.).
        4.2.6. Cadets who require a temporary body fat adjustment for athletic performance
        reasons during their first-class year may graduate while in a remedial WMP as long as
        they are making satisfactory progress (as defined in Paragraph 4.1.3.2. above) and receive
        approval from the Superintendent.
           4.2.6.1. Cadets who stop competing prior to their first-class year in the athletic
           activity that required a temporary body fat adjustment must meet cadet BF standards,
           to include the 3-month monitoring program, prior to graduation.
5. USAF Commissioning Fitness Assessment. In addition to meeting USAFA cadet weight or
body fat and athletic graduation requirements, to receive a commission, cadets must pass the Air
Force fitness assessment. AFI 36-2905 defines all fitness assessment standards and grading
scales.
     5.1. USAFA/ADP is the OPR for administering and managing the commissioning fitness
     assessment to first-class cadets.
     5.2. USAFA/ADP is responsible for:
        5.2.1. Scheduling all first-class cadets to take the commissioning fitness assessment in
        their last cadet semester. Any cadet who fails to meet the commissioning standard on the
        initial test date will be placed into athletic reconditioning (RECONDO) and retested no
        later than 60 days after initial failure. Cadets in the Unsatisfactory fitness category will
        remain in RECONDO until they earn at least a Satisfactory score or until other action is
        taken.
           5.2.1.1. In unique situations (i.e., surgery scheduled for their last semester), first-
           class cadets may be scheduled to test in their next-to-last semester. Cadets will not be
           administered an official commissioning fitness assessment prior to their first-class
           year.
           5.2.1.2. Providing fitness assessment data to the respective squadron AOC and AMT.
        5.2.2. Forwarding performance summaries and recommendations for first-class cadets
        who fail to meet commissioning standards after the make-up test to the Director of
        Athletics. The Director of Athletics may authorize a second make-up test within 21 days
        of the first make-up test failure.
           5.2.2.1. Athletic performance summaries and commissioning recommendations for
           first-class cadets not approved for a second make-up, or failing a second make-up,
           will be forwarded to USAFA/CWV for potential MRC action. The Commandant will
           make commissioning date delay or administrative separation recommendations to the
           Superintendent (see paragraph 2.2.).
        5.2.3. Forwarding cadet PFT, AFT, and PEA data summaries and recommendations for
        cadets needing waivers due to long-term medical restrictions for any of the three
USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012                                                                     9


     commissioning fitness assessment events (push-ups, crunches, or 1.5 mile run) to the
     Director of Athletics.
        5.2.3.1. Cadets must accomplish an abdominal circumference measurement if
        medically restricted.
        5.2.3.2. Cadets will complete a partial commission fitness assessment if their medical
        restriction allows.
        5.2.3.3. Most recent PFT and AFT data will be used in place of the medically
        restricted event (pushup, crunch, or 1.5 mile run) to approximate a composite score.
        No alternate tests, to include cycle ergometry, are authorized.
     5.2.4. Complete an annual review (normally following fall semester cadet make-up
     PFT/AFT testing) to identify first-class cadets considered to be ―at risk‖ to earn a
     Satisfactory score on the Air Force fitness assessment. The review may include assessing
     AF PFT scores earned in the Physical Development 112 course, AFT run-times, and PFT
     push-up/crunch scores. ―At risk‖ cadets will be reported to AOCs as appropriate.
  5.3. Squadron AOCs are responsible for accomplishing height and weight measurements
  (per AFI 36-2905, Paragraph 2.6.2.) on all first-class cadets within 24-hours prior to
  scheduled USAF commissioning fitness assessments and entering USAF commissioning
  fitness assessment data into the AF Fitness Management System (AFFMS) on the AF Portal
  within 10 duty days of receiving the data from USAFA/ADP.
     5.3.1. Squadron AOCs will administer an unofficial practice test to all first-class cadets
     by lesson 5 of the Spring semester. Intercollegiate athletes may be exempt provided they
     are not on the weight management program or fail to meet the parameters of an approved
     temporary body fat adjustment for athletic performance reasons. Testing may be
     completed during the beginning of the designated squadron intramural period. AOCs
     shall report Unsatisfactory scores to USAFA/ADPVT within 10 days of completing the
     assessment. AOCs may direct cadets to use the cadet schedule of calls directed
     development time for reconditioning in preparation for their official AF commissioning
     PFT assessment in Spring semester. AOCs may administer diagnostic AF PFT tests as
     they deem appropriate. Irrespective of Cum PEA and with prior USAFA/ADPVT
     approval, first-class cadets who fail to pass an AOC administered practice test during the
     Spring semester may be considered for RECONDO. This plan will afford cadets an
     opportunity to assess their compliance with AF fitness standards, implement a get-well
     plan where necessary, and minimize any surprise assessment failures at the time of
     official assessments.
     5.3.2. For any failures of official commissioning fitness assessments, AOCs will
     immediately provide initial counseling and arrange the mandatory appointments with the
     cadet clinic (10 AMDS/SGP), cadet dietician (10 FSS/FSLFN) and HAWC (i.e. for cases
     where this action was not previously initiated under paragraph 4.1.3.1./4.1.3.1.1. of this
     instruction).

                                BODY MASS INDEX TABLE

A2.1. Body mass index (BMI) is the physiological relationship of weight-for-height, measured
in kilograms of body weight per meter of standing height squared (kg/m2).
   A2.1.1. The Department of Defense’s height-weight screening guidance establishes an upper
   limit of 27.5 kg/m2 and lower limit of 25.0 kg/m2 for maximum allowable weight. USAFA
   male cadets will be screened with the 27.5 kg/m2 standard and female cadets with the 25.0
   kg/m2 standard.
A2.2. Height and Weight Measurements:
   A2.2.1. Height.
       A2.2.1.1. Measurement will be taken with the cadet in PC uniform, no shoes worn.
       A2.2.1.2. Cadets will stand on a flat surface with the head held horizontal looking
       directly forward, with the line of vision horizontal, and the chin parallel to the floor. The
       body should be straight, but not rigid, similar to the body position when at attention.
       A2.2.1.3. Measurements will be recorded to the nearest inch with the following
       guidelines:
          A2.2.1.3.1. If the height fraction is less than ½ inch, round down to the nearest inch.
          A2.2.1.3.2. If the height fraction is ½ inch or greater, round up to the nearest inch.
   A2.2.2. Weight.
       A2.2.2.1. Measurement will be taken with the cadet in PC uniform, no shoes worn. Two
       pounds will be subtracted from the measured weight to compensate for clothing weight.
       A2.2.2.2. The measurement will be made on calibrated scales and recorded to the nearest
       pound with the following guidelines:
       A2.2.2.2.1. If the weight fraction is less than ½ pound, round down to the nearest pound.
          A2.2.2.2.2. If the weight fraction is ½ pound or greater, round up to the nearest
          pound.
A2.3. BMI Screening Tables.
   A2.3.1. Tables present the male maximum (27.5 kg/m2), female maximum (25.0 kg/m2) and
   the minimum (19.0 kg/m2) USAFA cadet BMI screening weights.
       A2.3.1.1. Male cadets above the 27.5 kg/m2 maximum, female cadets above the 25.0
       kg/m2 maximum, or any cadet below the 19.0 kg/m2 minimum BMI screening weight
       will be taped to determine body composition.
          A2.3.1.1.1. Unless authorized a temporary body fat adjustment (see paragraph 4.2.),
          male cadets above the 27.5 kg/m2 and 20% body fat maximum and female cadets
          above the 25.0 kg/m2 and 28% body fat maximum, will be entered into a remedial
          weight management program.
USAFAI36-2002 2 MAY 2012                                                                                         13


              A2.3.1.1.2. For cadets below the 19.0 kg/m2 minimum BMI, the AOC will provide
              their body composition measurements to the Cadet Clinic for a health assessment
              review and direct the cadet to the cadet-wing dietician for nutrition counseling.
