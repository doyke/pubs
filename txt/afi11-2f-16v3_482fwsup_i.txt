                                    MISSION PLANNING

Section 2A—-General

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations. Accomplish
sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map
preparation, and takeoff/landing data.
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BWC are defined in AFI 91-
202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike
Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques. The OG/CC will determine local BASH procedures.
   2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
   phase II period increase likelihood of birdstrike. Significant bird hazards are published in
   FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance.
   2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
   appropriate judgments based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
   airfield personnel.
   2.2.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
   United States Avian hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com), provides BASH
   information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, PFPS software overlay, and
   latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information.
2.3. Standards. The OG/CC may publish and approve group or wing standards. Operations
Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11-series compliance prior to
publication.
2.4. CBRNE. Procedures for operation in a CBRNE-threat environment are contained in
Attachment 2.
2.5. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.5.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum TOLD requirements on the MDC are:
   2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal
   speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; normal landing speed and
   distance (dry/wet); heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and distance
   (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, evaluate aircraft performance by
   comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000’ acceleration
   check speed.
   2.5.2. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas.
   2.5.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational
   flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        11


   2.5.4. Low Altitude Maps.
       2.5.4.1. On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart
       Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. It will be of such
       scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits
       navigation and safe mission accomplishment. Circle/highlight manmade obstacles at
       above planned flight altitude within 5nm of the planned route. Annotate time or distance
       tick marks and headings.
       2.5.4.2. Annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the IFR Off Airways guidance in AFI
       11-202V3 chapter 8.
       2.5.4.3. For flights inside the Continental United states (CONUS) under Visual Flight
       Rules (VFR) or inside Military Training Routes (MTR), comply with the following:
          2.5.4.3.1. Use FLIP AP/1B and either sectional aeronautical charts or mission
          planning software (e.g. PFPS/Falcon View/JMPS). Select the following overlay
          options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,
          MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries.
          2.5.4.3.2. Annotate Low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books ,
          with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil
          airfields, and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g. parachute activity areas
          and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 nm of any planned VFR route or
          MTR lateral boundary. Annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity
          of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other
          areas of conflict.
       2.5.4.4. Outside the CONUS, follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
       on mission planning. If no such guidance exists, use the best charts or flight planning
       software overlay options available to accomplish the intent of maximizing traffic
       awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries.
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities.
2.7. Overwater. Plan overwater sorties outside the local training area (e.g. cross countries,
deployments, and PDM inputs) as a two-ship minimum. The OG/CC may approve exceptions.
2.8. Briefing and Debriefing.
   2.8.1. All flight members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with
   unit/squadron supervisors. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing to
   promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the
   capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron
   standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard."
   2.8.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on
   complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and must start flight briefings at least 1.5
   hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings will start in sufficient time to be completed
   prior to pilot changeover. Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all minimum
12                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


  requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-202v3 are addressed. Additional time and CRM
  emphasis is required in D-model sorties especially on FAM and Incentive flights. Passenger
  must demonstrate oxygen regulator use, ability to establish multiple airways and mask
  removal after being strapped in. Reference Attachment 3 for example briefing guides. All
  flight briefings will include:
     2.8.2.1. Weather and NOTAMs
     2.8.2.2. Emergency procedures
     2.8.2.3. Mission priorities and task management
     2.8.2.4. Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE).
     2.8.2.5. Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will
     brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight.
  2.8.3. Low-level Briefing. Emphasize:
     2.8.3.1. Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and
     weather avoidance with route abort procedures.
     2.8.3.2. Employment of all controlled-flight-into-terrain protection features, e.g.
     Automatic Low Altitude Warning (ALOW)/Line in the Sky (LIS)/Ground Collision
     Avoidance System (GCAS).
     2.8.3.3. Human factors to include task prioritization, g-excess illusion, and perceptual
     issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain.
     2.8.3.4. Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as
     well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict.
  2.8.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip
  clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of
  flight.
  2.8.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days.
     2.8.5.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight that is less complex than the primary
     mission. Unbriefed missions/events will not be flown. Mission elements may be
     modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads
     will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. Continuation training (CT)
     missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence.
     2.8.5.2. During deployed operations, exercises, or multiple-go days when aircraft turn
     times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight
     brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent flights.
     2.8.5.3. On multiple-go days, subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity.
     Schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. If that sortie is non-effective
     for weather, maintenance or airspace IPs may elect to accomplish the planned upgrade
     events in the second sortie.
  2.8.6. Debriefing.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                     13


       2.8.6.1. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
       responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and sensor
       management.
       2.8.6.2. Flight leads will review the video/audio record of all tactical portions of the
       sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness. It is imperative to evaluate not
       only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when the
       AGSM breaks down and G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots with
       poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations officer.
       The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge training in
       accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
2.9. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of
flight manual checklists must contain all items, verbatim and in order, unless specifically
addressed in the flight manual. Pilot aids will contain:
   2.9.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachment 3 for examples).
   2.9.2. Local radio channelization.
   2.9.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information.
   2.9.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
   NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc).
   2.9.5. Divert base cable and barrier information.
   2.9.6. Bailout and jettison areas.
   2.9.7. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation,
   Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing.
   2.9.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local
   training areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures.

Section 2B—Night (see also night sections of Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)

2.10. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Compute the MSA for each leg of the intended route of
flight in accordance with AFI 11-202V3.
2.11. Night chart requirements. Minimum requirement is a Form 70 or chart/map containing
headings, RAAs, MSAs, and maximum/minimum route structure altitudes.
2.12. Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra Red for Night (LANTIRN) Navigation
Pod Operations. For brevity, the remainder of this AFI will refer to operations using this pod as
Terrain Following Radar (TFR) Operations. For these purposes, TFR will presume use not only
of the TFR element of the pod, but also the Navigation Forward-Looking Infra Red (NFLIR)
imagery.
   2.12.1. TFR Planning.
       2.12.1.1. Bank angles. Plan turn point bank angles using realistic system limitations,
       not to exceed 45 degrees.
14                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


     2.12.1.2. Letdown Corridors. To the maximum extent possible, select letdown points
     that avoid initial descent into rugged or mountainous terrain. Compute primary and
     alternate entry point TF letdown corridors, Recovery Initiation Altitudes (RIA), altitudes
     for terrain at 1 NM, and altitudes for commanded level off.
  2.12.2. TFR Briefing. Emphasize ensuring the LANTIRN system is fully operational,
  transitioning to low altitude, and TF maneuvering limitations.

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. (B/D model aircraft) when the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully
   qualified F-16 pilot, place the stick control switch in the FWD position.
   3.1.2. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit; in the avionics bay
   behind the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back).
   3.1.3. Do not place objects in or on top of the engine intake.
   3.1.4. Secure publications, maps and personal items to avoid flight control/ throttle
   interference.
   3.1.5. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) except when using Aircrew Eye and Respiratory
   Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE). If flying
   with the COMBAT EDGE vest, remove the port plug on the CRU-94 (if installed), stow the
   plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon completion of the sortie.
   3.1.6. Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position.
   3.1.7. Do not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III
   configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2.
   3.1.8. (AFRC) Before hot pit refueling, turn targeting pod power off. After fueling, taxi
   clear of the pits before re-applying power to the pod.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
intercom system during all engine start, pre-taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Use the
intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are
performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas. Do not
actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment. Units
with an active air defense commitment may waive use of ground intercom during alert
scrambles. When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-
218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. The crew chief will
repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
   3.2.1. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
       3.2.1.1. EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate hand.
       3.2.1.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
       motion.
       3.2.1.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push
       forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
       3.2.1.4. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook.
 16                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


       3.2.1.5. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
       3.2.1.6. EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion
       indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors
       may be present.
3.3. Taxi and Arming.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission
   requirements dictate, limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots
   in turns.
   3.3.2. Ice/Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all
   portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. When ice
   and/or snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet
   spacing. Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. OG/CC may waive this requirement.
   3.3.3. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O.
   1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
       3.3.3.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation.
       3.3.3.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start.
       3.3.3.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and EOR). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.
       3.3.3.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-
       off.
       3.3.3.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified personnel must accomplish
       an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine.
   3.3.4. EPU Check. Do not allow maintenance technicians to approach the aircraft until the
   EPU check is complete. Use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe.
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Place hands in view of ground personnel
while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de-arming are in progress. If the intercom
system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
the chief and use visual signals. EOR inspections will be accomplished immediately prior to
takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing the chock
area (not required for alert scrambles). At non-USAF bases, make every attempt to coordinate
an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit.
   3.4.1. Forward Firing Ordnance. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed
   with forward firing ordnance.
   3.4.2. Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any
   abnormalities.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         17


3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width.
Minimum spacing between separated elements/flights is 500 feet. Wingmen must maintain
wingtip clearance with their element lead. If runway width permits, lineup with wingtip
clearance between all aircraft in the flight.

Section 3B—Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10.
   3.6.2. Pilots will review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as
   short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations and abort sequence in formation
   flights.
   3.6.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff.
   3.6.4. Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings
   (including remotely operated cables). OG/CC may waive this requirement.
   3.6.5. OG/CC may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   3.6.6. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50
   percent of the available runway.
   3.6.7. Centerline Stores. Start the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless
   runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate
   otherwise. Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank may takeoff across approach end
   BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system.
   3.6.8. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements is 10 seconds (15 seconds for
   afterburner). Increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for join-up on top or when carrying
   live air-to-surface ordnance.
   3.6.9. After releasing brakes, aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway.
   3.6.10. Formation Takeoff.
      3.6.10.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to two aircraft
      3.6.10.2. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
          3.6.10.2.1. Runway width is less than 125 feet.
          3.6.10.2.2. Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway.
          3.6.10.2.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
          3.6.10.2.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, 20mm
          ammunition, 2.75 rockets, AGM-88, AGM-65, and night illumination flares).
          3.6.10.2.5. Ferrying aircraft from contractor/AFMC facilities.
          3.6.10.2.6. Asymmetric loading or a difference of more than 2,500 pounds gross
          weight.
 18                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


3.7. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.7.1. Day weather minimums for VFR join-ups below a ceiling are 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
   miles (5 km) visibility.
   3.7.2. Flight leads will maintain 350 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed. Pilots may delay AB cancellation to establish
   closure on lead or lead element.
   3.7.3. Battle damage/bomb check will be accomplished on RTB, when practical (i.e. weather
   prohibits accomplishing BD check). This check is mandatory after expending any ordnance
   (including 20mm ammunition).
   3.7.4. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 MSL when practical.
   3.7.5. For further join-up procedures, see Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
   Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4).

Section 3C—-Enroute

3.8. Air Refueling.
   3.8.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade
   or requal pilot is in the formation, and will request a qualified (non-student) boomer.
   3.8.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g. KC-
   10, KC-135) for the first time.
   3.8.3. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW aircraft-specific
   T.O. 1F-16X-1.
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)/Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.9.1. The following are the minimum altitudes for the prescribed maneuvers.
       3.9.1.1. Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling - 10,000 feet AGL, except dive
       recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude).
       3.9.1.2. Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) numbers 1, 2 and 3 -
       10,000 feet AGL.
       3.9.1.3. HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 - 15,000 feet AGL.
       3.9.1.4. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering.
   3.9.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. If unavoidable, the aircraft should be
   unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.9.3. Do not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft
   performance. EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during intercepts
   performed by air sovereignty tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below 5000’ AGL)
   VID training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KIAS.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        19


   3.9.4. Do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. Examples
   are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to gain
   additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed.
   3.9.5. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition.
   3.9.6. The following is guidance for Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series
   (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16):
       3.9.6.1. HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only.
       3.9.6.2. In F-16 C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, do not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 unless
       in one of the following configurations: Clean, 300 gallon centerline tank, MAU-12s on
       stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM-9/AMDs on stations 1 and/or 9.
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. Flight
members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts or other
assigned tasks. Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond their abilities
without sacrificing basic responsibilities. Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and AFTTP 3-1.F-16.
   3.10.1. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. Wingmen will be prepared to
   take the lead when directed.
   3.10.2. In IMC, the maximum flight size in visual formation is four aircraft except when
   flying in close formation with a tanker.
   3.10.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.10.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, or detailed in local procedures. Initiate configuration changes for
   four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. When formation position changes are directed
   by radio, all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is
   mandatory when directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions.
   3.10.5. Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot
   has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN).
   3.10.6. Lead changes.
       3.10.6.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
       over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
       3E)].
       3.10.6.2. During limited visibility conditions (e.g. night, IMC) initiate lead changes from
       a stabilized, wings level attitude [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
       Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4)].
       3.10.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal
       fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast.
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3. F-16 and AFI 11-214).
 20                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   3.11.1. A G-Ex is required if planned maneuvering will exceed 5g. Accomplish the G-Ex
   day or night, only in VMC, with a discernable horizon, and only when unaided or NVG-
   aided visual cues are adequate to safely perform the maneuver. If these requirements are not
   met, omit the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5g.
   3.11.2. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g. chase of a G-Ex), flight members
   will maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet separation between aircraft during G-Ex execution.
   Use on-board systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior
   to maneuver execution. The G-Ex will consist of at least two 90 degree turns (the second
   turn of the G-Ex for air-to-air sorties will be a minimum of 180 degrees). The first turn will
   be a smooth onset rate to 4-5g. Ensure proper g-suit operation and anti-g straining maneuver.
   Regain airspeed and perform the second turn at 5-7g (or as aircraft limits allow).
   3.11.3. Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is
   clear from potential traffic conflicts. If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace:
      3.11.3.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g. Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
      Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
      exercise/special mission areas).
      3.11.3.2. Above 10,000 MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.11.3.3. Inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
      3.11.3.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
   3.11.4. Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,
   theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be performed. If no such
   guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical extent.
   3.11.5. Film the G-Ex in HUD and in Hot Mic. Fly the tactical portion of all basic missions
   (BFM, BSA, ACM, etc) in Hot Mic to enable assessment of the AGSM.
3.12. Tactical Formations.
   3.12.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight
   lead/lead element and they must maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for
   deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when required. At low
   altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will
   maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is
   on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between
   elements. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction, but the
   flight/element lead becomes primarily responsible when:
      3.12.1.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
      forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingman becomes
      engaged fighter).
      3.12.1.2. The wingman calls "padlocked."
      3.12.1.3. The wingman calls ―blind. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back
      to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
   3.12.2. Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        21


       3.12.2.1. Flight members will call blind with an altitude to the hundreds of feet, i.e.
       ―Blind 16.9‖. The visual flight member will respond with ―visual‖ and talk eyes on.
       3.12.2.2. If the other flight member is also ―Blind,‖ they will call blind with an altitude.
       Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the
       wingman’s flow direction. Use a minimum of 500 ft (1,000 above 5,000 ft AGL) altitude
       separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude. All flight members
       must visually clear their flight path.
       3.12.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the
       flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
       position of the other flight member/element and climb/descend if necessary. If visual
       contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to ensure
       flight path deconfliction. Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or
       adversary blocks must be considered.
   3.12.3. Sensor formations. If SA is lost or ―Blind‖ in a sensor formation, call ―Blind‖ with
   altitude and follow the above procedures. Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude stack
   at all times in sensor formation.
3.13. Chase Formation.
   3.13.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners
   (FEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Qualified pilots, including Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery,
   etc) and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Aircrew Training, may be chased
   by Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by
   group/squadron commanders.
   3.13.2. Procedures.
       3.13.2.1. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In-
       flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-tail
       separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In
       the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
       3.13.2.2. A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail
       clearance out to a range of 1 NM, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide
       assistance.
       3.13.2.3. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for ensuring frag
       deconfliction is maintained for his aircraft.
3.14. Show Formation. Such formations will be specifically briefed and flown IAW applicable
directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events, and applicable
MAJCOM or ANG directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in
static displays and aerial events.
3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1. F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16).
22                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


  3.15.1. Airspeed and Altitude. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300
  KIAS and the minimum altitude is 500 ft AGL (or IAW approved step-down training). For
  night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is the MSA (see AFI 11-202V3) unless
  operating under TFR procedures or NVG Procedures.
  3.15.2. At low altitude, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted attention, knock-
  it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL).
     3.15.2.1. For F-16s equipped with GCAS ―PULLUP‖ command capability, when a
     PULLUP-PULLUP‖ warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to ensure
     terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments.
     3.15.2.2. F-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings
     will set an altitude that does not result in ―PULL-UP‖ warnings at normal operational
     altitudes. Minimum MTC is 50 feet for strafe and visual bombing, and 125 feet for all
     other operations. Wings with significant tall trees in the operating area or VR routes will
     account for average tree height when setting MTC altitudes.
  3.15.3. Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. For low altitude
  training outside the CONUS, comply with theater/host nation guidance.
     3.15.3.1. Deteriorating weather on a VR Route.
         3.15.3.1.1. Able to maintain VMC. If it becomes apparent that weather ahead will
         not permit continued flight on the VR, maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit
         the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude.
         3.15.3.1.2. Unable to maintain VMC. Climb to briefed deconfliction altitudes
         (reference Chapter 2). Squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a
         controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if required. Maintain preplanned
         ground track.
  3.15.4. Obstacle/terrain Avoidance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
  separation from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight
  leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that
  ensures vertical separation.
  3.15.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
  than lead.
  3.15.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not
  exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright bunting
  maneuvers.
  3.15.7. TFR Operations during the Day. In order to train for TFR at night, comply with
  applicable portions of Section 3E Night. Vision Restriction Devices (VRD) will only be
  worn while conducting daytime TFR training. When a VRD is in use, a safety observer must
  be present. A safety observer is defined as a crewmember qualified in that aircraft in the rear
  cockpit of a two-place aircraft or another aircraft flying in the chase position. The chase
  aircraft must maintain continuous visual contact and have two-way radio communication
  between aircraft. During training with a VRD, pilots are cleared to fly no lower than they are
  certified to fly during night TFR.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       23


Section 3D—-Recovery and Landing

3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, call gear down no later than 3 mile final. For an
instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), call gear down at the final approach fix or published
glide slope intercept point. For an overhead, call gear down departing the perch. For a SFO or
FO, call gear down at base key.
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach will normally be flown at 11 degrees AOA.
Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA.
3.18. Landing restrictions. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the
available runway, land at an alternate if possible. When the RCR at the base of intended landing
is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g.,
MA-1A, 61QS11).
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.
   3.19.1. The desired touchdown point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a
   VFR approach is the threshold. The aim point for a precision approach is the glide path
   interception point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, touch down either past a
   raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. With centerline stores, touchdown
   will normally be past an approach-end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to
   the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or an
   aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. Single-ship or
   formation landings with centerline stores may be made across BAK-12 arrestment cables
   which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system.
   3.19.2. Touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 degree approach will be a
   minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and
   speedbrake/tail scrapes. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft
   is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g. F-16 following F-16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar fighter
   aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-15) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base,
   whichever is higher. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing
   with a light tail wind, spacing should be increased.
   3.19.3. All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when
   speed/conditions permit.
3.20. Low Approaches.
   3.20.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.20.1.1. IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.2. Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.3. Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.20.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
 24                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


3.21. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Do not fly
them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unless the OG/CC determines that local conditions (e.g.
threat condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, do not fly overhead patterns with
unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33).
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted if the following conditions are met:
   3.23.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
   3.23.2. Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate
   air traffic control agencies.
   3.23.3. The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000
   feet in trail will be considered a separate flight).
   3.23.4. No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid
   requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind).
   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. An element low
approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on
downwind at 200-250 KIAS.
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.25.1. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front
   cockpit.
   3.25.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take
   control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary.
3.26. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.26.1. Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. Consider symmetrical as those stores
   loadings which do not require an abnormal trim or control application to counter a heavy
   wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed.
   3.26.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.26.3. Use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. Fly a published precision
   instrument approach if one is available. If not, fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight
   in and reference available lighting systems (e.g. VASI, PAPI) for descent angle.
   3.26.4. If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side.
   3.26.5. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing. If the
   wingman overruns lead after landing, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side of
   the runway and wingtip clearance. Do not attempt to reposition behind lead.
   3.26.6. Do not make formation landings when:
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       25


       3.26.6.1. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.26.6.2. The runway is reported wet; or ice, slush or snow is on the runway.
       3.26.6.3. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.26.6.4. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach
       end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations).
       3.26.6.5. Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs.
       3.26.6.6. The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 miles visibility (or a flight
       member's weather category, whichever is higher). This applies to chased approaches and
       formation low approaches.

Section 3E—Night (see also night sections of Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)

3.27. General Night Procedures.
   3.27.1. Night Ground Operations. The anti-collision (strobe) light may be OFF and the
   position lights STEADY if they prove to be a distraction. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of
   300 feet and on the taxiway centerline. The taxi light will normally be used during all night
   taxiing. EXCEPTION: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an
   aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
   visually cleared without the taxi light.
   3.27.2. Night Takeoff. Aircraft will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights
   FLASH for takeoffs, unless IMC will be encountered shortly after takeoff. EXCEPTION:
   For formation takeoffs, flight/element leads will turn the anti-collision light OFF and position
   lights STEADY after reaching the run-up position on the runway. During a night formation
   takeoff, brake release, gear retraction and AB termination will be called on the radio.
   Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL
   before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.27.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is 3,000 foot
   ceiling and 5 miles visibility. After join-up, the anti-collision light will be OFF and position
   lights will be STEADY for all except the last aircraft, which will keep the anti-collision light
   ON and position lights FLASH unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   3.27.4. Position/Lead Changes. Unless operating with NVGs and/or TFR, do not change
   lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. Call such changes
   over the radio and initiate them from a stabilized, wings-level attitude whenever possible.
   3.27.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a night formation break-up, the flight lead will confirm
   position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
   acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids.
   3.27.6. Night Landing. Land from the most precise approach available. Night formation
   landings will only be performed when required for safe recovery of the aircraft.
3.28. Operating with both Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Terrain Following Radar
(TFR). When both NVG and TFR are in use, pilots may rely on one system or the other as
required in order to safely operate down to the applicable minimum altitudes. For example, with
 26                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


a failed Nav FLIR but an operative TFR component of the Navigation Pod, pilots may choose to
substitute NVG (if all requirements/minimum altitudes in para. 3.29 are met) for Nav FLIR.
3.29. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
   3.29.1. NVG Preflight. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted/focused for the
   individual pilot using (in order of preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye
   lane, or equivalent. Reference AFI 11-301, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, 25
   Feb 2009.
   3.29.2. Cockpit Lighting. Fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting
   MAJCOM designates as NVG compatible. MAJCOMs will only make such a designation if
   all control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated by the NVG-compatible
   lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event they need to
   transition to instruments.
   3.29.3. Weather/Visibility/Illumination Levels/Minimum Altitudes. Reference AFI 11-
   214 and AFI 11-202V3. Cease NVG operations anytime environmental conditions degrade
   NVG performance such that briefed formation positions cannot be flown.
   3.29.4. NVG Qualifications. Do not wear NVGs in flight unless the pilot is NVG qualified
   or there is a qualified NVG IP in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non-NVG qualified
   pilot). F-16B/D Familiarization flights are authorized if appropriate academics are
   accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat.
   3.29.5. Radio Calls. All flight members will make a radio call when going ―NVGs on‖ or
   ―NVGs raised/stowed.‖
   3.29.6. Obstacle/Intra-Flight Deconfliction. When flying in route formation, only one
   flight member per element will don/doff goggles at a time. Flight leads will call turns if
   forced to maneuver while flight members are donning/doffing NVGs.
   3.29.7. Takeoffs/Landings. NVGs will be stowed or raised during takeoff until at or above
   2000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. Stow or raise NVGs no later
   than 5 minutes prior to landing unless NVGs are required to handle an emergency.
   3.29.8. NVG Use during Air to Air Refueling (AAR). Stow or raise stow NVGs no later
   than the stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect.
3.30. Terrain Following Radar (TFR) Operations at Night.
   3.30.1. Minimum Altitude, Weather and Airspeed. The minimum altitude for TFR
   training will be the higher of VR/IR/MOA minimum altitude or pilot minimum altitude as
   certified by the unit commander IAW AFI 11-2F16V1. The minimum weather for TFR on
   an IR/VR route will be as per FLIP. Minimum airspeed for TFR navigation is 400 KCAS.
   3.30.2. INS Alignment. Do not conduct TFR operations unless the ground alignment was
   either full performance or an extended interrupted alignment with a flashing RDY/ALIGN
   (status 10).
   3.30.3. TFR Checks/Radio Calls. Verify proper operation of all technical-order-required
   systems before operating at low altitude. To the maximum extent possible, do so above
   10,000 feet MSL or within special use airspace. Set the CARA ALOW feature at 90 percent
   of the set clearance plane (SCP) or 90 percent of the command-directed minimum altitude,
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                      27


   whichever is higher. Pilots may place CARA to standby or off only during air refueling
   operations. All pilots will confirm TFR and radar altimeter are on and working properly
   before descending below the MSA by calling "(Call Sign), RALT ON, TFR ON." Check
   CARA for proper operation when descending through 4,500 feet AGL. During descent,
   pilots will accomplish a 1,000 foot SCP level off prior to selecting a lower SCP.

Section 3F—Other

3.31. Targeting Pod Operations. Do not use the TGP for anything other than navigational SA
below 1000’ AGL (e.g. VID or aircraft, designation for weapons deliver).
3.32. Radio Procedures. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign (except
for wingman acknowledgment). Transmit only that information essential for mission
accomplishment or safety of flight.
   3.32.1. Radio Checks. Acknowledge radio checks, which do not require the transmission of
   specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:               "2, 3, 4").
   Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of
   being completed or is understood by the flight member.
   3.32.2. Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding
   the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions
   when directed by the flight lead.
   3.32.3. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-
   1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations.
   3.32.4. Ops Checks.
       3.32.4.1. Monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an out of
       balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency should be increased during tactical
       maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are required:
          3.32.4.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
          3.32.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty.
          3.32.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
          3.32.4.1.4. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if
          multiple passes are made and after departing the range.
       3.32.4.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
       quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system and cabin altitude. If the G-suit
       malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all ACBT maneuvering until normal
       operation is reestablished.
       3.32.4.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or
       visual signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal.
          3.32.4.3.1. During Ops checks, ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is returned to
          the NORM position. Totalizer-only Ops checks may be used periodically during high
          demand phases of flight.
 28                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


           3.32.4.3.2. For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are carried, each flight
           member will check the external tank(s) and add ―Tank(s) feeding/dry‖ to the Ops
           Check. Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be omitted
           from subsequent ops checks.
           3.32.4.3.3. Do not substitute data-linked fuel status for operations checks.
3.33. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential
for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference.
3.34. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of an F-16B/D must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement "You have the
aircraft." The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft." Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
EXCEPTION: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the
aircraft) will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational
equipment unless briefed otherwise.
3.35. Fuel Requirements.
   3.35.1. Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.35.2. Bingo Fuel. A briefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.35.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended
   landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is established
   locally or:
       3.35.3.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 1,000 pounds.
       3.35.3.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,200 pounds.
   3.35.4. Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that
   an aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended
   landing or alternate, if required, with:
       3.35.4.1. Minimum Fuel:
           3.35.4.1.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 800 pounds or less.
           3.35.4.1.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,000 pounds or less.
       3.35.4.2. Emergency Fuel:
           3.35.4.2.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 600 pounds or less.
           3.35.4.2.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 800 pounds or less.
   3.35.5. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established
   bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
3.36. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          29


   3.36.1. If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.),
   turn them on for all flights. Set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. (AFRC)
   GCAS will be enabled with a minimum altitude setting is 200 feet for day operations and 700
   feet for night operations; pilots will ensure that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff.
   3.36.2. Non-TFR Operations. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter at the briefed
   minimum altitude or the command-directed minimum altitude, whichever is higher.
3.37. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Do not conduct training missions when surface winds
along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state. Do not conduct over water
training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the sea state exceeds
10 feet (or 4 meters-USAFE). This is not intended to restrict operations when only a small
portion of the route is affected. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
3.38. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). To reduce
adverse affects on ATC radars, attempt to limit Mode IV interrogations while pointing towards
areas of known high density civilian traffic. Outside operational training airspace, maximize use
of Spot from STT or TWS versus Scan and CRM.

                                            Chapter 4

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Head-Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block or OFP, do not use the HUD to
   recover from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when
   no other reference is available. The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/50
   aircraft with Operational Flight Program (OFP) 40T5/50T4 (TV Code 117/115) and later
   OFPs may be used as a primary flight reference in night/IMC conditions. The HUD in all
   other F-16 Blocks and OFPs may be used as an additional instrument reference, but not the
   sole reference, in night/IMC conditions.
   4.1.2. INS/GPS or EGI Use. The F-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV). Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
   observer in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. The observer may occupy either seat of the F-
   16B/D provided the intercom is operable. Use the radar to aid in clearing the area. Pilots in
   F-16A/C aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase. They may fly
   multiple approaches in VMC without a chase, but will place their primary emphasis on
   seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Chase aircraft may move into close formation on final for
   a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated.
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join-up.
   4.2.1. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 miles (5 km), each aircraft and element
   will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when
   departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and will
   not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
   airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
   attempts to maintain radar contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument
   procedure, then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will notify ATC.
       4.3.1.1. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.
       4.3.1.2. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
       4.3.1.3. Normal spacing is 2-3 NM.
       4.3.1.4. Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
       aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact and called "tied."
   4.3.2. No Radar Contact.
       4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
       turns to maintain the desired spacing.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        31


     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to
     meet the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, except
     to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS (or as required by local procedures). Upon reaching this speed, the flight leader
     will set a pre-briefed power setting. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise Mach/TAS,
     unless otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Make all turns using 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. En Route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at home station, deployed locations, and
     locally designated primary divert bases. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and
     local operating procedures must address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum,
     procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and
     maximum spacing requirements, lost contact and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
 32                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
       spacing.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure
       that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar.
       4.3.6.7. Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.
       4.3.6.8. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
       4.3.6.9. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
       4.3.6.10. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
       4.3.6.11. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
       4.3.6.12. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
       configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
       all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.13. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.14. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "Callsign
       (C/S) lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
       heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If
       contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
       may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
       cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by ATC.
       4.3.6.15. Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail
       recovery will terminate in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveilance
       Radar (ASR) approach.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will
confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or
appropriate GPS/INS waypoint).
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                    33


   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation
approach with an F-16 experiencing an Emergency.
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen, ICAO)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1.
   4.7.2. The F-16 is Approach Category E. Use approach Category D minimums at an
   emergency or divert airfield where no Category E minimums are published, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less.
      4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed
      (KTAS) or less. At high density altitudes 260 KTAS may require a KIAS below the
      speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and Category D approaches shall not be flown.

                       AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment.
   5.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW
   T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master
   Arm switch position.
   5.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   ―ARM‖ or SMS/MFD symbology reads ―RDY,‖ do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
   5.3.1. Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited.
   5.3.2. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering is 350
   KIAS.
   5.3.3. All configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering as defined by AFI 11-
   214. Before conducting unlimited maneuvering in a CAT III configured aircraft, consider
   gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements.
   5.3.4. (AFRC Only) F-16D aircraft with centerline stores are prohibited from utilizing the
   Unlimited maneuvering category, as defined by AFI 11-214.

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

Section 6A—-General

6.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
6.2. Simulated Gun Employment.
   6.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm
   switch in SIM) with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never
   perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master Arm switch position.
   6.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   ―ARM‖ or SMS/MFD symbology reads ―RDY,‖ do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
6.3. Training Missions with a Hot Gun.
   6.3.1. Pilots will not select strafe submode until immediately prior to roll in and will deselect
   strafe submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver.
   6.3.2. When firing the laser, ensure you are in a mode that will not allow the gun to fire.
6.4. Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets. Do not conduct such attacks
with hung ordnance. Do not conduct them with live ordnance, except for 20 mm ammunition
with a safe gun. When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g. bombs, external fuel
tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load simulated weapons (zero quantity) in the SMS/MFD only
on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations (EXCEPTION: Captive Maverick and HARM
missiles may be selected). Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the
first attack. Flight lead will query and flight members will reply to a ―check zero quantity,
uncarted station‖ radio call.
6.5. Weather. In training, do not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling below
2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL.
6.6. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS
above 10,000 feet AGL).
6.7. Target Identification. Pilots shall positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with ROE. For training sorties, achieve positive
identification by either visually acquiring the target or by confirming target location through
valid on-board/off-board cues. Cues may include, but are not limited to, radar, GPS, marking
rounds, IR Maverick lock on, IR pointers or NVG-compatible marking devices. Exercise caution
when relying on a single cue to confirm target location.
6.8. Safety of Ground Personnel. When ground controllers are present on Class B/C ranges,
range personnel will brief pilots on locations of these personnel and each pilot will acknowledge.
Pilots must know applicable range weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and

weapons footprints. Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground
personnel or intended target locations.

Section 6B—-Night

6.9. Altitude. Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the IFR Off Airways
guidance in AFI 11-202V3 chapter 8. The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS)
is the Target MSA (as defined in Attachment 1) unless executed by an NVG-low qualified pilot
(as defined in AFI 11-2F-16 Vol 1) under high-illumination conditions (as defined in AFI 11-
214).
6.10. Bank Angle. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
structure (<5K AGL)
6.11. TFR. If ingressing under TFR protection to a climbing delivery that will result in the need
to exceed TFR roll limits, cease manipulating the targeting pod no later than pull up initiation.
Focus on maintaining aircraft control. Do not resume manipulation of the targeting pod until
either above the MSA or back within TFR protection.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       37


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective
   actions have been accomplished.
   7.1.2. Do not fly an aircraft with a tripped engine monitoring system (EMS) Go-No-Go
   indicator (Bit Ball) until maintenance has accomplished the appropriate procedures and
   cleared the fault.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel steering system, the brake
   system, or a generator [NOTE: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator
   failure (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally].
   7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground or in-flight
   trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete.
   7.1.5. In the F-16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been
   accomplished and will provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.
   7.1.6. For actual/perceived flight control malfunctions, pilots will terminate maneuvering
   and take appropriate action. If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder
   interference, the pilot will take positive action to ensure no further control interference
   occurs.
   7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds dash one limits, terminate tactical maneuvering and
   investigate. If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank and
   can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW dash one guidance. If not, terminate the
   mission. Instruments, deployment missions, level weapons deliveries and straight-through-
   non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until a safe landing is
   possible.
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). CAPs are in ATTACHMENT 4.
7.3. Ground Aborts.
   7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead will normally renumber the
   flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate
   agencies of such changes.
   7.3.2. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight in accordance with the
   brief or flight lead instructions. If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range,
   all events will be terminated until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
7.4. Takeoff Aborts.
 38                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   7.4.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, say call sign and intentions when practical.
   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort takeoff if adequate
   clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" will be used to indicate a
   departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" will be used to
   indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will address net barrier raising
   procedures.
   7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KIAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, declare a
   ground emergency. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake
   procedures.
   7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 knots, lower the hook. If aborting below 100 knots, lower
   the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway.
7.5. Air Aborts.
   7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for
   the aborting aircraft is required..
   7.5.3. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
      7.5.3.1. Bird strike
      7.5.3.2. Actual or suspected foreign object damage.
      7.5.3.3. Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance.
      7.5.3.4. Moderate to severe icing.
      7.5.3.5. Over-G (NOTE: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach).
      7.5.3.6. Flight control system anomalies, including uncommanded departures from
      controlled flight (EXCEPTION: intentional departures from controlled flight conducted
      IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that
      reset IAW flight manual procedures.
      7.5.3.7. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown.
7.6. Radio Failure (NORDO). Reference AFI 11-205 and the Flight Information Handbook.
   7.6.1. NORDO in Formation.
      7.6.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
      maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member
      and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as soon as
      practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A
      formation approach to a drop-off on final should be performed unless safety
      considerations dictate otherwise.
      7.6.1.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
      aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                      39


     flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
     other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
     clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
     signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
     If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
     the base of intended landing or a divert base.               Aircraft experiencing any
     difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
  7.6.2. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range.
     7.6.2.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up
     radio.
     7.6.2.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower on the
     attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight lead
     will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base or rejoin the
     flight and RTB.
     7.6.2.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to
     join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.6.3. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range.
     7.6.3.1. Make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while
     rocking wings. The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO
     aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. If the NORDO
     aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass on the target maintaining
     normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic and proceed to a
     recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the
     emergency aircraft.
     7.6.3.2. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude
     landing with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished
     provided the following conditions are met:
     7.6.3.3. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with
     the RCO and the remainder of the flight.
     7.6.3.4. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
     aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.6.4. NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing.
     7.6.4.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
     7.6.4.2. If radio failure occurs, safe the armament switches, join on another member of
     the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.1
     7.6.4.3. Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and
     continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will
     join on the tow's wing. Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
     will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight lead will signal when
 40                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


       the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the banner is
       away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he will take the lead,
       RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the NORDO and establish the
       appropriate landing pattern. If cable remains, follow local procedures.
   7.6.5. NORDO during Recovery.
       7.6.5.1. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.5.2. To signal the need for an approach-end arrestment, lower the tailhook (visual
       formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted).
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots. Although
SD is most common at night or in IMC, it can and has happened in day VMC. Reference
AFMAN 11-217V1 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its
consequences.
7.9. Lost Wingman.
   7.9.1. Priorities. The first priority is to establish safe separation from other aircraft (e.g.
   tanker or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance
   and clearance from other traffic.
   7.9.2. Prohibitions. Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC
   conditions.
   7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to instruments and inform lead while
   executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3-3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will
   acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. Once lost
   wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the
   flight lead.
   7.9.4. Two- or Three-Ship Flights. (NOTE: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost
   wingman procedures.)
       7.9.4.1. Wings-Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously
       inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume
       heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15
       seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
       resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
       inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
       separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when
       separation is ensured.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                      41


      7.9.4.4. Precision/Non-precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
      ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
      while obtaining a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.5. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
      clearance, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
      procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
      clearance.
   7.9.5. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative
   that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will
   follow the appropriate procedure listed below:
      7.9.5.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30
      degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
      seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate
      clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.10.1. General. Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a
   known malfunction. If abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight occurs, have the
   launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage
   has occurred.
   7.10.2. Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and
   impact point, if known, and provide the information to debrief personnel. Check switches
   safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining stores as hung and
   obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard,
   jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.3. Hung Freefall Ordnance or Missile Hangfire/Misfire. First confirm
   switches/Option Select Button (OSB) settings were correct. If they were, record all relevant
   switch/OSB settings and proceed as follows.
      7.10.3.1. Hung Live Freefall Ordnance. Attempt delivery using an alternate delivery
      mode, if applicable. If unsuccessful, use selective jettison procedures for the store. If
      unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be
      determined, consider selective jettison of the rack.
      7.10.3.2. Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance. Make an additional attempt to
      expend. If unsuccessful, select an alternate delivery mode and try again. If unsuccessful,
      ordnance from other stations/dispensers may be released provided this does not violate
      load symmetry limits. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable
      area on a single pass, if practical.
 42                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


       7.10.3.3. Maverick Missile Hangfire. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft
       is a hangfire. If able, have a chase pilot inspect such a missile.
       7.10.3.4. Maverick Missile Misfire. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate
       switches were selected is a misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch. If able,
       have a chase pilot inspect the missile for smoke or fire. If either exists, jettison the
       missile on the range. If not, pilots may attempt another pass. If the second attempt fails
       and conditions permit, remain dry in the pattern for 15 minutes, then proceed to the
       recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures.
       7.10.3.5. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures. Visually
       inspect the aircraft for damage, if practical. Declare an emergency (not required for hung
       practice/inert ordnance or for live unexpended ordnance). Obtain a chase aircraft, if
       available. Avoid populated areas and trail formations. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3. A simulated
emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the actual
emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance
of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.11.1. Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. Instead, use the flight
   simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference. Do
   not practice in-flight engine shutdown. Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is
   available and either an active tower or a ROM (or equivalent, e.g. SOF) is in operation. Do
   not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC.
   7.11.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. OG/CCs will establish
   specific procedures for SFO training and establish letters of agreement with appropriate
   agencies. They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume. General
   SFO procedures follow:
       7.11.2.1. The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
       the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
       complete the approach.
       7.11.2.2. Do not initiate or continue an SFO if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists
       that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with
       traffic. Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a
       result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. Discontinue an SFO if unable to
       obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. Discontinue an SFO if airspeed drops
       below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the
       flare. Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and
       do not attempt to resume the SFO.
       7.11.2.3. Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g. AFMC high
       angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO.
       7.11.2.4. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call
          7.11.2.4.1. "High Key"
          7.11.2.4.2. "Low Key"
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        43


           7.11.2.4.3. "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)"
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the
unit supplement to this volume. General procedures are:
   7.12.1. Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation.
   7.12.2. Talk. Establish an On Scene Commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency
   situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency
   if necessary.
   7.12.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means
   available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or
   TGP. Pass this information to follow-on SAR forces.
   7.12.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of
   all possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow
   approximately 1 minute per thousand feet (16 feet per second) for parachute descent. The
   OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR.
   7.12.5. Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to
   maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Do not overfly bingo. Relinquish OSC
   duties to more qualified rescue forces (e.g. SANDY 1, US Coast Guard) upon their arrival.
7.13. Abnormal Operation of TFR or NAV FLIR. Honor all fly ups and allow automatic fly
ups to develop. If aural or visual pull-up warnings occur but the system does not initiate an
automatic fly up, initiate a manual one. Fly up procedures follow:
   7.13.1. Allow the system to raise the nose to the appropriate angle or do so manually
   (NOTE: using climb angles greater than 20 degrees can result in rapid airspeed bleed off and
   increased susceptibility to SD).
   7.13.2. Throttle - As required to preserve airspeed. Do not hesitate to use AB.
   7.13.3. When terrain clearance ensured, Paddle Switch - Depress and release (NOTE:
   continuing to hold the paddle switch depressed inhibits fly-up commands to the FLCS).
   7.13.4. If the system does not reset:
   7.13.5. Continue climb until at or above MSA.
   7.13.6. Level off and refer to checklist (if required).
   7.13.7. If the malfunction clears, pilots may resume TFR.
7.14. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures. Do not shut down the engine unless
fire/other conditions dictate or directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. Raise the tailhook on
the signal from the arresting crew. Do not taxi until directed to do so by the arresting gear crew.

                                  Chapter 8 (Added-482FW)

                           LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 8A (482FW)—Indtruction

8.1. (Added-482FW) Responsibility. The 482d Operations Group Commander (482 OG/CC)
and the 93d Fighter Squadron Commander (93 FS/CC) will ensure compliance with the
provisions of AFI 11-2F-16V3, and this chapter. This chapter applies to both local and off-
station sorties flown in 482 FW aircraft and is incomplete without the Mako Pilot Aid and the
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) standards. Unless stated otherwise in this supplement or
basic AFI as supplemented by Air Combat Command (ACC)/AFRC, the 482 OG/CC is the
waiver authority to these local procedures. Weather conditions, abnormal circumstances or
emergencies may require modification of these procedures in the interest of safety. Report any
deviations from these procedures to the 482 OG/CC through the 93rd Fighter Squadron/Director
of Operations (93 FS/DO) or representative.

Section 8B (482FW)—General Policy

8.2. (482FW) Command and Control.
   8.2.1. (Added-482FW) The 482 OG/CC exercises control over all local and deployed
   flying operations through the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the 93 FS Operations
   Supervisor (Ops Sup). The SOF will be readily available during periods of local flying from
   15 minutes prior to the first brief through engine shut down of the last aircraft. The SOF will
   reference the SOF Checklist, located at the Operations Desk. The SOF, call-sign ―Mr.
   MAKO,‖ will monitor UHF and VHF CH-1 (―MAKO Ops‖) and Maintenance Net (2) on the
   FM Brick. The SOF relays pertinent information such as changes in weather, airfield status,
   recall/divert instructions, and Conference Hotel advisories. During emergencies, pilots will
   contact the SOF for assistance when conditions permit. Pilots will also notify the SOF and/or
   the Ops Sup when aircraft problems, delays, aborts, or other factors might affect missions.
   8.2.2. (Added-482FW) The 93 FS will schedule an Operations Supervisor during all local
   flying operations as defined in AFI 11-418_482 FW Sup 1, Operations Supervision. The
   Ops Sup will be in the squadron 30 minutes prior to the first brief. The Ops Sup will be
   immediately available to respond to any current operation issues requiring time-sensitive
   decisions. Off-station itinerary changes will be coordinated with the 482 OG/CC through the
   Ops Sup during normal duty hours. During non-duty hours, coordinate changes with the 482
   OG/CC through the 482d Fighter Wing Command Post (482 FW/CP).
       8.2.2.1. (Added-482FW) The Ops Sup will reference the Ops Sup checklist, as defined
       in AFI 11-418_482 FW Sup 1, Operations Supervision, located at the Operations Desk,
       and will coordinate scheduled aircraft configurations with flight leads, as required, prior
       to brief time. The Ops Sup must make every effort to coordinate pilot ready jets one hour
       prior to scheduled/coordinated takeoff times.
   8.2.3. (Added-482FW) GO/NO-GO Program. Prior to the flight briefing, pilots will check
   their status (shown on PEX GO/NO-GO Program), and flight leads will confirm the status of
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                           47


   all flight members. The SOF/Ops Sup has primary responsibility for ensuring that no pilot
   flies "in the red." The Operations Desk will not issue a tail number to any pilot "in the red."
   The flight lead will ensure that no pilot in his flight steps "in the red." The GO/NO- GO
   Program depends on a multi-level review of each pilot’s status to preclude flying “in the
   red.” For complete GO/NO-GO details, reference the 482 FW supplement to AFI 11-
   202V2_ACC SUP 1.
   8.2.4. (Added-482FW) Individual Survival Equipment. Flight leads will determine the
   requirement for wear of survival vests during the ORM/risk analysis portion of mission
   planning. Guidance on the wearing of the survival vest can be found on the "482 FW Viper
   ORM sheet", maintained by squadron Operations Support and completed prior to every
   sortie.
8.3. (Added-482FW) Unit Standards. Unit administrative and tactical flying standards are
published separately in the 10th Air Force (10 AF) F-16 Standards. All 482 FW pilots are
responsible for knowing these standards.
8.4. (Added-482FW) Pilot Qualifications. The 93 FS/CC and 93 FS/DO are designated as the
signature authority for the 93 FS Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs). As a minimum, the
Certification Letter lists Pilot Weather Category Minimums plus certification for Instructor,
Evaluator, Flight Lead and FCF pilots. All squadron assigned and attached pilots will be on this
letter. All pilots not on the letter will fill out the ―Visiting Pilot‖ Checklist, maintained at the 93
FS Operations Desk, prior to flying. The Letter of Certification is published by 93d Fighter
Squadron/Training (93 FS/DOT in coordination with 482d Operations Group /Standardization
Evaluation (482 OG/OGV).
8.5. (482FW) Flight Briefings/Debriefings.
   8.5.1. (Added-482FW) Report time for flight members is a minimum of fifteen minutes
   prior to brief time. Report time is considered signature on the local sign-out sheet with all
   appropriate information completed. All flight briefs should begin 1+45 hours prior to
   takeoff, but no later than 1+30 hours prior to takeoff. Briefs can be posted earlier if required
   by the flight lead. If sign-out has not occurred, the Operations Supervisor will find a
   replacement or OPS cancel that line. All administrative functions will be accomplished prior
   to the briefing (i.e., CAPs, FCIF, SEPT, ORM) as indicated in the GO/NO-GO program.
   8.5.2. (Added-482FW) All flight members, including rear-cockpit occupants, will attend
   the briefing. Unless operational constraints preclude, the 93 FS Intel shop will brief the
   Threat of the Day. The flight lead will brief flight members on the planned and alternate
   mission using the appropriate briefing guide, Wedge Briefing System, and/or visual aids.
   Flight leads will complete the mission briefing in sufficient time to allow element briefings
   and a thorough aircraft preflight.
   8.5.3. (Added-482FW) Private communication and electronic media devices are prohibited
   in all briefings conducted in the 93 FS.
   8.5.4. (Added-482FW) 482 FW pilots will use and assess the Digital Video Recordings
   (DVRs) during tactical portions of all missions.
8.6. (482FW) Approved Alternate Missions.
 48                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   8.6.1. (Added-482FW) Alternate Missions. If the primary mission cannot be accomplished
   (WX, ATC delay, MX, etc.), flights are authorized to conduct alternate missions as briefed.
   The alternate mission will be less complex than the primary.
   8.6.2. (Added-482FW) The Ops Sup will be pre-briefed and will approve single-ship
   operations and any fallout situations that occur prior to takeoff, and will notify the SOF.
8.7. (Added-482FW) Flight Planning/Clearance. Flight leads will ensure the correct stereo
flight plan is loaded into PEX for their mission. Notify the Ops Sup or Operations desk
personnel if it is incorrect. Stereo Flight Plan descriptions are located in the MAKO Pilot Aid.
File a DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, through Base Operations when Stereo Flight Plans are
not appropriate for the mission.
8.8. (482FW) Operational Risk Management.
   8.8.1. (Added-482FW) The 93FS will use the ―482d FW Viper ORM Sheet,‖ a local
   derivative of the ―AFRC Viper ORM Sheet,‖ to determine the risk level of each mission.
   Flight leads will complete an ORM sheet prior to each training mission and, if required,
   obtain Ops Sup or OG/CC approval for high-risk missions.
   8.8.2. (Added-482FW) The 93FS will attempt to schedule XC/PDM/deployment missions
   over water as a 2-ship minimum based on operational and maintenance requirements. The
   OG/CC will approve exceptions as required during the weekly OG/CC-MXG/CC scheduling
   meeting where the schedule is reviewed.
8.9. (482FW) Fuel Requirements and Bingo Fuels.
   8.9.1. (Added-482FW) Flight leads will plan all missions to comply with the fuel
   requirements of AFI 11-2F-16V3. Recommended Minimum Bingo fuels for the local area
   are listed in the MAKO Pilot Aid.
       8.9.1.1. (Added-482FW) If the HST weather does not dictate IFR Bingos IAW 8.9.3.
       and no delays are expected on arrival, all aircraft will be on initial, at the FAF, or on
       GCA final with not less than 1,000 pounds of fuel.
   8.9.2. (Added-482FW) Decision Fuel. This is the amount of fuel required to divert to the
   alternate airfield from the missed approach point and arrive at the FAF/Initial with 1,000
   pounds of fuel. Decision Fuels are in the MAKO Pilot Aid. The SOF will designate a
   primary divert field, when required, based on such variables as weather, fuel states, distance
   and munitions status.
   8.9.3. (Added-482FW) IFR Bingo. The SOF will declare IFR Bingos and designate a
   suitable alternate any time an alternate is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight
   Rules, as supplemented by ACC. The SOF may also declare IFR Bingos, at his discretion,
   for any expected delays in the terminal area such as thunderstorms or in-flight emergencies.
   All aircraft will be on initial or at the FAF with not less than decision fuel for the primary
   alternate airfield. Local weather permitting, the SOF may allow aircraft to remain in the
   traffic pattern until reaching decision fuel for MIA if the ceiling and visibility there are at
   least 500 feet above the lowest compatible approach and 2 statute miles.
8.10. (482FW) Divert Instructions.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       49


   8.10.1. (Added-482FW) The 93 FS/SOF issues recall/divert instructions through
   controlling agencies, contacting the flight on their inter-flight VHF and, if necessary, on
   Guard. Flight leads, if able, acknowledge recall/divert instructions by contacting the SOF
   and relaying fuel status.
   8.10.2. (Added-482FW) Divert/Recall. Divert data is contained in the Pilot Aid. If
   directed to divert and fuel remaining is above decision fuel, request an IFR clearance and
   proceed to the alternate airfield as cleared by ATC. If divert is necessary when at or less than
   decision fuel, declare minimum or emergency fuel (as appropriate) to the controlling agency,
   request an IFR clearance to the cruise altitude recommended in AF Technical Order (T.O.)
   1F-16C-1CL-1, Flight Crew Checklist, and proceed to the closest alternate airfield. After
   landing, notify the 93 FS Ops Sup and 482 FW Command Post and advise if any munitions,
   maintenance and/or security assistance is required. Diverting pilots will ensure that proper
   security of the aircraft is maintained at all times. The following bases are designated for use
   as weather alternates and divert bases for 93 FS training flights: Key West Naval Air Station
   (Primary IFR Divert), MacDill AFB, Patrick AFB and MIA. Because it is a civilian field
   congested with airline traffic and poses significant FOD issues, MIA should only be
   considered as an emergency divert field or used as an IFR alternate during unusual
   circumstances with OG/CC approval.
8.11. (Added-482FW) Cross-Country Procedures. Operation Supervision for the launch and
recovery of Cross-Country flights will be IAW AFI 11-418_482 FW Supplement. All pilots will
ensure the AFRC Mission Identifier (MI) process is complied with and the 482 FW Command
Post is informed of all takeoff and land times. Refer to the MAKO Pilot Aid for expanded
procedures.
   8.11.1. (Added-482FW) Pilots will not plan a stop-over flight at any field that does not
   have the ability to perform the F-16 engine chip detector inspection IAW the JOAP and Chip
   Detector Program, T.O. 1F-16C-6WC-1-11, SEM/EDX Analysis or 10X Magnifying Glass.
      8.11.1.1. (Added-482FW) IAW T.O. 1F-16C-6WC-1-11, the Chip Detector must be
      removed after every flight and sent for SEM/EDX analysis. One flight is permitted
      between lab analysis provided the Chip Detector is checked by authorized MX personnel
      and any debris is within visible limits using a 10X magnifying glass.
8.12. (482FW) Fly By and Static Display.
   8.12.1. (Added-482FW) In addition to AFI 11-209_ACC SUP 1 and AFRC_SUP_1, Aerial
   Event Policy and Procedures, AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses, and any
   other applicable HHQ guidance, all flight leads will brief the OG/CC, or designated group
   level alternate (OG/CD, OSS/CC, 93 FS/CC/DO), on all planned flyby profiles and off
   station static displays. This brief will include the following: spare vs. no-spare game-plan,
   MI status and aircraft security. The MAKO standard flyby profile is a four-ship fingertip
   formation at 300 KIAS and 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within 2,000 feet of the
   flight path. Any deviation beyond this must be approved through the OG/CC and reflected in
   the MI process. For static displays, in all cases where maintenance is not available to safe
   the aircraft, cockpit closed or no public access procedures will be followed (refer to the
   MAKO Pilot Aid for details). Additionally, the 482 FW policy is to not allow the public to
   sit in the cockpit.

   8.12.2. (Added-482FW) The flight lead will brief all flight members on the rules and the
   conduct of the flyby in case the flight lead falls out.
8.13. (482FW) Local Weather/NOTAMs Procedures.
   8.13.1. (Added-482FW) The Homestead Weather Shop will provide local weather via
   current AFI or MAJCOM approved sources. The United States NOTAM Office internet
   (https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov)     or      Defense        Internet NOTAM service
   (https://www.notams.jcs.mil) sites will be used for local NOTAM updates.
   8.13.2. (Added-482FW) The SOF is responsible for ensuring the weather and NOTAMs
   are available prior to the flight briefings. If either are not available, the SOF will call local
   divert bases to obtain weather and airfield status.
   8.13.3. (Added-482FW) Lightning Warning Procedures. The base weather station is
   responsible for the declaration of ―Lightning Watches‖ (30 minutes prior to thunderstorms
   within 5 miles) and ―Lightning Warnings‖ (lightning within 5 miles).
      8.13.3.1. (Added-482FW) Upon declaration or notification of a Lightning Warning,
      maintenance personnel will expeditiously complete the shut-down of any aircraft in the
      chocks. All flight and ground personnel will proceed to shelter in a covered vehicle.
      Any pilots taxiing will contact the SOF for instructions. The SOF, in coordination with
      OPS SUP and Production Supervisor (PRO SUP), will assess the operational risks and
      direct pre-armed or post-flight aircraft to return to the ramp for shut-down or hold in
      EOR. The SOF will be directive with flights in the pattern to land, hold or divert. The
      SOF may direct flights that have completed arming to launch.
      8.13.3.2. (Added-482FW) If the conditions deteriorate after the initial declaration of a
      Lightning Warning, the SOF, OPS SUP or PRO SUP may determine that aircraft cannot
      be safely de-armed or shut down in EOR. The SOF may direct aircraft to taxi back to the
      MAKO Ramp without de-arming. Pilots will not taxi under the sun-shades without
      ground personnel. Aircraft with hot guns will remain in EOR and shutdown in EOR if
      required for fuel considerations. Pilots will contact the SOF before shutting down the
      engine. The SOF will use 600 lbs as a ―decision fuel‖ to shut aircraft down. Without a
      ground crew, pilots will set the parking brake and ensure the EPU is turned off prior to
      executing the engine shut down procedures. Pilots will remain in the aircraft until the
      PRO SUP determines it is safe for personnel to assist in aircraft bed-down.
   8.13.4. (Added-482FW) Hurricane Evacuation (HUREVAC). HUREVAC IAW 482 FW
   Comprehensive Emergency Evacuation Management Plan (CEEMP) 10-2. A copy is
   maintained at the 93 FS Duty Desk.
   8.13.5. (Added-482FW) Hot Weather Procedures. Pilots and supervisors will reference the
   Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS) Chart in AFI11-202V3_ACC Supplement 1, General
   Flight Rules, when determining the operational risks involved with a particular training
   sortie. The Ops Sup or SOF will use AFI or MAJCOM approved weather sources to
   determine the FITS value and will apply that value to the guidelines outlined in the ACC
   Supplement.
   8.13.6. (Added-482FW) High Humidity Conditions. If in ―IMC‖ conditions inside the
   cockpit from condensation on the exterior of the canopy or because of ECS operation and
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                     51


   forced to stop your taxiing due to restricted visibility, ensure a call is made and
   acknowledged on Ground frequency. When conditions become unsafe to taxi due to
   visibility, pilots may raise the canopy to the full up position only (not the partially opened
   position). Before opening the canopy, pilots will double check to secure all items. Taxi
   slowly. Especially important in the D model, as the canopy actuator is under more stress and
   a very hard to find MX item, speeds of 15 knots or less are essential.
Section C Ground Operations.
8.14. (482FW) Airfield Information (Reference Figure 8 1).
   8.14.1. (Added-482FW) Field Elevation: 5 feet. The Mako Ramp elevation is 6 feet.
   8.14.2. (Added-482FW) Runway 05/23 (054º/234º magnetic) is 11,200 feet by 300 feet
   with Precision Approach Path Indicator Lights (PAPIs) on both ends. (Note: the center 150
   feet between the solid white lines are for takeoff/landing.)
   8.14.3. (Added-482FW) Runway 05 is designated as the ―Preferred Runway‖ when the tail
   wind component is less than 10 knots.
   8.14.4. (Added-482FW) The TACAN, Channel 19, is southeast of the runway, 1.1 NM
   from the approach end of Runway 05 and .7 NM from the approach end of Runway 23.
   8.14.5. (Added-482FW) Arresting Equipment. Two BAK-12/14 (bi-directional) cables
   (located 1,650 feet from the Runway 05 threshold and 1,087 feet from the Runway 23
   threshold) provide a full approach-end arrestment capability. Each overrun has an E-5 (tail
   hook capable) cable. During normal operations, the approach-end E-5 is not connected and
   the departure end E-5 is connected and in the raised position. The departure end BAK 12/14
   is normally in the up position, and the approach end BAK 12/14 is normally in the down
   position. The black cable supports (donuts) of the BAK 12/14 can be damaged if they are
   taxied over on landing rollout, and the cable can become slack when crossing it with a high
   taxi speed. Since the entire runway is swept, to prevent donut damage and cable slacking,
   taxi around the raised cable minimizing time outside the solid white runway lines or cross the
   cable at a slow taxi speed and avoid running over the donuts.
   8.14.6. (Added-482FW) Runway Intercept Points. The PAPI Intercept Point is 1,485 feet
   for Runway 05 and 985 feet for Runway 23. The ILS Intercept Point for Runway 05 is 1,245
   feet. An ILS to Runway 23 is not available.

8.15. (482FW) Preflight/Engine Start.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                   53


   8.15.1. (Added-482FW) Pilots will start on back-up radio UHF CH-2(Ground). After
   engine start, pilots will monitor UHF CH-1(MAKO Ops) and the assigned discrete VHF
   frequency.
   8.15.2. (Added-482FW) Pilots will accomplish the SEC then EPU check after engine start
   and prior to applying power to the aircraft avionics.
   8.15.3. (Added-482FW) If maintenance assistance is required, contact MAKO Ops for
   ―Red Ball‖ assistance. If a spare is required, coordinate with the Ops Sup and inform flight
   lead if applicable.
8.16. (482FW) Taxiing.
   8.16.1. (Added-482FW) When requesting taxi clearance, include call-sign, number in
   flight, HST Profile and ATIS code. For a 20 second/2-3 mile trail departure: ―Request 20
   second, nonstandard RADAR trail departure.‖ When the mission requires separate flight
   plans, advise ground ―MARSA departure with (appropriate flight).‖ If necessary to switch
   from ground frequency during taxi, monitor guard or VHF CH-2.
   8.16.2. (Added-482FW) If a controlled takeoff time is desired, advise Ground Control of
   your requested time while taxiing to the quick-check/arming area.
   8.16.3. (Added-482FW) If sufficient quick-check/arming slots for Runway 23 are not
   available, flights will hold as required to leave the taxiway open for the air defense alert
   aircraft.
   8.16.4. (Added-482FW) If Mode IV and RWR checks will be accomplished during taxi out
   (i.e. some UTAs or local exercises), these checks are normally accomplished on Taxiway B.
   While on B, taxi slowly on the centerline with 300 foot spacing. Follow any marshalling
   instructions. Ensure the RWR and IFF are warmed up in sufficient time to perform taxiway
   checks if required.
8.17. (Added-482FW) Arming/Quick-Check (Reference Figure 8 2). Aircraft pulling into
the Arming area will take the first vacant slot furthest from the runway.

   8.17.1. (Added-482FW) Spots 7 & 8 in the Arm/De-arm area on Taxiway A are within the
   Precision Object Free Zone (POFZ). In IMC conditions, aircraft will NOT arm, de-arm or
   park in these spots. Pilots may ―hold short‖ in spots 7& 8 as long as they are able to taxi
   clear if required.
8.18. (Added-482FW) Departure Clearance. IFR clearance will normally be issued by
Ground Control during taxi. All flight members will acknowledge the clearance on the flight’s
discrete VHF radio.
8.19. (482FW) Landing/Taxi-back/Post Flight Requirements.
   8.19.1. (Added-482FW) Short Turnoff. Pilots may turn off short of the end of the runway
   after landing. Normally, this would only be done when de-arming is not required. Advise
   Tower of intentions before turning off short. Pilots will not normally exit the runway using
   Taxiway Charlie after a landing.
   8.19.2. (Added-482FW) De-arming (See Figure 8.2). De-arming is required for all
   expendables except: captive/uncarted training munitions, empty uncarted TERs or cold guns.
   Do not taxi to the parking ramp without coordinating with the SOF if ordnance/suspension
   equipment cannot be safe. If lightning within 5 NM is declared, see paragraph 8.13.3.1 and
   8.13.3.2
       8.19.2.1. (Added-482FW) See paragraph 8.17.1 for POFZ procedures.
   8.19.3. (Added-482FW) Aircraft pulling into the de-arm area will take the vacant slot
   furthest from the runway. The aircraft farthest from the runway will normally taxi back first
   by initially taxiing toward the runway, then circling behind additional aircraft being de-
   armed.
   8.19.4. (Added-482FW) Any aircraft requiring special assistance will pull into the hot
   brake area, Spot 8, and inform ground if parked in the POFZ.
   8.19.5. (Added-482FW) Hung live and/or forward firing ordnance. Avoid swinging the
   nose of the aircraft through congested areas. Taxi into Spot 8 in EOR for live ordnance or in
   the Hung Forward Firing Ordnance Area, between the runway and Spot 8 of either EOR (See
   Figure 8.2). Refer to Hung live ordnance procedures in of this supplement and the MAKO
   Pilot Aid.
   8.19.6. (Added-482FW) Anytime a ground emergency for hot brakes is declared in a de-
   arm area, the de-arm operations for the rest of the aircraft is moved from taxiways Alpha or
   Echo (EORs) to Bravo or Delta until the emergency is terminated.
   8.19.7. (Added-482FW) When clear of the runway, switch radios to UHF CH-1 and VHF
   CH-2. Call MAKO OPS and pass aircraft status and landing time (the landing time you will
   enter into the 781). After de-arming, or clear of the runway and de-arming is not required,
   contact Ground for taxi clearance on VHF CH-2.
   8.19.8. (Added-482FW) If a fresh water rinse is required, inform Ground of intentions to
   delay at the ―Bird Bath.‖ After the last go of each day, all pilots will taxi through the bird
   bath/fresh water rinse.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                   57


8.20. (Added-482FW) Hot Refueling Procedures (See Figure 8 3). In addition to the ―HOT
REFUELING‖ checklist procedures in T.O. 1F-16C-1CL-1, Flight Crew Checklist, the following
apply:

Figure 8.3. Hot Refueling Procedures.




   8.20.1. (Added-482FW) Normally, Hot-pit refueling will be conducted on the Hot Cargo
   Pad/ Hot Pit Pad. There are six cursory check parking spots on the NE (RWY 23 Ops) and
   the SW (RWY 05 Ops) sides of the pad. The Hot Pit Supervisor will designate the ―cursory
   check‖ row and the ―refueling direction‖ based on winds.
   8.20.2. (Added-482FW) After landing, pilots will conduct normal post-flight procedures
   and then taxi to the Hot Cargo Pad/ Hot Pit Pad for cursory checks. Subsequent aircraft will
   fill in the row. In the cursory row, ground crew will perform a brake and tire inspection.
   Aircraft will wait in the cursory row until ready to refuel and then taxi using normal
   procedures to the refueling spot. Use limited power in this congested area.
   8.20.3. (Added-482FW) If hot brakes are found in the cursory row, pilots will declare an
   emergency with ground control and coordinate with the SOF. Hot brakes will terminate all
   Hot-
 58                                        AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


Pit refueling until the emergency aircraft is clear of the Hot Pit area. Hot Pit area, the pilot will
coordinate with the Hot Pit Supervisor for instructions. At no time will safety or flight/good
pilot judgement be compromised.
   8.20.4. (Added-482FW) Use a marshaller when taxiing into the refueling spot. Establish
   intercom with the refueling supervisor and maintain communications during the refueling. If
   communication is lost, terminate refueling. Position the FLCS SELF TEST switch to TEST
   when advised by the refueling supervisor. Ensure ―hands-clear‖ during refueling.
   8.20.5. (Added-482FW) Before the crew chief disconnects the communication cord, the
   EPU pin will be pulled and an EPU check will be accomplished prior to taxi. Ensure the
   FLCS SELF TEST switch is turned OFF prior to taxi.
   8.20.6. (Added-482FW) Do not hot refuel aircraft with hung ordnance, hot brakes, or fuel
   leaks.

Section 8D (482FW)—Flying Operations

8.21. (482FW) Takeoff.
   8.21.1. (Added-482FW) When calling ready for takeoff, relay to Tower if non-standard
   spacing > 2 NM is required. Tower will pass cable status with all takeoff clearances.
   8.21.2. (Added-482FW) Runway line-up. Aircraft will use the center portion of the
   runway defined by solid white runway lines approximately 150 feet from left edge to right
   edge. Normal runway line-up will be in accordance with AFI 11-2F-16V3 and 10 AF F-16
   Standards.
   8.21.3. (Added-482FW) Rolling takeoffs are authorized IAW 10 AF F-16 Standards.
       8.21.3.1. (Added-482FW) Normal taxi speeds will be complied with until lined up on
       the runway centerline. All turns will be in ―Idle‖ power.
       8.21.3.2. (Added-482FW) Flight leads will add ―Rolling Takeoff‖ to their ―Ready‖ call
       to Tower. Tower should wait until the flight is released before clearing the flight for
       takeoff. If Tower clears the flight to ―Line Up and Wait,‖ the flight lead has the option of
       informing Tower that the entire flight will ―Hold short‖ (until cleared for takeoff), or the
       flight lead may proceed on the runway to ―wait‖ while the remaining flight members hold
       short. When takeoff clearance is issued the flight lead will takeoff and then the wingman
       will take the appropriate takeoff spacing behind lead, i.e. ―feed the fight.‖ Takeoff
       interval will be IAW AFI 11-2-F-16V3.
   8.21.4. (Added-482FW) Unless Tower approves (or safety dictates), do not initiate the turn
   out of traffic or exceed 1,000 feet MSL until past the departure end of the runway.
8.22. (482FW) Departure.
   8.22.1. (Added-482FW) All aircraft will depart Homestead ARB on an IFR clearance
   unless VFR departure is required for mission accomplishment. Change to Departure Control
   frequency (normally CH-4) when cleared by Tower and just prior to commencing the takeoff
   roll.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                      59


   8.22.2. (Added-482FW) VFR Departure.            Single aircraft must have an operative
   transponder (one per element in formation), and the weather must permit VFR flight to and
   from the operating area before departing on a VFR flight plan. If an IFR delay will preclude
   mission accomplishment, depart VFR, and attempt to regain your IFR clearance with Miami
   Center when able. Pilots must notify Miami Center prior to entering the over-water areas so
   that Miami Center can activate the area or hand over control of the flight to Tarpon Control.
   Notify both Tarpon Control and Miami Center when leaving the area. In the event that radio
   contact cannot be established with Miami Center, pilots can request the SOF or Tarpon
   contact Miami on the land line to activate/deactivate the area. All flights departing and
   recovering VFR will monitor the appropriate sector frequency for traffic advisories.
   Advisories may be provided, controller workload permitting. Aircraft should avoid VFR
   flyways such as coastlines, US-1 or US-27 to the maximum extent possible.
   8.22.3. (Added-482FW) Non-standard Formation. All stereo flight plans from HST are
   automatically approved for 2 NM, non-standard formation, en-route to the assigned airspace,
   range or low level entry point. This approval includes any en-route portions of the profile
   that require climbs or descents to the assigned area. Non-standard formations with more than
   2 NM spacing require Miami Center coordination. Non-standard formation is not
   automatically approved for recovery profiles, except for the Avon South Recovery, and
   requires Miami Center approval. All IFR Stereo Flight Plans include a request for a 2,000
   foot block altitude; however, clearance for an altitude block during recovery does not include
   clearance for non-standard formation.
   8.22.4. (Added-482FW) Non-Standard In-Trail Departures. Non-standard formations
   greater than 2 NM from lead aircraft (4-ship RADAR Assisted Trail) must be requested from
   ATC. The maximum flight size should be 4, with a maximum of 3 NM separation between
   aircraft. Flights shall use a maximum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between aircraft in the
   event airborne RADAR is lost. Expect an initial flight clearance to 5,000 feet MSL. The last
   aircraft will be assigned a Mode 3/C code (expect first two digits of lead’s beacon code
   followed by ―00‖).
8.23. (482FW) Recovery.
   8.23.1. (Added-482FW) All pilots will retain an IFR clearance to the maximum extent
   possible. IFR clearances will not be canceled unless further flight under IFR control will
   cause unacceptable mission degradation, and VMC can be maintained. Use RADAR flight
   following to the maximum extent possible when VFR. ATC expects all flights to descend at
   300 KCAS unless otherwise advised.
   8.23.2. (Added-482FW) In-flight Report. A call to Mr. MAKO will be made IAW 10 AF
   F-16 Standards during RTB to report aircraft status codes and receive any pertinent
   information. Flight leads will also pass any airspace denials, delays or restrictions to the
   SOF during the in-flight report.
   8.23.3. (Added-482FW) Largo Recovery. The Largo recovery is available for flights
   recovering from W-465. The recovery will be requested only if the weather is VFR and will
   permit cancellation of IFR at the Homestead 195/25, at 3,000 feet MSL.
 60                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   8.23.4. (Added-482FW) Thursday of each week will be Instrument Approach Day. Flights
   should plan to RTB with enough fuel so all flight members can give GCA at least one
   instrument approach.
   8.23.5. (Added-482FW) Freedom Recovery.          The Freedom Recovery is usually flown
   during
UTA weekends but can be approved by the Ops Sup during other flying periods. Request the
Freedom Recovery with Homestead GCA and Tower. The aircraft will normally be at 2,000 feet
MSL but no lower than 1,500 feet MSL and fly a ground track that is oriented down Coral Sea
Blvd. to intersect the runway at 90º. Aircraft will then break overhead the runway to enter a
normal downwind to base for a low approach/full stop landing. Inform Tower if your intentions
are to carry through to re-enter initial. Avoid Homestead General, Channel 6 tower, and Turkey
Point.
8.24. (482FW) RADAR Trail Recovery (RTR).
   8.24.1. (Added-482FW) RTR must be coordinated with Miami Center and/or Homestead
   Approach Control. Procedures in AFI 11-2F-16V3 will be followed. RTRs may fly the ILS,
   Localizer, TACAN or visual straight-in to Runway 05 only. Runway 23 RTRs are not
   authorized.
   8.24.2. (Added-482FW) Flight leads may audible non-standard airspeed and configuration
   changes by radio as required.
   8.24.3. (Added-482FW) RTRs may consist of the lead aircraft receiving vectors for the
   entire four-ship or just the lead element if number 3 receives vectors for the trail element.
   Wingmen will maintain 1.5 – 2 NM and call ―saddled‖ when reaching that range. The
   spacing maneuver will be in VMC. IMC breakups will be IAW AFI 11-2F-16V3. At no
   time will S-turning on final be allowed to gain spacing behind the lead aircraft. A separate
   clearance for number 3, if in a 4 ship, should be coordinated prior to split up if number 3
   receives separate vectors. The flight lead will call for number 4 to take spacing, ―Mako 4,
   take spacing.‖ At this time, number 4 will slow to 250 KIAS and call ―saddled‖ upon
   reaching 1.5 NM. Once number 4 is saddled, lead will call for number 2 and 3 to take
   spacing, at which time number 2 and 3 will slow to 250 KIAS, take spacing and call
   ―saddled.‖ Lead will then slow to 250 KIAS. Once in trail, wingmen will adjust airspeed as
   required to maintain the desired spacing.
   8.24.4. (Added-482FW) Flight leads will ensure the flight is configured prior to the final
   approach fix.
   8.24.5. (Added-482FW) Individual aircraft will slow to Final Approach Speed at the FAF,
   no radio call required.
   8.24.6. (Added-482FW) If at any time the spacing is in question (less than 9,000 feet with
   closure), the wingman will either execute the missed approach procedure if established on the
   final approach segment or execute a standard rate 180º right turn, with approval of the local
   ATC controller, and coordinate for another 180º right turn to fall in behind the last flight
   member. ATC will issue a safe altitude to accomplish the maneuver.
   8.24.7. (Added-482FW) Missed approach will be IAW the instrument approach procedure,
   as directed by ATC or standard climbout IAW this publication. In the event the first
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       61


   aircraft/element executes missed approach, the second aircraft/element in the flight shall state
   intentions (i.e. continue with approach, execute missed approach, etc.).               If both
   aircraft/elements go missed approach, RADAR trail will be maintained unless a separate
   clearance had been obtained by the second element, in which case the second element will
   follow separate ATC instructions.
   8.24.8. (Added-482FW) Aircraft loses RADAR contact. Pilot will transmit ―C/S, lost
   contact.‖ Preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed, heading and DME. Once
   established on a segment of the IAP, flight members may continue the RTR, but must
   confirm separation via navigation aids and data link. Preceding aircraft will transmit any
   altitude, airspeed and heading changes. If not established on a segment of a published
   approach or separation is in doubt, establish altitude de-confliction and coordinate a separate
   clearance with ATC for the non-RADAR aircraft.
   8.24.9. (Added-482FW) NORDO Aircraft. The NORDO aircraft will squawk 7600 and
   continue the RTR. The remaining aircraft will notify ATC of the NORDO aircraft.
      8.24.9.1. (Added-482FW) If in VMC and able to continue in VMC, squawk 7600,
      proceed VMC to initial, rock wings on initial, pitch out and land obeying Tower’s light
      signals.
      8.24.9.2. (Added-482FW) If lost communications occur after turning base leg in the
      RADAR pattern, the pilot shall intercept and fly the final portion of the ILS or TACAN
      Runway 5 approach and land.
      8.24.9.3. (Added-482FW) If lost communications occur any other place in the RADAR
      traffic pattern, the pilot shall maintain 1,600 feet and proceed direct FLATE and fly the
      ILS or TACAN Runway 5 approach and land.
   8.24.10. (Added-482FW) Breakout. If at any time ATC directs the flight to ―Breakout,‖
   the leading aircraft in the recovery shall comply with breakout instructions when they are
   issued. All succeeding aircraft in-trail shall continue inbound and comply with the breakout
   instructions at the same point-in-space where the lead aircraft executed the breakout
   instructions.
8.25. (482FW) Missed Approach/ RADAR Climb Out Procedures.
   8.25.1. (Added-482FW) Locally based aircraft will be issued ―RADAR climb out as
   published‖ instead of complete phraseology unless detailed climb out instructions are
   requested or required. Standard instructions are as follows:
      8.25.1.1. (Added-482FW) Runway 05. Do not exceed 1,000 feet MSL until passing the
      departure end of the runway, turn right heading 140 degrees, climb and maintain 2,000
      feet MSL.
      8.25.1.2. (Added-482FW) Runway 23. Do not exceed 1,000 feet MSL until passing the
      departure end of the runway, turn left heading 140 degrees, climb and maintain 2,000 feet

   8.26.1. (Added-482FW) Retain the IFR clearance on recovery until approaching the airport
   traffic area whenever possible. The IFR flight plan will automatically be canceled when the
   change to Tower frequency (CH-3) is made.
   8.26.2. (Added-482FW) The VFR pattern is flown at 2,000 feet MSL and 300 KCAS.
   Tower may approve a 1,500 foot pattern due to birds or weather. All landings will be from
   instrument approaches whenever the weather is less than 2,000 foot ceiling and/or 3 miles
   visibility.
   8.26.3. (Added-482FW) Aircraft executing a go-around will clear to the southeast side of
   the runway. Do not exceed 1,000 feet MSL until passed the departure end of the runway or
   initiate turns until 1 DME when re-entering to Sierra or Hotel. State your intentions
   (―request closed, full stop‖) to tower following each approach. Due to the Miami Class B
   airspace, all aircraft will Squawk Mode 3/C of 1200 when departing the pattern for the VFR
   entry points or climbing to High Key.
8.27. (482FW) Runway 05 Operation (See Figure 8 4).
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       63

   8.27.1. (Added-482FW) VFR Entry Point. To re-enter the VFR pattern following an
   approach, turn right at 1 DME and proceed to a plowed out area called ―Sierra." Sierra is
   located near the northern point of a triangle formed by a power line, a dirt road oriented east-
   west and a canal (approximately 195/08). This area is approximately 2 NM south of a
   circular antenna.
   8.27.2. (Added-482FW) Overhead Pattern Entry. Over Sierra, state your call sign and
   position, ―MAKO 11, Sierra." From Sierra, fly north between the gravel pit and the circular
   antenna to enter a 3-5 NM initial. Report Initial with intentions, ―MAKO 11 Initial, full
   stop/low approach.‖
   8.27.3. (Added-482FW) Holding. Aircraft directed to hold or execute a 360 degree turn for
   traffic spacing will hold north of Sierra, right turns, in a north-south orbit at 2,000 feet MSL
   and 300 KCAS. Fly the north-bound leg between the gravel pit and the circular antenna.

   8.28.1. (Added-482FW) VFR Entry Point. To re-enter the pattern following an approach,
   turn left at 2 DME and proceed to Arsenicker Key. Turn left just after passing this key and
   proceed to a mud flat called ―Hotel‖ located approximately 2 NM west of the north end of
   Elliott Key (HST 080/09).
   8.28.2. (Added-482FW) Overhead Pattern Entry. Call over Hotel with your call sign and
   position, ―MAKO 11, Hotel." From Hotel enter a 3-4 NM initial. Due to the potential for
   high bird activity north of the field, fly initial in route formation until the break. Report
   ―Initial‖ with intentions, ―MAKO 11 Initial, full stop/low approach.‖
   8.28.3. (Added-482FW) Holding. Aircraft directed to hold or execute a 360 degree turn for
   traffic spacing will hold southwest of Hotel, right turns 2,000 feet MSL and 300 KCAS.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        65


   8.28.4. (Added-482FW) VFR Straight-In. From point Hotel, descend to 1,200 feet and join
   a 5-6 NM final. Exercise caution for high bird activity over the Dade County Landfill (Mt
   Trashmore).
8.29. (482FW) Tactical Overhead Pattern.
   8.29.1. (Added-482FW) Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns may be flown to Runway 05
   only. The pattern will be flown at 2,000 feet MSL and a maximum of 350 knots. Tower may
   approve a 1,500 foot pattern if conditions preclude the 2,000 foot pattern. Over-flight of the
   weapons storage area is prohibited. The lead aircraft will fly the normal Overhead Pattern
   ground track with the wingman positioned approximately one mile line abreast to the
   Northwest. As a visual reference, the wingman should line up on the U.S. Customs ramp.
   8.29.2. (Added-482FW) The fight will break at the approach end of the runway to arrive at
   the normal Overhead Pattern downwind and base position. Trail elements will use caution to
   deconflict flight paths from the preceding element.
8.30. (482FW) Simulated Flame Out (SFO) Patterns (See Figure 8 6 and 8.7).
   8.30.1. (Added-482FW) The SFO is a visual approach flown entirely under Tower control.
Aircraft must remain in VMC conditions (ceiling must be at least 1,000 feet above requested
high key altitude and visibility at least 5 miles). ―See and avoid‖ procedures apply at all times in
the pattern. For SFOs during recovery, upon initial contact with Miami Approach/Homestead
GCA, request vectors for an Overhead SFO, or vectors to Park Place (HST 233/15) for a
Straight-In SFO. The required radio calls for an Overhead SFO is High Key, Low Key, and Base
Key with gear (or as requested by Tower). The required radio calls for a Straight-In SFOs are
Park Place, 9 DME and 6 DME with gear down for low approach (or as requested by Tower).
   8.30.2. (Added-482FW) Overhead SFO (See Figure 8.6).
 66                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


Figure 8.6. Overhead SFO.




      8.30.2.1. (Added-482FW) The overhead pattern will be entered from High Key at 7,000
      feet MSL (9,000 by request), with a left hand spiral pattern to Runway 05 and to Runway
      23. Low Key will normally be 3,000-5,000 feet MSL. All SFO maneuvering must be
      accomplished within 3 DME of the HST TACAN. Turkey Point Power Plant will not be
      over-flown.
      8.30.2.2. (Added-482FW) With Tower approval, Overhead SFO patterns may be flown
      after go around from a visual approach, instrument approach or from initial. Unless
      otherwise approved, aircraft will remain below 1,000 feet MSL until the departure end of
      the runway. At the departure end, the aircraft will initiate a right climbing turn from
      Runway 05 or right climbing turn from Runway 23 to High Key.
      8.30.2.3. (Added-482FW) Tower approval for the SFO is approval to climb VFR within
      3 NM to High Key altitude. Report ―High Key.‖ Tower will respond with ―Report Low
      Key/Base Key‖ or will ask you to hold at High Key for traffic. If holding (left turns
      RWY 05/ left turns RWY 23) at high key, Tower will advise when you may continue the
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                   67


      SFO. A maximum of four aircraft may hold at High Key. If breakout occurs at low key,
      the aircraft will breakout to Sierra/Hotel or proceed to high key with approval.
      8.30.2.4. (Added-482FW) A Low Key entry to the overhead SFO pattern may be made
      following a low approach. The pilot on the go will request ―Low Key entry.‖ Upon
      tower approval, a left climbing turn from runway 05 or a left climbing turn from RWY 23
      will be used to Low Key altitude (3,000-5,000 feet MSL). The pilot will report ―Low
      Key."
   8.30.3. (Added-482FW) Straight-in SFO (SI-SFO) (See Figure 8.7)

Figure 8.7. Straight-in SFO (SI-SFO).




      8.30.3.1. (Added-482FW) SI-SFOs are approved only upon initial entry into
      Homestead airspace or via RADAR re-entry with HST GCA and when runway 05 is the
      active. Requests will be made with the earliest ATC agency (Center, Approach/GCA),
      and aircraft will be vectored/cleared to the HST 233/15 (Park Place) at 9,000 feet MSL.
      The flight’s IFR clearance will be automatically canceled at Park Place.
      8.30.3.2. (Added-482FW) SI-SFO weather must be 10,000 feet and 5 miles visibility.
      This is a visual procedure and VMC must be maintained during the entire SI-SFO.
      8.30.3.3. (Added-482FW) A maximum of one flight, not totaling more than four
      aircraft, may perform a SI-SFO. Each flight member will maintain visual separation not
      to exceed 6,000 feet with the preceding aircraft. If visual separation is lost or spacing
      cannot be maintained, the pilot will breakout and inform the flight and Tower.
      8.30.3.4. (Added-482FW) Each aircraft will report ―Park Place,‖ initiate visual
      separation and continue inbound on a 053 course at 9,000 feet MSL. Approval for the SI-
      SFO will be received by 9 DME; report ―9 DME.‖ If approval has not been received, the
 68                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


      flight lead and wingman will initiate a left-hand turn and hold between 9 and 15 DME or
      breakout. When approval has been received, maintain 9,000’ MSL until 9 DME and
      report ―9 DME.‖ Start the descent to be at or below 7,000 feet MSL by 6 DME; report ―6
      DME‖ with ―Gear Down for Low Approach." Inside of 6 DME, the aircraft must be
      aligned with the runway centerline +/- 5 degrees.
      8.30.3.5. (Added-482FW) There will be no more than four aircraft (total) in the SI-SFO
      pattern. The tower must have visual contact with the SI-SFO aircraft no later than 3 NM
      or breakout instructions will be issued. Additionally, no other traffic will be on final or in
      the takeoff roll when the SI-SFO reports 6 DME.
      8.30.3.6. (Added-482FW) SI-SFO Breakout Procedures. At anytime, the controlling
      agency or pilot can terminate/cancel or breakout the SI-SFO. If this occurs, the aircraft
      will be expected to proceed VFR to the Overhead SFO High Key position and hold at
      7,000 feet MSL unless requested otherwise. Note: when a breakout occurs, the aircraft
      breaking out must ensure altitude de-confliction with other flight members performing
      the SI-SFO.
8.31. (482FW) Tactical Recovery Pattern (TRP) (Day VMC Only) (See Figure 8 8).
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  69


Figure 8.8. Tactical Recovery Pattern (TRP)(Day VMC Only).




   8.31.1. (Added-482FW) Request Tactical Recovery Pattern (TRP) from Homestead GCA.
   Entry altitude will be from 7,000-10,000’MSL or a hard altitude if required by GCA.
   Current ceiling must be at least 1,000’ above the requested altitude. All maneuvering must
   be within 3 DME, and a maximum of 4 aircraft can be in the TRP at one time. At any time,
   the controlling agency or pilot can terminate/cancel or breakout the TRP. When a breakout
   occurs, the pilot will descend to 2,000’ MSL and proceed to Sierra/Hotel with tower
   approval. When executing the TRP, perform an idle break at midfield. Then, descend in idle
   to be at ―High Base‖ (3,000-5,000 MSL). Roll out at 300’ MSL and 1 NM (Normal landing
   parameters). Landing light will be turned on when rolled out on final. The pilot will power
   modulate as required and not compromise safe landing parameters.
8.32. (482FW) Local Hazards.
   8.32.1. (Added-482FW) Turkey Point Power Plant. No aircraft will over-fly Turkey Point
   Power plant.
   8.32.2. (Added-482FW) R-2196. R-2196 is a tethered balloon and cable that extends to
   14,000 feet MSL at Cudjoe Key. Pilots will use caution to avoid R-2196.
 70                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   8.32.3. (Added-482FW) Homestead General Aviation Airport. Avoid Homestead General
   Airport (parachute activity up to 14,000 feet) as well as the light aircraft aerobatics area
   below 6,000 feet MSL, 1 NM south of Homestead General Airport. To the maximum extent
   possible, pilots will avoid proceeding direct to Homestead from VEGIE (HST 301/37 DME)
   as this will cross the Homestead General Working Area.
   8.32.4. (Added-482FW) Channel 6 Tower. Avoid the Channel 6 tower positioned roughly
   6 NM northwest of the field that extends to 1,849 feet MSL.
   8.32.5. (Added-482FW) Dade County Landfill (Mt Trashmore), located approximately
   3.75 NM northeast of the field, poses a significant bird hazard. Avoid over flying the
   landfill.
   8.32.6. (Added-482FW) IAW AFI 13-201 and AP/1B, Fort Jefferson National Monument
   is designated an HQ USAF Specified Critical Area and shall be avoided by ½ NM for each
   1,000 feet of flight altitude. To support these restrictions, 482 FW operated aircraft will
   avoid flying supersonic over Fort Jefferson within 15 NM as a minimum. Fort Jeff shall not
   be overflown below 5,000’ AGL at any airspeed.
8.33. (482FW) Bird Watch Conditions.
8.33.1. (Added-482FW) The 482 FW Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard Reduction (BASH) Program
Plan 91-212 contains detailed procedures for the 482 FW. The authority to declare bird watch
conditions (BWCs) in the local flying area, to include low level routes, is vested with the SOF
during normal flight operations. The SOF bases the declaration of a BWC on observations made
by the USDA Wildlife Biologist, call-sign ―Birdman,‖ information relayed by airborne aircraft
and information relayed by ground personnel. The Range Control Officer has the overriding
authority to declare BWCs for the R-2901 Complex.
   8.33.2. (Added-482FW) Due to high bird populations in the Local Area, the 482 OG/CC
   will be the approving authority for all Local Low-Levels. Unless required by an approved
   syllabus, 482 FW aircraft will not accomplish ―pop attacks‖ on the local ranges.
   8.33.3. (Added-482FW) The following terminology will be used for rapid communications
   to disseminate bird activity and implement unit operational procedures:
       8.33.3.1. (Added-482FW) BWC SEVERE: high bird population on or immediately
       above the active runway or other specified location that represents a high potential for
       strike. All takeoffs and landings are prohibited without OG/CC or higher approval. If
       approved, single ship takeoffs and landings will be accomplished. The SOF may
       consider diverting aircraft or delaying takeoffs and landings while the bird scare team
       reduces the bird condition to MODERATE or LOW. If SEVERE is declared, low levels
       will not be flown. If SEVERE is declared at Avon Park Range, operating below 3,000
       feet AGL is prohibited to include dive delivery recoveries.
       8.33.3.2. (Added-482FW) BWC MODERATE: increased bird population in locations
       which represents an increased potential for strike. This condition requires increased
       vigilance by all agencies and caution by pilots. Traffic patterns will be restricted to
       single ship takeoffs and full stop landings provided departure/arrival routing avoids
       identified bird activity. Low approaches are not authorized. On Avon Park Range,
       remain above 3,000 feet AGL to include dive recoveries. The only exception to this is
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                    71


      when accomplishing specific training, syllabus upgrades, RAP tasking events or updating
      currencies approved by the 482 OG/CC or designated representative.
          8.33.3.2.1. (Added-482FW) Instrument training at NAS Key West. If NAS Key
          West is reporting bird condition moderate, pilots are authorized to complete only one
          non-precision approach to complete an INSTM/QUAL check ride IAW AFI-11-
          202V2 or upgrade training IAW an approved syllabus. Since non-precision
          approaches are only evaluated to the MDA and the VDP (AFI 11-2F-16V2), pilots
          will plan a restricted low approach to 500’AGL for bird condition moderate and
          mission plan accordingly to move the VDP.
          8.33.3.2.2. (Added-482FW) Instrument training at Fort Myers International (RSW).
          IAW AFI 11-202V3, if pilots receive ATIS/ATC reports or hazard advisory to use
          caution for birds in the vicinity, they will utilize BWC MODERATE procedures.
          Pilots are authorized to complete only one non-precision approach to complete an
          INSTM/QUAL check ride IAW AFI-11-202V2. Since non-precision approaches are
          only evaluated to the MDA and the VDP (AFI 11-2F-16V2), pilots will plan a
          restricted low approach to 500’AGL for bird condition moderate and mission plan
          accordingly to move the VDP.
      8.33.3.3. (Added-482FW) BWC LOW: defined as normal bird activity on and above
      the airfield with a low probability of hazard. Continue with normal operating procedures.
   8.33.4. (Added-482FW) If a significant bird hazard is encountered on a low level, aircraft
   should climb to a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet AGL. On the range, flight leads may need
   to change events to increase pattern/release altitudes. If a bird strike is confirmed or
   suspected, the mission will be terminated, and the pilot will recover the aircraft as soon as
   practical.
Section 8E Weapons Employment.
8.34. (482FW) Air-to-Surface
   8.34.1. (Added-482FW) Avon Park Air Force Range/R-2901. The 482 FW primary Air-to-
   Surface bombing range is the Avon Park Range Complex. Refer to AFI 13-212V1, Avon
   Park Air Force Range, Addenda-A, and the Avon Park Range Website,
   https://avonpark.acc.af.mil, for a detailed description of the Avon Park Range and
   restrictions. The MAKO Pilot Aid also contains detailed guidance along with entry, exit and
   holding procedures.
   8.34.2. (Added-482FW) Range Entry. Flights will obtain clearance on the range from
   Avon Range Ops (UHF CH-8) prior to leaving ATC frequency.
   8.34.3. (Added-482FW) Avon Park Range Restrictions. All 482 FW pilots will comply
   with all restrictions in AFI 13-212 V1, Avon Park Air Force Range, Addenda-A and the
   following:
      8.34.3.1. (Added-482FW) The Master Arm switch will not be placed to Arm until over
      range real estate boundaries (not to be confused with airspace boundaries) and will be
      placed to OFF/SIM prior to departing the range real estate boundaries.
      8.34.3.2. (Added-482FW) Tactical range clearing procedures. A clearing pass to
      ensure the target area is clear is required prior to actual weapons delivery (See AFI 11-
72                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


     214). The first pass may be hot if a FAC is controlling that mission, an IG chase is
     present or another flight with back-to-back range periods can verify the range is clear
     (See AFI 13-212 V1, Avon Park Air Force Range, Addenda-A). The outgoing flight will
     advise the safety observer or Avon OPS if the range is clear. The incoming flight must
     confirm the range is clear with the safety observer or Avon OPS prior to dropping on the
     range. If this cannot be confirmed, a clearing pass will be made.
     8.34.3.3. (Added-482FW) Minimum altitude over the Avon Park complex and its
     associated MOA’s is 3,000 feet AGL. The exceptions are:
         8.34.3.3.1. (Added-482FW) When there is a safety observer in a position to assess
         the ―Bird Condition‖ on a class B range (R-2901 Avon), the box/curve pattern may be
         flown to the proper minimum release altitudes for the events being flown (Reference
         8.33.2 Pop Patterns may be flown IAW an approved syllabus with OG/CC
         Approval).
         8.34.3.3.2. (Added-482FW) When executing a tactical diving delivery, with a
         Minimum Release Altitude above 3,000 feet AGL, the recovery may descend below
         3,000 feet AGL. Minimize the time below 3,000 feet AGL. When executing diving
         deliveries or HAS/LAS for AEF spin-up tasking or to complete an approved syllabus
         ride, employment and recoveries are approved below 3,000’ AGL with Bird
         Condition Low and minimum altitudes IAW AFI 11-214.
            8.34.3.3.2.1. (Added-482FW) In order to determine the bird condition at Avon,
            pilots will check AHAS prior to the flight and give considerable emphasis to the
            AHAS modeling data. Pilots will ensure AHAS modeling is LOW on the
            appropriate ranges before executing procedures in 8.34.3.3.2 Pilots, will also
            query the safety observer (if available for a particular range) to obtain the bird
            condition. If there is no safety observer available, pilots will accomplish a bird
            check between 1,000 – 3,000’ AGL, with airspeed between 300 – 350 KIAS IAW
            AFI 11-214 and confirm the bird condition is low.
  8.34.4. (Added-482FW) Range Departure. All flights will depart the range not later than
  the end of the scheduled range time unless otherwise coordinated. The flight lead will
  request that the RCO initiate the IFR recovery clearance five minutes prior to the desired
  departure time. Either the RCO or Avon OPS will relay the clearance to the flight.
  Accomplish an armament safety check on range frequency prior to range departure or
  transition to operations in Placid MOA.
     8.34.4.1. (Added-482FW) Remain within the range boundary or the Placid MOA
     boundary until contact is made with Miami Center.
  8.34.5. (Added-482FW) To prevent off-range attacks with hung ordnance, flights will
  conduct a visual bomb inspection after dropping any ordnance and prior to any dry/simulated
  attacks outside the restricted areas. Prior to off-range attacks with or without expendable
  stores, flight leads will verbally confirm all flight members have the master arm switch in
  OFF/SIM, an empty or uncarted station is selected on the SMS prior to the attack, and (if
  applicable) the training laser is selected in the Targeting Pod. All flight members will
  acknowledge this confirmation. (EXAMPLE: ―MAKO 11, check simulate, zero quantity
  selected, un-carted station, training laser selected.‖).

   8.34.6. (Added-482FW) Pinecastle/R-2910. Pinecastle is an alternate Air-to-Surface
   bombing range. It is a Navy operated range suitable for Live Ordnance. All 482 FW pilots
   will comply with the Navy Pinecastle Range Restrictions. The MAKO Pilot Aid also
   contains detailed guidance with entry, exit and holding procedures.
   8.34.7. (Added-482FW) Live Ordnance Procedures. A project officer, normally a
   Weapons Officer, will be assigned for live ordnance employment exercises and will act in an
   overall supervisory role to ensure employment planning complies with T.O. 1-1M-34 and
   T.O. 1F-16C-34-1-1. The project officer will coordinate with on-base organizations IAW
   482 FWI 10-100, Live Ordnance Load Operation, to ensure smooth/safe operations. Special
   attention will be paid to frag avoidance, range restrictions and de-confliction.
      8.34.7.1. (Added-482FW) Ground Operations. Live ordnance operations will be
      conducted on the designated aircraft parking locations identified as P1 through P6, Live
      Ordnance Loading Area (LOLA), located on Taxiway Papa. The LOLA will be blocked
      or controlled at the Taxiway Bravo intersection to prevent aircraft other than 93 FS
      aircraft from entering the live ordnance load section of the taxiway.
      8.34.7.2. (Added-482FW) Take-off/Departure Procedures. Runway 05 will be the
      primary departure runway with an acceptable tailwind component up to 10 knots. On
      departure, do not over-fly populated areas. Do not make a left turn out on Runway 05 or
      turn right on Runway 23 until past Florida City/Homestead. Do not over-fly Turkey
      Point. If any weapon is confirmed unsafe, a medium altitude jettison with an interval
      equal to or greater than 100 feet should be used.
8.35. (482FW) Air-to-Air.
   8.35.1. (Added-482FW) The 93 FS will avoid scheduling any sorties in which Air-to-Air
   training will be conducted with Hot Guns. If sorties are scheduled and flown with Hot Guns
   due to operational constraints, all applicable training rules in AFI 11-214 and the ACC
   supplement will be briefed and followed.
   8.35.2. (Added-482FW) ―LOWAT‖ and/or ―Low A/A‖ training events will be updated by
   flying intercepts in the over water warning areas IAW AFI 11-214 and AFI 11-2F-16
   Volume 3. ―LOWAT‖ and ―Low A/A‖ events will be updated this way due to high bird
   activity over land. Over land ―LOWAT‖ and ―Low A/A‖ training, below 3,000’ AGL
   requires a OG/CC waiver on a case by case basis.
   8.35.3. (Added-482FW) Air-to-Air Maneuvering Guidance
      8.35.3.1. (Added-482FW) F-16D aircraft with centerline stores are prohibited from
      utilizing the Unlimited maneuvering category, as defined by AFI 11-214.
      8.35.3.2. (Added-482FW) F-16’s with CAT III loading configurations may fly
      unlimited maneuvering category missions but have a minimum airspeed restriction of 200
      knots.
      8.35.3.3. (Added-482FW) Until a pilot has completed Hi-AOA training, the minimum
      airspeed below 10,000’ AGL will be 200 knots. Once Hi-AOA training is completed, the
      pilot may fly unlimited maneuvering down to 5,000' AGL with a minimum airspeed of
      the low speed warning tone IAW AFI 11-214.

   8.35.4. (Added-482FW) Visual Merges. The blue flight lead is responsible for developing
   a scenario and briefing SPINs that ensure deconfliction between all aircraft with specific
   attention devoted to deconfliction in visual merges.
Section F Abnormal Procedures.
8.36. (Added-482FW) Jettison Area Procedures/Parameters (See Figure 8 9).
Figure8.9. Jettison Area Procedures/Parameters.




   8.36.1. (Added-482FW) If the situation permits, contact the SOF with your situation and
   intentions. The primary jettison area is the HST 095/20. Jettison in IMC is authorized;
   however, notify Homestead GCA or Approach Control for traffic advisories. Jettison the
   external stores at 2,000 feet MSL.
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                     75


   8.36.2. (Added-482FW) An alternate jettison/salvo area is located along the canal 800 feet
   south of the Runway, between taxiway D and E, in VMC, at 1,000 feet MSL on a magnetic
   heading of 050 degrees. The ―Salvo‖ area will not be used for jettison of live ordnance.
   Pilots must receive Tower permission to use this area.
   8.36.3. (Added-482FW) The emergency jettison area is located in Biscayne Bay south of a
   line extending out from Runway 05. Pilots should visually clear this area prior to jettisoning
   external stores.
   8.36.4. (Added-482FW) For jettison on a range or target area, comply with the appropriate
   range/exercise instructions.
8.37. (482FW) Hung Ordnance.
   8.37.1. (Added-482FW) Hung inert or unexpended live ordnance will be brought back,
   avoiding populated areas, for a Straight-In full stop. Pilots may execute a circling approach
   to RWY 23 if necessary. Notify the SOF and comply with AFI 11-2F-16V3 procedures.
   Declare an emergency for hung gun, hung live or un-secure heavyweight inert ordnance. If
   an arrested landing is required due to aircraft malfunction, plan on shutting down on the
   runway and de-arming as the situation allows.
   8.37.2. (Added-482FW) Hung Live Ordnance. If on a TER, attempt release after ―re-
   homing‖ the SMS. (―Re-homing‖ is not possible on a MAU.) If still unable to release off a
   TER, jettison both ordnance and suspension equipment. If all attempts to jettison fail,
   declare an emergency, avoid populated areas and fly a Straight-In approach. If hung on a
   MAU, ascertain whether the ordnance is hung secure or unsecure. If unsecure, attempt to
   jettison just the ordnance. If all attempts to jettison fail, declare an emergency, avoid
   populated areas and fly a Straight-In approach. Hung Live Ordnance will be de-armed in
   Spot 8 of either EOR. An alternate Hung/Unsafe Ordnance location on Taxiway Delta will
   be used if necessary.
   8.37.3. (Added-482FW) Hung Gun. If a hung/jammed gun occurs, safe the gun and do not
   attempt another firing. Normal bombing events on the range may be continued, but hung
   ordnance procedures will be followed during RTB. A chase aircraft is not required for this
   emergency. The aircraft will be parked in the Hung Forward Firing Ordnance Area, on the
   line between the runway and Spot 8 of either EOR (See Figure 8.2). Once the Fire Chief
   arrives the aircraft will be shut down. Avoid pointing forward firing ordnance through
   congested areas.
   8.37.4. (Added-482FW) Hung Rockets. If a hung rocket occurs, normal events on the
   range may be continued, but hung ordnance procedures will be followed during RTB (no
   chase required). An emergency does not need to be declared. The aircraft will be parked in
   the Hung Forward Firing Ordnance Area. If the EOR Crew determines that the aircraft
   cannot be safed for taxi back, the aircraft will be shut down.
   8.37.5. (Added-482FW) Diverts with Live Ordnance. Diverts with Live Ordnance should
   be planned to the following airfields in order: NAS Key West, MacDill AFB, Patrick AFB,
   Miami International. Telephonic notification of the base must precede the arrival of divert
   aircraft. Aircraft will not divert to MIA with hung unsecured ordnance.
8.38. (482FW) Emergency Procedures.
 76                                      AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   8.38.1. (Added-482FW) Emergency Communications. When time permits, contact the
   SOF to explain the problem and intentions. Request, through ATC, to have the SOF monitor
   the interflight frequency, if necessary. Advise the controlling agency/SOF of your ETA to
   ensure timely activation of the crash net. All emergency aircraft will request recovery on the
   Single Frequency Approach (SFA) CH-19 when handed off to Homestead Tower. If at any
   time ATC handling is unreliable, switch to Guard and declare your intentions. Emergency
   Aircraft should consider switching to the SOF VHF frequency to facilitate communication
   with the SOF.
   8.38.2. (Added-482FW) All ground emergencies will establish communication with the
   Homestead Fire Department, call-sign ―Chief 1‖ or ―Chief 2.‖ The Fire Chief will become
   the on-scene commander and declare/terminate the emergency.
   8.38.3. (Added-482FW) The SOF will notify the 482 OG/CC of emergencies when
   situation and time permit IAW AFI 11-418_482FW Sup 1. SOFs will ensure the Command
   Post is notified, which in-turn notifies 10 AF Command Post of any safety incident that
   might generate a Class C report.
8.39. (Added-482FW) Aborts. If a maintenance ground abort occurs after weapons arming,
the aircraft will be de-armed prior to taxiing back to the parking area.
8.40. (482FW) Cable Engagement Procedures.
   8.40.1. (Added-482FW) The approach end BAK 12/14 is normally in the lowered position.
   Notify the tower as early as possible if a cable engagement is anticipated. As soon as
   possible after the engagement, give the tower the roll-in gross weight and ground speed.
   8.40.2. (Added-482FW) If hung heavy inert or live ordnance is on the aircraft, jettison it in
   the jettison area. If unable to jettison ordnance, jettison the suspension equipment.
   8.40.3. (Added-482FW) After the aircraft stops in the cable, the Crash Rescue Crew Chief
   will direct further actions to the pilot to free the aircraft from the cable. Unless safety
   dictates otherwise, the pilot will remain in the cockpit to assist in the removal of the aircraft
   from the runway.
   8.40.4. (Added-482FW) Slingshot procedures will not be performed by 482 FW pilots.
8.40.5. (Added-482FW) Barrier Recertification.. When tasked for a barrier recertification, use
the following procedures:
       8.40.5.1. (Added-482FW) Refer to the Brake Energy Limits charts in T.O. 1F-16C-1-1
       for all limits and cooling times. Do not takeoff/taxi until brakes have cooled to within
       limits.
       8.40.5.2. (Added-482FW) In the event that more than one barrier recertification is
       required, ensure maintenance checks the aircraft’s brakes for Hot Brakes between
       engagements.
8.41. (482FW) Hot Brakes (See Figure 8 4 and 8.5).
   8.41.1. (Added-482FW) There are four hot brake areas established: one at each EOR Spot
   8 (closest spot to the runway), one on the Hot Cargo Pad/Hot Pit area, and one on taxiway
   Bravo between the runway and taxiway Papa. For most situations, hot brakes should be dealt
   with where they are discovered. Every effort should be made to park any aircraft with
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                     77


   suspected hot brakes facing into the wind. Excessive taxiing with hot brakes will create a
   more serious and potentially dangerous situation.
   8.41.2. (Added-482FW) When hot brakes are known or suspected, declare an emergency
   with Ground, notify the SOF and point the nose of the aircraft into the wind if possible. Use
   only minimal braking pressure to stop the aircraft and do not use the parking brake. If hot
   brakes are discovered in the de-arm area, do not taxi any further unless it is to position the
   aircraft into the wind.
   8.41.3. (Added-482FW) If Hot Brakes are discovered on the MAKO Ramp, notify Ground
   and the SOF and taxi to Hot Cargo Pad/Hot Pit area or as far away as possible from other
   parked aircraft, personnel or other resources. If the Hot Cargo Pad/Hot Pit area is in use,
   then taxi to Taxiway B2, which is located between the runway and taxiway P.
   8.41.4. (Added-482FW) At no time will a mechanical device be utilized to determine brake
   temperature if hot brakes are suspected. Refer to Hot Refueling Procedures for hot brakes
   during Hot Refueling.
8.42. (482FW) Radio Failure.
   8.42.1. (Added-482FW) VMC. Maintain VFR, RTB and fly initial at 1,000 feet MSL
   (rocking wings on initial).
   8.42.2. (Added-482FW) NORDO aircraft with an emergency (HEFOE). With a HEFOE
   for engine or fuel, take or chase the emergency aircraft to high key. If ―thumbs-up‖ after
   HEFOE, return to Homestead; if ―thumbs-down,‖ proceed to the closest suitable airfield.
   Emergency aircraft will lower the hook if an approach-end cable arrestment is required.
   8.42.3. (Added-482FW) In the event of lost communication en-route to the operating area
   and in IMC, proceed to CAJUN (HST 233/30) at the last assigned altitude (bottom altitude of
   a block). If communication is lost after entering the operating area, a recovery altitude has
   not been assigned and weather will not permit a VFR recovery, proceed to CAJUN at the
   altitude (bottom altitude of a block) that was assigned in the ATC clearance issued prior to
   takeoff. Squawk 7600 IAW standard NORDO procedures.
   8.42.4. (Added-482FW) In the event of lost communications after having entered the Avon
   Park Range, and a VFR RTB is not possible, depart all ranges at 4,000 feet or altitude
   assigned on range, squawk 7600, maintain the altitude for three minutes, then climb to FL210
   and intercept the Avon South Recovery profile.
8.43. (482FW) Recovery with Weapons M. ons.
   8.43.1. (Added-482FW) Reference paragraph 8.37 for recovery with hung ordnance.
   8.43.2. (Added-482FW) For all other weapons malfunctions, record the switch settings for
   maintenance. Mark the position of any unintentional or inadvertent release positions.
8.44. (Added-482FW) EPU Activation. If the EPU is activated, declare an emergency and
notify SOF/Tower that the Hydrazine Response Team is needed. For most situations, it is not
advisable to taxi. If the SOF directs taxi, every effort should be made to park the aircraft with
the left wing into the wind. The designated hydrazine holding area is on B/D taxiway or Spot 8
in each EOR. Follow the expanded procedures in T.O. 1F-16C-1CL-1 and the MAKO Pilot Aid.

8.45. (Added-482FW) Controlled Bailout Areas (See Figure 8 9). The controlled bailout
area is located at HST 180/05. Prior to bailout, if time permits, contact the SOF stating
intentions and ETA to the bailout area. Attempt to contact the Tower and have the VFR traffic
pattern cleared of all traffic. Ensure the aircraft is southbound and not directed toward any
people, buildings or vehicles prior to bailout.
8.46. (482FW) Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures.
   8.46.1. (Added-482FW) SAR procedures will be IAW the 10 AF F-16 Standards and
   AFI11-2F-16V3. If an aircraft crash occurs in the local flying area, notify HST Tower to
   activate the Quick Reaction Checklist.
   8.46.2. (Added-482FW) Avon Park Range. If an aircraft crash occurs on or near the Avon
   Park Range complex, notify Avon Operations to activate rescue forces and call the 482 FW
   SOF.

      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                     EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
   along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a
AFI11-2F-16V3_482FWSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       89


   HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS
   doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with
   Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations
   Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
