                                                                                              Pages: 5

This instruction provides guidance for the purpose of preparing and implementing AFMC Programming
Plans (PPlans). It implements AFI 10-501 and identifies, in general, what is involved in a PPlan and when
it is useful. This is the first issue of this instruction. This instruction does not apply to the Air National
Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members.



1. Objective. A PPlan is written to describe, in detail, a major action that is being accomplished below
the HQ USAF level, and focuses on major tasks and/or milestones. A PPlan can be initiated in response
to a program action directive (PAD), a program guidance letter (PGL), or HQ AFMC direction. Some
examples of when a PPlan would be useful:
   1.1. Creating a new organization.
   1.2. Transferring an organization from one command to another.
   1.3. Merging organizations.
   1.4. Transferring a mission/workload from one AFMC location to another.

2. Responsibility.
   2.1. The AFMC organization/directorate with mission responsibility for the organization being cre-
   ated/transferred/merged will determine the need for a PPlan and will develop and manage the PPlan.
   2.2. In the case of joint PPlans (a PPlan being developed jointly with another Department of Defense
   (DoD) service, major command (MAJCOM), or air logistics command {ALC}), the PPlan manager
   will coordinate with the other DoD service, MAJCOM, or ALC to develop the PPlan.
   2.3. Each organization developing a PPlan is responsible for the following:
2                                                                 AFMCI90-501 10 OCTOBER 1997

       2.3.1. Contacts all applicable AFMC organizations which will take part in the development of the
       PPlan, including the AFMC Business Area Chief Operations Officer.
       2.3.2. Ensures that each applicable AFMC organization appoints an office of primary responsibil-
       ity (OPR) to work with the organization developing the PPlan (these OPRs will be designated as
       “annex managers”). The PPlan is divided into a series of annexes which correspond to major
       organizational functions or structure (i.e., Civil Engineering, Logistics, Personnel, etc.). These
       annexes describe the new concept of operations and the transition plan from the current state to
       final organization. Associated with these annexes may be appendices, which further describe sub-
       functions and list the major actions needing to occur for implementation.
       2.3.3. If a PPlan is being written in the Headquarters, contacts HQ AFMC/XPX to receive a PPlan
       number to allow the Headquarters to track all “in house” PPlans.
       2.3.4. Sets up meeting with all annex managers and assigns each to develop an annex from their
       respective organizations that specifically describe what must be done to accomplish the task
       spelled out in the PPlan. Requests each annex manager sign their respective annex.
       2.3.5. Establishes a status reporting process to measure implementation and progress of the
       PPlan.
       2.3.6. Consolidates all annexes and format the PPlan (see attachment 1).
       2.3.7. Coordinate the PPlan with all applicable organizations.
       2.3.8. Determines appropriate signature level for the PPlan.
       2.3.9. At a minimum the organizational director or deputy director signs the PPlan.
       2.3.10. Prints and distributes the PPlan to all annex managers and any applicable organizations
       which may be affected by its accomplishment.
       2.3.11. Provides changes to the PPlan, when applicable.

3. Guidance. HQ AFMC/XPX is the OPR for this instruction, and will provide general guidance for all
AFMC written PPlans.
