     1.2. Reusable Container. A specially designed container engineered for repeated use
     without impairment of its protective function. The reusable container is intended to be used,
     saved, and reused as a complete system, excluding the wrap or barrier material. These
     containers are marked “Reusable Container, Do Not Destroy.”
        1.2.1. Long-life container. Container is usually made of metal, plastic, synthetic or
        composite materials fabricated for fragile items, usually loaded from the top.
        1.2.2. Type II Container. Container is usually made of convoluted polyurethane foam
        cushion bonded to container board and it protects items against shock while holding them
        in place.
        1.2.3. Discrete Special Packaging Instruction Container. This container is a specially
        designed reusable container for a particular commodity. This will be identified on the
        exterior of the container by Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) number, e.g., SPI 080-
        6214.
        1.2.4. Fast Pack. Families of standard size reusable containers whose design permits
        shipment of a large variety of items within certain limits of size, weight, and fragility.
        1.2.5. Standard Pack. Packs for which the packaging components, including the
        shipping container, have been standardized as to material and size. The cushioning in the
        Standard Pack is not bonded to the interior container walls.

     3.1. Reusable Fastpack Containers (Fiberboard/Cardboard). All Reusable Container
     Managers will take the following actions to obtain fastpack containers. First it is mandatory
     to check your reusable container area for the product. Second, check all other activities on
     base for reusable container availability. Third, contact Cargo Movements to see if there are
     used fastpacks available. Once it has been determined there are no containers available you
     will need to purchase the fastpack through GSA utilizing a Government Purchase Card from
     your unit or squadron.
     3.2. Wooden Containers or Crates. All Reusable Container Managers will take the
     following actions to obtain wooden reusable containers or crates. First, check your
     squadron’s reusable container area/inventory. If the container is not available in your
     inventory check with other base agencies to determine if one is available on base. If the
     container is still not available, check with Cargo Movements for a used crate. If Cargo
     Movements does not have a used container, the unit Reusable Container Manager will need
     to contact 56 LRS/LGRDDC for a constructive cost and list of materials required for
     container construction. Each unit will be responsible for purchase of materials from a local
     home improvement store or lumber yard and have the materials delivered to the cargo
     movement facility. The materials will be purchased with a unit Government Purchase Card.
     3.3. Additional resources/methods to obtain shipping containers.
        3.3.1. Crates and fastpacks can also be obtained by your Reusable Container Manager
        thru either your item manager or the government’s Re-Con warehouse at
        https://recon.wpafb.af.mil/.
        3.3.2. Any other forms of shipping and packing materials will be placed on the AF Form
        451 and all cost data will be forwarded to the 56 LRS Resource Advisor (56
        LRS/LGLOR) to initiate reimbursement actions through the appropriate squadron.
     3.4. Tenant Units. Non-56th Fighter Wing units will provide a DD Form 448, Military
     Interdepartmental Purchase Request; AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization; AF Form 406,
     Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document, or Government Purchase Card to 56
     LRS/LGLOR to pay for the replacement of reusable containers.
4. Procedures for the Reusable Container Program.
     4.1. 56 LRS.
        4.1.1. The Receiving Element will make sure items received are not separated from their
        respective containers.
        4.1.2. The Central Storage Element will ensure a reusable container remains with the
        issued item. Items placed in stock will be packed in a container.
        4.1.3. The Flight Service Center, or its equivalent unit, will verify items turned in are in
        reusable containers. If the items are turned in without reusable containers, an AF Form
        451 must be properly completed with both printed name and signature by the respective
        primary or alternate reusable container manager.
        4.1.4. When an item is received in a container that is packed by a contractor, every effort
        should be made to keep that item with that container.
LUKEAFBI24-202 12 MARCH 2012                                                                 5


  4.2. Other Units.
     4.2.1. On receipt of an item from 56 LRS, make sure the item is in a suitable container.
     A suitable container is defined as a box that can protect the property from damage. If the
     asset is not in a reusable container, an AF Form 451 must accompany the item. Turn in
     property using a reusable container or a suitable container with a properly completed AF
     Form 451. Every effort should be made to keep items in their respective containers until
     items are turned in for repair. Move repairable assets from work center to work center in
     an expedient manner and ensure proper documentation and containers accompany item
     IAW AFI21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
     4.2.2. If the containers are not immediately reused, contact the Unit Reusable Container
     Manager so the container can be properly stored. When containers are turned in for unit
     storage, all internal packaging materials should be maintained with that container.

  A5.1.8. (Item 8) Reason for Request. Check the applicable block:
     A5.1.8.1. Container Destroyed by User. Check this block when the user has disposed of
     a reusable container according to local procedures, and local reusable container program
     resources have no replacement. You may check this block for containers needed to
     replace containers that have deteriorated in storage.
     A5.1.8.2. Item Issued Without Proper Container. When turning in an unserviceable

     right corner of the container, you may use the pack for shipment or storage.
     A5.1.8.3. Item Due-Out Replacement Not Received. Check this block for Credit Due-In
     from maintenance turn-ins when the supply or reusable container program resources
     don’t have the SPI pack. If you check this block, write “turn-in” in item 16 (Remarks).
     A5.1.8.4. Initial Requirement. Check this block when units turn in items, containers are
     unavailable or replacement items came in a different SPI pack.

     supply, blocking and bracing, or pallet repair needed.
  A5.1.9. (Item 9) Item Requested.      Check this block to indicate the type of container
  required.
NOTE: TPO Pack is now SPI Pack.
  A5.1.10. (Item 10) Specifications. Enter the applicable information in the blocks. When
  you need additional room to describe the requested service, attach sufficient detail to the
  original AF Form 451 and write, “Details attached” in the remarks block.
     A5.1.10.1. Quantity. Enter the number of units required.
     A5.1.10.2. Unit. Enter “each,” “pieces,” “bags,” or any other descriptive unit of issue.
