    The Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program is prescribed in AFI 90-301. Air Force military
    and civilian members have a duty to promptly report fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA), violations of law,
    policy, procedures, or regulations, gross mismanagement, an injustice, abuse of authority, misconduct,
    inappropriate conduct, and deficiencies, or like conditions, to the appropriate supervisor or
    commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an established grievance channel.

    You have a right to file an IG complaint at any level but experience has shown that many complaints
    can be resolved through the chain of command. For this reason, although not required to, you are
    encouraged to discuss your concerns with your chain of supervision and/or commander before coming
    to the IG. If you wish to file an IG complaint, contact the base IG at:
