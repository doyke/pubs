SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include standardizing EPOS/LPU quantities for all configurations except Contingency to 40 each
and standardizes 20 man life raft quantities to 2 each. Replaces the term “Life Support” with
“Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)” where applicable. This revision also renames the training
configuration to standard configuration and gives ample leeway to add, delete, increase or
decrease equipment quantities to all configurations as needed by mission requirement. Clarifies
support roles for DD Form 365-4 Chart-C and AF Form 4100 and requires coordination on
Capstone/DV configurations 12 hours prior to execution. Standardizes baggage bin length to
eight feet. Removes requirement for obsolete AF Form 76. Moves emergency escape slide from
maintenance configuration table 1.1 to AFE configuration table 1.3. Removes the requirement
for KC-135E model publications. Increases the quantity of the 358 series mask with goggles to 6
for all configurations. Changes bottles water and cold weather rations to water packets and
Meals Ready to Eat.

     operators at all levels of command and directs KC-135 aircraft configuration for local or
     training missions, worldwide missions and contingency operations, OPLAN Alert and
     CAPSTONE/DV missions. KC-135 aircraft may also be configured as directed by command
     and control (C2) for specific mission tasking. C2 includes Wing/Group Current Operations
     in coordination with HHQ C2 entities if required to ensure proper configuration, equipment
     and crew mix.
1.2. Applicability.
     1.2.1. This chapter is applicable to all units operating or supporting KC-135 aircraft and
     provides mandatory standard configuration guidance.
1.3. Concept.
     1.3.1. Missions may be of short duration with immediate return to home station, or be to a
     specific location for an extended period of time to provide air refueling and airlift support for
     general purpose forces and strategic conventional forces. Subordinate commanders must be
     prepared to deploy KC-135 aircraft, associated equipment, personnel, and materials.
1.4. Terms. See Attachment 1.
1.5. Aircraft Configuration.
     1.5.1. Aircraft will be configured in accordance with Figure 1.1 thru Figure 1.9 unless
     command and control (C2) specific mission tasking directs otherwise. Proper aircraft
     configuration is the responsibility of the (Pilot In Command) PIC. The Boom Operator (BO)
     will have authority on all matters concerning the location and restraint of cargo and additive
     equipment and location of personnel. Like cargo, all additive equipment will be secured in
     accordance with 1C-135-9 requirements or other 550 ACSS engineering approve methods.
        1.5.1.1. For Aeromedical Evacuation configurations, refer to AFI 11-2AE Volume 3,
        Addenda A, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations, for specific instructions and equipment
        placement aboard KC-135 aircraft.

        Terminal (DUST) installation and removal, refer to T.O. 1C-135-1-1-3, Supplemental
        Flight Manual.
     1.5.2. The AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load Planning Worksheet or equivalent computer-
     generated worksheets may be used to plan and document KC-135 configurations before
     deployment or operation. If used, each unit preparing KC-135 aircraft for deployment or
     local operation will prepare two copies of the worksheet and distribute as indicated in 1.5.2.2
AFI11-2KC-135V3_ADDENDA-A 25 APRIL 2012                                                         5


     1.5.2.1. If used, the unit will initiate the AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load Planning
     Worksheet or equivalent computer-generated worksheets based on requirements
     established in this chapter or the command and control (C2) specific mission tasking.
     Annotate load planning worksheets with aircraft tail number selected for deployment.
     1.5.2.2. On completion, transmit the original to Maintenance Operations Control (MOC)
     for distribution to the on-duty maintenance production supervisor and Dash 21/AME
     section for timely aircraft load configuration. On-duty MOC/Plans Scheduling &
     Documentation (PS&D) will initiate appropriate Maintenance Data Collection system
     entries indicating the required configuration in the selected aircraft MDS automated
     AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
  1.5.3. Functions and Responsibilities.
     1.5.3.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). Ensure all life sustaining equipment is
     positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements according to Table 1.3 Actual
     preflight fitting and location of survival vests, and LPU-10/P life preservers during
     aircraft operations are the responsibility of individual crewmembers.
     1.5.3.2. Alternate Mission Equipment section (AME). Up/downloads required Dash 21
     equipment and validates positioning of the equipment as identified on AF Form 4100,
     KC-135 Load Planning Worksheet or equivalent computer-generated worksheets when
     used. Upon load completion, an AME representative signs, dates and installs the
     worksheet after the Chart C in the applicable aircraft’s supplemental weight and balance
     handbook.
     1.5.3.3. Quality Assurance (QA) Weight and Balance Technician. Provides the totaled
     weight and moment change for all additive equipment (not included on DD Form 365-3,
     Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record). The weight and moment change may be
     annotated on the AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load Planning Worksheet or equivalent
     computer-generated worksheet if used. The Load Planning Worksheet may be used as a
     temporary weight and balance change for temporarily installed equipment without
     making entries in the Chart C. The weight and moment change reflected on the Load
     Planning Worksheet will be added and totaled to the aircraft basic weight and moment
     from the Chart C. This total will be used by the BO in lieu of the Chart C final
     weight/moment entry in the Chart C when completing the DD Form 365-4, Weight and
     Balance Clearance Form F. NOTE: Each agency involved in aircraft configuration will
     furnish the current weight, cube, and dimensions data (including storage containers) to
     the weight and balance technician.
     1.5.3.4. Aircraft Crew Chief. Act as single point of contact to ensure required actions are
     completed and verified by tasked agencies. Upon return from off station operations,
     ensure the aircraft is returned to standard configuration at earliest opportunity not to
     exceed five work days. The five work day rule does not apply if the aircraft will not be
     flown during that period. In this case the aircraft will be in the proper configuration prior
     to next flight. All added equipment will be removed; under no circumstances will an
     aircraft be flown in a partial configuration (i.e. AFE equipment reconfigured and dash 21
     equipment not reconfigured).

        1.5.3.5. Operations Group Superintendent (CEM)/Senior Boom Operator or Designee.
        Act as the single point of contact within the wing for KC-135 cargo load planning.
        Determines required aircraft configurations and coordinates with applicable agencies to
        ensure compliance with paragraphs 1.5.3.1 through 1.5.3.3 above. Coordinates through
        QA to ensure the BO scheduled to fly with the aircraft is provided the updated basic
        weight/moment change reflected on the completed AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load
        Planning Worksheet or equivalent computer-generated worksheet to facilitate preparation
        of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F.
1.6. Configuration Load Planning. NOTE: On a temporary basis for a specific mission,
Standard and Contingency configurations listed in figures 1.1 through 1.4. configuration and
equipment may be modified to satisfy C2 mission requirements and crew mix. When the
configuration equipment amounts and/or locations are adjusted to meet C2 mission requirements,
the tasked unit must ensure the appropriate functional areas are coordinated with to confirm the
equipment is onboard, i.e. life sustaining equipment, shoring equipment, tie-down devices, bins,
etc. Annotate configuration changes on AF Form 4100, KC-135 Load Planning Worksheet or
equivalent computer-generated worksheet when used or aircraft Chart C.
     1.6.1. Standard Configuration. Figure 1.1, depicts the standard configuration will be used to
     the maximum extent possible to minimize flying with excess weight and may be modified as
     needed for training, steady-state deployments, off-station, cargo and unique unit missions and
     when C2 does not direct a specific configuration.
     1.6.2. Contingency configuration. Figure 1.3 depicts the initial configuration for aircraft
     tasked to participate in contingency and bare-base deployment operations.
     1.6.3. OPLAN Alert configuration. Figure 1.5, depicts the configuration for aircraft
     participating in OPLAN/FLAG Alert operations and may be modified to meet taskings.
     1.6.4. CAPSTONE/DV Support configuration. Figure 1.7, depicts the recommended
     configuration for aircraft participating in CAPSTONE/DV support.             Configuration
     coordination and verification between operations, maintenance and protocol and other offices
     as necessary will occur 12 hours prior to mission execution.
     1.6.5. A/M135 Roller Configuration. Figure 1.9, depicts the configuration for aircraft
     utilizing the A/M135 roller handling system.
     1.6.6. Unit-level operations along with maintenance and support functions must ensure KC-
     135 aircraft are properly configured in accordance with this chapter. Units will prepare
     aircraft configuration worksheets, Figure 1.1 thru Figure 1.9, based on the configuration
     required. Aircraft configurations may be amended by specific command and control (C2)
     mission tasking. AFE will prepare AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment.
     Each affected agency is responsible for the actual aircraft configuration check. Units may
     utilize locally developed or approved computer products as the configuration checklist.
        1.6.6.1. When used, two copies of the aircraft configuration worksheet prepared by the
        originating unit will accompany all aircraft to off station employment locations. One
        copy will be filed on top of the DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance
        Record. The second copy is used at the off station employment location to verify arrival
        or re-deployment configuration of the aircraft and to provide aircraft weight and balance
        data for mission planning.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_ADDENDA-A 25 APRIL 2012                                                         7


      1.6.6.2. The off station employment location will notify the originating unit of
      configuration discrepancies.
1.7. Aircraft Configuration Waivers. Follow waiver protocol in AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3
paragraph 1.4.
1.8. Supply Accountability. See AFMAN 23-110V2, Standard Base Supply Customer
Procedures, for accountability and transfer provisions, except when specific command and
control (C2) mission tasking provides additional guidance.
1.9. Corner Braces And Cargo/Baggage Bins And Tie-Down Shackles.
   1.9.1. Local manufacture of corner braces for cargo/baggage bins per the instructions listed
   in this chapter is authorized. Bins are constructed with 3/4 inch Douglas fir plywood. Secure
   bins in aircraft IAW Figure 1.13
   1.9.2. Operations personnel must identify specific needs for braces on other deployments
   and missions and coordinate with appropriate maintenance agencies for number and
   availability of devices.
   1.9.3. The maintenance squadron Dash 21 section will store and control braces when not in
   use.
   1.9.4. These devices will enhance safety and improve operational capability of KC-135
   aircraft in the cargo and passenger environment. In order to implement this program, units
   should comply with the following instructions:
      1.9.4.1. Air refueling squadron. Based on previous off station requirements and known
      contingency commitments determine total number of braces required and coordinate the
      total requirement with the AME section.
      1.9.4.2. At off station locations, evaluate the need for storing additional devices to build
      more baggage bins if needed.
   1.9.5. In order to utilize these devices, pre-cut plywood shoring for each bin as follows:
      1.9.5.1. Forward and aft ends of bin. Utilize 3 feet by 4 feet pieces of plywood. Units
      may opt to use 4 foot wide bins. Bin top pieces must be cut to match bin width. In order
      to exercise this new size option do not discard serviceable 3 foot by 4 foot plywood end
      pieces until deemed unserviceable. Sides of bin will utilize a full 4 foot by 8 foot
      plywood sheets.
      1.9.5.2. Top of bin. Utilize one 3 foot by 8 foot piece of plywood. Experience has proven
      that pre-cut shoring won’t degrade operational requirement of providing adequate shoring
      material for cargo requirements. If the option to increase bin sizes in paragraph 1.9.5.1 is
      used, the bin top size will be a full (4 X 8 feet) sheet of plywood.
   1.9.6. For planning purposes, use the following weights for empty bins
      1.9.6.1. Bins constructed 3 feet in width are approximately 250 pounds each to include
      corner braces.
      1.9.6.2. Bins constructed 4 feet in width are approximately 285 pounds each to include
      corner braces.

Notes:
1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume
protection for aircrew personnel. Masks will be positioned at P, CP, N, IP, BO FWD and BO Boom
Pod duty stations.
2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Preposition
additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads.
3. MIL-G-635 goggles will be uploaded as sets, and placed above the NAV table, to back-fill for
missing or defective sets of EEU-series goggles. EEU series/ (PLTZ) goggles, if used will be placed
on the floor behind the pilot left and right seats and left of the Nav/Boom seat. Units having partial
PLZT Goggle capability will configure aircraft with a full complement of 3 ea MIL-G-635 Goggles
and 3 ea PLZT Goggles.
4. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one
LPU for each passenger.
5. LPU-10/Ps are required to integrate with AFE equipment and are designed for use by aircrew
personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be a substitute for
these LPUs.
6. The restraint harness is required for in-flight aircraft hatch inspections.
7. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items on the ground while waiting for
rescue or return to duty.
8. For live-aboard accommodations, refer to OPLAN Alert. Water and Rations will be uploaded
IAW OPLAN Alert. Units will establish aircraft live-aboard capability consisting of 3 cases of cold
weather rations (CW)/MREs and 1,800 ounces of water as a minimum IAW AMCI 10-450, Volume
3, Support of Nuclear Planning and Operations (classified). This will allow aircrew to reside on the
aircraft for a minimum of three days at forward operating locations in support of OPLAN Alert.
During live-aboard conditions, carbon monoxide detectors are required for all models of KC-135
aircraft.
9. Aircraft flying over water (outside of gliding distance) to PDM will load one 20-person life raft
and four LPU-10/Ps.
10. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position AFE equipment on each aircraft IAW
permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining aircraft, including PDM aircraft, will contact the
losing organization and initiate transfer of required AFE and inspection records. The gaining
organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to
include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1,
