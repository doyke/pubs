Garrison, Fort Bragg. The 440th Operations Group Commander is responsible to the 440
AW/CC for the daily execution of SAA duties and responsibilities.
1.2. Scope. The rules and instructions herein are issued to promote the safe, orderly, and
expeditious movement of air traffic in Pope Air Traffic Control (ATC) airspace. Pilots and air
traffic controllers are expected to exercise their best judgment if they encounter situations not
covered in this instruction. Commanders of assigned and transient units will ensure their
personnel understand and comply with applicable chapters of this instruction, memorandums of
agreement, appropriate command directives, and aircraft technical orders. These instructions
supplement basic responsibilities defined in Air Force and FAA directives.
1.3. Administration and Waivers. The 440th Operations Group Commander (440 OG/CC) is
responsible for this instruction. The 440 OG/CC may issue waivers or immediate action changes
to this instruction when necessary for accomplishment of normal or special mission
requirements. All procedural changes affecting air traffic control must be sent to the MAJCOM
OPR (AFRC/A3VA) for ATC for review and approval before implementation. Changes to this
instruction will be discussed and tracked at least annually using the Airfield Operations Board
forum. The Airfield Operations Manager (AOM) will consolidate inputs and conduct
coordination to implement the proposed changes. Depending on urgency, a change notice may
be implemented at any time prior to the annual review.
1.4. Command and Control. The 440 OG/CC exercises command and control of local and
transient flying operations through the Pope Command Post on 381.3 (257.1 alternate).
1.5. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) Accounts. Pope Airfield Management
Operations (440 OSS/OSAA) manages the FLIPs account for Airfield Management Operations,
Pope Tower, Weather, En Route Operations, Command Post, and Combat Controllers. All other

1.8. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Alerting Procedures. The 440th Airlift Wing
BASH Program is conducted IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program;
AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Management Techniques; and 440th
Airlift Wing PLAN 91-212, BASH.
   1.8.1. During flight operations, the 440 OG/CC authorizes the Airfield Manager or
   designated representative to upgrade/downgrade Bird/Deer Watch Conditions at Pope Field.
   However, authority to downgrade from condition SEVERE will remain solely with the 440
   OG/CC or designated representative. Conditions can be declared based on observations,
   pilot reports, and/or radar identification.
   1.8.2. If an aircrew observes or encounters any bird/deer activity, which constitutes a hazard,
   the aircrew will contact Air Traffic Control (ATC), Pope Command Post, or Range Control
   and request the observed activity be passed on to Pope Field Airfield Management. The
   request will include the following information:
      1.8.2.1. Call Sign
      1.8.2.2. Location
      1.8.2.3. Altitude
      1.8.2.4. Time of sighting
      1.8.2.5. Type of bird (if known)
      1.8.2.6. Approximate number of bird/deer
      1.8.2.7. Behavior and direction of movement (soaring/grazing, flying/moving to or from
      a location, etc.)
   1.8.3. The following terminology will be used for rapid communication to disseminate bird
   activity and implement unit operational procedures.
      1.8.3.1. Bird/Deer Watch Condition LOW: Wildlife activity on and around theairfield
      representing low potential for strikes. Continue with normal operating procedures for all
      locations.
      1.8.3.2. Bird/Deer Watch Condition MODERATE: Wildlife activity near the active
      runway or other specific location representing increased potential for strikes.
      MODERATE requires increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors and caution by
      aircrews
          1.8.3.2.1. Traffic Pattern. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when
          departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Fighter-type aircraft formation
          takeoffs and formation landings are prohibited. Local traffic activity is prohibited.
          1.8.3.2.2. Ranges/Training Areas. Changes in flight profile or altitudes will be made
          to avoid bird hazards.

        1.8.3.2.3. Low-level Routes. Amendments to flight altitude will be made to
        minimize bird hazards. C-130s should limit formation flying to a minimum for
        mission/training requirements.
     1.8.3.3. Bird/Deer Watch Condition SEVERE: Wildlife activity on or immediately
     above the active runway or other specific location representing high potential for strikes.
     Supervision and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting
     operations in areas under condition SEVERE.
        1.8.3.3.1. Traffic Pattern. All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver authority
        is 440 OG/CC.
        1.8.3.3.2. Ranges/Training Areas. A specific area and altitude will be identified.
        That area will be avoided by all flights using the range/area.
        1.8.3.3.3. Low-level Routes.     Specific routes or segments and altitudes will be
        specified and avoided.
        1.8.3.3.4. Additional information on the BASH program can be found in 440 AW 91-
        212, Bird Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH).

        2.2.1.1. The first 1000’ of Runway 23 and the first 300’ of Runway 05 are
                concrete, with the middle 6201’ being asphalt. The overruns are weight bearing
        and usable for takeoff and landing roll. Note: 180 degree turns are not authorized on
        the asphalt portions of the runway for aircraft larger than C-130. No 180 degrees turns
        are allowed on the asphalt portions of the runway when the outside air temperature
        exceeds 85 degrees F/30 degrees C.
        2.2.1.2. Pope has one asphalt Landing Zone (LZ):

   2.2.2. Taxiway Description. Taxiways are identified by the letters A through S. All
   taxiways are 75’ wide except Taxiways C, E, and F are 40’ wide and Taxiway D North is
   100’ wide (See Attachment 2). Taxi restrictions can be obtained from Airfield Management,
   910-394-6510.
   2.2.3. Instrument Hold Lines/Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Areas. The ILS
   critical areas (glideslope and localizer) are depicted in Attachment 2. Painted instrument
   hold lines and lighted instrument hold signs are located on Taxiway B to protect the
   NAVAID critical areas. Additionally, an Instrument hold line is painted near the east end of
   Taxiway A to protect the Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). Pope Tower shall protect
   the ILS critical areas IAW AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs and
   FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
2.3. Runway Selection. Runway 23 is the primary runway when there is a tailwind component
of 10 knots or less. The tower supervisor will select the active runway based on the tailwind.
Note: Runway 23 is also the primary instrument runway.
2.4. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and/or Runway Condition Reading (RCR)
Values. Airfield Management is responsible for reporting RSC and RCR. The RSC can be
reported as Dry, Wet, Slush, Loose Snow, Packed Snow, or Ice (if standing water or freezing
precipitation is present it is measured to the nearest 1/10th inch). In accordance with AFI 13-
204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, paragraph 18.2.1, when water is the only
form of visible moisture on the runway, the RSC is reported as “wet runway;” when slush is on
the runway and snow or ice are not present, the RCS is reported as “slush on the runway.” RCR
will not be reported when water or slush is the only form of precipitation on the runway. The
RCR will be reported as a two digit number (00-25) that indicates reduced braking action when
freezing precipitation is present.
   2.4.1. RCR data can be converted as follows:
        2.4.1.1. Less than or equal to 05 = NIL
        2.4.1.2. 06 to 11 = POOR
        2.4.1.3. 12 to 17 = FAIR

       204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, Chapter 18 and T.O. 33-123.
2.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA is defined as any portion of the airfield
requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for
access. This is in lieu of the Movement Area as defined in FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. At
Pope, the CMA consists of the runway, overruns, landing zone, portions of taxiways between
runway edge and the VFR hold lines and all areas of the infield encompassed within these. All
areas within 175’ of the northwest runway edge and within 275’ of the southeast edge are
protected by the VFR hold lines. The solid red lines surrounding the runway on Attachment 2
depict the CMA.
   2.5.1. Pope shall control all vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the CMA. Direct radio
   approval from Pope Tower is required prior to entering the CMA or crossing the active
   runway and continuous two-way radio contact must be maintained with Pope Tower while in
   the area. Command Post approval to enter the restricted area does not authorize vehicles to
   enter the CMA.
       2.5.1.1. Only drivers trained by an Airfield Driving Program Manager at Pope and
       licensed by Pope Airfield Management are authorized to drive on the airfield at Pope.
       Training requirements include completion of the Airfield Driving computer based
       training, 440 AWI 13-213, Airfield Driving Program familiarization, day and night
       orientations, and successful completion of a closed book test.
       2.5.1.2. The host unit is responsible to provide training to temporarily assigned
       personnel, to include contractors. In the event the host unit does not have an Airfield
       Driving Program, Airfield Management will conduct the training. Note: Pope Tower is
       the only approval authority for activities within 100 feet of the edge of the runway.
   2.5.2. CMA and airfield driving procedures outlined in 440 AWI 13-213, Airfield Driving
   Program include:
       2.5.2.1. Airfield Management, flightline agency, and unit commander responsibilities for
       control of vehicle/pedestrian operations on the airfield

   2.5.3. Vehicles and personnel operating outside the CMA are solely responsible for
   observing and giving way to taxiing or towed aircraft. Personnel should use extreme caution
   while operating in these areas.
   2.5.4. Recall of Vehicles From Runway/Controlled Movement Area. After personnel are
   directed to exit the runway, they shall proceed without delay to an area behind established
   hold lines, unless instructed otherwise. Advise Pope Tower once all personnel, vehicles and
   equipment are behind the line or other specified withdrawal distance.
   2.5.5. If in the event of radio failure and it becomes necessary for Pope Tower to evacuate
   personnel from the runway/Controlled Movement Area, Pope Tower will first attempt
   contact using established ATC light gun signals. If this fails, Pope Tower will cycle the
   runway lights from lowest to highest setting to signal a loss of radio communication.
   Observing the lights cycle, individuals on the runway shall exit the runway immediately and
   attempt to contact Pope Tower. Once off the runway, vehicles will face the control tower
   and flash its headlights to confirm they are off of the runway. Pope Tower may notify
   Airfield Management, Fire Department or any vehicle on the ramp to assist, as needed.
   2.5.6. Tower Net. Pope Tower continuously monitors the VHF Tower Net. If unable to
       contact Pope Tower on the net, contact Airfield Management and they will notify Pope
   Tower to monitor the Tower Net as required. The Tower Net is for vehicle operations within
   or across the CMA, not for general communication.
   2.5.7. Crash Net. Pope Tower continuously monitors the Crash Net. If unable to contact
   Pope Tower on the net, contact Airfield Management and they will notify Pope Tower to
   monitor the Crash Net as required. The Crash Net is for fire vehicle operations within or
   across the CMA, not for general communication.
   2.5.8. Aircraft Movement Area is defined as the CMA plus all taxiways. Pope Tower shall
   control all aircraft traffic, taxied or towed, in the Aircraft Movement Area. Direct radio
   approval from Pope Tower is required for all aircraft traffic, taxied or towed, prior to
   entering the Aircraft Movement Area and continuous radio contact must be maintained with
   Pope Tower while in the area.
   2.5.9. On all parking ramps (non-Movement Area), the Aircraft Commander is ultimately
   responsible for observing and de-conflicting with other aircraft movement. Pilots shall
   contact Pope Ground prior to taxiing so that Ground can advise of any aircraft inbound to
   the same taxi lane and also advise of any traffic/flight plan delays which may warrant the
   pilot holding in chocks.
2.6. Runway/Taxiway Lighting. Pope Tower operates airfield lighting IAW FAAO JO
7110.65, Section 3-4. Airfield Management monitors the status of the airfield lighting system;
all observed outages should be reported immediately. Airfield lighting at Pope Field includes:

Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI);      Runway distance remaining markers
left of runway only
Sequence Flashing Lights (SFL)
Note: Taxiway lights are three-step, standard blue lights. Landing zone has three-step
runway lights (See Attachment 13).
   2.6.1. The rotating beacon is located on the Southeast side of the runway, midfield,
   approximately 1/2 mile from centerline.
   2.6.2. Operation of the Pope Field airfield lighting system may be reduced as a part of the
   base-wide energy conservation program. Normally, runway/taxiway lights will be operated
   between sunset and sunrise, or in less than VFR conditions, as follows:
        2.6.2.1. Runway Lights for Departing Aircraft: Before the aircraft taxies onto the
                runway and until it leaves the Class “C” surface area, or until the pilot no longer
        needs them.
        2.6.2.2. Runway Lights for Arriving Aircraft: Before an IFR aircraft begins final
        approach or a VFR aircraft enters the Class “C” surface area, until it taxies off the
        runway. Pilots may request/recommend lighting intensity adjustment.
        2.6.2.3. Taxiway Lights: Before an aircraft enters the taxiway (normally at the time taxi
        information is issued) until the aircraft taxies onto the runway. Arrivals use reverse
        procedures.
   2.6.3. Infrared (IR) lighting is installed on Runway 23 and the LZ for Night Vision Device
   (NVD) training. The lighting is solar powered and therefore should be available for use
   during nighttime NVD operations. See section 5.28 for detailed NVD procedures.
2.7. Ramp Lighting. For energy conservations purposes, ramp lighting should only be turned
on when aircraft occupy the aircraft ramps. If aircraft are parked on any portion of the ramp(s),
only the lights adjacent to that aircraft will be operated in a staggered sequence (every other
light). Empty ramps will have all stadium lights turned off. Energy conservation efforts will be
second to safety; if at any time Weapons System Security (WSS) or Maintenance personnel
determine the need for additional illumination; the requested lighting will be turned on.
   2.7.1. Airfield Management shall maintain control of all ramp lighting. Requests to amend
   established ramp light standards shall be made through the Command Post at 910-394-9000.
   2.7.2. Weapons System Security will request supplemental lighting (“Light-Alls”) for
   adverse weather conditions or for aircraft requiring a higher protection level (than PL 3/4) via
   Command Post.
   2.7.3. At least weekly, WSS will conduct a check of all ramp lighting. WSS will contact
   Airfield Management to request all ramp lights be turned on. Upon termination of the check,
   WSS will contact Airfield Management to inform them the check is complete. WSS will
 18                                                          440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


   annotate any discrepancies and ensure repairs are coordinated as necessary. Weekly checks
   will be annotated in the WSS daily blotter.
2.8. Traffic Control Signals on Perimeter Roads. Two sets of traffic control signals are
located beyond each end of the runway ( and ). These lights are controlled by . Traffic will be
stopped for the following reasons:
   2.8.1. Hurst Drive:
       2.8.1.1. When any aircraft departing Runway 05 requests takeoff roll from the Runway
       05 underrun.
       2.8.1.2. Not later than final approach fix for inbound aircraft on an ILS approach when
       the weather is less than an 800’ AGL ceiling and/or visibility less than 2 miles.
       2.8.1.3. When an arriving in-flight emergency reaches a point 10 flying miles from
       Runway 23/05, or at an appropriate distance as determined by the Tower Controller in
       Charge (CIC).
       2.8.1.4. When unsafe gun conditions are declared on Red Ramp Hot Spot 5 or on
       taxiway N.
   2.8.2. Reilly Road:
       2.8.2.1. When any turboprop or turbojet aircraft larger than A-10 or aircraft with
       afterburner capability requests takeoff roll from the Runway 23 underrun.
       2.8.2.2. Not later than final approach fix for inbound aircraft on an ILS approach when
       the weather is less than an 800’ AGL ceiling and/or visibility less than 2 miles.
       2.8.2.3. When an arriving in-flight emergency reaches a point 10 flying miles from
       Runway 23/05 or at an appropriate distance as determined by the Tower CIC.
   2.8.3. Traffic Signal Outages. When traffic signals are malfunctioning or inoperative, Pope
   Tower shall notify the Directorate of Emergency Services (I2MC) by direct line when traffic
   must be stopped.
   2.8.4. PMO Desk Sergeant shall:
       2.8.4.1. When notified by Pope Tower, dispatch available patrols to stop traffic at
                each stop light in both directions at the affected end of the runway.
       EXCEPTION: When only one patrol is available, the patrol will stop traffic on one side
       of the runway and then position themselves at the opposite side of the runway to block
       traffic.
       2.8.4.2. During parachute drop operations over the airfield, the Directorate of Emergency
       Services (I2MC) will dispatch available patrols to stop traffic as appropriate. In the event
       Military Police (MP) cannot respond; the Tower CIC will notify Airfield Operations
       which will assist.
2.9. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs).
   2.9.1. Preventative Maintenance Inspection (PMI) schedule is provided in the Table 2.4 and
   DoD IFR En Route Supplement. Any PMI outside of these scheduled times will be
   coordinated through the AOM or Air Traffic Manager (ATM). Reporting of malfunctions,

   2.9.2. Generator Power. All NAVAIDs have attached generators IAW AFI 32-1062,
   Electrical Power Plants and Generators and AFI 32-1063, Electrical Power Systems. The
   generators are on an automatic start system. Procedures are in place to provide manual start
   if needed.
   2.9.3. Airfield Systems (AF SYS).
       2.9.3.1. The 440th Communications Flight will advise Pope Tower of any
       interruptions/malfunctions to Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS).
       2.9.3.2. When an ATCALS facility fails, Pope Tower shall advise aircraft under their
       control, Fayetteville Approach Control, and Airfield Management. Airfield Management
       will issue a NOTAM as required.
   2.9.4. Civil Use of Air Force ATCALS. Civilian aircraft are authorized to fly published IFR
   approaches for practice if it will not interfere with military traffic. All practice approaches
   shall terminate with low approach only.
2.10. Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service (D-ATIS).
   2.10.1. Pope Tower will normally operate the D-ATIS 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It can
   be obtained via the published UHF/VHF frequencies; it can also be obtained by phone at
   394-2847.
   2.10.2. Blanket ATIS broadcasts are authorized for rapidly changing weather conditions.
2.11. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. The fire lane located east of
taxiway Delta and south of the LZ is unusable to aircraft and is marked as a closed taxiway.
There is also a permanently closed taxiway located in the corner of Taxiway Mike and Taxiway
Alpha (see Attachment 2). The closed taxiway is marked appropriately and can be used only by
vehicles.
2.12. Airfield Maintenance. All airfield maintenance will be coordinated through the Airfield
Manager. Directorate of Public Works (DPW) is responsible to provide adequate resources to
properly maintain the airfield IAW UFC 3-260-01, Army Class B Airfield Unified Facilities
Criteria, other DOD/FAA directives as appropriate. All sweeper operations, grass mowing, and
 20                                                            440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


general maintenance operations on the airfield environment will be coordinated/directed through
the Airfield Manager.
2.13. Aircraft Arresting Systems. None.
2.14. Pope Field Parking Plan. (See Attachments 4 - 7). All aircraft parking areas are under
the operational control of 440 OG/CC. Airfield Management is the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) for parking aircraft on Pope Field.
      2.14.1. 43AG En Route Operations is the OPR for forecasting requirements, planning, and
      development of the airfield parking plan for exercises, contingencies and joint training
      operations with Airfield Management approval. Parking plans will be distributed to Airfield
      Management, Command Post, MOC, 43 AMXS, TA, Pope Tower and other agencies, on a
      daily basis.      The schedule will normally be available by 1700L; it can be
      reviewed/downloaded off of the En Route Operations Enterprise Information Management
      (EIM) site. Parking for airlift aircraft is restricted to the Silver, Blue, Green, Yellow, and
      Red ramps. In emergencies, the 43 AMXS Production Supervisor, through MOC, issues
      parking. Airfield Manager has final authority on exact aircraft parking to maximize the use
      of the fuel pit hydrant system. Note: Units conducting JA/ATTs, JOAX, OREs, ORIs or
      any other exercise are required to use the ramp parking plan developed by En Route
      Operations in coordination with Airfield Management. The plan will be controlled by the
      Command and Control authority, normally the Pope Command Post.
   2.14.2. Parking Ramps. The airfield is divided into five main parking areas: Silver, Green,
   Blue, Yellow, and Red ramps. Each ramp is subdivided into rows labeled alphabetically, and
   parking spots in each row are numbered beginning with the spot nearest the runway with the
   exception to the Red Ramp in which numbering begins on the western most spot. Contact 43
   AMXS Quality Assurance for information on jack spots. Aircraft being on/off-loaded with
   non-hazardous, heavy equipment shall use Green Ramp or Blue Ramp whenever possible.
   Note: C-17 and C-5 aircraft require 25’ minimum wingtip clearance from other parked
   aircraft. All refueler aircraft (KC-10/KC-135) require a minimum of 50’ wingtip clearance
   from other parked aircraft.
         2.14.2.1. Silver Ramp lies directly in front of Hangars 4 and 5, and is used primarily for
         Distinguished Visitor parking. Silver ramp includes rows AA, BB, and the Transient
         Row. Coordination with Airfield Management is required prior to using the Silver Ramp.
         In turn, Airfield Management will contact Transient Alert once approved. The following
         configurations are authorized on Silver Ramp:
             2.14.2.1.1. Three C-130 aircraft may be positioned on BB Row.
             2.14.2.1.2. One C-17/Equivalent/Commercial aircraft may be positioned on BB row.
         2.14.2.2. Green Ramp consists of rows P and R, and is used primarily for JA/ATT and
         exercise activity. Green Ramp may be used for parking transient aircraft if JA/ATT and
         exercise activity allow. Requests for parking in this area must be coordinated with En
         Route parking representative, or Airfield Management/Pope Command Post when time
         does not permit coordination through En Route Operations. When transient aircraft
         parking is necessary, higher numbered spots on row P will be used. The following
         configurations are authorized for Green Ramp:
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                  21


        2.14.2.2.1. Ten C-130 aircraft may be parked on each P and R rows. In the event of
        a contingency, with abnormal parking procedures in effect, Green Ramp will hold up
        to 36 C-130s if no other aircraft type is on the ramp. Wing walkers are required for
        this operation. C-17 and C-130 aircraft share the same nose spot on Green Ramp,
        designated by a yellow rectangle.
        2.14.2.2.2. Ten C-17/equivalent/commercial aircraft may be parked on each P and R
        rows.
        2.14.2.2.3. Six C-5/Wide-Body spots exist, designated by yellow rectangle. Green
        Ramp C-5/Wide-Body spots can support either SW or NE aircraft orientation and
        have pit hydrant refueling. C-5/Wide-Body direction of parking will be shown on the
        En Route Operations daily parking plan. C-5/Wide-Body aircraft require follow-me
        on the spots due to abnormal taxi procedures (no taxi-in lines). Note: Wide Body
        spots P1-3 are not to be utilized unless the following coordination has been
        accomplished.      1) MOC shall coordinate with the 440 AMXS to ensure Oscar row
        is empty for the duration of the wide body time on station.    2) Wing walkers and a
        follow me must be provided for the non-standard taxi procedures through Oscar row
        to provide sufficient aircraft wing tip clearance.         3) Notification to Airfield
        Operations that Wide body parking is in affect for P1-3.      4) Airfield Management
        sends Local NOTAM for Non-Standard taxing procedures for entering P parking
        rows.
        2.14.2.2.4. Current usable fuel pits: Five fuel pits are operational on Romeo Row.
        All fuel pits are operational, however, until the fuel hydrant system is realigned to an
        updated parking plan, aircraft requiring fuel pit service will have to be off-set from
        these pre-designated parking spots; this constitutes abnormal parking. En Route
        Operations has final authority after consulting with Airfield management on exact
        aircraft parking to maximize the use of the fuel pit hydrant system.
        2.14.2.2.5. Commercial aircraft are not to be parked on R1 except for B747. KC135
        are not to be parked on R 5-10, due to low hanging engines in close proximity to an
        above ground obstruction (fuel emergency shutoff valve). Note: Row alignments on
        Green and Blue Ramps change for KC-10/C-5/C-17 and commercial aircraft because
        of their size and taxi clearance requirements.
     2.14.2.3. Blue Ramp is the primary parking location for locally assigned C-130s, and
     consists of rows G through O. Parking on this ramp is coordinated through the CP/MOC,
     Comm 910-394-9031, DSN 424-9031.
     2.14.2.4. Yellow Ramp is adjacent to the control tower on the southeast side of the
     runway and supports 427 Special Operations Squadron aircraft and customers. Follow-
     me service and/or marshaler are required for all (non 427 SOS) aircraft movement on
     Yellow Ramp. Ground Control will not allow aircraft to enter Yellow Ramp without a
     follow-me/marshaler and approval from Airfield Management.
        2.14.2.4.1. Five C-130 aircraft can be parked on Yellow Ramp, leaving a taxi lane
        between Taxiways D and G, in front of the parked aircraft. C-130 parking on Yellow
        Ramp is designated by a yellow square.
22                                                         440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


        2.14.2.4.2. Four C-17/Equivalent/Commercial can be parked on Yellow Ramp. C-17
        parking on Yellow Ramp is designated by a yellow hourglass.
        2.14.2.4.3. The taxi lane leading from Yellow Ramp to the Golden Knights Ramp is
        closed to C-130 and larger aircraft.      Note 1: Other MDS besides C-130s may park
        on Yellow Ramp. The parking will be non-standard and only authorized by Airfield
        Management.        Note 2: Due to the dimensions of the ramp, a maximum of five C-
        130 or four C-17 or two C-5 aircraft can park at any one time. When parking
        dissimilar aircraft, pay attention to parking configuration, taxi ingress route and MHE
        considerations. If all C-130 or C-17 spots are utilized at once, the last aircraft to park
        will have to “back” into or be “pushed” back into its spot due to lack of an ingress
        taxi route. This does not apply if maximizing the C-5 spots as they are afforded a taxi
        ingress path.
     2.14.2.5. Red Ramp is located in the southwest corner of the airfield accessible by
     Taxiways Kilo, Lima, Hotel, Romeo, and Sierra. It consists of six hazardous cargo
     parking spots (1-6). During routine operations, all explosive-loaded aircraft shall be
     parked on Red Ramp Hot Spots 1-6 (see para. 9.3.4. for hazardous cargo restrictions).
     Red Ramp may be used for overflow parking as long as appropriate distances are
     maintained between hot and cold loads. For example, if a hot aircraft is parked on HS 1
     or 6, the cold aircraft must be parked at the opposite end of the ramp on HS 6 or 1,
     respectively. The Red ramp was designed to accommodate six C-5 aircraft; as such, there
     are six universal spots during normal operations (hot cargo).            The following
     configurations are authorized on Red Ramp:
        2.14.2.5.1. C-130s may be parked on the Red ramp on any of the six designated
        hazardous cargo spots. In the event of a contingency, with abnormal parking
        procedures in effect, Red ramp will hold up to 26 C-130s if no other aircraft type is
        on the ramp. Wing walkers would be required for this operation. Refer to Pope
        Safety Center for additional guidance. C-130 and C-17 aircraft share the same nose
        spot, designated by a yellow hourglass.
        2.14.2.5.2. Six C17s may park on Red Ramp and utilize the universal fuel hydrants.
        During contingencies, up to eight C-17s may be parked on the Red ramp. C-130 and
        C-17 aircraft share the same nose spot, designated by a yellow hourglass.
        2.14.2.5.3. Six C-5s may be parked on the Hazardous Cargo parking spots. C-5
        parking on Red Ramp is designated by a yellow octagon.                 Note 1: Any
        concerns/issues regarding use of the Red ramp should be addressed to both Airfield
        Management and Pope Safety Center. All aircraft carrying hazardous material need
        to contact En Route Operations prior to arrival for special parking and handling
        considerations.        Note 2: Pope Tower, Pope Command Post, and Pope Safety
        Center approval is required prior to conducting training on the fire training pit. Fire
        training in the pit shall be disapproved when hot cargo is located anywhere on the Hot
        Spots. Note 3: Non-load bearing surfaces are located on each end of Red Ramp
        (asphalt portions) and appropriately marked with descriptive surface markings (See
        Attachment 2).
     2.14.2.6. Silver Ramp consists of rows A through D. Parking on this ramp is
     coordinated by Airfield Management, Comm. 910-394-6510, DSN 424-6510.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                    23


       2.14.2.7. The Airborne Special Operations Test Directorate parking area (ACE Board) is
       adjacent to the Yellow Ramp, directly in front of the Special Operations Airborne Test
       Directorate building. Coordination with Airfield Management is required prior to using
       the ACE Board.
           2.14.2.7.1. One C-130 can be parked on the ACE Board. Taxi requirements for
           Yellow Ramp (above) also apply to the ACE Board.
           2.14.2.7.2. One C-17/equivalent commercial can be parked on the ACE Board with
           follow-me or with the assistance of a marshaler.  Note 1: C-130 and C-17 aircraft
           share the same nose spot, designated by a yellow hourglass.  Note 2: C-130 and
           larger aircraft must park facing southwest on the ACE Board to protect taxiing
           Golden Knight aircraft.
       2.14.2.8. The Golden Knights Ramp is located southwest of the ACE Board, abeam
       Taxiway G. Only U.S. Army Golden Knights aircraft and aircraft hosted by the Golden
       Knights are to be parked on this ramp.
2.15. Taxi Restrictions. (Ref. AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground).
If an obstruction is within 25’ on one side only, a wing-walker is only required at that wing tip.
Aircraft Commanders are responsible for recognizing taxi conditions requiring
marshaling/Follow-Me assistance and making such requests at least 10 minutes prior to taxi.
Aircraft with wingspan wider than a C-17 (170 FT) are prohibited on Twy Alpha between Twy
Hotel and Twy Delta.
   2.15.1. Silver Ramp. Silver ramp requires a nose marshaler and/or wing-walker(s) prior to
   parking on this ramp. Unfamiliar aircraft may request Follow-Me assistance through Pope
   Ground Control or Pilot-to-Dispatch (Airfield Management). Silver Ramp has apron edge
   markings (double yellow line).
   2.15.2. Green Ramp.
       2.15.2.1. Prior to entering Green Ramp, all aircraft shall contact Pope Command Post on
       UHF frequency 381.3 or 257.1 to coordinate/validate assigned parking, as necessary. If
       needed, Follow-Me assistance shall also be requested through Pope Command Post.
       Aircraft may experience a brief delay if making a short-notice request.
       2.15.2.2. When heavy class aircraft are parked on Green Ramp, abnormal parking
       conditions may exist (see paragraph 2.16).
       2.15.2.3. If a C-17 or larger is parked on spot R-1, C-5 aircraft must enter R-Row
       parking via Taxiway M. (When R-1 is occupied there is insufficient wingtip clearance
       for a C-5 aircraft to pass on Taxiway A).
       2.15.2.4. If engines will be shut down, the aircraft will be marshaled into the assigned
       parking spot, either by a nose marshaler or crew member. Aircraft may maneuver to
       occupy a Green Ramp parking spot on a temporary basis (i.e. seat swap, ERO, taxi
       sequencing, departure timing), engines running, without marshaler assistance. Wing
       walkers are always required if within 25’ of other aircraft or flight-line equipment.
   2.15.3. Blue Ramp (J through O Rows).
 24                                                           440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


       2.15.3.1. Locally based C-130s taxiing between rows of aircraft may proceed without a
       marshaler or wing-walker when on fixed taxi routes and the only obstructions are C-130
       aircraft in designated parking spots.
       2.15.3.2. Fire bottles and ground equipment must be set at least 10’ from the taxing
       aircraft’s wingtips. If obstacles are within the white safety boxes, the taxiing aircraft will
       have at least 10’ clearance.
       2.15.3.3. Locally based C-130s taxiing into or out of a designated parking spot require a
       nose marshaler. If an aircraft or ground equipment is within 25’ on either side, a wing-
       walker is required on the affected wingtip. This wing walker is not required if all
       equipment is located within the white safety box.
       2.15.3.4. At all times, day or night, ground equipment shall be positioned within the
       white boxes during aircraft marshaling. This will ensure an unobstructed taxi/egress
       path.
2.16. Abnormal Taxiing/Parking. Abnormal taxiing/parking exists any time an aircraft has to
deviate from the painted taxi lines to maintain clearance from obstructions and other aircraft.
During abnormal taxiing/parking, all aircraft entering the identified ramp require a Follow-Me
vehicle and/or marshalers.
   2.16.1. Airfield Management, 43 AMXS, Transient Alert, or MOC (if applicable), will
   determine when and on which ramp abnormal taxiing/parking conditions exist. MOC shall
   notify Pope Command Post and Airfield Management when abnormal parking exists. In
   turn, Airfield Management shall notify Pope Tower. If abnormal parking is due to other than
   aircraft size, i.e. non-standard placement on the airfield, Pope Command Post shall notify
   WSS (abnormal parking constitutes “suspicious activity” by WSS regulation).
   2.16.2. It is the aircraft commander’s responsibility to ensure there is a marshaler or Follow-
   Me vehicle in place prior to calling for taxi.
   2.16.3. Abnormal taxiing/parking condition will remain in effect until canceled by 43
   AMXS or MOC, with Airfield Management concurrence.
2.17. Aircraft Towing/Run Operations.
   2.17.1. Aircraft Towing. When towing an aircraft within its own parking ramp area (from
   parking spot to parking spot or parking spot to hangar), tow operators need not contact
   Ground Control (see note). When towing aircraft on or across taxiways or runways, tow
   operators shall contact Ground Control on UHF/VHF/FM Net and obtain clearance to enter
   the taxiway/runway. When requesting such clearance, include call-sign/tail number,
   position, and destination. Two-way communications shall be maintained until the tow
   aircraft reports clear of the taxiway/runway (proceeding onto a parking ramp).    Note:
   Ground traffic outside of the Aircraft Movement Area operates on a see-and-avoid basis;
   right of way and priorities are defined in PFI 13-101, Airfield Driving Program.
       2.17.1.1. Tow operators will coordinate for tow clearance with MOC IAW C130A-2-
       2CL-5 Section I.b., Section II.
       2.17.1.2. Before towing aircraft to the Red Ramp Hot Spots, obtain prior permission
       from Airfield Management/Pope Command Post. Additionally, coordination must be
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                     25


       accomplished with the MOC and Pope Tower. When aircraft are not parked on the Hot
       Spots, ground equipment must be removed.
   2.17.2. Engine Run Operations. CP/MOC is responsible for ensuring coordination with
   Airfield Management on all engine runs is accomplished. Airfield Management will relay
   the following information to Pope Tower concerning approved engine runs.
       2.17.2.1. Tail number
       2.17.2.2. Aircraft type
       2.17.2.3. Location
   2.17.3. Aircraft shall obtain approval from Ground Control prior to starting engine runs.
   2.17.4. Restrictions for engine runs can be obtained from the Run/Jack Matrix, (See
   Attachment 16).
2.18. Flightline Tobacco Use. Tobacco use is strictly prohibited on any part of the airfield,
including all aircraft movement and parking areas.
2.19. Wear of Hats. With the exception of cold weather gear (authorized by AFI 36-2903,
Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel) and 3d Aerial Port Squadron personnel,
hats will not be worn on the flightline. If a hat is carried on the flightline, it will be properly
secured.
2.20. Taking of Photographs on the Airfield. Photography on the flightline is prohibited
unless coordinated by letter with 440 AW Public Affairs (Protocol for Distinguished Visitors) or
under other special circumstances coordinated through Squadron Commanders. To deconflict
with operations and avoid confusion, a letter from 440 AW Public Affairs describing participants
and photography times and locations will be distributed to Pope Command Post and a courtesy
call should be made to Airfield Management. Photographers should have their approval letter on
their person at all times. See PFI 13-101 for more information.
2.21. Procedures/Requirements for Conducting Runway Inspections/Checks. Local
procedures for conducting runway checks and inspections can be found in OSAA OI 13-2,
Airfield Management. Qualified Airfield Management personnel will accomplish (as a
minimum) airfield inspections once per day. Inspections are conducted to identify pavement
conditions of taxiways, parking ramps, and runways to include rubber deposits, overruns, and
any other damaged areas. Airfield markings, signs, lighting systems, and associated        lighting
facilities will be inspected. Identify violations of obstructions. Evaluate clear zone areas and
perimeter/access roads in proximity to the airfield to ensure clearance criteria violations do not
exist. Construction areas will be inspected to ensure they do not pose a hazard to aircraft
operations. Check for bird bird watch condition (BWC), RSC, grass height, abandoned
equipment not in use, new fixed or mobile obstructions, unsafe conditions, FOD, etc. Airfield
Inspection/Check form will be used for identification and documentation. If discrepancies
warrant immediate attention, coordinate with appropriate agency, i.e. sweeper, pavements, etc.

                            LOCAL AIRSPACE/FLYING AREA

3.1. Class “C” Airspace (see Attachments 8 and 9). Pope will maintain control of the
airspace up to and including 2000’ MSL and 5 DME around POB TACAN except the areas
inside R-5311 and the area southeast of the boundary line with Simmons AAF Class D airspace.
When deemed necessary by the Tower CIC, 2500’ MSL may be requested from Fayetteville
Approach for ATC spacing. During other times, will release the 2500’ altitude to Fayetteville
Approach Control.
3.2. Base Quiet Hours. Base quiet hours are from 2300L to 0600L. During this period, aircraft
engine operations above idle and non-essential aircraft operations are prohibited for noise
abatement. All scheduled flight operations are considered essential and are not restricted.
Waiver authority for the base quiet hours is the 440 OG/CC.
3.3. Restricted Airspace (See Attachments 8 - 10). Restricted airspace is shown in current
Flight Information Publications. R-5311 is a live-fire located 2.5 NM off the departure end of
Runway 23 and/or approach end of Runway 05; it is imperative aircraft avoid crossing its border.
Pope Tower will issue R-5311 restriction to all aircraft departing Pope via the ATIS. R-5311
Sector IV, surface up to and including 2,500’, lies east of a line connecting coordinates
N35.1729129 W079.0837871, N35.1357018 W079.0681976, and N35.1217256 W079.0399983,
and is contained elsewhere by R-5311 outer boundaries as listed in Attachment 8. R-5311 Sector
IV airspace is released to Pope Tower 24-hours a day unless this release is specifically rescinded
by Ft. Bragg Range Control. Range Control can recall Sector IV at any time with 15 minutes
notice. When Sector IV is recalled, there is no pattern work on either of Pope runways. Runway
23 arrivals will be full-stop only; Runway 05 will be used for departures.

3.4. Pope Field C-130 Local Flying Areas.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                               27


   3.4.1. The Pope AAF C-130 local flying area is bounded by an imaginary line beginning
       at SBV; to VXV; to SPA; to CRE; to ILM; to EWN.(See Attachment 3)
   3.4.2. C-130 Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area. This area is environmentally
   assessed for C-130 operations at 300’ AGL; C-17 and C-5 operations at 500’ AGL. Its
   boundary is listed below:

Table 3.1. LATN Area Boundaries.

N35-25 W80-13       N35-10 W80-00

   3.4.3. C-130 one-time use routes outside of the LATN area may be flown at 300’ AGL, but
   routes that will be used repeatedly are restricted to not lower than 500’ AGL when outside
   the LATN area. All low altitude operations must adhere to altitude requirements listed in
   AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.4.4. Low Level Corridors. There are three flight corridors for VFR route construction in
   the Pope Field local area. The corridors are designated Red, Yellow and Blue, and are used
   primarily to de-conflict formations flying to local drop zones. Planned routes that extend
   beyond corridor boundaries require no special approval. When operating within the Yellow
   corridor, contact Mackall AAF Tower prior to penetrating the Mackall Class “D” airspace.
   3.4.5. For planning purposes, corridor routes are normally within the following no-wind
   times:

Table 3.2. Low Level Cooridor No-Wind Times.
Corridor            Times
Red                 40 - 60 minutes

                       AIR TRAFFIC AREA/AIRFIELD PROCEDURES

4.1. Local Frequencies/Channelization. Local frequencies/channelization (See Attachment
15).
4.2. ATC Communications. All aircraft shall use VHF (if available) as the primary radio when
communicating with Pope Tower.
4.3. Single Runway Operations. Due to the close proximity of the LZ and the primary runway
(40’), all operations are considered single runway operations. Exception: See para. 5.27.3.
regarding procedures for a disabled aircraft on the LZ.
4.4. Class “C” Airspace/Services (See Attachments 8 and 9).
      4.4.1. All aircraft operating to and from Pope Field shall comply with Class “C” flight
      requirements. Pope Tower will provide Class “C” service within the Pope surface area
      airspace, as delegated by Fayetteville Approach Control. Class “C” services shall not be
      interpreted as relieving the pilot of their responsibility to see and avoid other traffic, to
      maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance, or, if VFR, to remain in weather equal
      to or better than the VFR minimums required by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
      During Fayetteville Approach Control radar outages, Class “C” service will not be available;
      Pope Tower will instead provide standard Class “D” services IAW FAAO JO 7110.65 and
      are still required to obtain departure releases with Fayetteville Approach Control.
      4.4.2. Pilots shall file either a DD-175, Military Flight Plan, DD-1801, DoD International
      Flight Plan, or stereo flight plan IAW the C-130 Aircrew In-Flight Guide   (if applicable)
      or Fayetteville Approach LOA.
      4.4.3. Aircraft remaining in Pope’s VFR airspace (Attachments 11 and 12) must remain at or
      below 2,000 MSL. Higher altitudes may be assigned by Pope Tower following coordination
      with Fayetteville Approach.
      4.4.4. Aircraft departing Pope’s airspace must receive a clearance from Pope Tower prior
          to departing, regardless of whether on an IFR or VFR flight plan. Pilots should normally
      request flight plans through Pilot-to-Dispatch, however, Pope Tower may coordinate them on
      a time permitting basis with Airfield Management.
         4.4.4.1. Aircraft that do not have a flight plan on file into Fayetteville’s Class C airspace
         may request a local VFR climb-out (Tac North or Tac South). Aircraft must maintain
         VFR unless they coordinate with Fayetteville Approach for an IFR clearance.
         4.4.4.2. Aircraft that do not have a flight plan on file into Fayetteville’s Class C airspace
         may request a local IFR climb-out (Pope North or Pope South) for practice instrument
         approaches or to join-up with an airborne flight.
4.5. Local Aircraft Priorities. Established by the 440 OG/CC, local aircraft priorities are
reviewed annually at the Airfield Operations Board. The Tower CIC shall ensure good order of
traffic flow is maintained according to the priorities below. These priorities are supplemental to
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                         29


the operational priorities listed in FAAO JO 7110.65. Aircrews are responsible for passing to
Pope Command Post and Ground Control the operational priority of their mission, as needed.
   4.5.1. Phoenix Banner/Silver/Copper: Higher Headquarters directed missions as specified
   by Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) priority code and Pope Command Post. HHQ mission include
   Phoenix Banner/Silver/Copper, Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF), Definite Purpose and
   specified SAAMs. If more than one HQ mission aircraft is operating at Pope at the same
   time, the Command Post will notify Pope Tower of the priority sequence.
   4.5.2. DV codes
   4.5.3. Exercise participants to include Joint Operational Access Exercise (JOAX) and
   ORI/OREs
   4.5.4. IFR full stops
   4.5.5. Formation low approach to follow-on route
   4.5.6. Controlled departures.           Note: Aircrews must advise Pope Ground upon engine
   start of controlled departure time to receive priority.
   4.5.7. Pope-assigned aircraft, transition pattern and Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
   Training Procedures (JA/ATT)
   4.5.8. Transient transition pattern
   4.5.9. Opposite direction traffic
4.6. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training Procedures (JA/ATT). Mission/aircraft
commanders for JA/ATT missions and missions tasked by Air Mobility Command (AMC) will
coordinate with the Pope Command Post to confirm mission details. Aircrews flying JA/ATT
and AMC tasked missions or cross country/training missions will contact Pope Command Post
for all support coordination, including changes to range clearance.
4.7. Aeromedical Evacuation (AIR EVAC). Aeromedical Evacuation (Air Evac) is exempt
from PPR/Official Business Only (OBO) restrictions, but is required to obtain a PPR number for
tracking and notifications. Upon notification of an inbound Air Evac, Airfield Management will
notify , transient alert, and the passenger terminal. In addition, Airfield Management will call
Fort Bragg Evac if the pilot gives load message including litters and ambulatory.
4.8. Filing Flight Plans Via Fax. Pope assigned aircrew/43AG supported missions, Command
Post and 440 Operations Supervisor of Flying (SOF) may fax flight plans to Airfield
Management. Original flight plans must be maintained for 90 days by the flying unit or with
43OSS/OSOE in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-07, and Rule 3.00. Pilots must
verify flight plan receipt, accuracy, and completeness by phone call with Airfield Management
prior to departing for the aircraft. Due to possible hijack of aircraft, initial departure flight plans
will not be accepted over the radio. Aircrews must file initial flight plans in person or through
the above agencies.

               DEPARTURES, ARRIVALS, AND ENROUTE PROCEDURES

5.1. General. None of the following procedures relieve pilots of their responsibility, whether on
an IFR or VFR flight plan, to maintain proper separation from other traffic while in VMC. Pilots
should be aware that although the North downwind is preferred, the South downwind is utilized
at Pope on a case-by-case basis. Pilots should include the South downwind when routinely
scanning for traffic.
5.2. VFR Pattern Reporting Points. (See Attachments 9 and 10). Pilots will use the following
VFR reporting points while operating in Pope Field’s VFR pattern:

Table 5.1. VFR Reporting Points.
 VFR Point            Radial/DME
 LAKE                 POB 304/4
 BEND                 POB 005/4.9

5.3. VFR Pattern Weather Minimums. If weather minimums do not exist to open the Outside
Downwind pattern, Pope Tower may continue the use of the other VFR patterns, traffic
permitting. Tower has the authority to close VFR and other patterns based on circumstances
such as weather, traffic satuation, equipment outages, ...etc.

Table 5.2. VFR Weather Minimums.
 Pattern                             Minimum Ceiling/Visibility
 Overhead                            2300’ AGL/3 SM
 Closed,                             1800’ AGL/3 SM
 Low Altitude Closed                 1500’ AGL/3SM

5.4. Instrument Approach Revised Minimums. Approach minimums are affected if any
portion of the approach lights, runway lights, or runway markings becomes inoperative or
unusable. The Airfield Manager will make recommendations to the 440 OG/CC regarding
whether to continue using the affected system. If the system is declared unusable, approach
minimums will be raised or the airfield closed in accordance with Air Force and FAA directives.
The revised approach minimums can be found in the DoD Flip Approach Plate. Airfield
Management will immediately notify the and the Command Post of any restrictions affecting the
operation of the airfield. Airfield Management will also send NOTAM(s) describing the system
outage and the increased approach minima.       Note: A 15% or more loss of HIRLs will restrict
the airfield to VFR daylight operations unless waived by the SAA.
5.5. Runway 23 Traffic Patterns and Operations (See Attachment 10). Aircraft may
coordinate direct downwind with approach control.
      5.5.1. 360 Overhead Approach. Initial entry point from radar is 6 DME (5 NM from the
      approach end of Runway 23). Pattern altitude: 2,000’ MSL, 200 KIAS on   initial.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                   31


   5.5.2. Overhead Break. Due to noise abatement requirements, all breaks will normally be to
   the right. All aircraft should plan to break (formations plan to begin break) at the approach
   end of the runway unless otherwise directed by Pope Tower. To ensure R-5311 avoidance,
   flights of four fighter aircraft shall start their break at the approach end of the runway and
   flights of three shall start their break not later than midfield.
   5.5.3. Closed Traffic Pattern. Normally executed as right traffic and commenced at the
   departure end of the runway unless otherwise approved by Tower. Fighters climb to 2,000’
   MSL; non-fighter aircraft will climb to 1,500’ MSL. Any pilot deviation from the pattern
   altitude by more than +/- 100ft MSL must be requested by pilot and approved by the Tower.
   Pilots should state intentions prior to reaching the departure end of the runway. Non-fighter
   aircraft shall maintain 200 KIAS or less; Fighters will not exceed 250 KIAS.
   5.5.4. Outside Downwind Traffic Pattern. Executed as right traffic and commenced at the
   departure end of the runway unless otherwise approved by Tower. Non-fighter aircraft will
   climb to 1,500’ MSL; fighters climb to 2,000’ MSL. Any pilot deviation from the pattern
   altitude by more than +/- 100ft must be requested by pilot and approved by the Tower. The
   pattern is defined by “Lake” (POB 304/4) and “Bend” (POB 005/4.9). Pilots report reaching
   “Bend” and state intentions. Non-fighter aircraft maintain 200 KIAS or less; Fighters will
   not exceed 250 KIAS.            Note 1: It is the aircraft commander’s responsibility to stay
   within Pope’s airspace at all times.
5.6. Runway 05 Traffic Patterns and Operations (See Attachment 10). Aircraft will
normally enter the Runway 05 pattern via a left downwind. Aircraft may coordinate direct
downwind with approach control. Due to the close proximity of R-5311, all formations shall
obtain spacing prior to downwind entry. Non-fighter aircraft shall descend to or enter at 1,500’
MSL; fighters shall descend to or enter at 2,000’ MSL. Overhead approaches are not authorized
for Runway 05.
   5.6.1. Closed Pattern normally executed as left traffic and commenced at the departure end
   of the runway unless cleared otherwise by Pope Tower. Fighters shall climb to 2,000’ MSL;
   non-fighter aircraft shall climb to 1,500’ MSL. Any pilot deviation from the pattern altitude
   by more than +/- 100ft MSL must be requested by pilot and approved by the Tower.
   5.6.2. Outside Downwind Traffic Pattern. Executed as left traffic and commenced at the
   departure end of the runway unless otherwise approved by Tower. Non-Figher aircraft will
   climb to 1,500’ MSL; fighters climb to 2,000’ MSL. Any pilot deviation from the pattern
   altitude by more than +/- 100ft MSL must be requested by pilot and approved by the Tower.
   The pattern is defined by “Bend” (POB 005/04.9) and “Lake” (POB 304/04). Pilots report
   reaching “Lake” and state intentions. Non-fighter aircraft maintain 200 KIAS or less;
   Fighters will not exceed 250 KIAS.
5.7. C-130 Tactical Procedures (See Attachments 11 and 12).
   5.7.1. Random and Tactical Approaches into Pope Field are designed to facilitate training
   while not compromising aircraft safety due to departing/arriving traffic. Reporting points
   will be used to sequence aircraft arrivals. ATC will have ultimate control over aircraft
   altitudes and aircrew should follow any directions given by ATC to ensure aircraft safety and
   alleviate traffic pattern congestion.    Note: Remain at or below 10,000’ MSL throughout
   the entire approach to alleviate excess ATC communications.

      5.7.1.2. POPE FIELD: SKULL – N35° 10.25’ W079° 00.87’
   5.7.2. GENERAL PROCEDURES:
      5.7.2.1. Authorized tactical procedures at Pope Field include:        penetration (tactical)
      decent and tactical approaches.
      5.7.2.2. All approaches will begin at 9500’ MSL (or appropriate VFR traffic altitude).
      5.7.2.3. Crews will remain as high as possible for as long as possible. (Not above
      10,000’ MSL)
      5.7.2.4. Upon initial check-in, report altitude and position from a tactical reporting point
      and make your request for ingress routing, type of approach and follow on departure:
      Fayetteville Approach, Packr XX, 9500’, 5 miles north of WAHOO, requesting Tactical
      Descent Overhead; WAHOO, WOLF, SKULL.
      5.7.2.5. Fayetteville Approach will give you radar ID (via ident), Pope Field info,
      sequencing information or proceed as requested. (Be sure to follow any instructions given
      by ATC to ensure safety of aircraft and crew.)
      5.7.2.6. If directed to hold for spacing/sequencing, proceed to assigned 15 NM reporting
      point and enter holding south of 15 NM reporting point on a POB (TACAN) radial, right
      turns, and 1 minute legs at 9500’ MSL. Fayetteville ATCT will hold aircraft until
      unrestricted descent can be approved.
      5.7.2.7. Aircrews are ultimately responsible for the clearing of traffic around their
      aircraft. Contact with Fayetteville is essential for clearance and traffic information.
   5.7.3. DEPARTURE PROCEDURES: “TAC North High” (TNH). After initial climb-out,
   fly direct to a 5 NM reporting point, then direct to a 15 NM reporting point. After initial
   contact with FAY, request a climb to 9500’ MSL. If a lower altitude is required to maintain
   VFR, coordinate with FAY.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                     33


     5.7.3.1. Runway 23: Depart Pope VFR via the North Departure. Upon initial contact
     with FAY, coordinate requested reporting points and final altitude. Note 1: Before
     commencing the approach, re-establish contact with FAY Approach for clearance and
     aerodrome information. Note 2: Be sure to remain within 20 NM of POB to stay within
     Fayetteville airspace.
     5.7.3.2. Runway 05: Depart Pope VFR via the Runway 5 Departure. Upon initial contact
     with FAY, coordinate requested reporting points and final altitude. Note 1: Before
     commencing the approach, re-establish contact with FAY Approach for clearance and
     aerodrome information. Note 2: Be sure to remain within 20 NM of POB to stay within
     Fayetteville airspace.
  5.7.4. ARRIVAL PROCEDURES:
     5.7.4.1. DESCENTS:
        5.7.4.1.1. TACTICAL (PENETRATION) DESCENT (Overhead, Downwind, Beam,
        etc): High rate (unrestricted) visual descent profile designed to transition an aircraft
        from a high-level altitude structure to a low-level altitude structure putting the aircraft
        in a safe position to execute a tactical approach.
        5.7.4.1.2. ARA DESCENT: High rate (unrestricted) descent profile designed to
        transition an aircraft from a high-level altitude structure to a low-level altitude
        structure putting the aircraft in a safe position to execute an ARA to runway 23.
        5.7.4.1.3. TACTICAL (PENETRATION) DESCENT ASSAULT – High rate
        (unrestricted) visual descent profile designed to transition an aircraft from a high-
        level altitude structure to a low-level altitude structure putting the aircraft in a safe
        position to execute a tactical approach to an assault landing zone. Note: A separate
        penetration descent profile may also be flown to Mackall AAF (HFF), see Pope
        Aircrew In-flight guide for procedures.
            5.7.4.1.3.1. Arrival Procedures:
               5.7.4.1.3.1.1. When sequenced, commence penetration descent to a tactical
               approach, ARA, or normal pattern. Request desired approach as early as
               possible upon switching to Pope Tower.
               5.7.4.1.3.1.2. Remain at or above 2500’ MSL until within 5 NM of Pope. Do
               not descend below 720’ MSL until given clearance to land from Pope Tower.
  5.7.5. TACTICAL APPROACHES: A tactical approach is a visual maneuver designed to
  transition an aircraft from an en-route configuration (high airspeed) to a landing
  configuration (low airspeed).
     5.7.5.1. Approach Parameters and Restrictions:
        5.7.5.1.1. Entry airspeeds will be between 200 KIAS and 250 KIAS.
        5.7.5.1.2. At night, aircraft will maintain 2,500’ MSL until entering Pope’s Class C
        Airspace. Once in Pope’s Class C Airspace and contact has been established with
        Pope Tower, descend to 1220’ MSL. Once the aircrew has the controlling obstacle,
        POB 009/4.7 (701’ MSL tower), in sight, they may descend from 1220’ MSL to 720’
34                                                        440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


        MSL. The aircrew will keep controlling obstacle in sight until positive position is
        identified and adequate terrain clearance is assured.
        5.7.5.1.3. To preclude entry into R-5311, do not enter the pattern southwest of the
        POB 310 radial.
        5.7.5.1.4. Approaches entering between the POB 310 radial and POB 020 radial will
        be a downwind type maneuver for Runway 05 or 23 with the exception of the Beam
        approach. Beam entry will be conducted north of the POB 310 radial.
        5.7.5.1.5. All Tactical Overhead or Straight-In approaches to Runway 23 and
        Teardrop or Club approaches to Runway 05 will be initiated between the POB 020
        radial and the runway centerline.
        5.7.5.1.6. Straight-in, overhead, or downwind patterns may be flown in formation.
        5.7.5.1.7. A departing aircraft must be on departure roll by the time an arriving
        aircraft executing a Tactical Approach reaches a point 2 NM from the approach end
        of the runway on either initial or final. Tactical Approaches will not overfly aircraft
        on the runway for departure.
        5.7.5.1.8. A departing aircraft must be departure roll by the time an arriving aircraft
        executing a downwind entry for a Tactical Approach turns base leg.
        5.7.5.1.9. When helicopter operations in the Northern Training Area (NTA) (at or
        below 700’ MSL) need to be de-conflicted with aircraft on a Tactical Approach, Pope
        Tower will issue traffic advisories on known traffic in the NTA prior to authorizing
        the “break turn” for a Tactical Overhead Approach.
     5.7.5.2. Low-Level Tactical Approaches: There are six specific Low-Level Tactical
     Approaches authorized at Pope Field. To promote predictable pattern operations, these
     approaches are intended to be flown as described below and not combined or modified.
     Note: For all approaches described below, do not descend to 720’ MSL until within
     Pope’s Class C airspace (Pope TACAN 5 DME) and cleared for the maneuver by Pope
     Tower.
        5.7.5.2.1. High-Speed Downwind Approach. Aircraft/mission commanders should
        ensure that all High-speed Downwind requests are coordinated through Fayetteville
        Approach Control as soon as possible during recoveries. The downwind leg will be
        flown at 200 KIAS and 1,500’ MSL.
            5.7.5.2.1.1. High-Speed Downwind (Runway 23): A high-speed downwind
            approach entering the pattern between the POB 310 radial and POB 350 radial at
            1,500’ MSL.
            5.7.5.2.1.2. High-Speed Downwind (Runway 05): A high-speed downwind
            approach entering the pattern between the POB 350 radial and POB 020 radial at
            1,500’ MSL. Note: For Runway 05 operations, formation spacing must be
            obtained prior to the downwind entry to avoid R-5311.
            5.7.5.2.1.3. “Tactical” High-Speed Downwind:           A high-speed downwind
            approach flown at 720’ MSL.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                            35


        5.7.5.2.2. Overhead Approach (Runway 23 Only): An overhead approach will be
        flown at 2000’ MSL with a right break or as directed by Pope Tower. Initiate the
        Overhead Approach from a 3-5 NM initial.
           5.7.5.2.2.1. “Tactical” Overhead: An overhead approach flown at 720’ MSL. Do
           not overfly aircraft/obstruction/personnel on the runway unless instructed to
           maintain at or above 720’ MSL (500’ AGL) on initial.
           5.7.5.2.2.2. “Tactical” Overhead “Pitch-up”: From the Tactical Overhead (720’
           MSL), a pitch-up to at or below 1500’ MSL will be initiated at the break. The
           approach may be flown if requested by the pilot and approved by Pope Tower.
        5.7.5.2.3. Straight-in (Runway 23 Only): An approach initiated between the POB
        020 radial and Runway 23 centerline with no maneuver to landing. “Tactical”
        Straight-in: A straight-in approach flown at 720’ MSL.
        5.7.5.2.4. Beam Approach (Runway 23 Only): A beam approach will be flown at
        1,500’ MSL. Remain north of the POB 310 radial. Cross the airfield perpendicular
        to the runway and enter a left break east of the control tower.
           5.7.5.2.4.1. “Tactical” Beam: A beam approach flown at 720’ MSL.
           5.7.5.2.4.2. “Tactical” Beam “Pitch-up”: From the Tactical Beam (720’ MSL), a
           pitch-up to at or below 1500’ MSL will be initiated at the break. The approach
           may be flown if requested by the pilot and approved by Pope Tower.       Note:
           Beam approaches to Runway 05 are not authorized due to the proximity of R-
           5311 and noise sensitive areas on Fort Bragg.
        5.7.5.2.5. Teardrop Approach (Runway 05 Only): A teardrop approach will be flown
        at 1500’ MSL. Approach the airfield between the POB 020 radial and Runway 23
        centerline. At 0.5 NM from the approach end of RWY 23 (1.5 NM from the
        approach end of RWY 05) make a 45 degree turn to the north to enter a left
        downwind to RWY 05.
           5.7.5.2.5.1. “Tactical” Teardrop: A teardrop approach flown at 720’ MSL.
           5.7.5.2.5.2. “Tactical” Teardrop “Pitch-up”: From the Tactical Teardrop (720’
           MSL), a pitch-up to at or below 1500’ MSL will be initiated at the break. The
           approach may be flown if requested by the pilot and approved by Pope Tower.
           CAUTION: Carefully analyze tailwinds to avoid entering R-5311.
        5.7.5.2.6. Club Approach (Runway 05 Only): A club approach will be flown at
        1500’ MSL. Approach the airfield between the POB 020 radial and Runway 23
        centerline. Initiate the maneuver with a right break (towards the north). After 90
        degrees of turn, reverse turn 270 degrees to enter a left base to RWY 05.
           5.7.5.2.6.1. “Tactical” Club: A club approach flown at 720’ MSL.
           5.7.5.2.6.2. “Tactical” Club “Pitch-up”: From the Tactical Club (720’ MSL), a
           pitch-up to at or below 1500’ MSL will be initiated at the break. The approach
           may be flown if requested by the pilot and approved by Pope Tower.
           CAUTION: Carefully analyze tailwinds to avoid entering R-5311.
 36                                                             440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


         5.7.5.3. Random Steep Approach (Runway 23 Only): This is the only type of random
         approach authorized at Pope Field, and must be coordinated with Fayetteville Approach
         Control. This coordination may be accomplished through Pope Tower. The Random
         Steep is a spiral down approach initiated from 4,500’ MSL over the approach end of
         Runway 23 (unless otherwise coordinated and approved by ATC). The number of turns
         to final will be coordinated with Pope Tower. All turns will be to the left, unless
         otherwise directed, and remain within the lateral boundaries of Pope’s Class C airspace
         (Pope TACAN 5 DME, not including FBG airspace 2.5 NM southeast).
5.8. Arrivals. All recoveries to Pope must have clearance into the Class C airspace from
Fayetteville Approach. Aircrews shall report their location to Pope Tower in DME from the
Pope TACAN. Unless multiple approaches have been previously coordinated, an instrument
approach normally terminates in a full-stop landing or a low approach followed by entry into
VFR pattern. If the aircrew is inbound on an IFR approach and knows that they want to stay in
the VFR pattern for a short period of time then go back to the local radar pattern on the same
inbound flight plan; the pilots needs to state to Pope Tower on initial contact their intentions.
Specifically that “they want to keep the current flight plan open”.
      5.8.1. Aircraft arriving IFR or VFR may execute a drag maneuver in VMC to allow element
      penetrations as long as ATC is notified of intentions. The flight retains the responsibility for
      aircraft separation within the flight.
   5.8.2. Flights are controlled as a single ship. Advise Pope Tower prior to flight break-up
   while in the Class C surface area.
   5.8.3. IFR Instrument Approach Arrivals. All aircraft should maintain 200-250 KIAS when
   within 20 NM of Pope. C-130 SKE/AWADS formations are not required to slow             to
   vectoring airspeed, but may select the airspeed most suitable for the formation size.
      5.8.4. IFR Cancellation. IFR service is automatically canceled for IFR aircraft recovering to
      an overhead approach upon reaching 6 DME initial.
      5.8.5. VFR Arrivals. Inbound aircraft shall contact Approach Control on the appropriate
      frequency prior to 20 DME from Pope TACAN, with ATIS identifier and intentions.
      Fayetteville Approach will provide Class C service until Pope’s Class C airspace. Visual
      overhead traffic will normally be vectored at 2,500’ MSL, but pilots may request vectoring at
      2,000’ MSL, traffic permitting. Maintain vectoring altitude until within 6   DME.       (See
      Attachments 8, 9, and 10)
      5.8.6. TACAN Alpha Approaches. Circling approaches are not authorized southeast of
      Runway 05/23.
         5.8.6.1. TACAN Alpha approaches to Runway 05 may be conducted to either a right
         base or cross the runway to enter a left downwind for Runway 05. Pilots should state
         their intentions with Tower on initial contact. It is the aircraft commander’s
         responsibility to maintain a safe altitude IAW published criteria.
         5.8.6.2. TACAN Alpha approaches are not normally flown to Runway 23. If flown,
         aircraft will overfly the runway to a right downwind to Runway 23.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                       37


       5.8.6.3. It is the mission commander’s responsibility to ensure adequate separation
       between elements conducting TACAN Alpha approaches. All other aircraft can expect
       greater than normal separation during this approach to ensure flight safety.
   5.8.7. Low Altitude Closed Traffic and Circling Approach Procedures. A maneuver that
   allows pilots to practice circling maneuvers only when a circling approach, to the
       opposite RWY, cannot be approved. Pilots shall request this maneuver from tower upon
   transfer from FAY. The weather minimums for low altitude closed traffic are transition
   weather minimums (1,500ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility). The maneuver begins with either a
   non-precision instrument approach or touch-and-go, followed by an over-flight of the RWY
   along the RWY centerline, and closed traffic at circling MDA.
       5.8.7.1. VFR. When aircraft are transferred to Pope Tower, the pilot will request low
       altitude closed traffic as follows: (“DEUCE 69 REQUEST LOW ALTITUDE
       CLOSED") Tower will approve or disapprove low altitude closed traffic based upon
       traffic conditions. The phrase ― “LOW ALTITUDE CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED”
       is approval for an over-flight of the RWY along the RWY centerline followed by closed
       traffic (at circling MDA) at the departure end of the RWY. When disapproving low
       altitude closed traffic, tower will provide alternate instructions.      Note 1: When the
       aircraft begins low altitude closed traffic, IFR is automatically cancelled the first time the
       aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Note 2: ATC shall not allow aircraft conducting
       ―LOW ALTITUDE CLOSED TRAFFIC to over-fly aircraft that are ―LINEUP AND
       WAIT.          Note 3: The VFR low closed maneuver is not afforded the same circling
       restrictions as an aircraft on an IFR flight plan i.e., you may extend the aircraft’
       downwind or issue a 360 maneuver if required.
       5.8.7.2. IFR. When weather conditions do not permit Low Altitude Closed Traffic
       (weather below transition minimums), pilots may request a ―Circling Approach to RWY
       aligned with the instrument approach procedure. This request shall be made with FAY.
       This is an IFR maneuver and pilots are expected to comply with all appropriate circling
       criteria, including keeping the RWY environment in sight. ATC will expect pilots to
       commence this maneuver at the departure end of the RWY or as instructed by ATC.
   5.8.7.3. Circling maneuvers will be north of the field to prevent traffic congestion and to
   avoid flying over populated areas. Circling south of the field is not authorized.
5.9. Formation Flight Arrivals. The following restrictions apply:
   5.9.1. During Runway 05 operations, C-130 AWADS/SKE formations may fly an approach
   to Runway 23 with a circle to Runway 05 as long as the weather is 2300/3 or better, and
   formation size is six or fewer aircraft.
   5.9.2. Formations may fly the TACAN-A approach when landing via a right base.
   5.9.3. Formations shall not overfly the airfield for a left downwind for Runway 05.
5.10. Restricted Altitude Low Approach. Restricted low approaches of at least 720’ MSL
(heavy aircraft: 1,220’ MSL) may be authorized by . Restricted low approaches shall NOT be
authorized over an aircraft in takeoff position or departure roll. If the restriction is for ground
traffic, personnel or equipment, the approaching aircraft will be advised of the location. Ground
personnel will be advised of a low approach aircraft.
 38                                                          440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


5.11. Go Around. Workload permitting, ATC will provide the reason for issuing a go around
and additional instructions as required. The following flight procedures shall be executed when
ATC directs Go Around or when the pilot initiates a go around:
   5.11.1. VFR aircraft or an aircraft conducting a visual approach will overfly the runway
   while climbing to traffic pattern altitude and expect to enter the closed traffic pattern unless
   requesting otherwise. Aircraft should remain at or below 1,500’ MSL to de-conflict with
   aircraft on initial. If unable to climb to 720’ MSL before overflying personnel, equipment, or
   another aircraft on the runway, the pilot should offset for at least 500’ lateral separation.
   5.11.2. If on an IFR flight plan making an instrument approach, the pilot will execute the
   published missed approach procedure or proceed as instructed by ATC.         Note: Pilots
   should expect the local North Departure when looking for Pope Tower to issue climb-out
   back to radar. (See para 5.18.3.)
5.12. TACAN Out Procedures. During TACAN outages, will notify the aircraft when it is at
the final approach fix. Missed approach instructions shall be issued as: “Immediate climbing
right turn heading 350, maintain 2000’.”
5.13. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Arrival Information. Pope Tower shall notify Airfield
Management IAW AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, para. 7.11.3.2
when initial inbound information is received from Fayetteville. If Pope Tower is unable to
contact Airfield Management, they will contact Pope Command Post as a secondary agency.
5.14. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). There are no RSRS standards applied at
Pope Field. Appropriate separation standards published in FAAO JO 7110.65 will be applied.
5.15. Transient Aircraft. Ground Handling. For flightline security purposes, transient crews
initially arriving at Pope should ensure a copy of their crew orders is on file locally. All crew
orders shall be forwarded or faxed to Pope Command Post (Blue, Green, Red or Yellow Ramp
parking) or Transient Alert (all other parking). In turn, Command Post/Transient Alert shall call
the Weapons System Security Control Center and advise that crew orders are available for pick-
up by the Restricted Area Supervisor. Prime Knight services for Air Mobility Command
transient missions are provided by 43 OSS/OSOEX, 910-394-4839 (DSN 424). After hours
contact Pope Command Post.
5.16. IFR Approach Restriction at Simmons AAF. All Pope assigned aircraft are restricted
from flying practice IFR approaches at Simmons AAF 20 minutes before or after any scheduled
departures from Pope Field. Aircraft commanders should check the 440 AW flying schedule for
C-130 departures and contact Pope Command Post for transient aircraft departures to ensure
PAR training will not interfere with higher headquarters directed missions. Southbound
departures from Pope are not allowed by Fayetteville Approach Control when an approach is in
progress at Simmons AAF. Departure delays can result if these practice approaches are not
properly de-conflicted using the Pope Field flying schedule.
5.17. Local Stereo Flight Plans. (See para. 4.8. for filing local flight plans via fax.) Local
stereo flight plans have been established with Fayetteville Approach to expedite flight plan filing
and simplify local procedures (see Fayetteville ATCT, USAFR 440 AW and USAF 43AG LOA
for a complete list of stereo flight plans). Only aircraft departing from and returning to Pope
may use the flight plans and their identifiers listed below.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                      39


   5.17.1. IFR: Pope North and Pope South routes shall be used for IFR practice approaches or
   to join a previously departed flight.
       5.17.1.1. Pope North - POB 20 POB LIVIA POB (Remarks: practice approaches).
       5.17.1.2. Pope South - POB 20 POB LORRY POB (Remarks: practice approaches).
   5.17.2. VFR: TAC North and TAC South routes shall be used for VFR aircraft departing
       into the local flying area.
       5.17.2.1. TAC North - POB LIVIA POB.
       5.17.2.2. TAC South - POB LORRY POB223020 POB.                Note: The Radial and DME
       of LIVIA is 332009, LORRY is 212013.
   5.17.3. These local stereo flight plans will be issued to aircraft in conjunction with one of the
   coded departures listed in paragraph 5.18 below. For example, “Deuce 10 cleared to Pope
   Airport via the Pope South, South Departure, squawk 1234.” This clearance provides the
   aircraft with an IFR clearance into Class C airspace using the coded departure procedure
   described below.
5.18. Coded Departure Procedures. There are three coded departures from Pope Field; North
Departure, South Departure and Runway 5 Departure. All departures will be issued a coded
departure depending upon the turnout direction of their flight plan. Departure instructions
including the phrase “cleared to” signify an IFR clearance. Departure instructions preceded by
“for Class C services” signify a VFR departure.
   5.18.1. Aircraft flying one of these three coded departures will not deviate from departure
   heading until cleared on course by Fayetteville Departure. When cleared on course by
   departure control, proceed from present position direct to the next point in the flight plan.
   5.18.2. Pope-assigned aircraft are considered to be familiar with these departure procedures,
   and may be issued the procedure by its coded name. ATC shall provide all other aircraft with
   detailed departure instructions unless approved by the Air Traffic Manager.
   5.18.3. Departing Runway 23.
       5.18.3.1. North Departure. Turn right within 2NM of departure end Runway 23 heading
       350, climb and maintain 2,000’. Expect (requested altitude) one zero minutes after.
       Departure Frequency 285.575 or 125.17, squawk (code).
       5.18.3.2. South Departure. Turn left within 2NM of departure end Runway 23 heading
       160. Cross 4 DME at or above 1,200’ climb and maintain 2,000’. In the event of
       TACAN outage: Maintain a climb gradient of 250’ per nautical mile until reaching 1200,
       maintain 2000’.Expect (requested altitude) one zero minutes after. Departure Frequency
       295.0 or 133.0, squawk (code). Note: Aircraft that will not meet the ATC climb gradient
       to 1,200’ MSL, or those that are unable to avoid R-5311, must advise the Pope Tower
       prior to departure.
   5.18.4. Departing Runway 05: Fly runway heading, climb and maintain 2,000’. Expect
   (requested altitude) one zero minutes after. Departure frequency 285.575 or 125.175,
   squawk (code).
 40                                                              440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


5.19. Intersection Departures. Note:            The takeoff distance available for intersection
departures will not be given to locally assigned aircraft except by request; this information will
be furnished to all transient pilots electing an intersection departure.
   5.19.1. Authorized intersection for Runway 23 departures: Taxiway D - 5,100’ available.
      5.19.2. Authorized intersection for Runway 05 departures: Taxiway H - 5,650’ available.
      5.19.3. Authorized intersection for Runway 23 LZ strip departure: Taxiway D - 2,650’
      available.
      5.19.4. Either the pilot or Pope Tower may initiate an intersection departure. Pilots who
      desire full use of the runway are expected to inform Pope Tower when they cannot accept an
      intersection departure.
5.20. Standard Climb-Out Instructions. Pope Field does not have a standard climb-out.
Fayetteville Approach Control will issue climb-out instructions on a case-by-case basis.
5.21. Protection of the Overhead Traffic Pattern. To ensure separation is maintained
between departures/practice approaches and aircraft in the 360 degrees overhead traffic pattern,
all departing and practice approach aircraft shall remain at or below 1,500’ MSL until reaching
the departure end of the runway. When there are aircraft in the overhead, Pope Tower will issue
the instruction, “Maintain at or below 1,500’ until departure end” to all departing aircraft.
Transient aircraft will also be provided applicable traffic calls.
5.22. Non-Standard Departures. All formation flights departing Pope Field shall be
considered non-standard.
5.23. Formation Flight Departures.
      5.23.1. On initial contact with Pope Tower and Fayetteville Departure, flight leads shall
      advise when formations will have an element(s) in-trail. Flight leads shall request a specific
      block altitude from Ground Control/Clearance Delivery, if required, providing 1,000’ of
      separation between aircraft/elements (500’ minimum). After requesting a block altitude,
      pilots need not repeat the request with subsequent Pope Controllers.         Note: Pilots may be
      given a block altitude different from the one requested, depending on existing traffic. Block
      altitudes issued as an alternate will include at least the altitude thickness implied in request.
      It is up to the pilot to decline the climb instructions/takeoff clearance if opting to hold on the
      ground until the requested block becomes available.
      5.23.2. Pilots can expect to be issued a block altitude by Pope Tower shortly before takeoff
      (block altitude availability is based on real-time traffic conditions at Fayetteville Approach
      Control). When issued a block altitude, flights do not need to notify subsequent ATC
      controllers/facilities of element(s) in-trail unless that status changes (i.e. aborted
      takeoff/rejoin).
         5.23.2.1. Takeoff interval shall not exceed 20 seconds between each member of the flight
         (i.e. four-ship max takeoff time: 60 seconds) unless coordinated with Pope Tower.
         5.23.2.2. The last trailing element shall squawk a discrete subset of lead until rejoined,
         i.e. if lead is squawking 4742; last aircraft squawks 4700.
         5.23.2.3. Lead shall inform ATC of flight rejoin in Visual Meteorological Conditions
         (VMC), and also advise when all aircraft are level in standard formation. If in Instrument
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                   41


       Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or unable a rejoin to standard formation, inform ATC
       of your intentions.
   5.23.3. Nighttime Runway Operations. Fighters shall turn on their taxi light when entering
   the runway for departure between sunset and sunrise. At a minimum, the last departing
   fighter in a formation must have its anti-collision lights on when on the runway. Note: This
   procedure alerts both Pope Tower and arriving pilots that aircraft are on the runway.
5.24. Opposite Direction Runway Operations. All opposite direction departures shall be
requested by the aircraft at engine start. Opposite direction runway operations are approved
when an operational benefit exists.
   5.24.1. All opposite direction departures must be airborne and turned on a course
       diverging by at least 45 degrees from the reciprocal of the final approach course before
   an arrival reaches 10 mile final. This applies to any aircraft conducting an instrument
   approach; IFR/VFR.
   5.24.2. Opposite Direction Traffic Involving VFR Pattern Aircraft. The aircraft in the VFR
   traffic pattern shall not be allowed to turn base until the IFR/VFR opposite direction
   departure is beyond the VFR pattern base leg. Opposite direction operations may be
   discontinued when the normal flow of other air traffic is disrupted (see para. 4.5 for local
   aircraft priorities).
5.25. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Procedures. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Procedures.
C-130 FCFs, when required, are conducted from the POB 050009 to the POB 137048 within the
block altitude of 16,000’ to Flight Level 180. Other airspace may be used when coordinated
with the appropriate ATC authority. Policies and procedures for conducting FCFs at Pope Field
can be found in the 440 OG/OGV Operations Process 12.0.
5.26. Landing Zone Operations. Simultaneous operations to the main runway and the LZ are
not authorized. The LZ is not authorized for use by civilian aircraft.
   5.26.1. Aircraft conducting an instrument approach to the main runway may request to circle
   to the LZ. Published circling minimums apply. The LZ is not an approved instrument
   runway.
   5.26.2. Taxiway C may be used to access the full length (3,000’) of the LZ for departure.
   2,650’ is available for runway 23 LZ departures from intersection D.
   5.26.3. Disabled Aircraft on the LZ. All runway operations will be immediately suspended
   for a disabled aircraft on the LZ (i.e. blown tire, hot brakes, etc.), the 440 OG/CC (or
   representative) may authorize continued operations to the main runway after coordination
   with Airfield Management, Pope Safety Center, and the on-scene commander responsible for
   the disabled aircraft. When notified of the situation, Airfield Management staff should
   consult the above agencies prior to contacting the 440 OG/CC in order to advise about
   aircraft characteristics, weather, runway surface condition, disabled aircraft location, the
   flying schedule, etc. prior to requesting resumed main runway operations. Upon 440 OG/CC
   approval, subsequent operations to the main runway shall be on a case-by-case basis and
   normally restricted to mission essential and/or recovery of Pope assigned aircraft.
   5.26.4. If any part of the disabled aircraft or maintenance equipment crosses the edge line of
   the main runway, or if two-way communications cannot be maintained between ATC and the
 42                                                        440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


   disabled aircraft/maintenance personnel, runway operations shall not be resumed until the
   disabled aircraft has been towed clear.
   5.26.5. ATC shall advise operating aircraft of the obstruction, location, and any special
   restrictions. Blanket advisories shall not be used in lieu of an advisory to each aircraft.
5.27. Airfield Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations Procedures. NVD operations
referenced are defined as: conducting flight operations with the aid of night vision devices in
conjunction with reduced airfield lighting and does not preclude the use of NVDs at other times
when normal airfield procedures are in effect. All NVD operations will be conducted at aircrews
“own risk”. This guidance does not relieve pilots of the responsibility to comply with FAA and
USAF directives.
   5.27.1. Infrared (IR) lighting is installed on Runway 23 and the LZ (See Attachment 13) that
   meets Airfield Marking Pattern 3 (AMP-3) standard per AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing
   Zone Operations. The lighting is solar powered and therefore should be available for use at
   all times.
   5.27.2. In the interest of aerodrome safety, NVD operations will not exceed four
   participating aircraft in the pattern. Pope Tower will maintain awareness for airspace
   saturation and coordinate accordingly with aircrew. NVD operations shall not interfere with
   services provided to non-participating aircraft. NVD operations shall be terminated if any
   non-participating aircraft are in Pope Airspace.
   5.27.3. Weather Requirements. NVD operations flown in accordance with visual flight rules
   will only be flown in visual meteorological conditions, IAW VFR pattern weather minimums
   described in Table 5.2. Aircraft conducting instrument approaches with NVDs in instrument
   meteorological conditions will apply the appropriate published instrument approach weather
   minimums.
   5.27.4. Aircraft lighting. NVD aircraft position/strobe lights will remain on IAW AFI 11-
   202, Vol 3 and FAR part 91.209.
   5.27.5. NVD Taxi routes. Aircraft will follow normal taxi routes during NVD operations.
   5.27.6. NVD Traffic Patterns. Aircrews may request closed traffic patterns while
   conducting NVD operations, and will follow all other standard traffic patterns/altitudes.
   Crews must inform Pope Tower in a timely fashion when requesting other than standard
   pattern altitudes (to ensure proper coordination/sequencing) and use standard position
   reporting procedures. Pope Tower will respond with standard ATC terminology.
   5.27.7. Vehicle operations during reduced lighting. Vehicles are required to maintain two-
   way radio communications with Pope Tower while operating within the movement area and
   will be notified by Pope Tower when NVD operations will affect them.
   5.27.8. Airfield lighting. Pope Tower is authorized to modify airfield lighting to both the
       runway and LZ to include the PAPIs, REILs, approach lights, and runway lights when
   requested by aircraft conducting NVD operations.
   5.27.9. There are two types of NVD lighting operations available to the local flying
   community: AMP-3 or Minimum Lighting. These procedures supplement FAAO JO
   7110.65 and AFI 13-204, Chapter 5 and intermittent lighting during sunset/sunrise is
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                    43


   published in the US IFR Supplement.     Note: Air traffic controllers will not, at any time,
   utilize NVDs nor will ATC reduce the tower cab interior lighting.
       5.27.9.1. By definition, when aircrew request:     “MIN LIGHTING” operations to the
       main runway or LZ, PAPIs, REILs, approach lights and runway lighting will be turned
       down to its lowest level.                  “AMP-3” PAPIs, REILs, approach lights and
       runway lighting will be turned off. IR lighting will provide AMP-3 configuration with a
       “Box and One” for runway 23 main and “Box and Two” for runway 23 LZ only.
       Note: MIN LIGHTING and AMP-3 are available between sunset and sunrise, traffic
       and weather permitting.
       5.27.9.2. Upon transfer from Fayetteville Approach Control or at any time within the
       VFR pattern, pilots will use the following when requesting NVD operations:
       “POPE TOWER, PACKER 22 REQUESTING MIN LIGHTING/AMP-3
       LIGHTING FOR NVD OPERATIONS”. After acknowledging approval, local control
       shall issue the following: “ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, REDUCED LIGHTING
       NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT”
       5.27.9.3. All taxiway lighting and the rotating beacon will remain on. Upon request
       from aircrews, taxiway lights may be turned off if taxiways are not in use. Lighting for
       the parking ramps (Red ramp, Green ramp, etc.) will remain on.
       5.27.9.4. If a non-participating aircraft requests the airfield lighting be turned back on,
       Pope Tower will advise the NVD aircraft that the airfield lighting will be turned on at the
       other aircraft’s request. Approach and runway lights will be turned on no later than the
       non-participating aircraft reaching 5 mile final and will remain on until the aircraft has
       exited the runway.
       5.27.9.5. Pope Tower will issue takeoff and landing clearances to aircraft participating in
       “MIN LIGHTING” and “AMP-3” operations.
   5.27.10. Termination of reduced airfield lighting for NVD operations. Reduced airfield
   lighting shall be terminated because of, but not limited to, the following: unsafe airfield
   conditions, emergency response, non-participating aircraft departure or arrival, etc. Pope
   Tower and/or the aircrew have the authority to terminate reduced lighting.
   5.27.11. To terminate NVD operations, Pope Tower shall transmit over the tower
   frequencies prior to switching the airfield lighting to a normal night-time configuration.
   Once the situation is resolved NVD operations may be resumed if users so desire.
   Controllers will transmit the following: “REDUCED AIRFIELD LIGHTING FOR NVD
   OPERATIONS ARE TERMINATED FOR (reason)”
5.28. Use of Temporary Infrared Lighting (IR) on the Landing Zone. The 427 SOS only
shall use removable IR lighting (TACTEC, Inc Cat Light) on the landing zone. This IR lighting
will be placed on the Landing Zone by an aircrew member just prior to the training flight and
removed immediately after. As the aircrew member is placing the temporary IR lighting on the
landing zone, he/she will also turn off the existing IR lighting. A NOTAM will be advertised
restricting use of the landing zone and will read to the following effect: “The Landing Zone at
Pope Field will be limited to prior authorized aircraft only between the hours of XXXXZ and
XXXXZ.” During this time the landing zone will be limited to 427 SOS aircraft only due to the
presence of temporary IR lighting on the landing zone.
 44                                                         440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


   5.28.1. Airfield Management will serve as the coordinating agency with the 427 SOS. The
   427 SOS shall request to use the temporary IR lighting at least 12 hours in advance.
   5.28.2. The mission aircraft will request access to the landing zone to place the temporary IR
   lighting and extinguish the permanently mounted IR lighting; a maximum of 30 minutes
   prior to training.
   5.28.3. Immediately following the conclusion of the training, the aircrew will notify Pope
   Tower that training has been concluded. All temporary IR lighting has been removed and
   permanently mounted IR lighting is turned back on. Airfield Management will conduct a
   FOD sweep of the landing zone once notified by Pope Tower that training is complete.
   5.28.4. At no time will the temporary IR lighting be placed on runway 05/23 main.

in Restricted Area R-5311 Sector IV at approximately the 250 radial. Pioneer Field’s elevation
is approximately 250 feet; runway designators are Runway 25 and Runway 07.
   6.4.1. The use of Pioneer Field is only for aircraft in direct support of scheduled Security
   Operations Training Facility (SOTF) operations and will be coordinated with Pope Tower
   and Airfield Management at least 72 hours in advance. Shorter requests will be handled on a
   case by case basis. Airfield Management will issue a NOTAM 72 hours in advance for
   requests involving continuous operations. No pattern work or touch and go’s are allowed
   unless in support of scheduled operations.
   6.4.2. Aircraft operations at Pioneer Field will normally be conducted at or below 750 feet
   MSL. Any deviation from Pioneer Field pattern altitudes must be coordinated with Pope
   Tower prior to takeoff from Pioneer Field or Pope Field. Approval will be based on existing
   traffic conditions.
   6.4.3. Aircraft desiring to use Pioneer Field will advise Pope Tower while inbound on an
   approach, established in the VFR pattern or when calling for initial taxi.
       6.4.3.1. Once approved for operations by Pope Tower, aircraft will climb on runway
       heading (23/05) and on runway centerline. Once the aircraft has reached 400-750 feet
       MSL and is past the departure end of Runway 23 it may proceed to Pioneer Field and
       commence operations.
       6.4.3.2. Aircraft will continuously monitor Pope Tower’s frequencies while operating in
       the Pioneer Field pattern. Pilots will notify Pope Tower if radio contact will be
       intentionally broken i.e. for a full stop landing with an extended ground time. Positive
       communications will be made with Pope Tower prior to resuming pattern operations.
       6.4.3.3. While operating at Pioneer Field, either the landing zone ground controller, or
       participating aircraft will make positive radio contact with Fort Bragg Range Airspace

      7.1.2. When Simmons AAF is closed, Fayetteville Approach Control handles it as an
      uncontrolled airport with no SVFR operations authorized. The helicopter corridor will not be
      in effect. Helicopters transitioning via the corridor during this time will be in violation of
      applicable FARs unless they establish two-way communications with Fayetteville Approach
      and receive authorization. Fayetteville will contact Pope Tower, for approval or disapproval
      of the operation. If approved, the aircraft should then be transferred to Pope Tower
      frequency.
7.2. Helicopter Sling Load Operations. Helicopter flights carrying sling loads over Pope Field
shall be under positive control of Pope Tower. Under no circumstances will the sling load be
carried over any aircraft, building, or other structures while within the confines of Pope Field.
Sling load operations at Pope require prior coordination with Airfield Management.

      8.2.12. Ground traffic may be held or directed away from the runway or taxiways as
      necessary to assure the safety of vehicles and personnel responding to the emergency.
   8.2.13. During base exercises, Pope Tower may redirect resources away from the exercise
   toward a real-world emergency.
   8.2.14. Runway Operations Suspended. After an on-field mishap or an emergency landing,
   runway operations shall be suspended except to emergency response vehicles, Airfield
   Management or other emergency aircraft. Airfield Management shall inspect the runway
   after each emergency landing and may close the runway if deemed necessary. When it is
   determined that the runway is clear and safe, Airfield Management will notify Pope Tower to
   resume normal operations, or open the runway if it was closed. Note: Pope Tower shall
   transmit on Guard for any actual or anticipated runway closure, including the estimated
   duration of the closure.
8.3. Civilian Aircraft Emergency. In the event a civilian aircraft declares an emergency and
must land at Pope, the aircraft will be treated as an unauthorized landing. The unauthorized
landing does not imply a hostile act; simply the appropriate paper work and approval were not
obtained at least 24 hours in advance. will follow the emergency procedures outlined in section
8.2. The handling of the unauthorized landing shall be second to IFE response.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                       53

   unauthorized aircraft landing.”
   8.3.2. Airfield Management will activate the SCN in accordance with section 8.2.
   Additionally, Airfield Management will include the following phraseology on the SCN:
   “This is an unauthorized aircraft landing. Aircraft is currently located on (state location if
   known). Request immediate response from Fire Department and WSS to assist in blocking
   aircraft taxi.”
   8.3.3. If the aircraft is not disabled, taxi and parking procedures will be IAW section 9.4. If
   the aircraft is disabled, the on-scene commander will decide appropriate course of action.
8.4. Controlled Bailout Area (See Attachment 8). When an emergency exists that requires
abandoning the aircraft in flight, the pilot will advise (or the appropriate controlling agency) of
the emergency and intentions, time permitting. The controlling agency will assist the pilot, if
requested, in navigating to the bailout area but positioning for bailout is the responsibility of the
pilot in command. When possible, the pilot will bailout passengers and crew over a Fort Bragg
drop zone, preferably the Sicily DZ (POB 269006) (see Attachment 7). Abandon the aircraft on
a 190 heading, at or above 2,000’ MSL, if able.
8.5. External Stores Jettison Area (See Attachment 8) The emergency tank/cargo/external
stores jettison area is the Coleman Danger Area in R-5311 (POB 250008). Jettison stores
over the impact area from a level pass at 1,700’ MSL (day) or 2,700’ MSL (night), if appropriate
for the ordnance being dropped. Pope Tower or Fayetteville Approach Control will coordinate
with Fort Bragg Range Control prior to using this area and may assist the pilot in navigating for
the emergency drop, as needed. Positioning for the jettison is the ultimate responsibility of the
pilot in command.
8.6. Fuel Dump Area. The fuel dump area is on the POB 145-degree radial between 25 DME

announcements as directed by the Pope Command Post or 440 Operations Supervisor of Flying.
will notify Fayetteville Approach Control, Range Control, , and Simmons AAF.
8.10. Hot Brakes. Because of the possibility of fire or explosion, a hot brakes situation
constitutes an aircraft emergency, requiring activation of the Primary and Secondary Crash
Alarm Systems.
   8.10.1. Aircraft with known or suspected hot brakes on landing or during an aborted takeoff
   shall taxi clear of the runway onto the Red Ramp (Runway 23) or onto the 90 degree bend in
   Taxiway B (Runway 5). If these areas are not available, EORs are the alternate areas. An
   aircraft notified of hot brakes while at the EOR will hold position and not taxi to a primary
   hot brake area.
   8.10.2. As soon as an aircraft commander suspects hot brakes, he/she will notify Pope
   Ground/Tower to coordinate Fire Department response. Pope Tower will activate the PCAS
   to disseminate the appropriate emergency information.
   8.10.3. Under normal circumstances, the aircraft should not be taxied into a congested area
   (within 300’ of personnel or other aircraft) until the condition is cleared. In accordance with
   technical order guidance, other aircraft may taxi in front of or behind the hot brakes aircraft
   unless the on-scene commander has determined that it would be unsafe.
   8.10.4. The Fire Department, after initial response, shall determine that no fire hazard exists
   before releasing the aircraft to the on-scene maintenance supervisor, at which time fire
   protection may revert to a standby role. MOC will then dispatch necessary maintenance
   personnel and equipment, as required, to take control of the scene and assist the disabled
   aircraft.
8.11. Crash Recovery and Removal of Disabled Aircraft. Removal of disabled aircraft from
the airfield, including the runway/taxiways, shall be given first priority for tow operations.
8.12. Beacon Location/Deactivation Procedures. Individual organizations are responsible for
locating operating emergency locator transmitters or emergency radio beacons. Responsibilities
and duties are as follows:
   8.12.1. Pope Tower shall notify Airfield Management and Washington ARTCC when an
   emergency locator transmitter is operating. Airfield Management shall notify MOC of an
   emergency radio beacon transmitting.
      8.12.2. MOC shall:
         8.12.2.1. Notify CP of Emergency Radio Beacon and initiate checklist.
         8.12.2.2. Dispatch life support technicians to check all transient aircraft.
         8.12.2.3. Dispatch life support technicians to check assigned aircraft for operations.
         8.12.2.4. Report to Airfield Management by telephone when aircraft and maintenance
         shops under their responsibility have been checked.
   8.12.3. ELT tests will be conducted during the first 5 minutes of the hour for not more than
   three audible sweeps.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                55


8.13. Interference on International Distress Frequencies. The keying of either 121.5 MHz or
243.0 MHz for 30 seconds or more will activate the International Search and Rescue Satellite
(SARSAT). Radio Maintenance will limit routine tests on 121.5 and 243.0 to 15 seconds or less.
8.14. Military Working Dog (MWD) - Patrol Explosive Detection Dog (PEDD). The Fort
Bragg Provost Marshal Office (PMO) has 24 hour access to both MWD and PEDD for
emergency response. Pope Tower will immediately notify the Fort Bragg 911 to request such
team.

              SPECIAL OR EMERGENCY PARKING/TAXIING OPERATIONS

9.1. Unscheduled Landing with Conventional Munitions. When notified that an aircraft
carrying conventional munitions is inbound without prior coordination, Transient Alert and
Airfield Management shall ensure that the following is accomplished:
      9.1.1. Landing Because of Weather. Aircraft will be parked in the Hazardous Cargo Areas
      (Hot Spots). Aircraft with forward-firing ordnance shall be oriented in a direction that is
      clear of personnel, buildings, equipment, and other aircraft until qualified personnel arrive
      that can de-arm the aircraft.
   9.1.2. Landing Because of Fuel Requirements. Aircraft may be refueled, de-fueled if
   necessary, as defined in appropriate technical orders. Fighter aircraft must be de-armed prior
   to performing any maintenance or servicing. Orient the aircraft to ensure that forward firing
   ordnance presents the least possible hazard to other resources.
   9.1.3. Landing Because of an Emergency. If an explosives-carrying aircraft is involved in a
   mishap, Pope Command Post shall ensure that EOD and Pope Safety Center personnel are
   notified.
9.2. Unsafe Ordnance/Equipment Procedures.
   9.2.1. Forward Firing. In the event of landing with a confirmed or suspected unsafe gun, or
   other unsafe forward firing ordnance including training projectiles (TP rockets), the aircraft
   will normally taxi to the Runway 23 EOR area, keeping the nose of the aircraft pointed away
   from other aircraft/personnel to the maximum extent possible. Ground Control will assist
   other aircraft to avoid taxiing in front of the unsafe aircraft. Aircraft should be stopped with
   enough room to pull forward out of EOR and continue taxiing. When landing to Runway 05
   with an unsafe gun, make a left 180 degrees turn and back-taxi down the runway to the
   Runway 23 EOR area.
         9.2.1.1. If the equipment cannot be rendered safe by the maintenance crew, the pilot will
         request clearance to the Taxiway November (Figure 9.1) and await instructions from 18th
         Explosive Ordnance Disposal Corps. Command Post will notify WSS to have traffic
         stopped on Hurst Drive and Rifle Range Road until termination of emergency.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                  57


Figure 9.1. Forward Firing Unsafe Ordnance Area.




   9.2.2. AC-130 Hot Gun Procedures. When notified that an AC-130 with hot guns is
   inbound, Airfield Management will notify Transient Alert and Command Post to park the
   aircraft on HSP 1 (Figure 9.2). Aircraft will park on the parallel taxiway behind HSP 1, with
   the gun facing the natural rise of the land away from the airfield. Command Post personnel
   will contact the WSS to have traffic stopped on Hurst and Malvesti Drive. After the aircraft
   is rendered “safe,” Airfield Management will notify WSS to reopen the road. Currently an
   AC-130 armed with Hazard Class/Division 1.1 105mm projectiles cannot be operated from
   Pope Field. Contact the Pope Safety Center for guidance.
 58                                                        440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


Figure 9.2. AC-130 Hot Gun Area.




   9.2.3. Hung Flare. In the event of landing with a confirmed or suspected hung or unfired
   flare, Airfield Management will notify Transient Alert and Command Post to park the aircraft
   as follows: C-130 will be positioned on the parallel taxiway behind HSP 1 and C-5/ C-17
   aircraft will pull to the rear of HSP 1 and await instructions from 18th Explosive Ordnance
   Disposal Corps. Initial withdrawal distance is 300ft. See Figure 9.3 and 9.4.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                          59

9.3. Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material. During routine operations, cargo aircraft
loading/unloading hazard class/divisions (HC/D) 1.2 and 1.1 explosives will use Red Ramp
 60                                                            440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


during non-contingency operations. See explosives site plans for explosives loading on other
ramps during contingencies. When information is received about an inbound/outbound
explosives or hazardous material shipment, it is the responsibility of the agency receiving this
information to ensure that Pope Command Post and Airfield Management are notified. Note:
Aircraft carrying hazardous cargo must have a PPR on file with Pope
   9.3.1. Airfield Management shall notify:
       9.3.1.1. Pope Tower.
       9.3.1.2. Fire Department.
       9.3.1.3. Weapons Systems Security.
   9.3.2. Pope Command Post shall notify:
       9.3.2.1. 440 OG/CC
       9.3.2.2. 3 APS Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC).
       9.3.2.3. Pope Safety Center.
       9.3.2.4. Golden Knights if HCD is 1.1/1.2.
       9.3.2.5. 81 Regional Support Command if HC/D 1.1/1.2 is used on spots 1 & 2.
   9.3.3. The following information will be disseminated:
       9.3.3.1. Aircraft call-sign, mission identifier and type aircraft.
       9.3.3.2. ETA/ETD.
       9.3.3.3. Parking spot. The term “hazardous cargo” or “inert devices as appropriate.
       9.3.3.4. DOT Hazardous Cargo Class/Division when applicable.
       9.3.3.5. Net explosive weight (NEW).
       9.3.3.6. Line numbers and quantities when nuclear weapons are involved.
       9.3.3.7. People on board (forward/aft) and fuel on board in pounds.
       9.3.3.8. Departing/arriving runway in minutes.
       9.3.3.9. Wind.
   9.3.4. Red Ramp should be used first to load/unload all HC/D. For aircraft transporting
   5,000 lbs NEW or less, HC/D 1.3 or 1.4, Green/Blue Ramps may be used once Red Ramp is
   full. Red Ramp is sited for 10,000 lbs NEW for HC/D 1.1, 1.2x, and 1.3 explosives, with the
   exeception of Spot 1, which is limited to 3,000 lbs NEW of HC/D 1.2.2 explosives. All spots
   are sited for mission essential quantities (MEQ) of HC/D 1.4.
   9.3.5. Airfield Management /Aircrews will ensure that “Hazardous Cargo” is annotated on
   the outbound flight plan (DD Form 175 or 1801) and that this information is transmitted to
   the destination airfield over the Aeronautical Information System (AIS) when a departure
   message is transmitted.
9.4. Unauthorized/Unidentified Aircraft Landings. AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations
Procedures and Programs, defines an unauthorized landing as a landing at an Air Force airfield
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                          61


by a civil aircraft without prior authority (approved DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing
Permit and 24 hours prior notice). In the event a civilian aircraft emergency must land at Pope,
the emergency will take precedence over the unauthorized landing. Upon termination of the
emergency, the unauthorized landing will be handled.
   9.4.1. Any flight plan filed through appropriate military/FAA channels, including one filed
   to a different destination is sufficient to properly identify an aircraft. If it is determined that a
   proper flight plan has been filed, the aircraft will be handled as normal transient traffic. If
   the aircraft does not have a flight plan or PPR number on file, or if the aircraft cannot be
   identified by a civil aircraft landing permit from HQ USAF, Airfield Management will
   continue to attempt identification through appropriate channels, including a query of the
   aircraft’s home station (if known). Note: Transient aircraft without a PPR number and not
   part of a Pope Field flying operation may be turned away if Pope is unable to provide the
   required support. When an “unidentified” aircraft arrives in the area with the intention of
   landing at Pope Field:
   9.4.2. Pope shall:
       9.4.2.1. Request the point of departure (or, if civilian, the aircraft owner) and
       immediately notify Airfield Management of call sign, type aircraft, and point of departure
       or ownership.
       9.4.2.2. Issue landing instructions if aircraft can be positively identified and authorized.
       9.4.2.3. Activate the Primary Crash Alarm System if the aircraft has not been
       identified/authorized.
       9.4.2.4. Upon landing, direct the aircraft away from the main ramp area and have WSS
       immobilize the aircraft. When appropriate, WSS will transfer control of the aircraft to
       Transient Alert.
   9.4.3. If the aircraft cannot be identified, Airfield Management shall continue notifications
   via the Secondary Crash Net.
   9.4.4. The Airfield Manager or a designated representative, and the senior WSS supervisor
   shall identify the aircraft occupants and determine the reason for the unauthorized/no flight
   plan arrival.
   9.4.5. If an unidentified aircraft lands, Installation Security Plan 31-101 shall be
   implemented immediately. The aircraft will be detained as an unauthorized landing until
   proper identification is made. At no time may unidentified aircraft taxi among or near other
   aircraft/resources.
   9.4.6. The installation CC or designated representative will identify an unauthorized landing
   as emergency, inadvertent, or intentional landing as stated in AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
   Landing Permits.
9.5. Aircraft Hijack/Theft Prevention. The purpose of this program is to thwart attempts by
known/unknown persons to gain access to, or to taxi and/or launch aircraft when such activity is
unauthorized. Procedures are outlined in JO 7610.4P, Special Operations, Chapter 6 (ESCAT).
   9.5.1. Pilots shall contact Ground Control prior to engine start as a hijack/theft prevention
   measure.
62                                                          440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013


  9.5.2. Pope Tower shall activate the PCAS for any unauthorized engine starts or aircraft
  movement. This imperative should not override good judgment. If an aircraft calls for a
      routine operation, i.e. request for taxi, engine run or tow, and prior coordination was not
  accomplished, the aircraft should be told to “stand by” while an inquiry takes place with the
  appropriate authorizing agencies. If an aircraft proceeds to start engines or taxi without prior
  coordination, Pope Tower shall attempt to contact the aircraft. If no response is received
  within 15 seconds or if it is determined to be an unauthorized operation, Pope Tower shall
  then activate the PCAS.
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                     63

       procedures are in effect. Primary radar unavailable at Fayetteville Approach. Radar
       services available on transponder equipped aircraft only. Class C Services will not be
       provided.”
11.4. Hot Weather Operations. The following guidelines are for Pope-assigned aircrews.
   11.4.1. Heat Stress Index (HSI). The severity of hot weather is indicated by the Heat Stress
   Index issued by Pope Bioenvironmental Engineering. HSI is given as Category 1-         5    (5
   being the greatest risk of heat stress injury) is available through Pilot-to-Metro. Category 5
   HSI will also be transmitted over the Secondary Crash Alert System as a Weather Advisory.
   Note: HSI uses Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) which takes into account
   temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, sunlight intensity, and pavement effects to
   determine an equivalent body load temperature.
   11.4.2. Heat Stress Operations (General). Refer to POPEI 48-105, Control of Heat Stress,
   Attachment 1 for HSI definition criteria as well as recommended work/rest cycles, water
   consumption, and actions to be taken under each category.
   11.4.3. C-130 Operations for Heat Stress.
       11.4.3.1. Category 4 or 5:
          11.4.3.1.1. Uploading of airdrop personnel should be accomplished on spots R-6
          through R-12, or as close as possible to the troop chute-up area.
          11.4.3.1.2. All personnel airdrop missions should be planned for Engine-Running
          On/Offload (ERO).
          11.4.3.1.3. All aircraft will be configured with two 5-gallon water jugs, one forward
          and one aft. Jugs may need to be refilled between sorties.
          11.4.3.1.4. Other special handling of Army troops on Pope is governed by Ft. Bragg
          regulation and will be directed by the Airborne Commander and jumpmaster.
       11.4.3.2. Category 5. In addition to the procedures listed above:
          11.4.3.2.1. Minimize ground/taxi times, and increase formation taxi interval.
          11.4.3.2.2. Low-level VFR routes should be reduced to 30 minutes.
          11.4.3.2.3. Station Keeping Equipment/Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System
          (SKE/AWADS) routes are not limited. Consider flying SKE/AWADS routes to
          increase the comfort level of jumpers.
11.5. Adverse Weather Advisory Procedures.
   11.5.1. Pope Weather or the 26th Operational Weather Squadron (Barksdale AFB, LA) will
   disseminate weather watches, advisories, and warnings IAW 440AWI 15-101, Weather
   Support.
   11.5.2. Upon notification of adverse weather conditions, Pope Command Post will run the
   quick reaction checklist and notify MOC of the adverse weather conditions. They will also
   make an announcement on the Giant Voice network and ATHOC MNS. MOC will make a
   call over their respective radio nets to ensure all flightline personnel are notified of the
440AWI11-250 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                     67


   situation. Pope Command Post and MOC will use these same procedures to notify personnel
   when the Pope Weather Authority determines that there is no longer a threat of adverse
   weather.
   11.5.3. Flightline maintenance personnel will begin to secure aircraft and loose/non-essential
   equipment when a lightning watch is issued (30 minutes advance notice of the potential of
   lightning within 5 NM). Maintenance personnel will shut down operations and evacuate the
   ramp immediately (a) upon receiving a lightning warning (lightning observed within 5 NM)
   which the Pope Weather Authority has determined poses a hazard to the base, or (b) at the
   direction of flightline supervision if, in their judgment, it is unsafe to continue work.
   Flightline operations shall not restart until the “all clear” announcement is initiated by the
   Pope Command Post.
