                                                Chapter 1

                                                POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations are
available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encountered
day-to-day. If deviations are required during contingency operations, use sound judgement and opera-
tional risk management to meet mission demands. In order to meet HQ AF guidance towards conserving
fuel, additional equipment not normally used in day-to-day operations should be removed.

1.2. Responsibilities. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most appropriate con-
figuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and man-hours to
change. Units performing services on the HC/MC-130 aircraft (e.g., maintenance, life support) are
responsible for configuring the aircraft in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and as outlined in mis-
sion directives to include the stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipment
tables outlined herein.

1.3. Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to HC/MC-130 cargo compartment
configurations. The number identifying the configuration capability will follow the letter code.
   1.3.1. AE - Aeromedical Evacuation
   1.3.2. C - Cargo
   1.3.3. CP - Cargo and Passengers
   1.3.4. LP - PSYOPS
   1.3.5. P - Passenger
   1.3.6. RAPID – Term synonymous with infiltration/exfiltration (Infil/Exfil)
   1.3.7. TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo
   1.3.8. TAP - Tactical Airdrop Personnel

1.4. Modifications. The configuration codes of this instruction may require modification for a specific
mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to ensure maximum
flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the basic con-
figuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy the mission requirement. For example, a
cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-X cargo
configuration. Indicate the mission directive configuration C-X (number as applicable) and modification,
e.g., two additional seats and bulldog winch required.

1.5. Weight and Balance.
   1.5.1. Configuration and necessary equipment changes to conduct rescue missions affect the weight
   and balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the location of the equipment, items shown
   in Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft except for
   maintenance, inspection and when removal is directed by this AFI. Equipment listed in Table 2.2. will
   be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, at ref-
6                                                   AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A 15 APRIL 2008


    erence 6, 7, or 8. Adjustments will be made when the actual on board weight of these items vary from
    the data shown. Add aircraft armor into the DD Form 365-4 (Form F) if armor is installed on the air-
    craft. Paratroop door armor, and panels covering components requiring access in flight (if required),
    needs to be re-calculated when armor is repositioned. DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instruc-
    tions in Chapter 5.
    1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1. is accomplished at a For-
    ward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority
    is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A,

                          CARGO COMPARTMENT CONFIGURATION

3.1. Configuration. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configurations for the HC/MC-130P
Aircraft. Although modifications to the basic configuration are authorized to meet special requirements,
the following factors should be considered:
WARNING: Jettison of pallets from the aircraft rollers without dual rails has not been tested and should
be attempted only as a last resort.

NOTES:
For aircraft with personnel equipment storage bins installed, useable cargo space is limited to 69 inches
off the cargo floor from FS 417 to FS 617, extending 35 inches inboard from the wheel well that the bins
are attached to.
All cargo compartment configurations depict the rescue bin installed. Installation and use of the rescue
bin is at the discretion of the flying unit CC or DO.
Standard configuration for contingency deployments is with at least one fuselage tank installed.
   3.1.1. Sidewall and wheel-well seats should be installed/stowed on all missions unless otherwise
   depicted by this instruction. One-man sidewall seats will not be used unless connected to a two-man
   seat. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch
   spacing will be configured for 20-inch spacing
   3.1.2. Pallet position six is limited to 4,759 pounds when rollers and ramp air deflectors are installed.
   With roller conveyors removed and ramp air deflectors installed, 4,919 pounds may be carried. With
   ramp air deflectors removed and rollers installed the limit is 4,840 pounds. At no time will total
   weight on the ramp exceed 5,000 pounds.
   3.1.3. Drawings in this volume are not drawn to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.
   3.1.4. Safety aisle requirements are depicted in Paragraph 4.2. and Figure 4.1.
   3.1.5. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, maintain a 30-inch
   space between cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or nuclear cargo. When cargo, either
   palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION:
   Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                            REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.

4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following emergency
exits and safety aisles are available:
     4.2.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
     4.2.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops. This does
     not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress. Litters and
     seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an obstruction.
     4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisleway will be maintained in the wheel
     well (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits. In
     the wheel well area the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide. Access to aft latrine facilities
     requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward left or right side of cargo loaded on the ramp.
     4.2.4. If the aisleway requirement in paragraph 4.2.3. cannot be achieved on missions carrying crew
     only or mission-essential personnel authorized by operations order/plan or CFAC, then a safety aisle
     will be maintained in the wheel well area to provide the following minimum clearance. (Figure 4.1.)
        4.2.4.1. At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher
        than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
        4.2.4.2. Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the aircraft beginning no
        higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform.
     4.2.5. During airdrop missions; loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to accomplish
     tactical checklists.
     4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of
     the aircraft. The aircraft commander will be the final authority for determining if safety aisles/access
     aft of cargo is adequate. Cargo loads in Section VI of T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Manual, are
     specific and do not require a waiver.

4.3. V-Blade Knife Sheath.
     4.3.1. Install V-blade knife with sheath assembly on the aircraft and enter it as special equipment on
     AF Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory. This knife can be used in an emergency to
     release personnel and recovery lines such as parachute harnesses, shroud lines, survival vest webbing,
     etc. V-blade knife may also be used to cut release straps on container delivery system and ramp bun-
     dles.
     4.3.2. Units will order sufficient V-blades and keys, crash rescue type, MA-l knives: part number
     5367126 is listed in the 5110 stock catalog as 5110-524-6924 (local purchase). Upon receipt, units
     will:
        4.3.2.1. Disassemble and spray each part of the knife separately with clear, acrylic plastic or other
        suitable preservative to prevent rusting and corrosion. Do not use Peralkatone. Reassemble knife,
        omitting the delta-shaped blade key.
        4.3.2.2. Locally manufacture sheath and plates per Figure 4.2. Construct the entire sheath assem-
        bly with canvas and cover with Duracote.
        4.3.2.3. Drill a 3/16- hole in the center of the handle, directly above the centerline of the shank.
        4.3.2.4. Tie a 10 ft. length of Type III Nylon (550 cord) to the knife through the drilled-hole and
        secure the other end to the strap sewn into the stowage pocket of the sheath assembly. Fold the
        line. Do not coil it. Bind the line with a rubber band for neat stowage and to prevent tangling.
     4.3.3. Care of the V-blade knife.
        4.3.3.1. Inspect the knife for rust or corrosion during each preflight inspection. Remove rust and
        corrosion and spray all parts with plastic or other preservative as often as necessary.
        4.3.3.2. After each use of the knife, remove the blade and sharpen, then recoat with preservative.

4.4. Roller Conveyer Installation.
     4.4.1. Install roller conveyors on the cargo ramp end, and on the cargo floor. Four ten-foot sections
     are installed on the cargo ramp and eight eight-foot sections are on the cargo floor in J and K compart-
     ments. Center rollers over tiedown rings at buttline 20 left and right.
NOTE: If up to three 48’x 48” CRLs (RAMZ) are to be loaded, two ten-foot sections are installed on the
cargo ramp and two eight-foot sections are on the cargo floor in J and K compartments (when required).
        4.4.1.1. A/A32H-4A Rollers. Due to past modification to the HC-130 cargo floor and ramp, the -
        4 rollers may not attach to the floor as they were designed. Locally manufactured braces and bolts
        are needed to secure the roller conveyors. Place two braces laterally across the top edge of each
        roller conveyor frame, while the bolts are attached vertically through predrilled holes in the braces
        to tiedown ring bolt receptacles. (See diagrams, this attachment)
     4.4.2. Until the HC-130 floors are modified by TCTO 1C-130(H)H-595C, D, E to accept rollers, the
     preferred method of attaching - 4 rollers is with braces and bolts. If braces and bolts/keepers are
     unavailable, steel safety wire (0.032 or greater, not less than four turns) may be installed at three (min-
     imum) points to secure each roller conveyor section. This is a less desirable method of attachment.

                                 DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD Form 365-4.
The Form F will be computed using simplified moments. All entries and signatures must be legible.

5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft
will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition. Consideration must
be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.
Math charts contained in T.O. 1C-130(H)H-5 may be used for load planning. When the fuel load is
unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of MAC zero fuel.

5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments.
   5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number, departure
   and destination station (name or ICAO identifier), aircraft’s home station and pilot's rank and last
   name.
   5.3.2. REMARKS section.
       5.3.2.1. Enter a breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for each tank, to include fuselage tank fuel, to
       the nearest 100 pounds and moments using the fuel moment tables contained in T.O.
       1C-130(H)H-5, Chart E.

NOTES:
Fuselage tank fuel will be included in the total takeoff fuel weight and moment entered in Reference 10.
Enter a breakdown of fuselage tank fuel weight with other fuel breakdown in the Remarks block. Fuse-
lage tank fuel, although considered cargo weight for ACL purposes, should be calculated with total fuel
load for flight endurance and fuel burn-off calculations.
An alternate method of computing fuel moments is accomplished by multiplying the total fuel (except
fuselage tank fuel) by .552. When using the alternate method of computing fuel moments, a breakdown of
takeoff fuel weight for each tank to the nearest 100 pounds will be entered in the remarks section. For
fuselage tank fuel multiply by .536.
       5.3.2.2. Enter estimated fuel burn-off (FBO) below the total takeoff fuel. Subtract anticipated fuel
       burn-off from total takeoff fuel. If no HAR or hot refueling is anticipated, this is your estimated
       landing fuel (ELF).
       5.3.2.3. Enter anticipated fuel offload HAR (label it as HAR) below the anticipated FBO. Add and
       subtract as appropriate FBO, HAR, and hot refueling to arrive at ELF. Enter the break down of
       ELF, and total ELF in the remarks block.
       5.3.2.4. Load adjuster number block. Leave blank.

NOTE: Use the following criteria to compute in-flight fuel consumption:
First hour of flight (climb-out)        6000 PPH
Normal flight at altitude               5000 PPH
Low altitude flight (low level)         6000 PPH
     5.3.3. Reference 1. Enter basic weight and moment from the last entry of the certified copy of the DD
     Form 365-3 in the aircraft weight and balance handbook. Line through the words, “Index Or” directly
     above the moments number entered in Reference 1 and write in the number, 1000, in the Index/
     Moment block.
     5.3.4. Reference 2. Leave blank.
     5.3.5. Reference 3. Enter the number of crewmembers, locations, weight, and moment from crew/
     cargo compartment Table 4.13.
     5.3.6. Reference 4. Enter crew baggage by location. Determine weight and moment.
     5.3.7. Reference 5, 6, and 7. Determine amount of equipment on board and location. Compute weight
     and moment.
     5.3.8. Reference 8. Countermeasure expendables: Enter chaff and flare weights and moments as
     required.

   ance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude, runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other pub-
   lished restrictions. The pilot/flight engineer will inform the loadmaster of any gross weight
   restrictions prior to the mission so an accurate allowable cabin load (ACL) may be obtained.
       5.3.26.1. Takeoff. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 pounds for HC/MC-130P/N,
       and subtract total aircraft weight (Reference 12).

NOTES:
The limiting wing fuel chart in this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated air-
speed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limiting wing fuel charts. When specific mis-
sion requirements exceed the limitations outlined in area "C" of the limiting wing fuel charts, the
loadmaster must compute limitations using the appropriate flight manual limiting wing fuel chart in sec-
tion V of T.O.1C-130(X)X-1.
Enter the allowable gross weight for limiting wing fuel and subtract the operating weight (Reference 9) to
determine limiting wing fuel allowable cargo load (ACL). The limiting wing fuel charts are based on wing
fuel stores only.

5.4. Limiting Wing Fuel. The following tables may be used to determine the maximum limiting wing fuel
ACL for a given fuel load when in primary or secondary fuel management. Both tables are based on the
recommended areas (Areas A, B, and C) of the Weight Limitations Chart (Primary Fuel Management) or
(Secondary Fuel Management) (*Non Air Refueling Mission) With Foam In Fuel Tanks, With Refueling
Pods. For operations that do not meet these criteria, use the appropriate chart in T.O. 1C-130(M)P-1, T.O.
1C-130(H)H-1, or T.O. 1C-130H(N)-1, Section V, to determine ACL. Fuel weights are expressed in thou-
sands. Both takeoff and landing conditions must be calculated. The most restrictive will be placed on the
DD Form 365-4 (* T.O. 1C-130(M)P-1).
