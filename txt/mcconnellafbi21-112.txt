                                            Chapter 1

                          GENERAL CDDAR RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General Responsibilities. The 22d Maintenance Squadron Commander (22 MXS/CC) has
the primary responsibility for conducting crash recovery operations, as directed by the 22d
Maintenance Group Commander (22 MXG/CC). Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will
implement the Maintenance Group commander’s instructions and will request support from
transient aircraft home station/MAJCOM as required. 22d Maintenance Squadron, Maintenance
Flight, Repair and Reclamation Section (22 MXS/MXMTR) is primarily responsible for the
crash recovery program. The section chief, Crash Recovery Team Chief (CRTC), or designated
representative will assume the duties of CRTC. Maintenance Flight will develop crash recovery
procedures in coordination with the 22d Civil Engineers Squadron Fire Department (22
CES/CEF), 22d Logistic Readiness Squadron POL Flight (22 LRS/LGRF), 22d Air Refueling
Wing Safety (22 ARW/SE/SEG/SEW/SEF), 22 CES Readiness Flight (22 CES/CEX), 22d
Medical Operations Squadron Base Bioenvironmental (22 MDOS/SGOAB), 22d Security Forces
Squadron (22 SFS), 22 CES Explosive Ordnance Disposal Flight (22 CES/CED), 22d Operations
Support Squadron Airfield Manager (22 OSS/OSAA), 931 ARG, and other on-base or off-base
agencies as applicable.
     1.1.1. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate
     safety practices to minimize their effect. There is an infinite variety of possible emergency
     and crash recovery situations; therefore, specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every
     situation. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the Emergency Operations
     Center to the Incident Commander (IC). Practice and/or participation in wing crash recovery
     exercises and implementation of operational risk management techniques are imperative for
     all emergency and crash recovery operations.
     1.1.2. 22 ARW will retain overall CDDAR responsibility for 22 ARW/931 ARG aircraft
     with manning assist as required.
     1.1.3. McConnell AFB personnel will direct all media inquiries to 22 ARW/PA. The only
     authorized persons to provide information to the media concerning crashed aircraft are the 22
     ARW/CC, 22 ARW/PA, or the formal Safety Investigation Board (SIB) President.
     1.1.4. CDDAR teams work with the Incident Commander (IC) and Team Chief to re-open
     runways for operational use, prevent secondary damage to aircraft, recover CVR/FDR
     equipment, and preserve evidence for mishap or accident investigations.

                    CRASH RECOVERY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

3.1. Overview. The KC-135R, R/T, T model aircraft are the primary Mission Design Series
(MDS) assigned to 22 ARW.
   3.1.1. For a detailed check list see: Attachment 8 and 9
3.2. Definitions:
   3.2.1. Normal Responses: Aircrew declared emergency requiring crash recovery team
   response but limited action in recovering the aircraft. EXAMPLES: Flight control
   malfunctions, radio failures, bird strikes, fuel leaks, extended/hanging boom, and low fuel.
   3.2.2. Major Responses: Aircrew declared emergency requiring crash recovery team
   response and action in recovering/removing the aircraft. EXAMPLES: Landing gear will not
   extend, collapsed landing gear, blown tires, auxiliary power unit fires, hot brakes, engine shut
   down, aircraft departs runway/taxiway and/or aircraft crashes.
3.3. Normal Response:
   3.3.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and two recovery members. The CRTS
   will respond with one CRTM in the primary crash recovery vehicle. 22 AMXS will standby
   with an aircraft tow vehicle for further guidance from the CRTS. The CRTS will establish
   and maintain radio contact with the SFO or OSC on the fire/crash net.
   3.3.2. If upon landing the aircraft stops on the active runway, the SFO or IC will normally
   determine if a fire or explosive hazard exists. Once the fire or explosive hazard is eliminated,
   the SFO or IC will normally clear the CRTS to begin recovery operations.
   3.3.3. The CRT will establish interphone/hand signal communication with the aircraft
   commander and, if no further assistance is required, the CRT will clear the aircraft to taxi to
   parking. The SFO or IC will normally terminate the In-Flight Emergency.
   3.3.4. If further assistance is required, the CRTS will supervise normal engine shutdown
   procedures on the runway. The CRT will, with the pilot as brake rider, tow the aircraft to an
   open parking location at either the North or South EOR. The CRTS will then contact the
   appropriate squadron, and based on mission requirements, either tows the aircraft to its
   parking location or request the squadron send a tow crew to retrieve the aircraft from EOR.
   Once the aircraft has cleared the runway the SFO or IC will normally terminate the IFE.
3.4. Major Response:
   3.4.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and four recovery members. The CRTS
   will respond with one CRTM in the primary crash recovery vehicle. 22 AMXS will standby
   with an aircraft tow vehicle for further guidance from the CRTS. The remaining CRTMs
   will respond as necessary.
   3.4.2. The CRTS will establish and maintain radio contact with the SFO or OSC on the
   fire/crash radio nets.
MCCONNELLAFBI21-112 24 JUNE 2010                                                               11


3.5. Hot Brakes:
   3.5.1. The pilot or CRT will be responsible for identifying potential or actual hot brake
   conditions.
   3.5.2. When an aircraft is declared as having a potential/actual hot brake condition the SFO
   or IC will normally establish a 300-foot cordon and determine if an explosive hazard exists.
   Once the fire or explosive hazard is eliminated the SFO or IC will normally clear the CRT to
   begin recovery operations. The CRTS will have authority to allow/deny entry into the
   accident site. CAUTION: It is impossible for the ground crew to avoid the hot brakes and
   inboard engine danger areas at the same time while installing the landing gear down lock
   pins or wheel chocks; therefore, the inboard engines will be shutdown prior to installing
   the landing gear down lock pins or wheel chocks.
   3.5.3. Prior to engine shutdown, the SFO will contact the pilot using UHF/VHF radio to
   confirm the engine shutdown and instruct the pilot to hold the aircraft in position using
   minimal brake.
   3.5.4. The aircrew will remain in the cockpit until the brakes have cooled sufficiently. If the
   aircrew must be extracted, 22 CES/CEF personnel will chock the nose tire before crew
   extraction.
   3.5.5. The SFO or IC will normally terminate the emergency and the CRT and one fire crash
   crew will monitor the aircraft.
   3.5.6. After 45-60 minutes, the CRT will approach the landing gear area from the front or
   rear only and examine to ensure enough heat has dissipated to safely tow the aircraft. When
   it is safe to approach the aircraft, the CRT will install any remaining pins and wheel chocks.
   The CRTS will notify MOC and applicable AMU to dispatch a tow team to tow the aircraft
   to its parking spot.
3.6. Aircraft Departs Runway/Taxiway/Crash:
   3.6.1. Once cleared by the SFO or IC, the CRT will inspect the aircraft for damage to items
   containing composite materials. The CRT will secure all loose composite fibers IAW T.O.
   00-105E-9, Aircraft Emergency Rescue Information.
   3.6.2. The CRT will make the aircraft safe for maintenance.
   3.6.3. The CRT will recover the aircraft IAW applicable safety standards, technical orders
   and instructions.
   3.6.4. The CRT will transport the aircraft to a facility designated by the IC or 22 MXG/CC.
3.7. On/Off-Base Recovery Procedures:
   3.7.1. The wing commander through disaster response force, i.e., Wing Command Post (22
   ARW/CP), unit control centers, emergency operation center (EOC) and any specialized
   teams, coordinates on/off-base recovery actions. Refer to 22 ARW Emergency Management
   (EM) Plan 10-2, Base Operation Plan 32-1, AFMAN 32-4004, and 22 ARW Mishap
   Response Plan 91-1 for agency/team responsibilities.
