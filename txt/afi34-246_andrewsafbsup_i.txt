SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The Air Force Instruction was realigned and is more cohesive. This revision (1) combines former AFI
34-252, Laundry, Dry Cleaning, and Linen Exchange and AFMAN 34-253, Laundry, Dry Cleaning, and
Linen Exchange; (2) eliminates all policy and guidance to laundry and dry cleaning plants. Since there are
only three remaining Air Force laundry and dry cleaning plants (all overseas), the responsibility for pro-
viding guidance is now a MAJCOM responsibility; (3) with the elimination of authorized APF manpower
positions, provides options for bases to continue linen exchange service; (4) allows alternate electronic
means of maintaining the linen exchange inventory. The office symbols were updated and outdated items
deleted. Table A3.1 Air Force Inns Standards was removed. Note 5.2 of Chapter 1 was changed to reflect
HQ AFSVA as the waiver authority for Standards, not to include business suite ratio standards. Added
1.5.2. explaining the new Pet Policy in lodging and the associated guidelines. The term Distinguished Vis-
itor Rooms was renamed to Business Suites. Paragraph 1.9.5 was added regarding MAJCOMs/bases not
reducing or expanding the number of business suites constructed in visiting quarters. Paragraphs 1.10. Fit-
ness Rooms and 1.11. Business Centers were added to address additions into Lodging. Rule 39 was added
to Table 2.1. allowing other DoD ID holders, not on orders, availability to use Lodging facilities. Para-
graph 3.4. Guaranteed and Non-guaranteed Reservations was amended and updated to current standards.
Table 3.1. Space Available Reservation Guidelines was previously covered by a policy letter. Paragraph
4.7. amended payment procedures to reflect current information. Paragraphs 5.2. on Lodging Staffing,
5.3. on Dress and Appearance, and 5.4. on Training Standards were added. Paragraph 5.5. Professional
Certification was added under training. Clarifications of Contingency Lodging Quarters Policy are
included in the revision at Attachment 5. Air Force and MAJCOM responsibilities were changed to be in
line with AF Lodging Centralization to be completely implemented by 1 Oct 2007.

                           FACILITY AND GUEST ROOM STANDARDS

1.1. Mission Statement. Provide quality lodging facilities and service to authorized personnel to main-
tain mission readiness and quality of life, while keeping official travel costs to a minimum.

1.2. Lodging Facility and Guest Room Standards. DoD 4165.63-M, DoD Housing Management, pre-
scribes standards (see Table 1.1.) for transient, unaccompanied personnel housing (lodging). Personnel
staying in DoD lodging operations should have the same quality facilities, furnishings, and services, as
they would find in a good quality, mid-level, commercial hotel. The standards identified in this AFI are
designed with the customer in mind. The customer wants consistent, quality service in all facets of the
lodging operation and expects the same quality facilities, furnishings, and service from one Air Force
lodging operation to the next. Air Force general managers, through their chain of command, are responsi-
ble for ensuring every aspect of their operation adheres to these standards. The use of standards will also
help maximize economies and efficiencies in Air Force lodging operations. The general manager’s chal-
lenge is to meet 100% of the standards. For a complete list of the Air Force Inns guest room standards,
refer to the Golden Eagle Standards section of the Air Force Inns webpage section on the Air Force Ser-
vices Agency website. Requests for waivers due to inadequate space, guest inconvenience, or operational
need may be forwarded to AFSVA/SVOHL for consideration from Squadron/Division Commanders with
complete justification. Conversion of new construction VQs to Business Suites must be submitted to HQ
AF/A1S for consideration. Lodging Managers will be given an AF Standards Evaluation. All new manag-
ers or prior failed operations must have two consecutive “Passes” of 85% or higher prior to moving to two
year evaluation increments. Bases that do not pass the AF Standards Evaluation will be required to
develop an improvement plan in cooperation with AFSVA/SVOHL and a courtesy copy to the MAJCOM
multi-functional. Those bases will be reevaluated every 6 months until achieving a passing score. For a
complete list of Visiting Quarters (VQ) and Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) facility design standards,
refer to the Air Force Services Agency website under the Lodging Construction Program section.

      designated for military mobility and field gear, or equivalent. In open bay, net living area is one
      equal share per person. For a detailed explanation on measuring rooms, please refer to the Air
      Force Visiting Quarters Facilities Design Guide on the Air Force Services Agency website.
   3. For information on lodging contingency procedures, see Attachment 5.
   4. Adhere to the above minimum adequacy standards when obtaining commercial lodging.
   5. Air Force lodging operations are not authorized to involuntarily lodge duty transient personnel in
      government lodging not meeting the minimum space and privacy standards identified in Table
      1.1., during normal, peacetime operations, without the approval of HQ AF/A1SO.
      5.1. Installation commanders may authorize lodging in facilities not meeting minimum standards
      for reasons of military necessity, such as contingency operations, natural disasters, emergencies,
      etc. It is inappropriate to involuntarily lodge duty transient personnel in facilities below minimum
      adequacy standards solely to reduce TDY costs.
      5.2. However, duty transient personnel may voluntarily accept a lodging room that does not meet
      minimum adequacy standards.
      5.3. Exception: Reserve personnel in IDT status with a waiver from HQ AFRC/A1S.
   6. For new construction and renovation projects, the standard for visiting quarters is a private room/
      private bath configuration for all grades, with 296 square feet of net living area. Please see the Air
      Force Visiting Quarters Facilities Design Guide as listed in Note 2 above.

1.3. Facility Utilization. General Managers determine the number of lodging rooms required based on
Priority 1 (see Chapter 2) guest historical data and future mission changes that might affect Priority 1
guest traffic. Commanders should consider redesignation of lodging rooms/facilities as permanent party
housing, or other use, if the occupancy rate is below 75% for a period of 1 year (or below 50% priority one
guests). Any non-contingency re-designation of lodging appropriated fund (APF) assets requires HQ AF/
A1S approval.
   1.3.1. HQ AF/A1S must approve facility diversions to any other use for all facilities built with non-
   appropriated funds to include internal diversion of NAF built quarters such as redesignation of VQ
   rooms to Business Suites, etc. (Refer to AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities, for additional
   guidance.)
   1.3.2. General managers may temporarily house newly assigned unaccompanied single permanent
   party personnel in lodging facilities if permanent party housing is not readily available. Members
   must pay the lodging service charge. Lodging units are not intended to be transferred temporarily to
   Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQs) or dormitories to circumvent the daily service charge. Members
   should consult their financial services office regarding pay entitlements.

    1.3.3. If on-base lodging becomes unavailable for any reason, the general manager informs potential
    customers IAW procedures outlined in AFMAN 34-255, Directory of Government Quarters and Din-
    ing Facilities.
    1.3.4. Unaccompanied male and female guests will not share sleeping rooms or bathrooms, but may
    have adjacent bedrooms with a kitchen and/or living area between them if the kitchen/living area has
    two doors with functioning locks on both the inside and outside of each door.
       1.3.4.1. For facilities configured as VQs the following guidelines apply. A separation of general
       areas between guests that fall into different rank categories is normally desirable. To the extent
       possible, assign airmen/NCOs, officers, and aircrew members to rooms on separate floors/wings,
       especially when crew rest is an issue (where Prime Knight is established). Managers should use
       flexibility and good judgment when making these assignments. When rooms in the normally des-
       ignated area are not available, assign guests to any available VQ room on a first-come, first-served
       basis. Do not send guests to commercial quarters or issue certificates of nonavailability unless
       there are no rooms available.

1.4. Guest Room Standards. The guest room is the heart and soul of Air Force lodging operations.
Every effort should be made to ensure our guests have clean, comfortable rooms that afford them a good
night’s rest. All lodging employees have a significant role in this effort. The room should be attractively
furnished, fully supplied, clean, and properly maintained to ensure the guest a pleasant stay. Detailed
guest room amenities, furnishings, and supplies standards are in the Golden Eagle Standards.
    1.4.1. Guest Room Accessories and Amenities. Air Force lodging rooms are distinguished by the
    attention to detail that is put into the rooms to make them as comfortable as possible for our guests. To
    ensure consistent service from one Air Force Inn to the next, our lodging operations must provide our
    guests the same standard accessories and amenities. See Golden Eagle Standards for the detailed list
    of standard Air Force Inn accessories and amenities.
    1.4.2. Guest Information. It is important that our guests feel welcome and comfortable in their “home
    away from home.” Each room will have a guest information book prominently displayed that includes
    a welcome letter from the general manager on the first page (and how they may contact the duty man-
    ager). Ensure information is available pertaining to local areas and conditions. Lodging will also list
    occupant responsibilities in guest room information books. See Golden Eagle Standards for a detailed
    listing of what is required in the guest information book.
    1.4.3. Guest Privacy. Housekeeping or lodging management will enter a guest room that has had a
    ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign showing for three consecutive days. This should be accomplished no earlier
    that the posted check-out time.

1.5. Occupant Responsibilities in the Facilities and Guest Rooms. Occupants are responsible for their
conduct and the conduct of their guests, and/or family members, while in government lodging. Their
actions must not infringe on the rights of others.
    1.5.1. No-Smoking Policy. All Air Force lodging common areas and guest rooms, including TLF
    units, are no-smoking areas. General Managers will ensure guests are informed of this policy when
    making a reservation and at check-in. When smoking does occur in a guest room, an efficient ionizer
    or deodorizer will be used to clean the room and rid it of as much smoke residue as possible. Guests
    may be charged up to a $150.00 fee based on expenses incurred to return the room to available inven-
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                     9


   tory for violating the no-smoking policy. Once cited, guests who violate this policy are subject to evic-
   tion as determined by the Lodging Manager; appeals should be made through the Services
   Commander/Division Chief.
   1.5.2. Pet-Friendly TLFs. Every effort should be made to accommodate the inclusion of Pet Friendly
   TLFs in an Inn’s inventory and make every effort to provide PCS quarters to this unique segment of
   the AF Family. Lodging operations are required to implement Pet TLFs unless HQ AFSVA/SVOHL
   approves a waiver justifying why Pet TLFs aren’t appropriate at a specific base. Guests may be
   charged up to a $150.00 fee based on expenses incurred to return the room to available inventory for
   violating the no-pet policy (those installations not participating in the pet program) or when guests in
   pet facilities violate the rules. Once cited, guests who violate this policy are subject to eviction as
   determined by the Lodging Manager; appeals should be made through the Services Commander/Divi-
   sion Chief. Pets in VQs are not authorized and are incompatible with the purpose of TDY facilities.
   Information on operating Pet TLFs is found in paragraph 1.19.
   1.5.3. Occupants will conserve utilities, and comply with fire, health, and safety regulations.
   1.5.4. Occupants will reimburse lodging for damage beyond fair wear and tear, and for missing gov-
   ernment property caused by abuse or negligence on their part or by their guests. AFMAN 23-220,
   Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, or AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets,
   govern the assessment of loss or damage to a lodging unit by a guest. The general manager processes
   a report of survey on loss or damage to NAF/APF assets in accordance with AFMAN 23-220 and AFI
   34-202.

1.6. Guest Security in Facilities and Guest Room. Guest safety and security is of the utmost impor-
tance. Accordingly, the front desk staff must not give a guest’s room number or personal information to
others.
   1.6.1. Key control procedures will be implemented to ensure security. Do not print room numbers on
   the key, key chain, or electronic door openers. If room numbers are already placed on keys or key
   chains, place the key in a small envelope to conceal the room number until replaced.
   1.6.2. Do not issue replacement keys to guests when another key is requested without positive identi-
   fication confirming that the guest is assigned to the particular room.
   1.6.3. All interior corridor rooms will have evacuation procedures with maps leading to the closest
   exit posted on the backside of all room entry doors.

1.7. Guest Room Housekeeping and Preventive Maintenance. The housekeeping staff plays a very
important role in ensuring guests enjoy their stay and must ensure all lodging rooms and common areas
are clean and orderly (the room is neat and everything works). All housekeepers must provide guests with
friendly, prompt, professional service.
   1.7.1. Guest requests for housekeeping service or supplies must be fulfilled as soon as possible, but
   no later than 30 minutes after the request during normal working hours; after normal duty hours, tow-
   els, spare light bulbs, toilet paper, etc., will be made available at the front desk.
   1.7.2. In addition to full room and common area cleaning, accomplish deep cleaning and preventive
   maintenance checks according to prescribed standards. Standards and checklists are located in the AF
   Lodging Standards Checklist which can be found on the Air Force Services Agency website.
10                                                     AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


1.8. Guest Room Quality Assurance Inspection and Review. The installation commander (or his/her
deputy commander) inspects a sampling of all types of lodging at least annually. The general manager
maintains a record of these inspections to include dates, facilities visited, and comments. All discrepan-
cies noted must be tracked and corrected.
     1.8.1. The general manager or assistant manager will inspect at least 1-2 percent of guest rooms (each
     room type) on a weekly basis (and maintain documentation of inspections for at least 1 year).
     1.8.2. At least two members of the lodging management staff must conduct formal inspections of
     lodging common areas and at least 25 percent of the guest rooms each quarter and document their
     findings (maintain inspection documentation for at least 1 year).
     1.8.3. The lodging staff will conduct safety self-inspections of all lodging facilities and operations,
     using checklists from Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 91-1, Billeting
     Operations (see your local safety office for additional information).

1.9. Business Suites. An installation commander may designate business suites within the visiting quar-
ters. Business suites will be released NLT 1600 daily to the Lodging office when managed by the Protocol
office. Occupancy should be maximized by issuing a majority of rooms to other TDY and Space A trav-
elers regardless of rank or status (being mindful of upcoming reservations) aiming to keep Business Suites
occupied at least 75% of the time or risk a reduction in their Business Suite inventory.
     1.9.1. No more than 5 percent of a lodging operation’s total transient quarters will be identified as
     business suites without HQ AFSVA/SVOHL approval. Waivers must be resubmitted every two years
     and should justify excess need and include historical occupancy data. (HQ AFSVA/SVOHL will pro-
     vide HQ AF/A1SO and MAJCOM/A1S an information copy of approved waiver requests).
     1.9.2. Lodging and protocol will establish local operational instruction concerning business suite res-
     ervations and management to include exceptions to 1.9. above such as protection of General Officer
     suites, etc. It should also emphasize Space-A availability and occupancy percentages.
     1.9.3. MAJCOMs and/or bases are not authorized to adjust the number of business suites constructed
     in visiting quarters. These suites have already been identified consistent with paragraph 1.9.1. above,
     and do not need to be adjusted. Any action pursued to either reduce or expand the number, and/or size,
     of suites constructed is inconsistent with the justification and methodology for providing visiting
     quarters and must be submitted to HQ AF/A1S as the sole waiver authority.

1.10. Fitness Rooms. In keeping with the Fit to Fight culture of the Air Force, fitness rooms should be
included in Air Force Lodging facilities when space and equipment permit. Fitness rooms should focus on
cardio equipment such as treadmills, elliptical trainers, stair climbers, and stationary bicycles. Addition-
ally, an area for abdominal work and stretching is required. Free weights or other weight machinery is not
appropriate for this area and is best left to fully supervised facilities such as the base fitness center. A tele-
vision for viewing while using the equipment is required as are towelettes to clean the equipment after
use. Ideally, when establishing a fitness room, lodging should partner with the fitness center staff to max-
imize use of their excess equipment. Whether reusing aged fitness center equipment or buying new, lodg-
ing should use the same cardio equipment brands as the base fitness center and establish equipment
maintenance through the fitness center’s source. Lodging fitness rooms are in no way intended to compete
with base fitness centers, but instead should complement the focus on an individual’s responsibility to
stay Fit to Fight in the temporary duty / permanent change of station (TDY/PCS) environment. Specific
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                      11


standards, location consideration, etc. are listed in the Golden Eagle Standards section of the Air Force
Inns webpage on the Air Force Services Agency website.

1.11. Business Centers. Air Force personnel traveling on TDY or PCS orders often require continued
contact with their offices/duty stations. Air Force Inns must provide standard business services including
Internet access, fax and copy capability for official business at no cost. Specific standards/guidelines
regarding the appropriate number of computers for a business center are listed in the Golden Eagle Stan-
dards section of the Air Force Inns webpage on the Air Force Services Agency website.

1.12. Laundry Facilities. Laundry facilities are a core item in our Air Force Inns. Laundry equipment
will be offered to our guests at no charge. Laundry supplies (detergent, softener, etc.), must be available to
users thru coin-operated vending machines located in laundry rooms or at retail sales outlets. Washers and
dryers are provided at a ratio of one washer and dryer for each 12 rooms in visiting quarters and one
washer and dryer per each eight rooms in temporary lodging facilities (one per unit in new construction);
however at training bases or bases where a significant portion of the customer base involves long-term
stays (more than three-weeks duration), the ratio is one washer and dryer for each eight visiting quarters.

1.13. Transient Aircrew Lodging. Lodging provides a private room/private bath to officer transient air-
crew members (accommodations may include a shared kitchen and/or living area). For enlisted transient
aircrew members, lodging provides a private room and a private or shared bath. Aircrew members are
defined as anyone on the flight crew order. Ensure gender is considered when assigning lodging to air-
crews.
   1.13.1. When construction or maintenance in the vicinity of aircrew quarters could interrupt crew
   rest, general managers will not assign aircrew members to buildings in the area.
   1.13.2. Lodging may assign other TDY personnel to transient aircrew accommodations if not
   required for aircrews and other on-base lodging is not available. When assigning other TDY personnel
   to aircrew accommodations, advise them of the varied aircrew members sleeping hours, and ask them
   to refrain from making any noise or disturbance that could interrupt crew rest.
   1.13.3. Lodging will maintain aircrew integrity by housing the entire aircrew either on base or off
   base. If housed on base, lodging will house them as close together as possible, with no more than two
   stops to pick up all crew members. If lodged off base, lodging will house the aircrew in one commer-
   cial establishment.
   1.13.4. The installation commander or the aircraft commander may waive aircrew lodging require-
   ments on a temporary basis for reasons of military necessity.

1.14. Commercial Lodging (CL). Air Force lodging operations, using a Memorandum of Understand-
ing (MOU) will attempt to negotiate reduced rates for CL accommodations in order to provide eligible
guests alternative lodging when adequate on-base lodging is not available. If no space is available on base
the TDY guest has the option to accept a non availability number and find their own hotel. Most of our
TDY travelers will accept our assistance by going to one of our available CLs. Lodging Managers will, to
the greatest extent possible, distribute assignment among properties with special CL rates established with
the base to maintain good business relations. The negotiated rates for CONUS CL establishments may not
exceed the lodging portion of the local area per diem rate authorized by the JFTR, Volume 1, excluding
taxes. The negotiated rates and applicable taxes for OCONUS CL establishments should not exceed
12                                                   AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


authorized local area per diem rates. As bases fully migrate to the Defense Travel System (DTS) and AF
and DoD Lodging availability becomes linked to travelers CLs will become obsolete.
     1.14.1. Lodging must be able to show the reason CL was used when on-base lodging was not opti-
     mally utilized (no-shows, team integrity, etc.), as prescribed by the servicing accounting and finance
     office.
     1.14.2. The general manager will establish requirements-type contracts when circumstances warrant,
     such as when it is known in advance that a specific number of rooms are needed for a fixed time
     period (e.g., Air Reserve Component (ARC) Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends).
     1.14.3. Base lodging, military public health, and fire protection officials must visit off-base commer-
     cial lodging establishments, when initially considered for use as CL, to ensure they meet the Perfor-
     mance Work Statement/Memorandum of Understanding (PWS/MOU) conditions. Military public
     health and fire protection officials will provide the general manager written reports/assessments for
     each establishment visited. General Managers will also conduct, and document, annual community
     relations visits with the management of all CL establishments.
     1.14.4. General managers will provide travelers assigned to CL information about base facilities,
     telephone numbers, and hours of operation. Managers should also have information available about
     the commercial hotel, transportation arrangements, and check-in and checkout procedures. General
     Managers will make customer comment forms available to guests assigned to CL to obtain feedback
     regarding the service provided. The general manager ensures comment cards received at the CL estab-
     lishment are picked up and reviewed, with appropriate actions taken and documented.

1.15. Guest Parking. There must be adequate and designated vehicle parking for guest registration with
a separate area for passenger and baggage unloading/loading. All facility parking areas must be well
marked, cleaned, swept, free of debris, and adequately lighted at night. Where feasible, each business
suite will have a designated parking space as close as possible to the room.

1.16. Facility and Guest Room Signage. Proper signage is necessary to direct lodging guests to the
lodging reception center and to their rooms. The general manager will make every effort to ensure the fol-
lowing signage is in place:
     1.16.1. Directional signs from the base main gate(s) to the lodging reception center(s).
     1.16.2. Illuminated exterior sign(s) identifying the lodging reception center and all other lodging
     facilities.
     1.16.3. Illuminated signs identifying lodging facility numbers.
     1.16.4. Directional signs at each lodging guest facility entrance, and on each floor in the case of
     multi-story buildings, indicating the room location, room numbers on each exterior guest room door,
     and where vending machines, ice machines, laundry facilities, etc., are located.

1.17. Facility Employee Work and Break Areas. All lodging employee break areas must reflect the
same quality standards of lodging common areas and guest rooms. The general manager will designate
appropriately furnished and decorated lounge areas for lodging employees to take their breaks.

1.18. Training/Conference Rooms. Lodging is required to have a training/conference room large
enough to host training for the majority of the employees.
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                  13


   1.18.1. The room may be used by guests or other base units at no cost with the understanding that the
   groups will pick up after themselves.
       1.18.1.1. A cleanup fee can be charged to any group that either damages the facilities or leaves an
       excessive mess.

1.19. Pet TLFs. Every effort should be made to accommodate the inclusion of Pet Friendly TLFs in an
Inn’s inventory and make every effort to provide PCS quarters to this unique segment of the AF Family.
Lodging operations are required to implement Pet TLFs unless HQ AFSVA/SVOHL approves a waiver
justifying why Pet TLFs aren’t appropriate at a specific base.
   1.19.1. The limit of pet-friendly TLFs is not more than 40% of TLF inventory unless a waiver is
   approved by HQ AFSVA/SVOHL with an informational copy being sent to the MAJCOM multi-func-
   tional.
   1.19.2. Pet owners will be charged a standard $10 per room per night fee regardless of the number of
   pets in the unit and duration of stay.
   1.19.3. The standard is two pets (dogs & cats) per unit.
       1.19.3.1. Managers may “waive” the restriction on a case-by-case basis and permit other caged
       pets under 20 lbs (such as hamsters, rabbits, gerbils, etc.). However, it is important to ensure
       housekeepers are comfortable servicing the room with that pet present in a cage.
       1.19.3.2. Managers may “waive” the limit of two pets on a case-by-case basis especially with
       smaller animals.
   1.19.4. Pet owners must provide proof of current rabies shot at time of check in. Installations may
   require evidence of additional shots.
NOTE: Guests that are accompanied by Service and working dogs are authorized to stay in lodging facil-
ities, regardless of an approved local pet policy and are exempt from paying any additional fees above the
nightly room rate.
   1.19.5. Occupants will obtain appropriate care for their pets when pet units are not available. The
   general manager will ensure a list of local pet kennels is available.

                                            GUEST ELIGIBILITY

2.1. Eligible Guests in Air Force Visiting Quarters, Temporary Lodging Facilities, and Commercial
Lodging. Table 2.1. lists personnel who qualify for Priority 1 and Priority 2 status in VQs. Table 2.2. lists
personnel who qualify for Priority 1 and Priority 2 status in TLFs. Personnel listed as Priority 2 are
assigned rooms on a space available basis. Within Priority 1 and Priority 2, assignments to VQs and TLFs
are made on a first-come, first-serve basis, without regard to rank.

2.2. Support of Tenant Units. Host base general managers extend support to personnel assigned or on
temporary duty (TDY) to tenant and attached units. Host-tenant or interservice support agreements must
reflect this support.

NOTES:
  1. Civilian personnel and/or their family members are Priority 1 for on base lodging when in a PCS
     status overseas. In CONUS, they are Priority 2 for on base lodging.
   2. Do not issue a PCS member an automated commercial lodging authorization or nonavailability
      (NA) number. Instead, provide member an Air Force Inns Temporary Lodging Expense Allow-
      ance/Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLE/TLA) memorandum. Using Epitome, you will register
      the guest in the Wait List Module and assign them a CL or NA room type. You may reference the
      Epitome wait list account number on the provided TLE/TLA memorandum.
   3. All foreign personnel must pay lodging service charges directly to the lodging office, except
      International Military Education and Training (IMET) enlisted personnel. Lodging requests reim-
      bursement for IMET enlisted personnel through the host base foreign training office and account-
      ing and finance office. Invoices must list names, nationality, and number of days that lodging was
      provided, and total amount of charges. Lodging must also furnish a copy of each student’s travel
      orders.
   4. IMA members will pay all lodging charges, regardless of type of duty performed (i.e., active duty,
      AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour; inactive
      duty for training, AF Form 40A, Authorization for Individual Inactive Training, per diem status,
20                                                    AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


        or location where the duty is performed (i.e., at or away from the assigned unit/man-day assign-
        ment). IMA members must file for reimbursement through IMAT-OL/FMFPT (Consolidated
        Accounting and Finance Office, Travel Section), 1392 Second Street, Dobbins ARB GA
        30069-4823.
     5. Lodging Managers who have other groups requesting reservations more than 60 days out will
        work with the ARC wing/unit lodging POC to maximize occupancy in Lodging facilities. When
        quarters are in short supply on a routine basis, Lodging and the ARC unit should work together to
        negotiate with a commercial hotel for quarters at or near the Base Lodging rate. Installation Com-
        mander may waive on a case by case basis.
     6. Unit-assigned Air Force Reserve personnel in an active duty status, to include annual tours in a
        per diem or non-per diem status, performed at home station or away from home station, will pay
        all lodging charges and file for reimbursement on a travel voucher.
     7. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status away from home station will pay their own
        lodging costs and file for reimbursement.
     8. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status at home station will not pay for their own lodg-
        ing. The unit of assignment will pay all lodging room charges via an organizational credit account
        (e.g., Government Purchase Card (GPC)). Refer to Attachment 3 for billing procedures.
     9. Air National Guard (ANG) members in an active duty status for annual tours in a non per diem
        status will pay for on-base lodging or commercial lodging. ANG members will file for reimburse-
        ment through their unit of assignment.
     10. Air National Guard members in an IDT status will not pay their lodging room charges. The unit of
         assignment will pay IDT lodging charges via an organizational credit account (e.g., GPC). Refer
         to Attachment 3 for billing procedures. For Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), Air
         National Guard and Reserve lodging is provided in accordance with the Interservice Support
         Agreement (ISSA) and Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA).
         NOTE: For payment procedures concerning individual and unit-assigned Air Force Reserve per-
         sonnel, contact HQ AFRC/A1SP (Programs Division, Services Directorate), Robins AFB GA,
         DSN 497-2103. For Air National Guard billing procedures, contact ANG/A1SX, Andrews AFB
         MD, DSN 278-8177.
     11. Contract personnel traveling overseas are lodged according to the contract provisions and the
         host-nation Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The local contracting squadron provides Letter
         of Identification (LOI).
     12. If you have the space available for these guests, confirm their reservation as a Priority 1 status for
         the duration of their stay.
     13. Unless otherwise covered by other rules in this table.
     14. Military includes US Coast Guard members.
     15. Retirees who are evacuated to a Military Treatment Facility in the United States are considered
         Priority 1 and thus allowed to make confirmed lodging reservations for the duration of their stay.
     16. AFROTC cadets participating in the Operations Air Force Program and the Base Visit Program
         are not in a per diem status. They are not charged for services provided (except for incidental
         expenses, e.g., sundries, phone charges, etc.). They are not assigned to CL without prior approval
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                               21


     from HQ AFROTC/DOSR. Reimbursement for lodging service charges is accomplished as fol-
     lows: For the Operations Air Force Program, collect a copy of each cadet’s orders, indicate the
     daily service rate and estimated number of nights’ stay and fax a copy of the orders to HQ
     AFROTC/DOSR at DSN 492-7003 or commercial (334) 953-7003, within 5 days after checkout.
     HQ AFROTC/DOSR will provide a Government Travel Account (credit card) number to pay for
     room charges. Upon checkout, fax a copy of the paid bill/receipt to HQ AFROTC/DOSR. For the
     Base visit program, fill out the information at the bottom of the cadet’s special orders, where it
     says, “note to lodging facility,” and fax a copy to HQ AFROTC/DOSR. All other procedures are
     the same as the Operations Air Force Program.
  17. Every attempt must be made to house the United States Air Force Academy Cadets on base. If
      there is no on-base room availability during one of their proposed TDY dates, then with approval
      from the cadet Liaison Officer first, these cadets may be authorized Commercial Lodging (CL).
      CL costs will be paid directly by the individual cadet.

NOTES:
  1. PCS-in as Priority 1 applies only to the member’s new duty assignment location, not PCS enroute
     (traveling to new assignment). PCS-out as Priority 1 applies only to the member’s departing duty
     assignment location, not PCS enroute (traveling to new duty assignment). Personnel PCSing-in or
     -out of the local area (i.e., Recruiters, regardless of service) will be considered Priority 1 for
     assignment in the TLF at the installation closest to their office location regardless of their host
     base of assignment.
  2. If no space is available on base then register the guest in the Epitome system as a NA account
     (wait list). Provide the member a locally devised TLE/TLA memorandum. Annotate the NA
     account number on the memorandum.
  3. This does not apply to government housing occupants who are displaced as a result of pro-
     grammed housing renovation/ upgrade (e.g., kitchen renovations, etc.).
  4. Military includes US Coast Guard members.
  5. Retirees who are evacuated to a Military Treatment Facility in the United States are considered
     Priority 1 and thus allowed to make confirmed lodging reservations for the duration of their stay.
  6. Lodging fees may be reduced to BAH levels to this category of guests for up to 30 days.

                         RESERVATION AND CHECK-IN/OUT PROCESS

3.1. Reservation Process for On-Base Lodging. The reservation process is typically the guest’s first
encounter with the lodging operation. Therefore, lodging personnel who accept reservations must be thor-
oughly trained to conduct this procedure as efficiently and smoothly as possible. Air Force lodging
accepts reservations for travelers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on a first-come, first-served basis, with-
out regard to rank. Lodging operations operating less than 24 hours must have the capability to accept res-
ervations via answering machines after normal duty hours. Air Force military temporary duty personnel
must use on-base lodging when adequate and available (unless waived for military necessity), and will
make advance reservations when traveling to an Air Force installation. Reservations can be made via a
traveler’s home installation’s servicing commercial travel office (CTO) or by contacting an Air Force Inn
directly. The Air Force Lodging Directory can be found at: http://www.dodlodging.net for public access.
This directory can also be used to make direct online lodging reservations at those Air Force Inns imple-
mented with the Epitome web reservations system. Calling -888-AF-LODGE can also make reservations
for CONUS operations. Lodging Managers must report all lodging phone number changes to HQ
AFSVA/SVOHL immediately after the new number is available.
   3.1.1. You must book guest reservations by reserving room type space and not specific rooms.
   Reserving guest reservations by space versus rooms results in the most effective use of available quar-
   ters and the best customer service. There will be occasions where you need to reserve specific rooms
   such as for Distinguished Visitors, handicap rooms, or other unique situations.
   3.1.2. Guests that check-in between 2400 and 0500 will be charged for the previous night’s stay.
   Guests that request an “early check-in” and reserve a room for the day prior to their arrival may be
   assessed an early check-in fee, regardless of their actual arrival time. Guests checking in after 0500
   will be charged for the current day’s stay.
   3.1.3. Newly inducted enlisted members undergoing processing, orientation, or basic training, includ-
   ing follow-on technical training at a base having both government dining facilities and lodging, are
   not authorized per diem or reimbursement for lodging service charges, and will be accommodated in
   permanent party housing. However, if members have attended a PCS school and are attending fol-
   low-on training and are entitled to per diem, lodging provides accommodations.
   3.1.4. The installation commander reserves the right to refuse service to any guest for cause. (This
   responsibility may be delegated in writing to the general manager). A memorandum for record (MFR)
   detailing the reasons for refusal should be sent to the Services squadron for review and filing.
   3.1.5. The lodging office will house group travelers requiring team integrity at the same geographical
   location (all on base or all off base) when specified on the group members’ travel orders. See Attach-
   ment 4 for further details regarding the Prime Knight program.

3.2. VQ Reservation Process. At the time lodging confirms the reservation request, the staff must
inform TDY personnel whether their reservation is confirmed for on-base lodging or off-base lodging. If
on-base is not available the guest has the option to accept a nonavailability number (NA) and find their
own hotel or allow us to assist them with off-base lodging by staying at one of our contract lodging (CL)
hotels. The member is authorized an NA or CL if adequate lodging is unavailable on base for the entire
TDY period. If space becomes available in on-base lodging after CL reservation confirmation or NA

number issuance, lodging should make an effort to maximize occupancy by attempting to notify the trav-
eler of the change and encouraging the traveler to stay on base.

NOTES:
The traveler is not required to stay in on-base lodging after he/she has already received a NA number or
been issued a CL reservation confirmation.
See Attachment 3 for ARC procedures for IDT Lodging.
Those bases with TDY-to-School students will still maximize occupancy by being able to split a students
reservation between on-base and commercial lodging. Also, those bases have the right to pull
TDY-to-School students back on base if space becomes available from Commercial lodging if more than
7 days is left on their TDY.
     3.2.1. Lodging Procedures for students who are TDY-to-school (AETC Bases) are as follows:
        3.2.1.1. Students attending formal training courses funded with TDY-to-school dollars have prior-
        ity for on base lodging over all other personnel categories listed in Chapter 1, Table 1.1. (basic
        publication).
        3.2.1.2. Managers must maximize the use of on base lodging. This means that managers may
        require students to be lodged both on and off base during the course of their TDY, provided stu-
        dents are only moved once and the length of stay in both locations is at least 5 days. For example,
        if students arrive and space is available for the first 5 days on base and the length of the TDY is 10
        days, managers must place the students on base and then move them to off base lodging for the
        remaining 5 days. Students must receive 24-hour notice of any move on or off base.
        3.2.1.3. A student’s reservation must be changed from off base to on base if quarters become
        available prior to his or her arrival in the area. The lodging office must notify the student or point
        of contact when reservations are changed.
        3.2.1.4. Managers must ensure the lodging office places each student housed in commercial lodg-
        ing (CL) on a waiting list for the first available vacancy on base. When lodging becomes available,
        the lodging office will call the student to inform him or her to move on base within 24 hours.
        3.2.1.5. Prior to the start of the fiscal year, the general manager will obtain annual class schedules
        from the base training registrar or individual squadron training manager (as appropriate for each
        base) and make group reservations in the property management system for the projected classes
        (by class name, class number, and number of students). Lodging manager along with base training
        registrar or individual squadron training manager will review and update training schedules
        monthly for accurate forecasting of the next 3 months.
     3.2.2. Before placing an official traveler in commercial lodging or issuing a nonavailability number,
     lodging operations will assign guests to available room types that meet or exceed the minimum ade-
     quacy standards found in Chapter 1, Table 1.1. Lodging will assign enlisted personnel to Visiting
     Officers Quarters (VOQ) when Visiting Airman’s Quarters (VAQ) are full rather than sending them
     off base. Officers and civilians may be assigned to a VAQ when VOQs are full and the VAQ room
     meets minimum adequacy standards for officers and civilians. General Managers are responsible for
     controlling lodging rooms to ensure efficient use of all rooms and maximum occupancy. General
     Managers will review daily reports, e.g., arrivals report, departure report, reservations, etc., and make
     changes to reservations as necessary. The reservation staff will encourage guests to book the portion
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                      27


   of their stay that can be accommodated on base at the time of “sale.” The goal is to accommodate the
   entire length of stay, but at the very least, accommodate them for the maximum amount of time a room
   is available. General Managers will also establish a tracking system to ensure guests are contacted at
   their off-base accommodations to provide them the opportunity to move back on base once space
   becomes available.
   3.2.3. If a registered Priority 1 guest (on base, CL, or with a NA number) must extend the TDY
   period, lodging will consider this extension as a new requirement and handle it accordingly. The gen-
   eral manager will issue another NA number if on-base lodging or CL is not available for the extended
   TDY period.
NOTE: Lodging reservations for multiple tours (back-to-back) regardless of the type of duty performed
are considered one requirement if made at the same time. Do not move personnel from one room to
another when duty status changes.
   3.2.4. When lodging authorizes CL, provide the traveler the name and phone number of the commer-
   cial hotel or motel within one duty day of the reservation request.
       3.2.4.1. When authorizing lodging at a CL establishment, lodging will provide a letter of authori-
       zation identifying the traveler and verifying duty status. This authorization will be provided to the
       hotel/motel prior to the guest’s arrival (via fax, e-mail, etc.). The traveler is not required to go to
       lodging to pick up the letter of authorization. The CL establishment will develop procedures to
       provide the traveler a copy of this authorization at check-in. The CL agreement entitles duty status
       travelers to the agreed government rate for the specified period. The traveler retains this authoriza-
       tion and submits it with his/her travel voucher.
   3.2.5. Per Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Volume 1, government quarters are considered not avail-
   able when the TDY is less than 24 hours. Therefore nonavailability numbers are not issued in such cir-
   cumstances. This should be stated on the member’s travel orders or the TDY member should note this
   on his/her travel voucher.
       3.2.5.1. Lodging does not issue NA numbers to ARC units in an inactive duty, non-per diem sta-
       tus when at home station.
       3.2.5.2. The general manager issues NA numbers only if the installation is listed in AFMAN
       34-255 as having lodging facilities available.

3.3. TLF Reservation Process. The maximum TLF stay for Priority 1 guests (members arriving/depart-
ing PCS, separating, or retiring; hospital outpatients, friends/relatives of inpatients, etc.) is 30 days if
available. The general manager may adjust the maximum stay considering PCS and hospital outpatient
demand for lodging to maximize TLF availability for Priority 1 guests.
   3.3.1. PCS members on Permissive TDY for an advance house-hunting trip (e.g., not performed in
   conjunction with actual PCS move) are limited to ten days. In overseas areas, the general manager
   may grant extensions if this reduces TLA costs and does not create hardship for other potential guests.
   3.3.2. If Priority 1 guests occupy all TLFs, and other Priority 1 personnel request TLFs the general
   manager keeps their requests on a standby basis for a reasonable time (property management system’s
   wait list), pending cancellation of reservations or early guest departure. Lodging fills vacancies from
   these standby reservations on a first-come, first-served basis before assigning personnel from lower
   priorities.
28                                                   AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


     3.3.3. Lodging assigns families to CL on a voluntary basis when TLFs are fully occupied or adequate
     space is not available in the VQ (general manager will determine if VQ space is suitable for family
     and other VQ guests). When the family is referred to CL or makes their own arrangements, lodging
     must register them in Epitome as a CL or NA room type reservation.

3.4. Guaranteed and Non-guaranteed Reservations. Official duty travelers, i.e., TDY/PCS, must use
their government travel card (GTC) to pay all lodging room fees per Public Law 105-264 unless exempt
from GTC use (exemptions should be reflected on official travel orders). Any reservation that is guaran-
teed for late check in with a credit card and not checked-in by midnight will be forwarded a day by the
desk clerk before running Night Audit. Guaranteed reservations may be subject to a no-show charge on a
case-by-case basis as determined by the general manager. All lodging guests must provide a credit card
when making their reservation (unless noted as an exception in Table 2.1. where the lodging bill is not
paid by the individual). If the guest (excluding the exception in Table 2.1.) does not provide a valid credit
card at time of reservation, the guest must be informed the room is not guaranteed beyond 1800 hours (use
1800 hold code in Epitome). There will be individual reservations where the duty guest (Priority 1) does
not have a valid credit card to provide at time of reservation and they are arriving after 1800. In this case,
the manager must approve to hold the reservation beyond 1800 (use Manager code in Epitome). Lodging
will inform guests of the cancellation/no-show policy when the reservation is made.

3.5. Space-Available Reservations. Lodging will accept and confirm reservations for Priority 2 (space
available) guests according to the guidelines outlined in Table 3.1. Priority 1 customers will not “bump”
Priority 2 customers with confirmed reservations, nor will they bump them once they are assigned quar-
ters for a specific period of time, except in times of contingency, emergency, or when the installation com-
mander determines higher priorities exist. Installation commanders may establish a policy limiting the
number of days space-available guests may stay in on-base lodging to no more than 30 days a year.

Table 3.1. Space-Available Reservation Guidelines
If Projected Occupancy is:          Space-Available Reservations may be accepted:
86% or greater                      Up to 3 days in advance
81 to 85%                           Up to 7 days in advance
66 to 80%                           Up to 14 days in advance
51% to 65%                          Up to 30 days in advance
50% or less                         Up to 120 days in advance

NOTE: Managers have the option to extend these windows if the opportunity exists based on seasonal
occupancy.
     3.5.1. Space-available guests requesting lodging should be assigned to uncommitted (not occupied or
     reserved) lodging rooms upon arrival. Number of nights assigned is left up to local management dis-
     cretion and should be based on forecasted occupancy or historical occupancy for the same time
     period. Space-available guests must not be placed on a waiting list. After 1800, lodging assigns all
     vacant rooms resulting from no-shows of personnel with non-guaranteed hold reservations to remain-
     ing Space-A guests on a first-come, first-served basis. Space-available guests that cannot be accom-
     modated on base should be offered assistance in locating off-base quarters.

3.6. Check-in and Checkout Process. The front desk staff has the opportunity to make a lasting, favor-
able impression on the guest. The front desk staff will be proactive, attentive, and professional, always
striving to anticipate guests’ needs and “make things right” for them.
   3.6.1. Front desk staff must acknowledge all guests (e.g., make eye contact, smile) and greet them in
   a professional, courteous manner.
       3.6.1.1. Front desk staff must adhere to payment procedures outlined in Chapter 4, paragraph
       4.7., asking the guest for a government identification card and a valid credit card (if applicable).
       3.6.1.2. Validation of a guest’s Priority 1 status will be at the general manager’s determination but
       should be limited to times of high occupancy or question of the guest abusing Priority 1 status. A
       copy of the guest’s government travel orders can be politely asked for as well as the government
       identification card and credit card review. After review, the orders will be given back to the guest
       that is paying for room charges and not centrally billed.
   3.6.2. Front desk staff must ensure that guests’ immediate needs (e.g., registration, information on
   Services activities/eateries, local points of interests, restaurants, etc.) are met in a friendly, efficient
   manner.
   3.6.3. Front desk staff will provide guests with professionally made, easy-to-use maps, directing them
   to their rooms upon check-in (if the guest room is in a different facility from the reception center/reg-
   istration desk).
   3.6.4. At least one front desk staff member must be in the immediate vicinity of the front desk at all
   times.
   3.6.5. The front desk must be staffed 24 hours a day. (HQ AFSVA/SVOHL has the authority to waive
   this requirement on a case-by-case basis, for up to 1 year, and will provide HQ AF/ A1SO and MAJ-
   COM/A1S an information copy of any such waivers).
   3.6.6. Check-in and checkout must be completed as promptly as possible. Guests checking in with a
   reservation should be checked in within 3 minutes. Guests arriving without a reservation should be
   checked in within 5 minutes. Do not let a guest stand in line without acknowledging their presence.
       3.6.6.1. Normal check-in time is 1400. However, guests may check-in at any time if rooms are
       available. Normal checkout time is 1100. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL may approve changes to these
       standard times due to local requirements on a case-by-case basis, and provide an information copy
       of the waiver to HQ AF/A1SO and MAJCOM/A1S. A late fee equal to the daily room rate may be
       assessed, at the general manager’s discretion, for late checkouts.
       3.6.6.2. At check-in, confirm the room type, rate, and departure date (mentioning checkout time).
       Do not charge guests a deposit for the room key or charge for lost keys.
       3.6.6.3. At checkout, ask the guest if their stay was satisfactory. Offer them a chance to complete
       a customer comment card (AF Form 3211). Thank departing guests and give an appropriate fare-
       well, such as, “Hope you enjoyed your stay.”
       3.6.6.4. Management must ensure the express checkout envelope and insert are available and vis-
       ible with the daily room rate for all transient aircrew and Distinguished Visitors (DVs) staying in
       on-base lodging. Where feasible, management should also provide express checkout envelopes in
       other quarters types.

3.7. Group Registration Process. The general manager must establish procedures to efficiently
pre-block and assign rooms and check-in guests who are part of a group. This registration may take place
at a location other than the primary lodging reception center front desk if the size of the group warrants it.

3.8. Check-in and Out Luggage Storage. Lodging will provide guests secure luggage storage service.
For those guests who arrive before the normal check-in time, and when no rooms are immediately avail-
able, offer to store their luggage in a secure luggage storage room located in, or immediately adjacent to,
the lobby. Also, ensure the guest is made aware a luggage storage room is available for use on the day of
checkout, if necessary. Verify guest identification is on each item stored. Provide the guest with a receipt
for each item stored. Provide luggage carts where feasible.

3.9. Endorsing Civilian TDY Orders at time of Check-in. The general manager, or designated repre-
sentative, will endorse, sign and date TDY orders of all civilian employees who occupy on-base govern-
ment lodging to entitle them to limited use of Exchange and Services facilities. This can be accomplished
with a rubber stamp containing the following statement: (“The individual’s name”) is assigned to on-base
government lodging at this installation for the period of TDY indicated on these orders, and is eligible to
use the base theater, Services activities, and exchange facilities, if otherwise authorized by the com-
mander, according to Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 34-210, Army and Air Force Exchange Service
(AAFES) Operating Policies, and AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility.

                                                Chapter 4

               LODGING FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT

4.1. Fund Sources. Lodging operations, to include visiting quarters and temporary lodging facilities, are
mission-sustaining functions, supported through a combination of appropriated funds (APF) and nonap-
propriated funds (NAF) as prescribed in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, and AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated
Funds (NAFs).

4.2. Resource Protection. The general manager must ensure adequate procedures are established and
followed in accordance with AFI 34-202 to protect all lodging assets against misappropriation, misuse,
damage, or loss. This includes cash control procedures, physical safeguards, key control, resale merchan-
dise, and property control. General Managers will consult their local security forces to determine the
requirement for intrusion detection systems, surveillance cameras, or duress alarms.

4.3. Base Lodging Fund (BLF). Each base establishes a base lodging nonappropriated fund instrumen-
tality (NAFI) in accordance with AFI 34-201. The base lodging general manager will manage the lodging
activity to meet financial standards established by HQ AF/A1S and HQ AFSVA/SVOHL. The base
Resource Management Flight Chief (RMFC) is the fund custodian.

4.4. Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF). The AFLF will fund the bases’ capital requirements projects
based on the standard replacement schedule, and will ensure their base lodging activities meet financial
standards. MAJCOM SVF offices will still be responsible for ensuring their base lodging activities meet
financial standards.

4.5. Transfer of NAF Property. The general manager, working with the Services logistics manager,
may transfer NAF-procured property to APF for maintenance when allowed by AFI 34-201 and AFI
65-106.
   4.5.1. Lodging NAF property may be transferred to other NAFIs on the same base or elsewhere as
   prescribed in AFI 34-201, paragraph 5.1.
   4.5.2. Recording the disposition of Lodging NAF property is in accordance with AFI 34-204, Ser-
   vices Property Management, AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and
   Accounting; and AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and
   Accounting.

4.6. Service Charge Rates. AFLF will recommend Air Force-wide service charge rates at the minimum
amount necessary to cover the cost of providing quality lodging facilities and service to authorized guests.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Cost and Economics, SAF/FMC, approves Air Force
lodging rates.
   4.6.1. Lodging will charge all occupants the same rate for similar accommodations, regardless of duty
   status or priority. The installation commander may waive the TLF room charge for additional units
   occupied by large families, but the TLF assessment must still be charged for each additional room
   used.
32                                                   AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


NOTE: The TLF waiver only applies to Priority 1 guests. Space-A guests will incur room charges for
additional rooms. The current TLF assessment charge must be paid in all cases.
     4.6.2. Lodging operations will be managed so lodging NAFI cost centers are self-sustaining. AFLF
     will manage funds for capital improvements.
     4.6.3. Lodging will not charge more than the single occupancy daily rate for visiting quarters accom-
     modating two or more family members. If rooms are configured for double occupancy, and both
     guests are on official orders, each will pay the full room rate. TDY guests on official orders sharing a
     TLF unit will split the room rate. Guests sharing quarters not normally configured for double/triple
     occupancy will also split the room rate.
     4.6.4. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL, in coordination with the HQ AFSVA/SVF, prepares lodging service
     charge rate determination packages biennially and submits them to HQ AF/A1S for review. Service
     charge rates will be sufficient to pay operating expenses, annual capital requirements, surcharge, and
     TLF user assessments.
NOTE: HQ AFRC/A1S will continue to work the AFRC Base lodging budgets for inclusion in the AF
Rate Determination process.
     4.6.5. At overseas operations experiencing financial difficulty due to foreign currency fluctuations,
     the installation commander can authorize service charge increases for up to 90 days.

4.7. Payment Procedures. All Air Force lodging guests must pay the established daily service charge for
the type of accommodation used. All lodging guests must provide a valid credit card and government
identification card for verification purposes at time of check-in; managers may opt to pre-authorize credit
cards to ensure “validity”. Guests who do not have a valid credit card must pay in advance at check-in
with cash or check. Guests paying with cash or check must provide their social security number or For-
eign Service number at time of check-in. Once entered into Epitome, only management can access the
SSN, foreign service number or credit card number to process payment for charges after guest departure
(i.e., left without paying, incidentals, damages, etc.). Those guests paying with a credit card can have their
credit card charged (sales function) at check-in or wait until checkout to have their lodging charges billed
to their credit card unless staying over 15 days in the TLF or VQ. See paragraph 4.7.2. for guidance.
NOTE: The exception to these procedures is unit paid bills for Reserve and Guard personnel and aircrew
under Air Mobility Command Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) at authorized locations
only. Reserve component units must pay using a GPC or central billed account within 20 days of the
actual stay (checkout day). AF Form 616 Fund Cite Authorization and DD Form 448 Military Interde-
partmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) may be accepted from Air Force and other DoD agencies on a
case-by-case basis with prior management approval. When possible, the preferred method of payment is
the GPC.
     4.7.1. All guests checking in will sign the guest registration form that advises them lodging is autho-
     rized to apply any unpaid charges to their credit card.
     4.7.2. All long-term lodging guests (staying over 15 days), whether paying by cash, check, or credit
     card, will return to the front desk at 15-day intervals to verify and pay their lodging bill or pay in
     advance for the next 15 days.
        4.7.2.1. Cash/check-paying guests must pay in advance for the next 15 days or remaining days of
        occupancy (if less than 15 days).
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                  33


       4.7.2.2. Credit card-paying guests will have their credit card processed for charges incurred over
       the previous 15 days.
       4.7.2.3. All space available guests , regardless of method of payment, will pay for their stay in
       advance at check-in. It is the general manager’s discretion when to require payment for an
       approved extension.

4.8. Financial Planning. The planning and budgeting process helps the general manager forecast reve-
nues, program expenses, and fund capital requirements. Managers should work with the unit APF
resource advisor to develop annual APF budgets. They should also work with the RMFC to develop NAF
income and expense operating budgets. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL will assist with the NAF requirement bud-
gets, which include capital fixed asset items and those meeting bulk purchase criteria. Rate packages pro-
vide good budget forecasts but must be reviewed at least annually to ensure business assumptions and
performance expectations are considered and properly reflected. (Refer to AFI 34-201, AFI 34-202, AFI
34-209, and AFMAN 34-212) Managers are not allowed to budget for the same expense from APFs and
NAFs. (Refer to AFI 65-106 for more detailed information on the appropriate fund source).
   4.8.1. Capital Requirements Planning Standards Guide. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL will develop a standard
   Capital Requirements Planning Standards Guide and distribute it to all bases with informative copy to
   MAJCOM Multi-functional. General Managers will develop and maintain a 5-year capital improve-
   ment plan approved by the HQ AFSVA/SVOHL. The capital improvement plan will be verified dur-
   ing the AF Standards Evaluation. General Managers will also participate in the installation Quarters
   Improvement Committee meetings and ensure lodging’s capital improvement requirements (facilities,
   furnishings, and equipment, both APF and NAF) are adequately addressed in the Installation Quarters
   Improvement Plan (see AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management) and made known to the
   Civil Engineer’s Furnishings Management Office (FMO) and base senior leadership. It is important to
   execute approved annual capital requirements in a timely manner to maintain quality lodging facili-
   ties, furnishings, and equipment. It is critical to ensure APF furnishings and appliance requirements
   are worked closely with the FMO to allow adequate lead-time for ordering, receiving, warehouse stor-
   age (if necessary), and delivering lodging items in time for beneficial occupancy dates of lodging
   facility renovations. Refer to AFI 32-6004, Furnishings Management, for more detailed guidance
   regarding facility and furnishings standards, individual responsibilities, budget requirements, ware-
   house management, furnishings accountability, and appliance management.

4.9. Operating Expenses. General Managers should consistently monitor and manage the operating cost
per occupied room (CPOR). Labor is the single largest and most controllable expense item impacting
CPOR. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL will determine personnel cost goals based on historical financial data.

4.10. Sundry Sales. Snack and beverage sales are required guest services.
   4.10.1. General managers will ensure every guest has a reasonable opportunity to obtain sundry items
   24 hours per day (readily available). In most operations, this can be accomplished using a combination
   of front desk sales and vending machines strategically located throughout the lodging facilities. In
   those rare instances where building layout precludes vending machines, room stocking may be used.
   The final determination will be based on providing quality customer service and not the convenience
   of the lodging staff. However, you must continue to provide sundry items in all business suites. Gen-
   eral Managers manage sales and structure pricing so the gross margin from sales is sufficient to cover
34                                                   AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


     the cost of goods and labor. The general manager will ensure sundries are inventoried and restocked
     daily (including weekends).
     4.10.2. Post charges to guest folios in a timely manner. To enhance internal controls in business
     suites, use the standard 3-part inventory form where one copy is left with the guest, another is sent to
     the front desk to update the folio, and the third is used to update the storeroom files.

4.11. Long Distance Telephone Calls. Charges for long distance telephone calls must be continuously
monitored; if the telephone system does not interface with the property management system and automat-
ically update folios, lodging personnel must manually post charges to the guest’s folio as calls are made.

4.12. Lodging Annual Occupancy Reporting. The general manager uses Epitome to prepare the JAS
105-occupancy report annually. Inclusive dates are 1 October to 30 September for the report. Each base
sends the report electronically to Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, Lodging Branch (HQ AFSVA/
SVOHL), 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 401, San Antonio TX 78216-4148, by 31 October. Format and
instructions are included on the Air Force Inns Webpage. This Lodging Annual Occupancy report is
assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) RCS: HAF-SV(A)0101 and is designated emergency status code
D. Immediately discontinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions. Discontinue
reporting during MINIMIZE. Lodging operations implemented with the Epitome web based application
are exempt from this requirement since HQ AFSVA/SVOHL centrally manages their occupancy data.

4.13. Lost and Found. The general manager must establish efficient procedures and operating instruc-
tions for the effective handling and return of lost and found items to their rightful owners. HQ AFSVA/
SVOHL has an Operating Instruction (OI) standardized template for Lost and Found, located on the Air
Force Inns webpage under the Standards section.
     4.13.1. Store all items in a secure area. Lodging employees must use the Lost and Found module in
     EPITOME to track lost and found property. Every attempt should be made to contact departed guests
     as soon as possible regarding their forgotten belongings. Guests are responsible for all postage charges
     incurred when items are returned. Lodging will contact guests to verify payment method and shipping
     instructions.

4.14. Automation. All Air Force lodging operations are fully automated. All reservation, registration,
accounting, and management functions must be utilized through the automated system. When situations
such as power outages, bad weather or maintenance problems arise, manual procedures must be used. All
manual forms must be accounted for and controlled. Samples of manual forms can be found on the Air
Force Services Agency website under the Operations link. Daily backups of the Epitome property data-
base are mandatory and must be performed by all lodging operations. Management must also ensure they
keep up with the latest Epitome update patches and releases. Lodging operations implemented with the
Epitome web based application are exempt from backup and update patch requirements since HQ
AFSVA/SVOHL centrally manages their database. For guidance on proper backups, verification and lat-
est updates and release information, reference the Air Force Services Agency website, under the Epitome
link.

4.15. Marketing. In conjunction with the marketing office, Air Force lodging operations will develop a
marketing plan and work with other Services activities (e.g., golf course, marina, outdoor recreation, ITT,
clubs, etc.) to promote all Services operations.
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                              35


  4.15.1. Lodging operations will use the Air Force Inns logo to help promote their establishment as a
  guest-oriented, professionally managed operation balancing AF Inns Branding, telling the Services
  Story, and keeping logos standardized and minimized. See the Agency webpage, AF Inns Section, and
  select Lodging Logo for specific guidance.

                                                Chapter 5

                            EMPLOYEE STANDARDS AND TRAINING

5.1. General Management Requirements and Responsibilities. The lodging general manager sets the
tone for the entire lodging operation and will ensure adherence to this Air Force Instruction in the lodging
operation for which he/she is responsible. The manager will ensure consistent, quality service to meet our
customers’ expectations every time they stay at an Air Force Inns establishment. To ensure customers
have the opportunity to comment on service, general managers will ensure the AF Form 3211, Customer
Comments, is visibly displayed in each guest room and guest service representatives will ask guests upon
checkout if they would like to provide comments about their stay. Responses will be reviewed, tracked
and responded to verbally, via letter or electronic mail as appropriate. General Managers will conduct
semi-annual self-assessments of their operations using the AF Lodging Standards Checklist posted in the
Golden Eagle Standards section.

5.2. Lodging Staffing. Refer to the Golden Eagle Standards section of the Air Force Inns webpage
located on the Air Force Services Agency website for personnel matrices and staffing guides.

5.3. Dress and Appearance. All lodging employees, to include management, will wear one of the Air
Force Lodging Standardized uniforms. Each employee should be issued an adequate number of uniforms
to perform their duties and uniforms should fit appropriately to provide a professional appearance. Man-
agement should have an OI detailing required personal hygiene standards. Nametags will display either
the USAF Services logo or the local Services logo (depending on local logo policy). Those items allowed
embroidery will be the Air Force Inns logo and will not be customized. Refer to the Golden Eagle Stan-
dards section of the Air Force Inns webpage located on the Air Force Services Agency website for guid-
ance on required items, logo location and specific Air Force Inns uniform standards. Military personnel
assigned to lodging will wear the appropriate military uniform and Services organizational badge.

5.4. Employee Recognition Program. All bases are required to have an active employee recognition
program to include having a written OI. The program can be monthly or quarterly, but can not just be an
annual event. This can be a lead into but not just the squadron quarterly awards. Lodging should ensure
internal awards focus on all functional areas. The lodging award program may submit to the squadron
quarterly awards program but the squadron’s program will not substitute for lodging’s award program.

5.5. Training Standards. All employees will receive recurring training particular to their jobs (task
training), as well as customer service techniques to guarantee consistent, courteous, and professional ser-
vice to all guests. Managers must use the HQ AFSVA/SVOHL approved web-based training program for
use in Air Force lodging. General Managers may receive assistance in obtaining training materials from
HQ AFSVA/SVOHL. All lodging employee training will be documented using the appropriate forms. In
addition, training for military personnel (E-1 through E-6) will be documented using the Career Field
Education Training Plan (CFETP). Completed training forms will be maintained in each civilian
employee’s personnel record.
     5.5.1. Specific training standards are found on the Education and Training webpage of the Air Force
     Services Agency website. Operational Instruction (OI) standardized templates can be found on the Air
     Force Inns webpage under the Standards section. These OIs provide the basic operating information
     required and can be modified for your particular lodging operation as needed.
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                   37


   5.5.2. Initial Training. Newly hired employees must receive the following aspects of training within
   the timeframe annotated in parentheses at the end of the tasking.
       5.5.2.1. General Training: Safety, security, and emergency procedures. Dram Shop training
       requirements as prescribed in AFI 34-219 Alcoholic Beverage Program. (1 day) This training may
       be accomplished by the Services training section.
       5.5.2.2. Lodging Specific Training: This training is intended to focus on the professional hospital-
       ity and lodging progression and will be accomplished by Lodging staff.
           5.5.2.2.1. Initial training on blood borne pathogens (BBP) exposure control (to include poli-
           cies, procedures, and equipment) for all employees whose normal duties include the possibility
           of occupational exposure to blood and other bodily fluids (Occupational Safety and Health
           Administration annual training requirement). (3 days)
           5.5.2.2.2. An entire lodging operation overview, to include reservations, front desk opera-
           tions, housekeeping and maintenance. An EPITOME training database must be established for
           new desk clerk training. (2 weeks)
           5.5.2.2.3. A lodging operations tour, to include all types of guest rooms. Front desk/reserva-
           tions staff members should also tour commercial lodging establishments and be familiar with
           eating establishments within the immediate vicinity. (2 weeks)
           5.5.2.2.4. Customer service technique instructions (e.g., greeting customers, making eye con-
           tact, answering the phone). (2 weeks)
           5.5.2.2.5. Instruction on the impact of “first impressions” to include the importance of
           employee appearance, dress, and demeanor to lodging operation success. (2 weeks)

5.6. Professional Certification. The Air Force recognizes the importance of life-long learning and con-
tinuing professional development. The general manager is encouraged to have (or be working toward)
professional certification, such as the Certified Hotel Administrator (CHA) designation, and accomplish
the necessary actions to keep the designation current. Other staff members are also encouraged to pursue
certification in their specialty.

5.7. Training Workshop. Lodging managers and assistant managers must attend the Lodging Managers
Course at HQ AFSVA within 12 to 15 months of initial assignment and are encouraged to attend refresher
training every 5-8 years. Lodging Managers should maximize use of the HQ AFSVA courses such as the
Lodging Operations courses, and any specialty training like Certified Hospitality Trainer and Certified
Hospitality Supervisor for subordinate staff.

5.8. Community Relations. The general manager will establish a professional relationship with local
hotel/motel and tourism organizations, chambers of commerce, etc., in order to improve customer service
by sharing experiences, professional knowledge, and hospitality education opportunities.

                                                Chapter 6

                                         LINEN EXCHANGE

6.1. Operation. Military. manpower positions to operate a centralized linen exchange point are no
longer authorized. Bases have four options to support the base linen exchange requirements. Option one:
Establish a contractor operated centralized linen exchange point, normally using the same contractor that
is awarded the base linen/laundry contract. Option two: Establish a nonappropriated funded (NAF) oper-
ated centralized linen exchange point with an established Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to provide
APFs to reimburse the NAF expense. NAF personnel would normally be assigned under the base Lodging
operation. Option three: Eliminate the central linen exchange point and establish decentralized pick up
and delivery points, normally at each organization requiring linen exchange. Option four: In house NAF
operated with APF reimbursement using a MOA. Under Option three, since there is no manned central
exchange point, each organization would be required to be trained as quality assurance evaluators (QAE)
to monitor their part of the commercial linen contract. A standard Performance Work Statement (PWS) to
establish Option one and three and an MOA sample for Option two can be downloaded from the Air Force
Services Agency website under Lodging.
6.2. Authorized Items.. The following items are authorized to be washed or dry cleaned at the expense
of Air Force appropriated funds:
    6.2.1. Government-property linens and items, such as sheets, pillow cases, blankets, towels, mattress
    covers, and others, bought with appropriated funds and issued to or used by organizations, activities,
    and individuals
    6.2.2. Government rugs, upholstery, and drapes
    6.2.3. Organizational items and special or distinctive clothing or equipment issued to military or DoD
    civilian personnel
    6.2.4. Linens purchased with appropriated funds (linens on nonappropriated fund accounts must be
    cleaned using nonappropriated funds)
    6.2.5. Shop wiping towels, cloths, and rags (cost analysis should be made first to decide which is less
    expensive, cleaning or buying new shop wiping towels, cloths, and rags)
    6.2.6. Authorized uniform items that need water-repellent treatment
    6.2.7. Clothing of prisoners kept at a base in a non-pay status
    6.2.8. Clothing required for burial of deceased active duty personnel
    6.2.9. All soiled personal clothing items (serviceable items only) of deceased active duty personnel or
    personnel declared missing must be washed or dry cleaned, as needed, before they are sent to the next
    of kin. The commander (or the summary court officer) of the deceased or missing person must sign a
    certificate for payment from local O&M appropriations stating the following:
    I certify that the items listed are the personal items of (name, grade, and social security number),
    who are deceased (or missing), and that the cleaning costs should be paid from appropriated funds.
    6.2.10. Uniforms soiled as a result of honor guard duty. A letter authorizing cleaning, signed by the
    honor guard commander, must be kept on file in linen exchange for all honor guard members desiring
    this service
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                   39


6.3. Centralized Linen Exchange Point.. If a base maintains a central pickup location using Option one
or two above, then base linen exchange provides the Base Exchange point for all items authorized in para-
graph 2. At bases with an Air Force laundry and dry cleaning plant, the plant should serve as the linen
exchange function point.
    6.3.1. Contingency/Wartime Operations. In the event of an emergency situation, natural disaster or
    wartime situation, the Services commander/director through the installation commander, can expand
    the authorized customers or items the central linen exchange can process.
    6.3.2. Managing Linen Inventory. Maintain only enough items to meet scheduled exchanges, replen-
    ishment of worn out and damaged items, and a justifiable reserve for emergencies. Your emergency
    requirements will be determined by referring to your base Operating Plans (OPlans) as referenced in

    Keep records of items released and returned using AF Form 904, Daily Linen Exchange Transac-
    tions. Instructions for completing the form are at Attachment 6. Due to the size of the AF Form 904,
    this form cannot be downloaded from the Air Force publication forms website, but can be ordered
    online. Linen operations can also use other electronic means in place of the AF Form 904. A
    Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in the same format as the AF Form 904 can be downloaded from the Air
    Force Services Agency website under Lodging.
        6.3.2.1. Inventory Procedures. Perform a complete inventory semiannually, on the last workday
        of March and September. Prepare two copies of AF Form 905, Linen Exchange Inventory
        Report. Instructions for completing the form are at Attachment 7. This report is maintained

            posting to AF Form 2009-1. Keep supporting documents with the control register. On 1 Octo-
            ber each year, voucher numbers in numerical sequence are assigned to all documents affecting
            linen exchange accountability.
            6.3.2.1.2. AF Form 85a, Inventory Count Card, is certified by the linen exchange manager
            and approved by the Services squadron commander or director.

            form to document quantities on hand, on order, received, issued, inventoried, and adjusted.
            6.3.2.1.4. Where administrative errors caused overages or shortages, use and attach AF IMT
            85a, Inventory Count Card, to correct records. This form will be certified by the linen
            exchange manager and approved by the Services commander or director.
    6.3.3. Salvage of Linen Items. Sprinkle uneconomical repairable linens with a distinctive dye. Dyed
    linens are issued to organizations (transportation, field maintenance, etc.) that normally use wiping
    and cleaning rags. Unserviceable linen is accounted for and issued intact (not torn into rags). Tearing
    items into rags is the responsibility of receiving organizations. Linen will be entered on the AF Form
    2009-1, Manual Supply Accounting Record, in the unserviceable column, until dyed and issued to
    an organization.
        6.3.3.1. When issuing rags to organizations, fill out a DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt

when government housing is not provided.
Bednight—Each time a bedspace or lodging room/unit is sold within a 24-hour period.
Civilian Employees—US civilian federal employees paid from DoD APFs or NAFs.
Commercial Lodging (CL)—Commercial accommodations under lease, contract, or memorandum of

Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters,
located within North America between Canada and Mexico.
Corporate Lodging—Lodging obtained in the private sector at a rate lower than the normal commercial
lodging rate charged to short-duration TDY travelers (includes apartments). The cost for this type of
lodging will result in monetary savings to the Air Force compared to the rates agreed to in MOUs, etc.,
already in effect.
Diversion—Temporary use of government facilities for other than designated use or rooms blocked for
maintenance. Does not change category code on real property inventory.
Essential Products Program (EPP)—The EPP is designed to maximize Air Force leverage in the
marketplace on products essential to nonappropriated fund operations. Through a competitive process, the
contractor awarded these individual programs will be the sole provider of a specified product to the Air
Force Services community for the negotiated period of time.
Family Member—The sponsor’s (a) spouse; (b) unmarried child who is the sponsor’s by birth, legal
adoption, or marriage (e.g., stepchild) who is under 21 years of age and is dependent on the sponsor,

extraordinary burden on a member not normally encountered by other members of similar grade at that
installation.
Lodging Fund—Nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) established to account for all NAF funds,
assets, liabilities, personnel and other costs associated with a lodging activity (or activities, in the case of
a CLF).

similar circumstances.

Nonappropriated Funds (NAF)—Funds generated by DoD military and civilian personnel and their
dependents and used to augment funds appropriated by Congress to provide a comprehensive,
morale-building welfare, religious, educational, and recreational program, designed to improve the
well-being of military and civilian personnel and their dependents.
NAF Purchasing Agreement (NPA)—NPAs are limited primarily to prime sources exercising full
control over the product and its distribution. In addition, prices offered for the product do not exceed the
prices offered by the firm’s most favored customer for the same items under comparable conditions.
Representation is usually limited to three to four contractors per major product category under our NPA
program.
Nonavailability Numbers—Refers to nonavailability of government quarters or meals. Lodging issues
the TDY member a nonavailability number when government lodging is not available. (Nonavailability
numbers are not issued when AFMAN 34-255, Directory of Government Quarters and Dining Facilities,
reflects that the installation does not have lodging available.) The authorizing official determines if the
TDY member may eat meals in the government facility. The commercial travel office uses AFMAN
34-255, Directory of Government Quarters & Dining Facilities, to determine the availability of
government meals at the TDY location; no written nonavailability of meals certification is required, and
the full per diem rate for meals and incidental expenses is authorized (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 9,
Chapter 5).
Optimum Utilization—Determining the proper mix of transient and permanent party quarters, as well as
maintaining an average annual occupancy rate of at least 75 percent for VQ and TLF (with at least 50%
official duty travelers).

the continental United States.
Permanent Party Personnel—Personnel assigned or attached to an installation in a PCS status.
Prime Knight Program—Provides transient aircrew members ready access to base transportation, food
service, and lodging after arriving at an Air Force base.
Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA)—An amount of money authorized to partially reimburse a
member for the added living expense incurred when it is necessary to occupy temporary lodging outside
the CONUS incident to PCS under certain prescribed conditions.
Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) Allowance—An amount of money authorized to partially offset
the added living expenses incurred within CONUS by members and their dependents when it is necessary
for the member and/or dependents to occupy temporary lodgings incident to PCS under certain prescribed
conditions.
Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF)—Lodging used primarily to house members and their dependents
(incident to PCS) and friends and relatives of patients in Air Force hospitals.
TDY Travelers—Military personnel and DoD civilian employees temporarily assigned at an installation
other than the one to which they are permanently assigned or employed.

ARC members residing outside the designated lodging commuting distance of the installation (ANG – the
installation commander’s designated commuting distance; AFRC – 50 mile radius, or 1 hour driving
time).

A3.2. Multiple Duty Tours. Lodging reservations for multiple tours (back-to-back), regardless of the
type of duty performed, are considered one requirement. Do not move personnel from one room to
another when duty status changes.

A3.3. Lodging Reservations.
   A3.3.1. Lodging management makes lodging reservations for ARC personnel for on-base and with
   contract commercial lodging establishments in accordance with established procedures.
   A3.3.2. Non-availability numbers will not be issued to unit-assigned ARC members in an inactive
   duty status.
   A3.3.3. Each ARC wing will appoint the Services ART as the wing lodging point of contact (POC).
   At ARC locations without a Services ART the ARC installation commander will appoint a lodging
   POC from existing resources. Each unit/flight will appoint a unit lodging POC to work with the wing
   lodging POC. The wing lodging POC is responsible for working all wing/unit lodging requirements
   with the host base lodging management for on-base and contract CL when used. The ARC lodging
   POC at each installation will provide lodging a copy of the non-commute alpha roster, extracted from
   the Personnel Data System (PDS), which identifies members, authorized lodging at unit expense dur-
   ing IDT periods. Inactive duty for training periods include Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs),
   rescheduled UTAs (RUTAs), additional flying training periods (AFTPs), and for annual tour (if appli-
   cable), etc. Lodging should load the non-commute listing in their lodging automated management sys-
   tem (History File) to expedite the room assignment process.
   A3.3.4. The ARC wing/unit lodging POC at each installation will also provide lodging a copy of the
   wing’s annual UTA schedule as soon as it is finalized and approved (Jul-Sep time frame). Lodging
   will match the UTA schedule to create a group reservation for scheduled UTAs. Lodging Managers
   who have other groups requesting reservations more than 60 days out will work with ARC wing/unit
   lodging POC to maximize occupancy in Lodging Facilities. Lodging will notify the ARC lodging
   POC of any problems in obtaining the required number of rooms/bedspaces. This allows the ARC
   commanders to reschedule UTAs or, if necessary, lodging to establish requirements-type contracts for
   specific time periods. Installation Commander may waive on a case by case basis.
   A3.3.5. Within 5 working days after the UTA, the ARC wing/units will provide lodging a list identi-
   fying Reserve or Guard members who will require lodging for the next UTA. Lodging will input
   names and obtain contract CL, when needed within 5 working days from receipt of the UTA lodging

     list. (Exception: Reserve wings/units using the Automated Lodging Reservations System (ALRS).)
     Three days prior to the scheduled UTA, the wing/unit POC will update the list (revalidate), in writing,
     with any changes that may have occurred. Changes that occur after this notification (Wednesday, prior
     to UTA) will be worked on a case-by-case basis with the host lodging activity.
        A3.3.5.1. Per paragraph 1.6. of this AFI, ARC members are required to make advanced lodging
        reservations. Members who walk-in without making reservations may still utilize government
        quarters, however, the wing/unit of assignment will not pay for lodging of members who fail to
        comply with this directive. (EXCEPTIONS: New recruits, members returning from long deploy-
        ments, etc.) It is the wing lodging POC’s responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of
        and in compliance with this policy.
        A3.3.5.2. The ARC wing/unit guarantees payment for on-base and contract CL reserved for their
        members. Therefore, the wing/unit will be responsible for payment of quarters reserved and not
        used. Lodging will check in all unit no-shows before the Friday night audit and provide a list of
        no-shows to the wing/unit lodging POC by 0800 on Saturday of the UTA. The wing/unit will
        notify lodging by check-out time on Saturday if the member will occupy quarters on Saturday
        night. The wing/unit will pay for no-shows at commercial quarters also.
        A3.3.5.3. Each ARC wing must establish a wing lodging policy to include procedures identified
        in this attachment. It is essential to enforce a walk-in and no-show guidelines to ensure an accurate
        number of rooms are reserved for members performing their UTAs and to eliminate the expendi-
        ture of funds for unused rooms and to maintain maximum utilization of on-base quarters.
     A3.3.6. Individual Mobilization Augmentee/Individual Ready Reserve (IMA/IRR) AFRC) person-
     nel. Lodging is authorized for individual members who reside outside the designated lodging com-
     muting distance (50 miles, or 1-hour driving time).
     A3.3.7. IMA/IRR members may be given a non-availability number if on-base or contract commer-
     cial lodging is not available. However, reserve members must use government quarters for IDT lodg-
     ing reimbursement. Members should use www.gsa.gov/lodging for finding government lodging, or
     utilize HQ AFRC/A1SP corporate lodging contracts.

A3.4. Payment Responsibilities.
     A3.4.1. Procedures outlined herein apply to all Services unless otherwise noted.
     A3.4.2. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
        A3.4.2.1. IMA/IRR Lodging Payment. Individual (IMA/IRR) members will pay all lodging
        charges regardless of the type of duty status (active duty or inactive duty for training), location
        where the duty is performed, or per diem status, and file for reimbursement. (IMAT-OL/FMFPT,

        cial 478-327-0625)
        A3.4.2.2. Unit-assigned members performing active duty tours (AF Form 938, Request and
        authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour), regardless of per diem status, are
        individually responsible for their lodging charges. Individuals will file for reimbursement (normal
        procedures apply).
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                   55


       A3.4.2.3. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs away from home station (AF Form 40A,
       Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training) are responsible for payment of their lodging
       charges and will file for reimbursement.
       A3.4.2.4. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs at home station will not pay lodging room
       charges. Lodging room costs (on-base and contract) for unit-assigned members performing IDTs
       at home station will be paid by the wing/unit of assignment via a government purchase account
       (GPC). Payment for personal charges, i.e., telephone, in-room resale items, late check out fees,
       etc., are the responsibility of the member, and must be paid prior to being assigned lodging for the
       following month’s UTA. Individuals may not file for reimbursement for these charges.
   A3.4.3. Air National Guard (ANG).
       A3.4.3.1. Unit-assigned ANG members performing active duty tours, regardless of per diem sta-
       tus, are individually responsible for their lodging charges.
       A3.4.3.2. ANG members performing IDTs, regardless of location, will not pay for their lodging
       room costs. The unit of assignment will pay for on-base and commercial quarters via a GPC. Pay-
       ment for personal charges, i.e., telephone, in-room resale items, late checkout fees, etc., is the
       responsibility of the member.
NOTE: For unit-assigned members, the ARC wing/unit provides lodging and/or CL managers with an
ARC lodging monitor (wing/unit lodging POC or designated representative), if requested. This individual
will be available in the reception areas(s) on training weekends to assist with peak check-in (and
check-out) periods for unit-assigned members, and to facilitate resolution of UTA lodging issues.

A3.5. Billing Procedures.
   A3.5.1. For overseas deployments, the unit of assignment’s FM function may provide an AF Form
   616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA), or other fund source document, to confirm that sufficient
   funds are available to cover the cost of on-base and/or commercial quarters for unit-assigned person-
   nel, if requested by the overseas lodging general manager. The billing and payment process will be
   accomplished within 20 working days following the deployment.
   A3.5.2. For on-base lodging bills, the base lodging accounting technician will ensure that all back-up
   documentation (AF Form 938, AF Form 40A, or unit lodging reservation/revalidation listing, plus all
   folios) to substantiate the charges are provided with each bill. For easier validation bills may be bro-
   ken out by unit of assignment. This portion of the process will be accomplished within 5 working days
   of the UTA. The ARC wing/unit lodging POC, together with the lodging accounting technician, will
   review the bills and ensure they are correct. Upon validation, the GPC or centrally billed account is
   used to make payment. If discrepancies occur, lodging and the ARC lodging POC will work together
   to resolve the issue. This entire process will be accomplished within 20 working days from the UTA.
NOTE: At least twice monthly, lodging prepares bills for other IDT lodging requirements, i.e., RUTAs,
AFTPs, etc. These bills may be provided at the same time as the UTA bill, but must be documented sepa-
rately. Payment is made via the GPC or a centrally billed account. An ARC member performing IDTs
(other than regular UTAs) must provide a completed AF Form 40A or locally developed Reserve (ALRS)
lodging form.

     A3.5.3. Contract commercial lodging bills may be processed through the installation lodging general
     manager, or sent directly to the wing lodging POC. Within 20 days of receipt, the ARC wing lodging
     POC ensures that payment is made.
     A3.5.4. When a unit-assigned Reserve member performs an IDT at home station in conjunction with
     an active duty tour, to include annual tour in a non per diem status, only the IDT portion is authorized
     for payment by the wing/unit of assignment. The member is responsible for payment of their lodging
     charges for all active duty tours regardless of per diem status.
     A3.5.5. When a unit-assigned ANG member pulls an IDT in conjunction with a per diem status tour,
     only the IDT portion is authorized payment by the unit of assignment. It is the responsibility of the
     member to present the paperwork for the IDT portion of the stay at check-in. The ANG member is
     responsible for payment of their lodging charges when in a per diem status.

                             AIRCREW SUPPORT (PRIME KNIGHT)

A4.1. Aircrew Support Programs.
   A4.1.1. Special aircrew handling programs, such as Prime Knight, ensure high-quality and consistent
   lodging, transportation, and food service support to transient aircrews. The quality of service depends
   upon timely notification to the host program manager of aircrew requirements. The program is man-
   datory for all transient aircrews.
   A4.1.2. The elements of success for aircrew handling programs include commander interest and
   involvement, aircrew awareness, HQ AFSVA/SVOHL procedures to facilitate timely requests for ser-
   vice, and customer-oriented, base-level agencies.
   A4.1.3. The installation commander appoints a program manager empowered with the authority to
   ensure transient aircrews receive transportation, lodging, and food service support. If a base has no
   Prime Knight program then HQ AFSVA/SVOHL needs a letter from the Services Commander/Direc-
   tor authorizing no program.
NOTE: These programs do not apply to bases that do not support flight operations.
   A4.1.4. (Added-ANDREWS) Command Post (CP), Services Division and Logistics Readiness
   Squadron (LRS) are responsible for Andrews AFB Transient Aircrew Support Program execution.

A4.2. Functional Responsibilities.
   A4.2.1. HQ AF/A1S. Serves as the Air Staff office of primary responsibility (OPR), reviews program
   assessments and MAJCOM reports (upon request), and in coordination with other Air Staff agencies
   such as Operations (A3O) and Transportation (A4TT) provides recommendations to the Air Force
   Chief of Staff.
   A4.2.2. MAJCOM/A1Ss will:
       A4.2.2.1. Coordinate MAJCOM staff guidance with other agencies (XO, LGT, etc.)
       A4.2.2.2. Implement the program command wide.
       A4.2.2.3. Conduct periodic assessments of the program.
   A4.2.3. Host installation commanders will:
       A4.2.3.1. Implement this instruction and approve local support plans and procedures.
       A4.2.3.2. Appoint a base program manager.
NOTE: This program impacts several disciplines (e.g., Services, Transportation.) No single, functional
entity is responsible for providing all the required services under this program. Therefore, the vehicle
operations chief, lodging general manager, or food service officer will not be appointed as the Prime
Knight manager. Select this individual from an operations unit such as operations support, Air Mobility
support, or command post.
       A4.2.3.3. Provide the resources required for a viable Prime Knight program.
58                                                  AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


     A4.2.4. Aircraft commanders/command and control agencies (or other MAJCOM designated agen-
     cies) will:
        A4.2.4.1. At the earliest opportunity, provide destination program managers with information
        required as indicated below:
           A4.2.4.1.1. Using a fax, telephone, message, or radio (HF), provide number of crew members
           by rank (e.g., 5 officers, 3 enlisted, estimated time of arrival (ETA), gender of crew by excep-
           tion, and call sign/tail number if available). Upon arrival at the TDY location, the aircraft com-
           mander provides a copy of the aircrew orders listing each member’s SSAN to the program
           representative.
           A4.2.4.1.2. Cancel reservations to preclude “no shows” and guaranteed hold charges being
           assessed due to mission changes, weather diversions, etc.
     A4.2.5. Base Program Manager will:
        A4.2.5.1. Develop base aircrew handling program support plans and policies to provide transient
        aircrew with transportation, lodging, and access to meals.
        A4.2.5.2. Ensure a responsible individual meets each transient aircraft requesting Prime Knight
        service and provides appropriate transportation, keys, (or documentation) for lodging/rooms, and
        an information packet to the aircraft commander. NOTE: (The vehicle operator may be used for
        this task. Installations may set policy allowing the crews to pick up the information packet and
        keys at the command post or base operations if crews normally stop at these locations prior to
        going into crew rest. Under no circumstances will aircrews be required to pick up keys or other
        items from locations they would not normally transit (not applicable during contingency aircraft
        operations).
        A4.2.5.3. Ensure the welcome packet contains the following as a minimum:
           A4.2.5.3.1. Base information on meals, lodging, and transportation, lodging registration
           forms, or off-base lodging authorizations.
           A4.2.5.3.2. Program critique form.
     A4.2.6. Lodging General Manager will:
        A4.2.6.1. Support the installation Prime Knight manager by providing adequate rooms and effi-
        cient lodging guest service to transient aircrews when rooms are available.
        A4.2.6.2. Establish designated aircrew visiting quarters when the volume of transient aircrews
        warrants.
        A4.2.6.3. Provide reservation capability during all normal operating hours (e.g., at 24-hour lodg-
        ing operations, aircrews should be able to make reservations at any time during that period).
        A4.2.6.3. (ANDREWS) Command Post or crews contact lodging to make lodging requests and
        provide arrival information and orders if available.
        A4.2.6.4. Pre-register the aircrew if assigned to on-base lodging. In addition, the general manager
        will block or assign rooms and assemble keys or put them in the information packet prior to the
        aircrew’s arrival. (On-base lodging will be used to the maximum extent possible to maximize mis-
        sion execution and limit demand on support activities.)
AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008                                                                  59


     A4.2.6.5. Information packets will contain base information on meals, lodging, and transporta-
     tion; lodging registration forms or off-base (commercial lodging) authorizations if necessary; area
     maps; and customer comment cards.
     A4.2.6.5. (ANDREWS) Prior to arrival, an aircrew support package is prepared that contains
     Lodging registration form, room assignments/keys, express checkout instructions and forms, base
     and local maps, AF Inns customer comment cards, base phone numbers hrs of operation and con-
     tract authorization sheets for crews being lodged off base. Lodging desk clerk calls command post
     for update on arrival.
     A4.2.6.6. Assemble the necessary documents if the aircrew is staying off base (CL authorizations,
     directions to CL, etc.)
     A4.2.6.7. Establish an express checkout system for aircrews staying in government quarters.
     A4.2.6.8. Assign each crewmember to a single room (exceptions may be made during contingen-
     cies and alert operations). Aircrew members are defined as anyone on the flight crew order. Ensure
     gender is considered when assigning lodging to aircrews. Crew integrity will be maintained--all
     members of the same crew will be housed together, either all on base or all off base. If a crew is
     divided into multiple buildings on base, no more than two stops will be required to pick up all
     crewmembers.
     A4.2.6.8. (ANDREWS) Lodging will maintain aircrew integrity by housing the entire aircrew
     either on base or off base. If housed on base, lodging will house them as close together as possible,
     with no more than two stops to pick up all crew members. If lodged off base, lodging will house
     the aircrew in one commercial establishment.
         A4.2.6.8.1. (Added-ANDREWS) The installation commander or the aircraft commander
         may waive aircrew lodging requirements on a temporary basis for reasons of military neces-
         sity.
     4.2.6.9. (Added-ANDREWS) Accommodations are made according to availability of on-base,
     commercial lodging (CL), and Non-Availability (Non-A) of government quarters. On-base quar-
     ters must be considered first and are mandatory if space is available.
     A4.2.6.10. (Added-ANDREWS) Commercial Lodging (CL): Non-Availability is only issued
     when government contracted quarters are not available. Lodging clerk must make CL arrange-
     ments and should help with Non-A reservations if requested. If CL is unavailable, the guest is
     responsible and authorized to find and stay at any hotel priced within the authorized local per diem
     rate. Ultimately, the aircrew commander will decide where the crew will stay. Lodging, as a ser-
     vice, will provide a list of local hotels and assist with calls if other guests are not waiting.
  A4.2.7. Food Service will:
     A4.2.7.1. Provide the program manager with menus and operating hours of the flight kitchen and
     base appropriated fund dining facilities for inclusion in the aircrew information package.
     A4.2.7.2. Respond to aircrew requests for meals. (Use of the in-flight kitchen is sufficient to meet
     this requirement.)
  A4.2.8. Transportation will:
60                                                    AFI34-246_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 31 MAY 2008


        A4.2.8.1. Meet the aircraft within 10 minutes of the time requested by the aircrew or applicable
        command and control system.
        A4.2.8.2. Provide authorized transportation to aircrew members during their stay.
NOTE: Base shuttle or taxi services are considered adequate and may be used for this purpose but will
not be used for initial pickups or departures.
        A4.2.8.3. Respond to the aircrew’s request for departure pickup at the established pickup time.
     A4.2.9. Base operations (or command post) will:
        A4.2.9.1. Track all inbound aircraft in the normal course of duties that might generate program
        requirements. If there is a change to either arrival time or number of crew members expected, base
        operations or command post personnel will notify the responsible agency/agencies as indicated in
        the installation program support plan. Base operations will provide these updates as soon as possi-
        ble but not later than one hour, if possible, prior to scheduled arrival times.
        A4.2.9.2. (Added-ANDREWS) CP will request aircrew orders from the previous RON (Remain-
        ing Over Night) duty six hours prior to the RON aircraft arrival. If none available, CP will call the
        RON aircrew’s home station command post to obtain orders. CP will fax a copy of the orders to
        Lodging/Billeting with the number of crewmembers and amount of days requested.
        A4.2.9.3. (Added-ANDREWS) CP will confirm lodging reservations, whether on-base or
        off-base, four hours prior to aircraft arrival. If off-base, CP ensures non-availability slips are faxed
        to the hotel and will build a transient aircrew package with the lodging information provided.
        A4.2.9.4. (Added-ANDREWS) CP will receive a UHF radio call from the inbound aircraft with
        RON information to include other aircraft requirements (fuel, passengers, up-load information, to
        include crew transportation request for the inbound aircraft) thirty minutes prior to aircraft arrival.
        CP will notify Vehicle Operations Dispatch of request for transportation. CP provides type air-
        craft, tail number, estimate time of arrival (ETA), parking location, how many crew members, and
        their destination. Vehicle Operations will take aircrew to the CP to pick-up “Air Crew Support
        Package” and afterwards to their lodging location).
        A4.2.9.5. (Added-ANDREWS) CP controller will: greet the aircrew at the CP building; brief the
        crew of their lodging; store their classified package (if applicable); provide the Legal for Alert
        (LFA) time; aircraft up-load time (if applicable); request outbound seats (if applicable); request
        crew pick-up time at lodging (depending upon whether they've obtained U-Drives from Vehicle
        Operations); brief the in-flight meal request process; and request a good contact number (cell
        phone) for the aircraft commander for their LFA call. The aircrew departs the CP with their Air-
        crew Support Package in provided transportation to lodging. Note: If crew arranges for their own
        lodging (by choice) and does not stop at the Andrews CP for appropriate “Prime Knight” brief, it
        is determined that the crew has opted for “self-alert.”
     A4.2.10. (Added-ANDREWS) 316th Logistics Readiness Squadron responsibility.
        A4.2.10.1. (Added-ANDREWS) U-Drive-It available: Vehicle Operations will transport crew to
        vehicle dispatch to pick up U-drive after departing the CP.
        A4.2.10.2. (Added-ANDREWS) U-Drive-It unavailable: Vehicle Operations will transport air-
        crews to local hotels within a 10-mile radius of Andrews AFB or arrange for taxi service to com-
        mercial lodging outside the 10-mile radius.

                                     CONTINGENCY LODGING

A5.1. Lodging Procedures During Emergency/Wartime Conditions. During emergency or wartime
conditions, the lodging function may be required to surge to meet contingency requirements. Contingency
lodging may be temporarily opened to accommodate large influxes of enroute TDY personnel who cannot
be housed in regular base lodging accommodations. General Managers should plan for 50 square feet per
person, but may lodge personnel in less square footage due to military necessity.
NOTE: When lodging operations are converted in direct support of contingency or wartime operations,
Space-A lodging is not authorized. The lodging staff sets up and provides 24-hour locator service for per-
sonnel in contingency lodging operations.
   A5.1.1. Field or tent city-type arrangements: The capability to beddown augmentation/ contingency
   forces will be identified using existing facilities and equipment (dormitories, family housing, etc.), or
   commercial quarters. When necessary, Services identifies furnishings requirements to the base civil
   engineer (CE). CE will provide minimal furnishings to meet contingency requirements, such as excess
   FMO furniture from either the support base or within the region. If surplus stocks are not available,
   FMO will purchase required furnishings from appropriated funds as necessary, using funds earmarked
   for specific contingency lodging operations when appropriate. Services provides accountability for
   furnishings assets while they are in use in contingency lodging operations. When fixed assets are
   insufficient or not available, War Reserve Material (WRM) assets will be used for planning surge
   capability for a main operating base (MOB), collocated operating base (COB), forward operating base
   (FOB), or bare base (BB). In such cases, primary bedding is sleeping bags that are clean, sanitized,
   and in good repair. All bases must maintain separation between contingency lodging operations and
   lodging desk operations. All bedspace assignments and terminations will be controlled separately
   between lodging and contingency lodging operations. The lodging desk will operate in coordination
   with Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) to ensure accountability of deployed
   personnel. For further guidance on planning factors, refer to the War Mobilization Plan (WMP1) Ser-
   vices Supplement Aug 2006.
   A5.1.2. Standards for Contingency Lodging Quarters. The policies are outlined in AFPAM 10-219,
   Volume V, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide, War Mobilization Plan (WMP) – 1 and AFH
   10-247 Force Beddown Handbook and Base Support Plan.
   A5.1.3. When operating in a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE)
   environment, the placement of personnel in fixed facilities (brick, wood, concrete, etc.) promotes
   force survivability far greater than the placement in soft (tent) shelters. Services personnel should
   work in conjunction with Civil Engineering Readiness personnel when prioritizing facilities for lodg-
   ing assignment. For further guidance on Counter-Chemical Warfare Concept of Operations (C-CW
   Conops) and operating in a CBRNE environment, reference current DoD and Air Force policies and
   directives.
   A5.1.4. Contingency Lodging quarters are defined as excess base facilities used to beddown person-
   nel deployed to and/or transiting a main operating base (MOB) or geographically separated unit
   (GSU) in support of an exercise or contingency operation. Permissive TDY personnel supporting offi-
   cially sanctioned events (i.e., sports teams, scouts, and JROTC groups) may be authorized to stay in

     contingency quarters at the discretion of the installation commander as long as APFs are used for all
     associated costs (i.e., cleaning, furnishings, repair, and maintenance, etc.).
     A5.1.5. When the installation commander authorizes minors (i.e., scouts, JROTC) to use the facility,
     they must be in a separate area from any active duty and adult occupants of the facility and be chaper-
     oned by an adult of at least 18 years of age or older. Personnel on routine, funded TDY orders, not
     associated with a contingency or wartime mission, are not authorized to stay in contingency quarters.
     In addition, personnel on leave or otherwise considered space-available in lodging are not authorized
     in contingency quarters. No fee will be charged to use contingency lodging quarters. Contingency
     lodging quarters offer more protection from the elements than a tent city and should be used to their
     maximum capacity before moving to a tent city.
     A5.1.6. Selection criteria and types of contingency lodging quarters. Selecting facilities to use for
     contingency lodging quarters is based on the following factors: Force Protection considerations,
     amount of available space in existing lodging facilities, the availability of unused existing facility
     space (i.e., dormitories, base housing, etc.), number of people deploying to the location, duration of
     time people will be bedded down, and the duration of the surge.
     A5.1.7. Types of facilities that can be used for contingency lodging quarters include, but are not lim-
     ited to: excess dormitory space, vacant lodging or dorm space designated for demolition, and excess
     base housing. For surges of short duration, facilities such as community centers and fitness centers can
     be used.
     A5.1.8. Contingency facilities will be managed by Base Civil Engineering Squadrons. Services per-
     sonnel will only manage contingency lodging quarters on a day-to-day basis when supporting an
     on-going exercise or contingency operation that cannot be accommodated in the existing lodging
     facility inventory. The MOB or GSU will be responsible for managing contingency lodging quarters
     if it’s within their capabilities as determined by the installation commander. Services Unit Type Code
     (UTC) support should only be requested when the operation is beyond the capability of the MOB or
     GSU. If UTC support is required, ensure adequate personnel are included in the Services UTCs desig-
     nated to deploy to the location.
     A5.1.9. Appropriated funds (APF) will be used for necessary purchases to support contingency lodg-
     ing quarter operations. Nonappropriated funds (NAF) are not authorized to support contingency lodg-
     ing quarters. When expending funds in support of contingency lodging quarters, use the appropriate
     emergency and special program (ESP) code for the exercise or contingency operation.
     A5.1.10. Reserve and ANG personnel called to active duty under the Presidential Reserve Call-up
     (PRC) in support of wartime emergencies are entitled to per diem as authorized in the Joint Federal
     Travel Regulation (JFTR). Under these conditions, activated ANG and Reserve personnel are active
     duty TDY members. General managers must consider the following when fulfilling their lodging
     requirements:
          A5.1.10.1. Give long-term TDY personnel highest consideration over short-term TDY require-
          ments for on-base lodging for the duration of the emergency. If possible, assign long-term TDY
          members to those facilities having the most "livable" amenities suitable for a lengthy stay. Con-
          sider availability of kitchen facilities, large refrigerators, private bath, etc.
          A5.1.10.2. During real-world contingency operations, all non-contingency personnel may be
          requested to vacate lodging to meet mission requirements. If necessary, move current guests off
          base and change future reservations as necessary to accommodate long-term TDY personnel on
          base.
