                                           Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction provides for training management of MC-130E/H/P aircrew
members. Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth for each phase of aircrew
training. Training is designed to progressively develop the combat readiness of each aircrew
member while maintaining previously acquired proficiency.
     1.1.1. Qualification Training (Chapter 2) qualifies aircrew members for basic, non-tactical
     aircrew duties.
     1.1.2. Mission Qualification Training (Chapter 3) qualifies aircrew members, in an assigned
     crew position for a specific aircraft, to perform the command, or their unit, mission.
     1.1.3. Continuation Training (Chapter 4) provides the capability for aircrew members to
     reinforce and build upon previous training and conduct Air Force Task List (AFTL), United
     States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Joint Mission Essential Task List
     (JMETL), and MAJCOM Mission Essential Task List (METL) based, combat-oriented
     aircrew training.
     1.1.4. Upgrade/Specialized Training (Chapter 5) upgrades copilots (CP) to aircraft
     commanders (AC) and all aircrew members to instructor and flight examiner status. It also
     identifies special mission qualifications and certifications.
1.2. Training Objective. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of mission readiness, facilitating immediate and effective employment
in exercises, contingencies, limited war, and general war operations, mitigating risk to loss of
airframe and aircrew as appropriate.
     1.2.1. The training program must train aircrew in the skills, knowledge, and attitudes
     required in accomplishing assigned missions. Regulatory/directive and authoritative sources
     of required information include, but are not limited to: AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules;
     MAJCOM guidance; MC-130 specific instructions (AFI 11-2MC-130, Vols 1, 2, 3); Federal
     Air Regulations (FARs); International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO); Standards and
     Recommended Practices (SARP); Flight Information Publications (FLIP); Foreign Clearance
     Guide (FCG); Notices to Airman (NOTAMs); Technical Orders (T.O.s); Air Traffic Control
     (ATC) instructions; and Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) volumes.
     The AFTTP 3-3. MC-130 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, provides the authoritative,
     standardized, and fundamental tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for tactical
     employment of the MC-130. This document is the primary source of combat aircraft
     fundamentals and Formal Training Unit (FTU) mission qualification courseware and
     instruction. The AFTTP 3-1. MC-130, Tactical Employment, provides classified and
     advanced, threat-driven TTPs.
     1.2.2. Air Force Special Operations Training Center (AFSOTC) and AFSOC, ARC and Air
     Education and Training Command (AETC), in coordination with USSOCOM, will establish
     and supervise an aircrew-training program consistent with the policies and requirements of
     this instruction.
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                              5


   1.2.3. The AFSOC/Air Combat Command (ACC) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
   outlines the inter-command relationships and responsibilities regarding operations at the
   Special Operation Force (SOF) Detachment of the USAF Weapons School (USAFWS).
   1.2.4. The AFSOC/AETC MOA outlines the inter-command relationships and
   responsibilities regarding MC-130 operations at the 58th Special Operations Wing (SOW).
   Informal discussion and coordination regarding formal training and evaluation matters
   between AFSOC and AETC training agencies is encouraged. Formal authorization for inter-
   command requests (e.g., waivers, operations guidance, training quotas, or syllabus
   requirements) must be forwarded through both MAJCOMs for coordination.
1.3. Responsibilities: AFSOC commander (CC) is responsible for overall management of Air
Force flying training programs supporting Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOF) and
USSOCOM. AFSOC is designated as the lead command for MC-130 Mission Design Series
(MDS) aircraft. AETC responsibilities are listed in the AFSOC/AETC MOA or as determined
by AETC.
   1.3.1. MAJCOMs will issue updated mission continuation training guidance via RTM as
   necessary to Operations Group (OG)/CC for implementation.
   1.3.2. AETC/A3RA, AETC/A3ZS, and AFSOC/A3TA are responsible for MC-130H
   training. AETC/A3RA, AETC/A3ZS, AFSOC/A3TA, and AFSOTC are responsible for
   MC-130P training. AFRC/A3TR, AFSOTC, and HQ AFSOC/A3TA are responsible for
   MC-130E training.
   1.3.3. FTU Responsibilities
      1.3.3.1. Conduct overall operation, logistics, and administration of MC-130 formal
      training courses.
      1.3.3.2. Conduct and monitor formal training to meet all course objectives and standards.
      This includes monitoring and adjusting syllabus content and quality as well as
      Programmed Flying Training (PFT) quantity to produce crewmembers qualified to
      perform the mission. The annual training review, syllabus review, and PFT conferences
      are the primary conduits for significant changes.
      1.3.3.3. Administer end-of-course critiques and field evaluation questionaires. Forward
      a summary of all critiques and questionaires to MAJCOM/A3Ts for review. Acquire
      feedback from MAJCOM/A3Ts to ensure formal school graduates meet unit
      requirements.
      1.3.3.4. Maintain a class roster of student entries and graduates for each formal course.
      Award AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, to graduates per Education and Training
      Course Announcements (ETCA). Maintain a record of certificates issued, to include
      graduate's name, rank, course completed, course number, dates of course entry and
      completion, and automated personnel data system (PDS) course code.
      1.3.3.5. Prepare, review, and forward all syllabi to AFSOC/A3T (AETC/A3Z for AETC
      FTUs) for coordination. Syllabi will contain a brief summary of revised, deleted, or
      added material and a resource impact statement (flying hours, manpower, facilities, etc.).
      1.3.3.6. Recommend required changes to the ETCA through channels to MAJCOM/A3T.
 6                                                   AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012


        1.3.3.7. Notify MAJCOM/A3T and gaining unit, in writing, when student graduation
        dates are extended 30 days past scheduled, or if students will graduate without
        completing all syllabus training requirements.
        1.3.3.8. Forward all training records to the student‘s gaining unit, or unit of assignment,
        within 30 days of graduation.
        1.3.3.9. Prepare quarterly report of student training status and forward through channels
        to HQ AFSOC/A3T (N/A for AETC units).
1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for MC-130 initial qualification,
requalification, or upgrade training is attendance at a formal school. USAF policy dictates the
use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical.
     1.4.1. Formal schools will not forward written examinations as part of the courseware for in-
     unit qualification training.
     1.4.2. Students previously disenrolled from a formal ETCA course for substandard
     performance are ineligible for a secondary method training waiver.
     1.4.3. AETC and AFSOTC are the primary sources for formal training products. When
     formal training products are unsuitable, units may use MAJCOM-developed products. When
     specific formal courseware is not published, units may use locally-developed training syllabi
     that have been reviewed and approved by MAJCOM/A3T.
1.5. Secondary Method Training (SMT). In-unit training using applicable formal school
courseware is referred to as SMT in this publication. SMT requires a waiver be submitted
through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by MAJCOM/A3T. See AFI 11-
202, Vol. 1, as supplemented, for guidance.
1.6. Waivers. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for MDS-specific, Vol. 1 aircrew training
requirements unless otherwise noted in this AFI. Some ground and ancillary training items (e.g.,
small arms training, etc.) are prescribed by other instructions. Reference the prescribing
instruction to determine the waiver authority in these cases.
     1.6.1. Group commanders are the waiver authority for individual, case-by-case flying hour
     requirements and for ground and flying training requirements as outlined below.
     1.6.2. OG/CC or equivalent (e.g., Combined Joint Special Operations Air Component
     (CJSOAC)/CC) may:
        1.6.2.1. When allowed per applicable RTM, extend ground training requirement due
        dates up to 2 months for certain noted training items. (Exception: Items referenced in
        paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG/CC unless
        specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI). When allowed per RTM, these events
        may count towards the next periodic requirements (units will note on waiver when events
        were accomplished and the ARMS due date will be updated).
        1.6.2.2. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency, or operational
        mission for events, IAW applicable RTM, on an individual basis only if a crewmember
        goes overdue while away from home station and the training is not available at the
        deployed location (Exception: Items referenced in para 1.6 levied by other AFIs may
        not be waived by the OG/CC unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).

   1.6.3. Squadron commanders may carry new crewmembers as Mission Ready (MR) for up
   to 6 months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not
   MR in all core mission events. Units completing formal training will include restrictions on
   AF Form 8/8A for a core item not trained, regardless if the method of qualification is by
   evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform events in
   which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This policy
   does not apply to basic aircraft qualification events. If training is not complete in 6 months,
   the aircrew member becomes mission unqualified (and non-mission ready (NMR)).
   Squadrons will have 6 months from the time a new core mission event is added, and
   MAJCOM guidance issued, to train and qualify aircrew in the new event.
1.7. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202, Vo1. 1, as supplemented.
1.8. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. The gaining organization
will honor validated training completed by newly assigned crewmembers prior to the transfer.
Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered qualified in that equipment
throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-
   401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
1.9. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA). CEA qualifications are not tied to AFI 36-2101,

Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that
crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of
skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct
from On-The-Job (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in Air Force Specialty
Code (AFSC) by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew flight examiner).
1.10. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send
recommendations to AFSOC/A3T through command channels, on an AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. AETC units will forward AF Form 847s through
Stan/Eval channels to AETC/A3V. USAF/A3/5 is the approval authority for changes or
revisions to this instruction. Because of the dynamic requirements for Combatant Commanders,
training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly. These training requirement and
currency adjustments may be made via RTM. AFSOC/A3 will be an info addressee on all
changes.
1.11. Deviations. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any
other Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction.
1.12. Publication Administration. This instruction is distributed to AFSOC, AFSOC-gained
units, and AFSOC-related schools based on requirements established through the Publications
Distribution Office (PDO). All aircrew members are authorized this instruction.
     1.12.1. Supplements. Major Commands (MAJCOMs)/Direct Reporting Units (DRUs)/Field
     Operating Agencies (FOAs) are to forward proposed MAJCOM/DRU/ FOA-level

                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification, requalification, and differences training. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or
MR status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the
appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. If no requalification
course exists, conduct requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When
attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct SMT
for mission qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as supplemented.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school syllabus
designates the course prerequisite waiver approval authority.
   3.3.1. Basic qualification and mission qualification training may be accomplished
   simultaneously on a single MDS. Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished simultaneously.
   3.3.2. For the minimum requirements to be trained as a mission AC, refer to para 5.2. If the
   requirements of the table are not met, train and evaluate the individual as a mission CP unless
   excepted below.
       3.3.2.1. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP), e.g., First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP),
       Operational Support Aircraft (OSA), etc., with at least 800 hours total flying time may,
       with AFSOC/A3 approval, be trained in the left seat and evaluated as a Mission Pilot
       (MP). PQP pilots trained as an MP with less than the required Table 5.1, C-130
       experience, will fly in-unit as an MC until they have the required Primary Mission
       Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) flight time. These pilots may maintain First Pilot (FP)
       qualification at the discretion of the squadron commander. Units will follow
       requalification procedures in Chapter 4 to requalify those pilots as MPs.
       3.3.2.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilots. MPD pilots will complete AFSOC
       mission qualification in the right seat.
   3.3.3. For FS and Medical Technician training requirements, refer to AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as
   supplemented.
   3.3.4. For Combat Camera Aerial Photographer training requirements, refer to DODI
   5040.04, Joint Combat Camera (COMCAM) Program.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all ground training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1,
and applicable RTMs as part of mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as
MR. Completion of training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in
Chapter 4. Credit any training accomplished at a formal school. MR crewmembers transferred

from other units require only unit-specific mission ready training events or events which are
due/overdue.
   3.4.1. Academic Training.     Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Crewmembers must complete a written examination IAW AFI
   11-2MC-130, Vol. 2. The formal school will not forward their examinations as part of the
   courseware for in-unit qualifications.
3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the requirements of this section. Formal course training will include all core mission
events applicable to the crewmember‘s aircraft and crew position (Tables A3.1 through A3.3.).
Approved in-unit qualification training must be accomplished IAW applicable formal school
courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the
   squadron Director of Operations (DO).
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete MQT requirements within the prescribed time period.
   3.5.3. Crewmember requirements may be completed on training or operational missions
   under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position.
3.6. MQT Differences Training.
   3.6.1. MQT Differences Training. Table 3.1 lists the only authorized forms of mission
   differences training. The primary method for accomplishing differences training is via in-
   unit using a MAJCOM-approved syllabus. All differences training will include mission
   open/closed book examinations and a flight evaluation per AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol. 2.
       3.6.1.1. Crewmembers qualified and current in special mission events may regain that
       qualification without additional training once they are BMC in their new aircraft.
   3.6.2. Crewmembers previously qualified as HC-130P instructors. Units may use the current
   AETC SOIs and courseware to conduct in-unit differences training to train and qualify HC-
   130P qualified instructors and evaluators in the MC-130P. Mission ready HC-130P crew
   members who are not instructors or evaluators will not be trained using the AETC-developed
   SOIs/courseware, as they are designed for instructor/evaluator differences training.

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter and the RTM are the minimum flying and related ground
   training to maintain currency and the assigned training status. Individual proficiency may
   require a greater number of events.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction and the MDS-specific RTM are met. Sorties and events that are compatible
   may be credited on the same flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on a successful evaluation or an instructor certification
   (in certain events) will be credited toward the individual‘s continuation training requirements
   in ARMS.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. For all events not required to be accomplished during the
   evaluation, log volume of zero in ARMS, but enter the checkride/certification date. Use
   actual dates for all ground training.
   4.1.6. ATD guidance.
       4.1.6.1. Formal training. Certification events trained to a 3C level (or equivalent) in an
       approved ATD will use the course completion date (successful evaluation date) as the
       initial accomplishment date.
       4.1.6.2. Aircraft flying requirements, to include updating currency or obtaining
       recurrency, may be accomplished in a certified ATD for events designated in the MDS-
       specific RTM.
       4.1.6.3. Simulator Crew Complement. In order to log events in a Weapons System
       Trainer (WST), simulator crews will be consistent with the the standard front end crew
       complement needed to fly an aircraft, to include an aircraft commander for the type of
       mission being flown.
4.2. Training Levels (TL). The use of experienced-based Flying Training Levels (FTLs) and
Ground Training Levels (GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.
Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1, and Table
4.1, before assignment to the respective training level. (Exception: Air Reserve Component
(ARC) squadron commanders may assign TLs to individuals not meeting these minimum
requirements with MAJCOM/A3T approval). When these minima are met, awarding a training
level is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander. NOTE: The aircrew member‘s
availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning FTLs.

   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time. For
   basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include flight time and simulator time for any variant
   of C-130. For mission qualification FTL, MC-130 PAA time may include HC-130P/N, MC-
   130E/H/P aircraft flight time, and MC-130E/H/P simulator time. Total hours may include all
   simulator time.
        4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
        4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.

   4.2.2. Crewmembers may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications
   and individual events. Example: An aircraft commander coming from EC-130s might be
   assigned basic FTL ―A,‖ mission FTL ―C,‖ with a caveat of FTL ―A‖ for AAR.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
   4.2.4. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
        4.2.4.1. GTL ―1‖ – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
        4.2.4.2. GTL ―2‖ – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1.
4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew
member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not
perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events as outlined in the MDS-specific RTM
   results in a loss of currency for that event. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event
   currency expires.
        4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any event as noted in the MDS-specific RTM results in
        supervised status until recurrent. (Exceptions: FPs that lose left seat landing currency
        may fly in the right seat without an instructor).
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                             15


      4.4.1.2. Crewmembers who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and an
      AFSOC ‗slick‘ C-130 variant may satisfy currency requirements in either their primary
      aircraft or the C-130. If basic semiannual currency is lost (failure to complete the
      requirements of MDS-specific RTM), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost basic semiannual
      currency may be regained in either aircraft. Crewmembers must complete at least one
      aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 semiannually. Failure to complete at least one
      aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency in the C-130 only and
      currency must be regained in the C-130.
      4.4.1.3. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. Non-currency in designated BAQ events
      (Table 4.2, Note 1 events) in excess of 6 months results in loss of BAQ. Non-currency in
      designated mission events IAW applicable RTM in excess of 6 months results in loss of
      mission qualification status.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
      4.4.2.1. Only Table 4.2, and certain events as noted in applicable RTMs, require an
      evaluation if loss of currency exceeds 6 months IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1. Other events
      require showing proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or ATD (per MDS-specific
      RTM) IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, to regain currency. If loss of currency exceeds 24
      months in non-Note 1 events, a training folder will be opened and additional ground and
      flight training, as directed by the squadron commander, will be completed. See MDS-
      specific RTM for Cross Crew Position Instruction.
      4.4.2.2. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
      certification (Table 5.4) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
      instructor.
      4.4.2.3. Aircrew non-current more than 24 months in special mission events requiring an
      evaluation per RTM will complete all initial training and evaluation requirements for that
      special mission.
   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, Chapter 2, Chapter
   3, and Chapter 5 of this instruction, and the applicable RTM.
4.5. Ground Training Guidelines. AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and applicable RTMs, designate
ground training requirements for all aircrew members. Crewmembers will complete training
within the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL IAW the referenced publications and the
guidance below.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. Accomplish make-up training at the
   earliest opportunity. The following apply when crewmembers exceed due dates for
   applicable RTM events:
      4.5.1.1. Grounding items.      Crewmembers will not perform flight duties until the
      grounding item is satisfied.
      4.5.1.2. Training status items. Crewmembers will not fly without instructor supervision.
      4.5.1.3. MR items. Failure to accomplish MR events in applicable RTM results in non-
      mission ready status. The individual will not deploy as a crewmember.
16                                                AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012


  4.5.2. Block Training (AFSOC only). Each group operations training office should establish
  and administer a centralized aircrew block training session. Block training should include all
  recurring ground training required to maintain readiness.
  4.5.3. System Refresher. Navigators, Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs), Flight Engineers
  (FEs), Airborne Mission System Specialist (AMSS), and Loadmasters (LM) will attend
  periodic system refresher courses. MC-130E/H Pilots will attend a periodic radar refresher
  course. System refresher instruction can be provided by an Aircrew Training System (ATS)
  contractor or position-specific aircrew instructor using MDS-specific SOI and formal school
  courseware. Satisfactory completion of a formal school initial or requalification course will
  satisfy the refresher course requirement. Conduct the training at a formal school if possible.
  ARC units may conduct in-unit refresher classes for those crew members unable to attend the
  formal course.        Individual cases requiring exception will be coordinated with
  MAJCOM/A3TA (AFRC/A3T for AFRC units).
     4.5.3.1. Navigator Refresher. The navigator refresher course is designed to improve
     standardization and to provide maximum training to improve and refine navigator job
     skills. A simulator may be used if available. Students will not be evaluated during the
     Navigator Refresher Course.
     4.5.3.2. EWO Refresher.        The EWO refresher course is designed to improve
     standardization, provide a review of equipment capabilities and procedures, provide a
     review and update on threat systems, and provide training in threat identification. Units
     will develop courseware in coordination with group intelligence and may add or delete
     items as applicable to their assigned aircraft and mission. A simulator may be used if
     available. Students will not be evaluated during the EWO Refresher Course.
     4.5.3.3. FE Refresher. The FE system refresher course is designed to improve
     standardization and to provide maximum training on normal procedures, emergency
     procedures, and hostile environment repair. It consists of in-depth systems coverage and
     emergency procedures for each system. FEs will complete a ground training course in a
     6 month period that begins 5 months after the month in which simulator refresher is
     accomplished. Once a phase period is established for system refresher, it will be
     complied with even if the FE returns to the simulator in the meantime. Students will not
     be evaluated during refresher training.
     4.5.3.4. AMSS Refresher. The AMSS refresher course is designed to improve
     standardization and to refine the AMSS‘ job skills. Students will not be evaluated during
     refresher training.
     4.5.3.5. Loadmaster Refresher. The LM refresher course is designed to improve
     standardization and provide maximum training on LM duties and responsibilities.
     Schedule an aircraft or ATD for applicable portions of this course. Dual qualified and
     multi-aircraft qualified loadmasters will attend one loadmaster refresher course. These
     courses should be alternated per aircraft qualifications. Simulator is not required for
     loadmasters
     4.5.3.6. Radar Refresher Course (MC-130E/H). All MC-130E/H Pilots, Navigators, and
     MC-130H EWOs will attend a terrain following radar refresher course. This training is
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                                17


       conducted during pilot simulator refresher course and navigator/EWO refresher course
       for MC-130H crewmembers.
   4.5.4. Simulator Refresher Course. The periodic simulator refresher course is designed to
   improve standardization and to provide maximum training on normal, instrument, and
   emergency procedures. The primary purpose for simulator refresher training is to
   accomplish events that are unable to be accomplished or potentially unsafe in the aircraft.
   These events should be accomplished in both qualification and tactical scenarios. Units or
   crewmembers who desire to practice specific events will identify those requirements on the
   first day of training. Satisfactory completion of formal school basic aircraft qualification,
   requalification, or aircraft commander course, which includes instruction in a C-130-type
   simulator, as well as the instructor upgrade course, satisfies the simulator refresher course
   requirement.
       4.5.4.1. The recommended minimum crew size for this course is an aircraft commander,
       copilot, and flight engineer. If units are unable to provide the minimum crew size, they
       will ensure that the ATS contractor is able to support less than the minimum crew,
       otherwise, the ATS contractor is not required to provide the training.
       4.5.4.2. Instructors may credit simulator refresher when they instruct a full simulator
       refresher course (ARC-only: ATS contractors who are also qualified crewmembers may
       credit simulator refresher when teaching the course in a civilian capacity).
       4.5.4.3. Simulator refresher training is not required for aircrew members who will not be
       flying the same type or similar aircraft beyond 4 months after their due date.
       4.5.4.4. When AFSOC WSTs are not available for training, HQ AFSOC/A3TA will
       acquire C-130E/H simulator refresher courses at various locations to serve as alternate
       training for this requirement.
   4.5.5. Visual Threat Recognition and Avoidance Trainer (VTRAT) Training. Periodic
   VTRAT training is designed to introduce or refresh crewmembers in the basics of aircraft
   threat engagement recognition and avoidance. The VTRAT simulation displays realistic
   visual characteristics of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) such as missile fly-out and AAA rate-of-
   fire, as seen from the scanner‘s viewpoint in the aircraft. Training will include:
       4.5.5.1. Group/individual academics on threat recognition, calls and avoidance
       maneuvers IAW AFTTP 3-1.MC-130 and AFTTP 3-3.MC-130.
       4.5.5.2. Following academics, individuals will receive ~30 minutes of individual
       simulator time on the VTRAT.
4.6. Ancillary Training. Ancillary training is any guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series.
Some ancillary training does not impact mission ready status or mobility status. AFI 11-2MC-
130, Vol. 1, is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.
Individuals are responsible for completing additional ancillary ground training requirements as
specified in applicable instructions. In accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, the source AFI
provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See
Unit Deployment Manager to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training
requirements.

4.7. Flying Training.
    4.7.1. All aircrew members who maintain BAQ, BMC, or MR status must accomplish all
    applicable training requirements of Table 4.2 and the MDS-specific RTM, based on assigned
    FTL (A, B, or C). BMC and MR aircrew will also comply with the following:
        4.7.1.1. MR aircrew members will also accomplish applicable mission ready
        requirements as designated in the MDS-specific RTM according to their mission
        qualification and FTL.
        4.7.1.2. BMC aircrew members will also accomplish at least 50 percent of the applicable
        mission requirements as designated in the MDS-specific RTM according to their assigned
        FTL.
        4.7.1.3. BAQ ACs maintaining MR CP status will maintain left seat aircraft currency
        IAW the BAQ table of the MDS-specific RTM, and right seat mission currency IAW the
        MDS-specific RTM.
        4.7.1.4. MP qualified PQPs awaiting AC certification may complete BAQ events in
        either seat. Emphasis should be on left seat flying. Local Proficiency Sorties should be
        flown in the left seat. PQPs may fly in the left seat for airland missions when an AC who
        has a minimum of 100 hours since certification occupies the right seat (Exception: No
        Max Efforts). Mission events may be completed while performing CP duties in the right
        seat or in the left seat when an AC with 100 hours since certification occupies the right
        seat. AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol. 3, further defines takeoff and landing policy. Prior to AC
        certification, PQPs will only accomplish left seat max effort takeoffs and landings when
        under direct instructor supervision. PQPs may perform right seat ―pilot monitoring‖
        duties during max effort operations with an AC.
        4.7.1.5. MPD pilots may maintain left seat qualification at the discretion of the squadron
        commander.
        4.7.1.6. Instructors and flight examiners may not log events performed by other
        crewmembers during instruction or evaluations. Exception: AETC: With squadron
        commander approval, formal school instructors may log 50% of volume requirements
        and update currency with events accomplished by students under their direct supervision.

 1. Only these events require an evaluation if loss of currency exceeds 6 months per
 AFI 11-202, Vol. 1.
 2. Failure to accomplish event, within specified time, results in loss of basic aircraft currency.
 3. Failure to accomplish event, within specified time, results in loss of mission currency.
 4. Noncurrency in this event results in loss of currency in this sub area.
 5. Noncurrency in this events results in loss of currency in only that event
 6. MC-130H EWOs only. MC-130E EWOs do not have this currency requirement.
 4.8. Basic Aircraft Qualification Events. The following event definitions apply to Table 4.2
 and to the BAQ events table Semiannual BAQ Flying Training Requirements, in the MDS-
 specific RTMs. Not all definitions apply to all MDSs; refer to MDS-specific RTM for specific
 MDS requirements. Failure to accomplish currency or volume requirements results in loss of
 basic aircraft currency. Exception: Does not apply to C-130E/H if it is not the crewmember‘s
 primary MDS. Flight Surgeons will log currency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 requirements.
     4.8.1. Aircrew Proficiency Sortie (APS) [ST14]. An APS may be logged for an individual
     who is flying in a primary crew position and meets the following position-specific criteria:
         4.8.1.1. Pilots must accomplish at least three of the events listed in Table 4.2 or in the
         MDS-specific RTM to log an aircrew proficiency sortie. Pilots may log more than one
         APS on multi leg missions if at least three events were accomplished on each leg/APS to
         include a full stop landing.
         4.8.1.2. Navigators may log an aircrew proficiency sortie when they monitor a departure
         and approach. Minimum flying time is 30 minutes. If more than one qualified navigator
         is on a flight, each may obtain sortie credit on the same flight provided each one occupies
         a navigator position and performs navigator duties.
         4.8.1.3. Other aircrew members may credit a sortie when they perform appropriate
         preflight, in-flight, and post-flight duties in their primary crew position. Other
         crewmembers may also credit same day sorties not requiring preflight/post-flight duties
         (credit multiple sorties on multi-leg missions with full stop landings).
         4.8.1.4. Multiple aircraft qualified crewmembers may credit basic proficiency and/or
         mission sorties on any aircraft in which they maintain qualification. Events which can be
         credited are based on qualification held in each MDS.
     4.8.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [ST15]. All Pilots - A training mission including at
     least 1 hour of primary and/or instructor time practicing instrument, transition, and
20                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012


  emergency procedures. Fly maneuvers under the supervision of an instructor pilot (IP) and
  repeat them until an acceptable level of proficiency is attained, or the LPS may not be
  credited. If the LPS is incomplete, the instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or
  just the incomplete events must be re-accomplished. Instructors and flight examiners need
  not complete all LPS events on a single sortie. Credit an LPS when all events are complete.
  IPs and evaluator pilots (EPs) are not required to fly with another IP to credit this event.
  When conditions permit, the following should be practiced by FP/ACs and demonstrated to
  CPs: simulated two engine out landings, windmill taxi starts, and simulated three engine
  takeoffs. MPD pilots maintaining left seat currency will conduct LPS from the left seat and
  should include start/taxi/takeoff. Squadron commanders may add to the following minimum
  LPS sortie criteria:
     4.8.2.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures.
     4.8.2.2. Two instrument approaches (one precision, one non-precision).
     4.8.2.3. A holding pattern or procedure turn.
     4.8.2.4. A circling approach (traffic permitting).
     4.8.2.5. A simulated engine out landing.
     4.8.2.6. A simulated engine out go around.
     4.8.2.7. A Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern (weather permitting).
     4.8.2.8. 100 percent, 50 percent, and no flap landings (FP/AC/IP).
  4.8.3. Emergency Procedure Event (EPE) [ST94]. The purpose of this training is to improve
  crew competence during aircraft emergencies. The AC or designated representative will
  facilitate the discussion. This designated representative should be an instructor in their
  respective crew position. Conduct this training with the entire crew present (or a thorough
  cross section of crewmembers) in an ATD, classroom, or in flight. All crewmembers will
  participate by providing inputs/feedback. ACs should fully discuss onset indications,
  boldface items if applicable, and in-flight/landing or ditching/ground egress procedures.
  Upon completion of this discussion, crewmembers should understand the nature of the
  emergency and how the emergency procedure applies to their crew position. Only one
  emergency procedure is required to log this event.
  4.8.4. Pilot   Proficiency    Events  [AP10/AP12/AP20/AP21/AP30/AP35/AP40/AP60/
  D00/LD05/ LD60/TO00/TO05]. Accomplish events IAW AFMAN 11-217, Vol. 1,
  Instrument Flight Procedures. See MDS-specific RTM for event dual log information.
     4.8.4.1. Holding Patterns [AP35]. Fly an entry into a holding pattern and at least one
     complete circuit to log this event.
     4.8.4.2. Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Approach [AP60]. If an NDB approach is not
     available due to geographic or equipment limitations, a Very High Frequency Omni-
     directional Range Navigation System (VOR) approach utilizing only a bearing pointer or
     only a Bearing Directional Heading Indicator (BDHI) for lateral navigation may be
     substituted for this requirement.
     4.8.4.3. Backup Instrument Approach [AP12] (MC-130H only). Perform an approach
     using the backup instruments. May dual log with Precision or Non-Precision approach.

       4.8.4.4. Left Seat Landing [LD60]. MPD pilots who maintain left seat currency, at the
       discretion of the squadron commander, will accomplish six landings from the left seat
       each semiannual period.
4.9. Multiple Qualifications. Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation
Program, MAJCOM supplements, and AFI 11-2MDS-specific, Vol. 2s for crew positions and
evaluation requirements. Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 concerning approval authority for multiple
qualifications. Multiple qualified crewmembers will have one aircraft designated as their
primary aircraft. Other aircraft will be considered secondary aircraft. All AFSOC C-130
crewmembers are authorized multiple qualification in their primary mission aircraft (i.e., MC-
130, AC-130) and a ―slick‖ C-130 variant (includes C-130E/H and EC-130E/H) for BAQ.
Multiple aircraft qualified crewmembers may credit basic proficiency and/or mission sorties on
any aircraft in which qualification and currency is maintained. Events which can be credited are
based on qualification held in each MDS.
   4.9.1. Multiple qualified aircrew members must complete 100 percent of the requirements of
   Table 4.2 and the MDS-specific RTM. Multiple qualified crewmembers may complete
   Table 4.2 and the MDS-specific RTM requirements in either aircraft, but must maintain
   aircrew proficiency sortie currency in each aircraft. The basic qualification FTL assigned to
   an individual should be the highest experience level (fewest requirements) of any aircraft in
   which they maintain qualification. For example, a crewmember qualified as mission FTL A
   in the MC-130P and mission FTL B in the MC-130E should have an FTL A basic
   qualification profile.
   4.9.2. Multiple qualified crewmembers who maintain MR or Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
   status in more than one AFSOC C/MC-130 aircraft must complete the semiannual mission
   ready flying requirements in Table 4.2 and the MDS-specific RTM. Multiple qualified
   crewmembers may accomplish mission events in either aircraft, but will fly at least one
   Combat Mission Profile (CMP) quarterly in each aircraft in which they are mission ready.
   When the training table for the secondary aircraft contains core mission events not required
   in the primary aircraft, crewmembers will complete required volume and currency for those
   events in their secondary aircraft. If mission flying currency is lost for the primary aircraft, it
   is lost for all aircraft and must be regained in the designated primary aircraft. If mission
   currency is lost in a secondary aircraft, it is lost only for that aircraft.
       4.9.2.1. MC-130 MR crewmembers who maintain BAQ in a C-130 variant may
       accomplish requirements listed in the MDS-specific RTM as allowed in the RTM and
       this publication‘s Table 4.4. AMSS may log events approved by the aircraft commander.

                           UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter identifies the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized
flight events.
5.2. Aircraft Commander Upgrade. Commanders will consider experience, knowledge, and
judgment when identifying candidates. Nominees must have an in-depth knowledge of systems,
procedures, and instructions prior to entry into the upgrade program. The upgrade program is
designed to teach AC duties and responsibilities, as well as left seat mission qualification.
   5.2.1. Commanders may select MR CPs to be trained/certified as BAQ-only ACs. The
   individual will maintain CMR status as a CP until completion/certification as a mission AC.
   5.2.2. AC Upgrade Prerequisites. The prerequisite flying time levels for upgrade in Table
   5.1 are based on pilots having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively
   accomplish the unit‘s mission. Flying experience should include left seat time prior to
   entering formal school upgrade training. AC candidates will also meet all prerequisites listed
   in the ETCA and the formal school syllabus.

Table 5.1. Minimum Hours Required to Upgrade to Aircraft Commander.
          TOTAL PILOT HOURS                                 PMAI HOURS (note 2)
              Over 1,900                                           200
              1,600-1,899                                          300
                 1,300-1,599                                           400
                 1,000-1,299                                           800
Notes:
1. All pilots with prior rotary wing time will be trained as copilots unless they have a minimum
of 500 hours of fixed-wing time (including Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) flying time).
2. For the purpose of this table, PMAI hours includes any type of C-130 aircraft (except J
models). Include all simulator hours toward the total pilot hours requirement and all MC-
130E/H/P (as applicable) WST time toward the PMAI hours requirement. Subtract ―Other‖
flight time in excess of 100 hours from total hours. Subtract all ―Other‖ time from the required
PMAI time.
   5.2.3. The primary method of AC upgrade is satisfactory completion of the MAJCOM-
   approved formal school course. ARC units may accomplish in-unit upgrade training without
   a waiver for students that have not been previously disenrolled from a formal ETCA course
   for substandard performance.
   5.2.4. PQPs. Cross flow pilots may be trained in the left seat at the formal school and may
   be MP qualified. They may be certified as ACs once they meet the hour requirements of
   Table 5.1.

Terms
Air-to-Air Refueling—For the purposes of this instruction, airborne fuel onload (simulated or
actual) by MC-130 receiver aircraft.
Ancillary Training—Universal training, guidance, or instruction, regardless of Air Force
Specialty Code (AFSC), that contributes to mission accomplishment. It does not include
functional, occupational, or additional duty training. Ancillary Training is divided into the
following four categories: Annual Total Force Awareness Training (TFAT), Selected Force
Training, Event Driven Training, and Expeditionary Skills Training (EST). See AFI 36-2201V1.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit to assist in maintaining
readiness. Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for
the unit.
Basic Aircraft Qualification Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft currency
IAW this instruction. The aircrew member, when current, may perform the events in table 4.2.
Basic Mission Capable Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining 50 percent of the applicable mission
qualification currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable crewmembers
may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the
squadron commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crewmember
to perform primary crew duties.
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                               35


Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on
1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the
command or unit combat mission.
Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs
will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use
of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Core Mission Events—A crewmember must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC). To determine how non-
currency in any core mission event affects overall mission currency, refer to the aircraft‘s
mission ready flying requirements. Loss of qualification in any core mission event results in loss
of overall mission qualification. A core mission event will be considered an instructor certified
event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission Evaluation. Squadrons will
maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR. AFSOC squadron CC/DO will
determine the status/qualification of crewmembers in excess of 100 percent manning
requirement.
Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Dual Qualified—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one crew position in the same
MDS.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.
Expeditionary Skills Training (EST)—A category of Ancillary Training. Training directly
related to an Airman‗s ability to survive and operate in a contingency environment. Examples of
EST include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN), and Self-Aid/Buddy Care.
A current list of predeployment training is available at AEF Online,
https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/mandatory_exped_trning.aspx.
Formal School Courseware—Training materials and programs developed for training crew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and applicable training forms related to the specific course.
Training courses listed in ETCA. Formal courses may be conducted using the secondary method
(in-unit) of training IAW the provisions of this instruction
Formation Operations—Accomplish IAW applicable volume(s) of AFTTP, AFI 11-2MC-130,
Vol. 3, and ATP-56 (B). AFSOC guidance will never be less restrictive than the formation
definitions found in AFI 11-202, Vol. 3, ―Formation Flight,‖ ―Nonstandard Formation,‖ and
―Standard Formation.‖ Formation operations place all aircraft in a critical phase of flight which
requires constant vigilance, strict discipline, and polished crew coordination for mission
 36                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012


accomplishment. Training will ensure aircrew can think and plan for multiple aircraft instead of
single ship operations.
Instructor Certified Events—Training given to an aircrew member that requires an instructor
to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified
in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111. Instructor certified events are documented in
AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM-approved substitute).
Mission Design Series—The official designation for aerospace vehicles used to represent a
specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and documentation purposes.
Mission Essential Task List—Combat-oriented training requirements. All AFSOC aircrew
training requirements should be in support of unit METLs.
Mission Events—The unit Defined Operational Capability (DOC) Statement defines required
crew capabilities. These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special
Mission.
Mission Oriented Simulator Training—Training conducted in a WST that incorporates a full
mission profile. The focus of this training should be crew coordination and problem solving.
Mission Ready Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
mission qualification and is maintaining all of the applicable mission qualification currency
requirements of this instruction.
Multiple Qualification—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one MDS.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory—Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of its
wartime mission. PMAI forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours.
Requalification Training (RQT)—Training required to qualify crewmembers in an aircraft or
mission in which they have been previously qualified.
Secondary Method Training—Formal training conducted at a location not designated as an
FTU using SOI and courseware.
Self-Contained Approach—An approach conducted using self-contained navigation systems on
the aircraft.
Special Mission Events—Mission events not designated as a ―core event.‖ Some MR/MC
crewmembers will carry additional qualifications in special mission events. Squadron CC/DO
will determine which crewmembers will be qualified in these special mission events. Squadron
CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C-rating and report variations
through Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS).
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Status—A deficient status in which a crewmember must fly under the supervision of
an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
crewmember is removed from training status.
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                               37


Transition Course—Normally, a shortened version of initial qualification training that gives
aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft credit for acquired aviation
proficiency.
Upgrade Training—Training to qualify/certify a crewmember in a higher crew qualification
(i.e., mission pilot or instructor upgrade).
Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew
member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
Weapon System Trainer (WST)—Device that provides synthetic flight and tactics
environment, in which aircrews learn, develop, improve, and integrate skills associated with their
crew position. In this instruction, WST and simulator are synonymous.

                                         Attachment 2
        CHEMICAL DEFENSE TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING (CDTQT)

A2.1. General. This attachment contains the initial and recurring aircraft CDTQT requirements
for AFSOC aircrews. The purpose of CDTQT is to reinforce the crewmember's awareness of
limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while wearing the aircrew chemical defense
ensemble (ACDE). The complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited
dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during CDTQT. All aircrew
members must complete initial aircrew chemical defense training prior to accomplishing initial
CDTQT. Complete Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense
Awareness and CBRN Defense Survival Skills training prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble
is used. Initial CDTQT should be done in the aircraft and also reaccomplished in the aircraft
every 4 years. If initial CDTQT is done in the simulator, the next event must be logged in the
aircraft. All other times the event may be accomplished in the simulator. Accomplishing the
event in the aircraft dual logs normal CDTQT.
A2.2. CDTQT Procedures.
   A2.2.1. Accomplish CDTQT inflight using the primary unit aircraft. Crew members will
   perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE. All inflight profiles must be a
   minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only. Accomplish CDTQT in the
   simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs. All simulator profiles must be a minimum of 2
   hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles. This should include a threat scenario and
   aircraft emergencies. Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew wearing ACDE is
   highly encouraged.
   A2.2.2. The entire ACDE need not be used. Normally, wear the blower assembly unit, inter-
   communications box, cotton gloves, butyl rubber gloves, nomex gloves, and Aircrew Eye
   and Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) mask hood, and helmet (if applicable). Either
   the ACDE or ground ensemble may be worn during aircraft preflight. Ground ensembles
   will come from training assets.
   A2.2.3. When wearing the Chemical Protective Overgarment (CPO) mask, do not
   accomplish CDTQT when required to wear Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). When wearing
   AERPS, NVG events will be accomplished.
   A2.2.4. An observer is required to monitor each crew member while accomplishing CDTQT
   inflight. An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not wearing the
   chemical defense components, will act as the observer for initial CDTQT. Exception: An IP
   not wearing the ensemble and not performing any other instructor duties may act as the
   observer for initial FE training. During recurring CDTQT, if the crew member can be
   directly observed by another primary crew member, a dedicated observer is not required.
   The dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also wear AERPS for all crew
   positions except pilots (two non-pilot crewmembers wearing AERPS may observe one
   another). Additionally, for safety purposes, one crewmember in the back of the aircraft must
   not be wearing AERPS in case of smoke and fumes. For any airdrop mission, a fully
   qualified loadmaster must not be wearing AERPS in case of an airdrop malfunction.
   Example: during an MC-130E flight with a full mission crew complement, all crewmembers,
   with the exception of one mission pilot occupying a pilot seat and one crewmember in the
AFI11-2MC-130V1 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                          39


   back, may wear AERPS if all of these crewmembers have previously completed initial
   CDTQT. If this is an airdrop mission, the crewmember in the back must be a loadmaster.
   Dedicated observers not wearing AERPS for non-pilot crewmembers are not required in this
   case.
       A2.2.4.1. An instructor or flight examiner pilot not wearing the chemical defense
       components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT. During recurring
       CDTQT, a mission ready pilot not wearing the chemical defense components will act as
       the observer and occupy the opposite seat. With squadron commander approval, both
       pilots may wear AERPS while occupying the pilot seats provided both pilots have
       accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days. The squadron commander may delegate
       this authority to the squadron DO or mission commander.
       A2.2.4.2. Observers will closely monitor crewmembers actions during CDTQT. If a
       crew member experiences difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, headaches,
       hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the crew member will remove the ensemble. The observer
       will notify the PIC of any difficulties encountered.
A2.3. Mission Profile. Aircrew members will accomplish a profile that includes terrain
following (if equipped) or NVG low level and either an airland, airdrop, or HAAR/TAAR event.
Do not credit simulated events. In addition:
   A2.3.1. Pilots will accomplish a minimum of one approach and landing.          Pilots may
   accomplish CDTQT in either seat.
   A2.3.2. FEs will accomplish inflight duties including running any checklists accomplished
   from before starting engines through after landing.
   A2.3.3. All other crew members will credit CDTQT while performing their normal crew
   duties during the specified events.
