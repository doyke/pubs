AFI 90-301 formalizes Air Force commitment to prevent and eliminate FW&A. Air Force military and civilian members
have a duty to report FW&A, mismanagement, a violation of any Air Force instruction, an injustice, deficiency, or like
condition, to a superior or commander in their chain of command, to an Inspector General (IG) or other appropriate
inspector, or within any established grievance channel. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse complaints may be reported to the AF
Audit Agency, AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Security Forces, or other proper authority. Promptly advise
the AFOSI of suspected criminal misconduct or fraud.

Complaints should attempt to resolve FW&A issues and complaints at the lowest possible level using command channels
before elevating them to the next higher level or to the IG. However, complainants may file an IG complaint at any level
without notifying or following the chain of command. Complainants may submit FW&A disclosures on an AF Form 102,
by letter, in person, or by FW&A hotlines. All complainants have the right to file a protected disclosure.
